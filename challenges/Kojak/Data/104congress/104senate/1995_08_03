Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1026, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1996 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is recognized to offer an amendment on which \nthere shall be 90 minutes for debate equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from North \nDakota? The Senator from Nebraska has been attempting to make an \nopening statement with regard to the measure before us. I am wondering, \nafter the Senator from North Dakota has made the presentation under the \nunanimous-consent agreement, if both sides would agree to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska having 10 minutes for an opening statement on the overall \nmeasure without being charged to the time under the control by the \nmajority or the minority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond to the Senator from \nNebraska, I have no objection. But my understanding is that the 9 to \n10:30 time period for this amendment would result in a vote at 10:30, \nand there are some leadership obligations that require that vote to \noccur at 10:30, and by unanimous consent we have limited debate to an \nhour and a half, 45 minutes to each side, on the amendment.\n  It might be the case that the Senator should give an opening \npresentation immediately after the vote at 10:30.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator. That does not happen to agree with the \nschedule of the Senator from Nebraska. But I will try again.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I might say that I have no objection. But \nmy understanding is that the 10:30 vote must occur at 10:30 because of \nsome leadership obligations by previous agreement.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Robert \nRussell, a fellow on detail from the Department of Energy, be allowed \nfloor privileges during the debate of S. 1026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2087\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the amount authorized to be appropriated under \n                 Title II for national missile defense)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Bradley, Mr. Leahy, \n\n[[Page S 11228]]\n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2087.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 32, strike out line 14 and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following` ``$9,233,148,000, of which--\n       ``(A) not more than $357,900,000 is authorized to implement \n     the national missile defense policy established in section \n     233(2);''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have by unanimous consent a time \nagreement on this amendment, I understand 45 minutes to each side. I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, let me begin to describe this amendment. It is \npainfully simple. There was $300 million added to the defense \nauthorization bill by the Armed Services Committee for something that \nthis country does not need and that the Secretary of Defense says he \ndoes not want. The proposal that I lay before the Senate is to take the \n$300 million back out.\n  This, it seems to me, is a very symbolic issue. The $300 million is \nto build a national missile defense system with instructions it be done \non a priority or accelerated basis so that the deployment begins in \n1999. Some said yesterday, well, this has nothing to do with star wars. \nAnd, of course, that is not true at all. This is, in fact, national \nmissile defense, which includes a star wars component. It is the \nbuilding of missiles in order to create some sort of astrodome over our \ncountry to block incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  It is the revival of a proposal offered in the early 1980's by then \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Of course, times were different then. The \nSoviet Union existed. We had a cold war that was in full force. We had \nan active adversary and a real threat. Times have changed. Now we have \nthe dismantling and destruction of intercontinental ballistic missiles \nin Russia. And, paradoxically, we are helping pay the bill to destroy \nthose missiles.\n  It is an irony that does not escape me this morning that the same \npeople who proposed $300 million in additional spending this year as \npart of what will eventually be a $48 billion new project are also \nsaying they want to cut back on our contribution to help the Soviets \ndismantle and destroy their intercontinental ballistic missiles. If \never there is a disconnection, it seems to me it is in that logic.\n  To call this $300 million--or what eventually will be a $40 billion \nprogram--``pork'' is I think unfair to pigs. Hogs carry around a little \nmeat. This in my judgment is pure, unadulterated lard.\n  I want to describe this proposal in the context of what the Secretary \nof Defense has said. I am reading from a letter from the Secretary to \nSenator Nunn:\n\n       This bill will direct the development for deployment by \n     2003 [incidentally, the early deployment by 1999] of a \n     multiple site system for national missile defense that, if \n     deployed, would be a clear violation of the ABM Treaty. The \n     bill would severely strain U.S.-Russian relations and would \n     threaten continued Russian implementation of the START I \n     Treaty and further Russian consideration of the START II \n     Treaty. These two treaties will eliminate strategic launchers \n     carrying two-thirds of the nuclear warheads that confronted \n     the Nation during the cold war.\n\n  That is a statement of current administration policy.\n\n       S. 1026 would authorize appropriations for defense programs \n     that exceed by approximately $7 billion the administration's \n     FY 1996 request.\n\n  A $7 billion increase, this from folks who say they are opposed to \nthe Federal deficit.\n  Here is what the committee says:\n\n       The committee recognizes that deploying a multiple site NMD \n     system by 2003 will require significant investments in the \n     outyears.\n\n  And, incidentally, the Congressional Budget Office says anywhere from \n$30 to $40 billion. But the committee avoids the issue. The committee:\n\n       . . . directs the Secretary of Defense to budget \n     accordingly.\n\n  This is very interesting. The Armed Services Committee says we are \ngoing to build this. Here is $300 million you do not want to build \nsomething we do not need, and it is going to cost $48 billion, and we \nsay to you, Mr. Secretary of Defense, ``budget accordingly.''\n  It does not say where he should get the money. It does not say they \nare going to raise taxes to pay for it. It says to the Secretary of \nDefense, budget accordingly.\n  Well, we all understand what that means. That means that the warriors \nwho fight so hard rhetorically to reduce the Federal budget deficit are \nnow wallflowers who decide they want to use the taxpayers' credit card \nto go out and purchase a $48 billion national ballistic missile program \nthat this country does not need and cannot afford.\n  It seems to me we ought to ask two questions about these kinds of \nproposals when they come to us. One is, do we need it? And the second \nis, can we afford it?\n  On the first question, do we need it, do we need the $300 million \nadded to this budget, the Secretary of Defense says no.\n  Can we afford it? Even if we do not need it, can we afford it? Does \nanybody in this room, living in a country that is up to its neck in \ndebt, with annual yearly deficits that are still alarming and a Federal \ndebt approaching $5 trillion, believe we can afford something we do not \nneed?\n  I am going to talk some about the system itself, but first I wish to \ntalk about the irony of being here in the Chamber at a time when we are \ntold repeatedly, week after week after week, that we do not have enough \nmoney. We are told we do not have enough money to fully fund the \nprograms to be able to send kids to college. So we are going to budget \nin a way that is going to make it harder for families to send their \nkids to college because we have to tighten our belt. We are told that \nwe cannot afford to provide an entitlement that a poor child should \nhave a hot lunch at school in the middle of the day because we must \ntighten our belt. We are told health care is too expensive and so we \nmust cut $270 billion from Medicare and a substantial amount from \nMedicaid because we must tighten our belt.\n  So for the American family, the message is tighten your belt on \nthings like education, health care, nutrition. But when it comes to \nsecurity, we are told it is not time to tighten our belt; let us get \nthe wish lists out and let us get the American taxpayers' checkbook \nout--or the credit card more likely--and let us decide to build a \nproject that the Secretary of Defense says he does not want money for \nat this point.\n  Let me talk about the project itself.\n  This bill provides research and development funds in order to \naccelerate the deployment of a national missile defense system. The \nadministration requested $371 million for its ongoing research and \ndevelopment program. The Armed Services Committee says that is not good \nenough for us. The committee wants $300 million more added to the \nrequest because it wants to deploy the system in four years. The \ncommittee is telling the Defense Department to build it. They are \nsaying that it does not matter to us what you think; it does not matter \nto us whether you think we need it. We insist you build it.\n  I come from a State where the only antiballistic missile system in \nthe free world was built. It was built in the late 1960's and early \n1970's. Less than 30 days after it was declared operational, it was \nmothballed. In other words, in the same month that it was declared \nfully operational it was also mothballed.\n  It is anticipated, because of our Nation's geography, that one of the \nsites in a multiple site national missile defense system would be in \nNorth Dakota. There would likely be one North Dakota site. And I \nsuppose some would say, well, that means jobs in your State; you ought \nto support this.\n  I do not think it makes sense to support a defense initiative of this \ntype especially at this time in our country's history if you measure it \nwith the yardstick of a jobs program. Yes, this might include some jobs \nin North Dakota, but it also will include the commitment and the \nprospect of taking $40 billion from the American taxpayers to build a \nproject we do not need, with money we do not have, at a time when we \nare telling a lot of Americans that we cannot make investments in human \npotential for the future of this country.\n  There is an ancient Chinese saying:\n\n       If you are planning for a year, plant rice; if you are \n     planning for 10 years, plant trees; if you are planning for \n     100 years, plant men.\n\n\n[[Page S 11229]]\n\n  I take ``plant men'' to mean ``educate your children.''\n  In this Chamber, we appropriately say that we have big financial \nproblems. We are choking on debt and must do something about it. We \nhave a lot of folks who talk a lot about it, gnash their teeth, who \nwring their hands, and act like warriors on deficit reduction--until it \ncomes time for a bill like this. And then they say to us, boy, we have \nthreats; we have threats from North Korea; we have threats from Libya; \nwe have threats from Iraq.\n  What do those threats suggest we should do? What we should do is, \nunder the aegis of reform--which is the wrong ``re'' word; the real \n``re'' word is not ``reform''; it is ``retread''--is resurrect and dust \noff a proposal coming from the early 1980's, a cold war relic to build \na national missile defense system to put an umbrella over America to \nprotect against incoming missiles from some renegade country. Far more \nimportant, in my judgment, is the threat from a suitcase bomb \nsomewhere; you start worrying about a nuclear device hauled in the \ntrunk of a car and parked at a dock in New York City; you start \nworrying about a canister 3 inches high of deadly biological weapons. \nThat is far more likely a threat to this country than a terrorist \ngetting ahold of an intercontinental ballistic missile and attempting \nto blackmail America.\n  Mr. President, I am most anxious to hear those who defend this kind \nof spending on projects that are, in my judgment, worthless. So let me \nat this point yield the floor and listen and then respond to some of \nwhat I hear. I hope maybe the Senate, voting on this today, will decide \nthat it ought not spend $300 million we do not have on something the \nSecretary of Defense says we do not need. That would seem to me to send \na powerful signal to the American people who in this body is serious \nabout the issue of the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nDorgan amendment. The Armed Services Committee has taken a hard look at \nthe ballistic missile defense programs and concluded that an increase \nof $300 million is warranted--indeed, badly needed. If the United \nStates is to ever be defended against even the most limited ballistic \nmissile threats, we must begin now.\n  The administration's program for national missile defense is simply \ninadequate. And in my view, the ballistic missile threat facing the \nUnited States is significant and growing. This threat clearly justifies \nan accelerated effort to develop and deploy highly effective theater \nand national missile defenses. In the bill now before the Senate we \nhave done just this. The Missile Defense Act is a responsible and \nmeasured piece of legislation that responds to a growing threat to \nAmerican national security.\n  There have been many arguments raised in opposition to the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995. These are either false or seriously exaggerated. \nLet me address three of the main objections that have been mentioned \nrepeatedly.\n  First, the Missile Defense Act of 1995 does not signal a return to \nstar wars. It advocates modest and affordable programs that are \ntechnically low risk.\n  Second, it does not violate or advocate violation of the ABM Treaty. \nThe means to implement the policies and goals outlined in the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995 are contained in the ABM Treaty itself.\n  Finally, the policies and goals contained in the Missile Defense Act \nof 1995 will not undermine START II or other arms control agreements. \nRussia has repeatedly agreed in the past that deployment of a limited \nnational missile defense system is not inconsistent with deterrence and \nstability. The United States must not allow critical national security \nprograms to be held hostage to other issues when there is no \nsubstantive or logical linkage between them.\n  Mr. President, I therefore would conclude by urging my colleagues to \noppose the amendment by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. \nThis amendment would undermine a critical defense requirement and \nfurther perpetuate the vulnerability of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the amendment. \nI would like to begin with a quote from Secretary Perry in this general \narea now, that we have entered the post-cold war time. Secretary Perry \nis quoted as saying:\n\n       The bad news is that in this era deterrence may not provide \n     even the cold comfort it did during the cold war. We may be \n     facing terrorists or rogue regimes with ballistic missiles \n     and nuclear weapons at the same time in the future. And they \n     may not buy into our deterrence theory. Indeed, they may be \n     madder than MAD.\n\n  MAD, mutually assured destruction.\n  Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate that there are those who \nseem to think that the American people should not be defended against \nthe one military threat which holds them at risk in their homes on a \ndaily basis. Simply stated, this amendment seeks to perpetuate what \nmany believe is truly an American vulnerability.\n  Yesterday there were only five Senators who opposed a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that the American people should be defended against \naccidental, intentional, or limited ballistic missile attack. Today the \nSenator from North Dakota is attempting to cut $300 million from \nnational missile defense to ensure that American cities will in effect \nremain undefended without this additional funding.\n  Senators yesterday voted in favor of defending the American people in \nthis new era that we are in. So today all Senators will have an \nopportunity to demonstrate whether or not they are serious about a \nnational defense. If you believe, as the Senator from North Dakota so \nhonestly does, and has stated, that the United States should not be \ndefended against this particular potential for ballistic missile \nattack, then support the amendment. But if you believe that the time \nhas come to get on with national missile defense, you should oppose \nthis amendment.\n  We have heard quite a bit about how there is no threat and how \ninvestment in national missile defense is a waste of money. Let us \nremember that more Americans died in the Persian Gulf war as a result \nof one missile than any other single cause. I do not imagine that the \nfamilies of these victims would view missile defense investments as a \nwaste.\n  The argument that there is no threat to justify the deployment of a \nnational missile defense system I think is strategically shortsighted \nand technically incorrect. Even if we get started today, by the time we \ndevelop and deploy an NMD system we will almost certainly face new \nballistic missile threats to the United States. Unfortunately, it will \ntake almost 10 years to develop and deploy even a limited system.\n  Much has been made of the intelligence community's estimate that no \nnew threat to the United States will develop for 10 years. But the \nintelligence community has confirmed that there are numerous ways for \nhostile countries to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \nmuch less than 10 years by other than indigenous development. I would \npoint out the same intelligence has also prepared a chart that has been \ndisplayed on the Senate floor showing the North Korean missile \nprograms, including the Taepo Dong II ICBM, which DIA says could be \noperational in 5 years.\n  We see the size and the capability of destructive ability of these \nvarious missiles. You have got the Scud-B, the Scud-C, the No Dong, the \nTaepo Dong I and II. And these have not been tested. But it is very \ncapable for them to do that, the North Koreans to do that. And it is \nestimated that they could go to this biggest one, which would be well \nover the 1,000 kilometers, in 5 years or maybe less. And in developing \nthis system North Korea has demonstrated to the world that an ICBM \ncapability can emerge rapidly and relatively with little notice.\n  Nobody knows with certainty what the range of this potential new \nmissile would be. But we do know that it is approximately the size of \nthe Minuteman ICBM.\n  Even if we knew with certainty that no new threat would materialize \nfor 10 years there would still be a strong case for developing and \ndeploying a national \n\n[[Page S 11230]]\ndefense system. Developing an NMD system would serve to deter countries \nthat would seek to acquire otherwise ICBM capability. A vulnerable \nUnited States merely invites proliferation, blackmail, and even \naggression.\n  It has also been argued that the administration's NMD program costs \nless than the one proposed in the defense authorization bill. Well, I \nguess that is right. It usually does cost more to actually do something \nabout a problem than nothing, which is precisely what the \nadministration's program will do, I fear--nothing at all. They request \nmoney. And they have requested almost $400 million this year. And yet \nit is not enough to actually get the job done. The administration's \nprogram has no deployment goal in sight. In effect, you know, it wastes \nalmost $400 million per year on a program designed never to achieve a \nspecific end. In my view, if we are not going to actually deploy \nsomething we ought to take the rest of the NMD money and spend it on \nsomething that will defend America.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has stated that the system we want to \nbuild will cost $40 billion. But by the administration's own charts, it \nstates that it would cost less than $25 billion, including a full \nspace-based sensor constellation. How does this compare to the cost of \nthe F-22, the B-2 or other major new systems? I think it is a pretty \ngood investment relative to virtually anything else that DOD is \ndeveloping. What good does it do to be able to project power overseas \nwith modern and sophisticated weapons if we cannot secure our families \nat home? Remember what we are talking about here.\n  It is not an insignificant amount, an additional $300 million \napproximately, but you are talking about the cost of three or four \nairplanes. You are talking about offensive weaponry, three or four \nairplanes. We can move toward the ability to develop and deploy this \nsystem.\n  One other chart I would like to refer to with regard to the national \nmissile defense program. The Bottom-Up Review just, I guess, 2 years \nago, projected the expenditures at this level for the national missile \ndefense. The administration fiscal year 1995 request was as you see up \nto about, I believe it indicated about $500 million. And then in the \nfiscal year 1996 it dropped down, and what this bill actually does is \nbasically a very small increase over what the administration's fiscal \nyear 1995 request was. So, talking about just enough increase to move \ntoward actual development and the ability to deploy within 10 years.\n  So this is a good-sense approach. It is one based on what the \nadministration had projected in its Bottom-Up Review and what it asked \nfor in 1995.\n  For those who argue that the Senate Armed Services Committee is \nthrowing money at ballistic missile defense, I point out that the \namount of this bill for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization is \n$136 million lower than the Clinton administration's own Bottom-Up \nReview recommended for fiscal year 1996. It is also less than the \nadministration's own budget forecast in last year's plan.\n  All four of the defense committees in Congress have increased funding \nfor the national missile defense. In fact, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee have \nrecommended a smaller increase than the House committees have. The \nHouse has recommended an increase of $450 million.\n  In response to those who say the administration did not request this \nincrease, I point out the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has \nmade it clear on many occasions and with the administration's, I think, \ntacit approval, that if more money was made available for ballistic \nmissile programs that they would want to spend $400 million on the \nnational missile defense program.\n  The bottom line is simple. If you think that the American people \nshould not be defended against ballistic missiles, then go ahead and \nsupport this amendment. If you think that the time has come to do \nsomething about an ever-increasing threat in this post-cold-war era, \nthen vote against this amendment.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to put themselves on the side of \ndefending the American people at a very reasonable cost.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the time.\n  I was listening intently to the Senator from Mississippi. I was glad \nhe brought that up because the Senator from North Dakota has said over \nand over and over again that this is a $40 billion program for the \nfuture. I think it has to be clarified, and yet after we clarify it, I \nsuggest the Senator from North Dakota will continue to use $40 billion. \nThis is just not true.\n  The Senator from Mississippi talked about, according to the figures \nof the administration, it was $24.2 billion. But I suggest that \nincludes the SMTS program, Brilliant Eyes, which is funded separately, \nwhich can be taken off. It is closer to $18 billion.\n  We do have an investment today in the program of $38 billion. Some \npeople estimate it is more than that. Let us be conservative and say \n$38 billion in what we call the SDI program, which some people like to \ncontinue to use star wars to try to make the public of this country \nbelieve that this is some fantasy, that it is not real. It is not \nsomething we are handling today.\n  The SDI program, we feel, helped end the cold war by 5 years. What \nkind of a value can we put on that? In fact, the Russian Ambassador to \nthe United States, Vladimir Lukin, stated that if it had not been for \nSDI, the cold war would have gone on for 5 additional years.\n  The SDI program and its research led to systems, not fantasies, but \nsystems in place today, such as the Aegis system, cruisers and \ndestroyers, kinetic energy programs, the hit-to-kill technologies which \nare used in the THAAD, the PAC-3, the Navy upper-tier defense systems. \nThese are not star wars; these are technologies. They are on line \ntoday.\n  All we are trying to do is say that in 5 years from now, where many \nin the intelligence community say we are going to be threatened by \nperhaps North Korea or other technology that will reach the United \nStates--and this is something that most of the intelligence community \nagrees with--we want to do something today that will be within the \nconfines of the ABM Treaty. We talked about that before. This is as \nmuch as we can do to reach the point so that 5 years from today, we are \ngoing to be able to defend the United States against missile attacks.\n  The Senator from North Dakota refers over and over again to the \nsuitcase bombs, to the ships and vans that deliver weapons. And on that \ncase, I agree with the Senator from North Dakota, I think he is right. \nBut we are already taking care of that. We are already working on that \nprogram.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talks about intelligence estimates. I \nasked yesterday on this floor, what if we are wrong, what if those \nintelligence estimates he is saying where the threat is not there for \n10 more years, what if we are right and it is 5 more years? What if he \nis wrong? Look back to 1940 and Pearl Harbor. At that time our \nestimates were wrong; North Korea in 1950, or more recently, Iraq in \n1990. Our intelligence was wrong at that time.\n  The Senator relies on the cold war mutually assured destruction \nprogram embodied in the triad of missile submarines, land-based \nmissiles and bombers, but we had all these things 5 years ago, and that \ndid not deter Saddam Hussein from using Scud missiles.\n  When the Senator points out that the administration says that $300 \nmillion to defend Americans from attack is not in our interest, he \nignores the fact that just 3 months ago, the director of the Pentagon's \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization, with the administration's \nblessing, said that they could spend $500 million more. That is $200 \nmillion more than the additional amount we are trying to put on that we \ndid put on in the Senate Armed Services Committee and our counterparts \nin the other body to reach a system that would defend America.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is also citing the administration \nsupposedly defended our interests last year by spending $2 billion. We \nare doing a lot of talking now about $300 \n\n[[Page S 11231]]\nmillion. What about the $2 billion that we spent for humanitarian \nmissions that, by their own admission, in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, by the Secretary of Defense were really not to our vital \nnational security interests.\n  I am talking about Somalia and Haiti and Bosnia and Rwanda. We are \nspending all this money. We are sending our troops all the way around \nthe world to defend violations of human rights. Certainly, I am not \ninsensitive to the ethnic cleansing that is going on and all these \nhuman rights violations. But we are spending huge amounts for that. I \ndisagree with the foreign policy of the administration, and I do not \nthink we should be doing it. But if we are doing it, that is $2 \nbillion, and we are talking $300 million right now to keep this on line \nto be able to defend this country 5 years from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Carolina yield 2 \nadditional minutes?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I grant him 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Finally, Mr. President, I must express my amazement with \nthe priorities of the Senator from North Dakota. He wants to cut $300 \nmillion from the missile defense. He says we have higher domestic \npriorities. We heard about the nutrition programs, we heard about all \nthese social programs that seem to, in his mind, have a higher \npriority.\n  I suggest to you that this $300 million is a relatively small amount \nof money. The one bomb in Oklahoma City that wiped out the Murrah \nFederal Building cost the taxpayers $500 million--one bomb.\n  I suggest if the Senator from North Dakota could have stood with me \nin Oklahoma City on April 19, April 20, April 21, when they are sending \ntroops and volunteers into this building to pull out people who might \nbe alive in there, the hope was there that more would be alive, then \nthe fourth day came and the smell of death had enveloped the city, if \nyou could have been there, and what was going through my mind was, this \nis just one building in one city, one missile could come in there and \nwipe out every building in the city of Oklahoma City, in the city of \nSioux Falls, SD, in Bismarck, ND, in New York City, could wipe out the \nentire thing.\n  Multiply that one thing, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City \nby 100, by 1,000. That is the threat that is out there. That is the \nthreat that can reach, according to many in the intelligence community, \nthis country within 5 years. We have to be ready for that. This should \nbe the highest priority. We are elected to defend America. That is \nexactly what this is about today.\n  So, Mr. President, in the strongest of terms, I say this is the \nminimum that we can do to keep on force, to have a national missile \ndefense system in place in 5 years when the threat is very real.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  The Ballistic Missile Defense Initiative, reported by the Armed \nServices Committee, puts our Nation on the right track to address the \ngrowing missile threat to our country.\n  In the defense appropriations bill, which was reported last week, we \nfully supported every element of that plan, and I congratulate Senators \nThurmond, Lott, and others who worked with them on this plan.\n  Every intelligence assessment available to the Congress indicates \nthat the threat posed to U.S. military forces is growing from ballistic \nmissiles, as is the threat to the United States itself.\n  There can be no greater imperative, as we allocate funding for \nresearch and development for future systems, than to develop and deploy \nan effective national missile defense system.\n  This matter has special significance to every citizen of my State of \nAlaska. Already, North Korea is developing missiles that could attack \nthe military installations in Alaska.\n  Alaska-based F-15's, F-16's, and OA-10 aircraft will be the first to \nrespond to any attack on South Korea. On that basis, we are a target \nfor North Korea.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota may be confident that his \nState will not face that threat in coming years, and I share that \nconfidence. Our country was lucky in the gulf war. The ingenuity and \ntechnical creativeness ensured that we had some minimal capacity to \nrespond to the Iraqi Scud missile threat.\n  We cannot, and must not, rely on luck to be ready to face the risk of \nmissile launches against my State and against the United States in \ntotal. We must make the investment now to have ready a system to \ndeploy, if that is the decision of the President and Congress.\n  The additional funds proposed for authorization and appropriation for \nnational missile defense is a reasonable and affordable start for this \nprogram.\n  I am here to urge all Members to support this initiative. I do so as \na Senator from a State that is seriously threatened today, and I \nbelieve the funding authorized by this bill, already included in the \ndefense appropriations bill, is the proper way to start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume to \nmyself.\n  Mr. President, statements have been made that my position is I do not \nwant to defend America's cities against a very real threat--total \nnonsense; absolute nonsense.\n  My position is that we should not be spending money we do not have on \nsomething the Secretary of Defense says we do not need. Let me read \nfrom a letter from Secretary of Defense William Perry to Senator Nunn:\n\n       The bill's provision would add nothing to DOD's ability to \n     pursue our missile defense programs and would needlessly \n     cause us to incur excess costs and serious security risks. \n     The bill would require the United States to make a decision \n     now on developing a specific national missile defense for \n     deployment by 2003, with interim operational capability in \n     1999, despite the fact that a balanced strategic missile \n     threat has not emerged. Our national missile defense program \n     is designed to give us the capability for a deployment \n     decision in 3 years, when we will be in a much better \n     position to assess the threat and deploy the most \n     technologically advanced system available, if they think it \n     is needed.\n\n  This is not a case of somebody deciding we do not want to protect \nAmerica's cities. It is a case of saying we do not want to spend $300 \nmillion that the Secretary of Defense says we do not need to spend.\n  Let me respond to a couple of other things that have been said. This \nis not about just $300 million. It is about $48 billion, according to \nthe Congresional Budget Office. I ask all the Senators who spoke here, \nwhere are you going to get that money? You suggest that the Secretary \nof Defense budget for it. I ask you, are you going to charge it? And \nare you going to tax people for it? Where are you going to get the \nmoney? Do you want to advance a notion now that you want to build a $50 \nbillion new system, which by the way does, indeed, include star wars, \nas page 59 of the bill says? I ask you, where are you going to get the \nmoney for it?\n  Let me say to you, as well, that when you talk about the threat from \nan intercontinental ballistic missile, as you have all talked about, \nyou understand and I understand--I have some material that I will not \nread from on the floor, but it is material from Nobel laureates, from \nveterans of the Manhattan project and from physicists who are experts \nin this field, all of whom agree--and I think you would agree--that a \nthreat from a renegade country is far more likely as a result of a \ncruise missile, which cannot be defended against by this system, than \nit is from an intercontinental ballistic missile. A cruise missile is \neasier to build and cheaper to build and more likely for them to get.\n  I ask you this question, if you are worried about protecting \nAmerica's cities: If you finished spending $48 billion to defend \nagainst ballistic missiles, then tell me how that system defends \nAmerica's cities against the far more likely threat of cruise missiles. \nThe fact is that by building a national ballistic missile defense you \nhave done nothing to defend against a cruise missile attack on American \ncities.\n  That is the point. The point here is that this is a weapons program \nwith a constituency. Like all weapons programs, it does not matter what \nthe climate is--it can be rain, snow, wind, or \n\n[[Page S 11232]]\nsleet; you can have a Soviet Union or not, and it could be 1983 or \n1995--this weapons program has legs. It has jobs and it has \nconstituencies. This is out of step, makes no sense, and yet we see on \nthe floor of the Senate folks who come here and say, well, let us, this \nyear, stick $300 million more in this program than was asked for and \nthan is needed. Why? Because we want to defend America's cities. \nAgainst what? Against a threat which the Secretary of Defense says does \nnot exist, and Nobel laureates and veterans of the Manhattan project \nsay does not exist.\n  If you are so all-fired worried about threats, let us focus on the \nthreats that the Nation will really face.\n  One additional thing. I think the Senator from Oklahoma makes the \npoint that I have been trying to make this morning when he talks about \nthe tragic bombing of Oklahoma City. It is not an intercontinental \nballistic missile with all of its sophisticated targeting that is the \nlikely way to attack against America. It is far more likely to be a \nrental truck, a suitcase, a glass vial, a single-engine airplane. I \nthink the Senator from Oklahoma made the point I was trying to make.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not yield on my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to respond to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would give time, I am happy to answer \nquestions. But we have 45 minutes equally divided.\n  I will at this time reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say that 5 \nminutes is not a lot of time to make the case. But I am in strong \nsupport of the Dorgan amendment for a number of reasons. First of all, \nI will talk policy, and then I will talk budget. There is no \nsignificant long-range ballistic missile threat to the United States \nnow or in the immediate future. The head of the DIA stated:\n\n       We see no interest in or capability of any new country \n     reaching the continental United States with a long-range \n     missile for at least the next decade.\n\n  Mr. President, the national missile defense provides no defense \nagainst the most likely future attacks on the United States, which will \nnot be delivered by missiles. We have seen that clearly in a tragic way \nat the World Trade Center, the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and \nthe subway in Tokyo.\n  Mr. President, there are many arguments I could make about this \nimpossible dream. But let me just put it in a slightly broader context. \nWe have out here a bill that requests $7 billion more than the Pentagon \nsays it needs. We have out here with star wars a request for $300 \nmillion more than the Pentagon says it wants to spend or needs to \nspend.\n  Mr. President, I think this amendment is about more than star wars. \nIt is about priorities. And if you look at requests for Head Start, it \nis $3.9 billion, but the total cost of the next aircraft carrier, the \nCVN-78, is $4.6 billion.\n  If you look at requests for police officers, housing, childhood \nimmunization, alongside star wars, the B-2, Pentagon budget, $7 billion \nmore in this bill than requested by the Pentagon itself, of the kind of \nstories that are now coming out, Mr. President, about a variety of \ndifferent pork projects, all across the country, we have to ask \nourselves the question, what are we doing here?\n  I was on the floor of the Senate not too long ago, saying why are we \neliminating low-income energy assistance? I was talking about the poor \nin the cold-weather State of Minnesota. We also could talk about \ncooling assistance. This was during the time where we read that 450 \npeople died, many elderly and poor.\n  On the one hand, we cut low-income energy assistance, we cut \neducation programs, we cut job programs, we cut all sorts of nutrition \nprograms, we are not investing in our children, and we have here a bill \nthat asks for $7 billion more than the Pentagon says it needs for our \nnational defense.\n  Now we have--for this impossible dream, many independent people \narguing it never will work anyway--a request for an additional $300 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, the real national security for our country is not for \nstar wars in space. It is to feed children and educate children and \nprovide safety and security for people in communities, and job \nopportunities for people on Earth.\n  This is outrageous. At the very time we have some of our deficit \nhawks saying, ``Cut this nutrition program, cut low-income energy \nassistance, cut legal services, cut job training, cut summer youth \nprograms, cut education programs, cut health care programs,'' we have \nhere a budget that asks for $7 billion more than the Pentagon wants, \nand $300 million more for star wars--this impossible dream, this \nfantasy--than is requested by our own defense people.\n  This is really a test, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, this \nis a test case vote, as to whether or not we are serious about reducing \nthe deficit and investing in people in our country, investing in people \nwho live in the communities in our country. That is what this is about.\n  Senators, you cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. Maybe \nyou are trying to dance at three weddings at the same time. You cannot \nkeep saying you are for deficit reduction, you cannot keep saying you \nare for children and education, you cannot keep saying that you are for \njob opportunities, you cannot keep saying you are for veterans, you \ncannot keep saying we will not cut Medicare, and at the same time \nallocating more and more money for your pork military projects, and \nadding to a military budget that the Pentagon itself says it does not \nneed. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for yielding time to discuss this amendment.\n  Going back to basics, the amendment is to cut $300 million from the \ncommittee's request for funding for the Defense Department. The \ncommittee has a $300 million increase from what the administration had \nrequested for this particular part of the budget. The House had \nincreased it $400 million. The Senate increase is less than the House \nincrease by $100 million. The Dorgan amendment is to cut $300 million \nfrom the committee's request.\n  The primary arguments against the committee's mark are categorized \ninto two areas: First, the threat is not that great or that soon; \nsecond, the money could be spent on other things.\n  First, talking about the threat, there is a suggestion here that the \nthreat is not imminent. The threat we are talking about is a threat to \nrelatively soon be able to attack the continental United States, \nbecause this is the national missile defense part of the program we are \ntalking about.\n  Now, we all understand that eventually we will have to have a defense \nagainst missiles that would either be accidentally or intentionally \nlaunched against U.S. territory. The question is, how soon do we need \nto begin preparing for that?\n  The Senator from North Dakota says we do not need to worry about it \nyet because it will be maybe 10 years before the threat emerges. There \nare two primary responses to it. First, it is wrong; and, second, we \nare not taking into account the fact that it takes a long time to \ndevelop the programs to respond to the offensive threat.\n  We have been working at this program for a long time. It has been 5 \nyears yesterday, since the taking over of Kuwait by Iraq. Yet we are \nnot very far down the road in terms of improving our ability to defend \neven against a missile like the Scud B that the Iraqis had. We are \ntalking here about much longer range missiles than the Scud B. We are \ntalking about missiles that could reach U.S. territory.\n  Now, at first we are talking about the State of Alaska or the \nTerritory of Guam. I know it is of interest to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  In fact, we all would be very, very concerned about a threat to any \nU.S. citizen, whether it be in Guam or whether it be in Alaska. It does \nnot have to be to the heartland of America.\n  What is the fact with regard to this threat? The person who last \nheaded the CIA just prior to the new Director, John Deutch, the then \nActing Director \n\n[[Page S 11233]]\nof the Central Intelligence Agency, Admiral William Studeman, made this \npoint just a few months ago. He said,\n\n       Our understanding of North Korea's earlier Scud development \n     leads us to believe that it is unlikely Pyongyang could \n     deploy Taepo-Dong I or Taepo-Dong II missiles before 3 to 5 \n     years. However, if Pyongyang has foreshortened its \n     development program, we could see these missiles earlier.\n\n  What the acting CIA Director was saying is that they probably will \nnot have this missile that could reach the United States for 3 to 5 \nyears.\n  Well, we cannot develop this system within 3 to 5 years. The bill \ncalls for some kind of a deployment, hopefully, by 1999. That is within \nthe timeframe that the CIA Director acknowledges the Taepo-Dong II \nmissile could be developed.\n  Now, what about the current CIA director? John Deutch said last year, \n``If the North Koreans field that Taepo-Dong II missile, Guam, Alaska, \nand parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''\n  The point here is that North Korea, a belligerent state over whom we \nhave virtually no negotiating control, no diplomatic control, is \ndeveloping a weapon which the CIA says could potentially reach United \nStates territory in 3 to 5 years.\n  If the 3 years is correct, we cannot possibly have anything deployed \nin time to meet that threat. Even if it is just used to blackmail us, \nit is a tremendous threat. For those who say that there is no threat \nhere, the facts do not bear them out. The intelligence estimates do not \nbear them out.\n  The other side of this argument is, well, there are other threats. \nThere could be a suitcase bomb. There is a cruise missile threat, and \nof course the answer is yes, that is true. We are doing everything we \ncan to meet those threats as well.\n  It is a fallacy of logic to suggest that because there is some other \nthreat that, therefore, this is not a threat. That is the logic of the \nSenator from North Dakota. Well, somebody might bring a suitcase bomb \nover.\n  Well, we are working that problem very hard. The last three CIA \nDirectors have said that their primary concern is the proliferation of \nthese weapons of mass destruction and the missiles that can deliver \nthem.\n  As a matter of fact, there has not been a suitcase nuclear bomb \nexplode, but there have been missiles launched against U.S. forces. As \na matter of fact, as I said yesterday, fully 20 percent of our \ncasualties in the Persian Gulf were as a result of a Scud missile. We \ndid not have an adequate protection against the Scud missile.\n  We at least had the Patriot over there. We have nothing to protect \nthe people in the United States. I think the CIA Directors are a pretty \ngood source for the proposition that there is a potential threat out \nthere, and we will be lucky to be able to deploy a system in time to \nmeet that threat, if their statistics are correct.\n  Now, just one quick final point on the threat. The Senator from North \nDakota suggests that the triad is actually adequate here, but the same \nSecretary of Defense that he is so fond of relying on has made it clear \nthat mutual assured destruction, the threat that we retaliate with \nnuclear weapons against Iraq or some other country, is just not \ncredible.\n  As Secretary Perry said on March 8 of this year,\n\n       The bad news is that in this era, deterrence may not \n     provide even the cold comfort it did during the cold war. We \n     may be facing terrorists or rogue regimes with ballistic \n     missiles and nuclear weapons at the same time in the future, \n     and they may not buy into our deterrence theory. Indeed, they \n     may be madder than MAD.\n\n  And the M-A-D that he is referring to is the mutual assured \ndestruction doctrine, which the Secretary is saying is madness today. \nThat doctrine no longer works. We need a defense, not just the threat \nof massive retaliation to prevent countries from launching missiles \nagainst the United States.\n  Finally, let us talk about the amount here. First of all, as the \nSenator from Mississippi pointed out earlier, the amount that is in the \nSenate bill this year is less than the Clinton administration requested \nlast year in their 5-year budget. So in the 5-year plan the \nadministration sent up here last year, they were asking for more money \nfor this program than the committee has asked for this year. It is a \nmatter of timing, of when you spend the money. As I think I have \npointed out, even with this amount of money we will be lucky to be able \nto field something that is effective by the time the threat is upon us.\n  Second, there is a suggestion here that the Secretary does not want \nthis because he has not asked for it. Obviously, we are all aware of \nthe politics within the Pentagon and the administration and not asking \nfor it is not the same as not wanting it. You will note in the letter \nfrom the Secretary, nowhere does he say: Do not send us this $300 \nmillion, I do not want it and I will not spend it if you send it to me. \nAs a matter of fact, his spokesman on this issue, Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, \nbefore the House committee just a few weeks ago, was asked if he could \nspend this money, and here is what he said:\n\n       I have reviewed the BMD program, the impact of last year's \n     budget reductions and the schedule of several key programs in \n     order to recommend where additional resources could be best \n     applied.\n\n  Remember, the House is talking about $400 million in additional \nresources. And he says:\n\n       These funds could be effectively used in several key BMD \n     programs to accelerate development efforts, preserve early \n     development options for a national missile defense system, \n     and to protect current theater missile defense system \n     acquisition schedules.\n\n  In other words, the expert in this area, the head of the program, \nGen. Mal O'Neill, made it clear to the House of Representatives if he \nhad this extra money he could effectively use it. I understand the \nadministration position is against this. We all understand that. But it \nis not common sense when you recognize the speed with which this threat \ncould be upon us and the ability we have to develop a system that could \ndefend us.\n  When I say it is not common sense, I do not mean to denigrate the \nSecretary of Defense. He is a fine public servant and is very concerned \nabout the future of our country. But reasonable people can differ about \nthe speed with which we ought to get on with this effort and the \npriority of spending this money. I submit the weight of evidence from \nthe Central Intelligence Agency and from the other people who have \nspoken on the issue is, we better get about this task right away.\n  The final point with regard to the money is that while we could be \nspending this money on summer youth programs or Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance--of course we could. But what is more important, defending \nAmerican lives or summer youth programs? We have to set priorities \naround here. I submit, if a missile were launched against the State of \nHawaii or the State of Alaska, every one of us on this floor would be \ndenouncing the act and would be asking why that was allowed to happen? \nWho sat by while this threat emerged? Who allowed this threat to evolve \nto the point we could not defend our own citizens from a missile \nattack? Those would be the questions asked on this floor.\n  Today that question can be answered because those people who seek to \ncut these funds out of the committee bill will be the people \nresponsible for us not having a system at the time that the CIA \nbelieves we are going to need to have it. That is the question before \nthe body. Do we go along with the leadership? Do we go along with the \ncommittee, which is the body of expertise on this? Do we go along with \nthe Central Intelligence estimates, and do we go along to fund this \nprogram to at least get us on a path to develop and deploy a system in \nthe time we need it? Or do we take the risk and roll the dice, spend \nthe money on summer youth programs or Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nor the like?\n  I submit the decision today is that we should go along with the \ncommittee's request here, support the committee and vote down the \nDorgan amendment which would cut the $300 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me yield a minute to myself before I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  I might say if ever there is an Olympic event called side stepping, I \nhave seen this morning several candidates for gold medals.\n  Let us not be confused about what the Secretary of Defense has said. \nHere is a letter he sent last week. It says this:\n\n\n[[Page S 11234]]\n\n       The bill's provisions would add nothing to DOD's ability to \n     pursue our missile defense programs and would needlessly \n     cause us to incur excess costs and serious security risks.\n\n  That is not a letter from a Secretary who is undecided about whether \nthis is good policy or not. The Senator from Arizona says he just has \nnot asked us. The Senator says that of course, the Secretary would like \nto get it this additional money.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This letter says he does not want it. He thinks it adds \nexcess costs and additional security risks to this country. So let us \nnot be confused about the message from the Secretary of Defense. He is \nclear on this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas. I will be \nhappy to yield momentarily for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Briefly, can the Senator point anywhere in that letter where \nhe is referring to this $300 million? He is referring generally to this \nbill, not to this $300 million.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In fact, he specifically refers to this $300 million in \nthis program, I say to the Senator from Arizona, in the following part \nof this paragraph. I read it once before and I am not going to read it \nagain for you.\n  The point is, he is talking about developing specific national \nmissile defense for interim operational capability in 1999 and for full \ndeployment in 2003. That is exactly and specifically the program we are \nnow debating. If the Senator is asking, was the Secretary talking about \nthis issue, the answer is clearly, unequivocally, yes, that is exactly \nwhat the Secretary was talking about in this letter.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding, and \nthank him for his leadership in support of the defense of the United \nStates of America.\n  I am very pleased that this amendment has been offered. I oppose it, \nvehemently and strongly oppose it, but I am glad it has been offered \nbecause it gives the American people a chance once and for all to see \njust exactly what this debate is all about and who stands for what.\n  The Dorgan amendment would leave the American people completely \nvulnerable to ballistic missile threats, completely vulnerable. It says \nto our constituents, it is OK to protect Israel, protect France, \nprotect Germany, protect Italy, protect our allies, but not our folks \nat home. Do not protect them.\n  The armed services bill, on the other hand, establishes a program to \ndefend all Americans, regardless of where they live, against a limited \nballistic missile attack. For the life of me, I do not understand how \nanyone could use the argument it is OK to protect somebody in one area \nof the country and not in another area of the country. How can one do \nthat and keep a straight face?\n  The Clinton program and the Dorgan amendment leaves the United States \nhostage, completely, to the likes of Kim Jong Il and the Pyongyang \nCommunists. The intelligence community has suggested that North Korea \nmay well deploy an ICBM capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii within 5 \nyears, and some talk maybe even as far as San Francisco in a very short \nperiod of time, but the Senator from North Dakota thinks it is wrong \nfor us to defend these American citizens?\n  If the Senator disagrees with this assessment, let us look at the \nstatement of the recently confirmed Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, John Deutch. Dr. Deutch stated,\n\n       If the North Koreans field the Taepo Dong II missile, Guam, \n     Alaska, and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.\n\n  This is a serious, serious problem. The issue really boils down to \nthis. Twenty nations have acquired or are acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction and the capability to deliver them, Iran, Syria, North \nKorea, Libya, China, to name a few. That ought to put the fear of God \nin us--just that, just thinking about those nations. And at least 24, \nsome of the same ones I just mentioned, have chemical weapons. And \napproximately 10 more are believed to have biological weapons. And at \nleast 10 countries are reportedly interested in development of nuclear \nweapons.\n  The international export control regime is failing to prevent the \nspread of these technologies. They are being spread all over the world, \nthis missile technology, biological, chemical, nuclear, and the \ncapability to deliver them.\n  The Armed Services Committee, under the strong leadership of Senator \nStrom Thurmond, recognizes that fact. This is a far-reaching, \nfarsighted, looking-ahead attempt to protect the United States of \nAmerica and its citizens in the outyears. You have to be thinking about \nthat today, not 50 years from now, because 50 years from now it will be \ntoo late. You think about it today, and that is what the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has done. Under his leadership we have provided, in the \nArmed Services Committee, the opportunity to protect our citizens.\n  The Dorgan amendment would say that the continental United States, \nAlaska, and Hawaii, are absolutely vulnerable to these threats. The \nreckless leaders of North Korea, Syria, Libya, and others basically \nhave free access to our citizens. The choice is simple, really; really \nsimple. If you believe the American people should be protected against \nlimited accidental or intentional missile attacks--take your choice--\nyou should support the Armed Services Committee bill.\n  That is why we are on the committee. That is why we delve into these \nmatters in great detail. That is our specialty. That is what we are \nthere for, to understand these things and to present options to the \nfull Senate. But if you believe the American people should not be \ndefended and should be completely vulnerable, then you vote for the \nDorgan amendment.\n  It is ironic--and tragically ironic, frankly--that those who oppose \ndefending the American people hide behind the fig leaf of the cold war. \nThe cold war is over. And the technology and the philosophy that we use \nto defend against it is also over. We do not have mutual assured \ndestruction anymore. We do not have a bipolar world anymore. These \npeople are not rational. Does anybody think Saddam Hussein is rational? \nWould Saddam Hussein have used a nuclear missile in the Persian Gulf \nwar if he had the opportunity? You bet he would. He just does not have \nit.\n  We do not have the capability to protect against this. It is very \ninteresting that focus groups have been held where we call a few people \ninto the room and interview them. We asked them, ``What would you do if \nsomebody fired a missile at the United States?'' In this group, \nAmerican citizens were put together in a room and they were asked, \n``What would you do if someone fired a missile at the United States of \nAmerica?'' And every single one of those people said, ``We would shoot \nit down.'' Guess what? We do not have the capability to shoot it down, \nMr. President. This amendment will make sure we do not have the \ncapability to shoot it down until it is too late.\n  So I urge my colleagues to defeat this very irresponsible amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want everyone to \nunderstand that the President's request already has $371 million in the \nbill for a national ballistic missile defense system. The committee \nadded $300 million. So now we have $671 million, almost doubling what \nthe Pentagon requested. The Senator from North Dakota very sensibly and \nwisely is trying to strike out the extra money. I hear people on that \nside of the aisle saying, ``We are not trying to abrogate the ABM \nTreaty. This does not abrogate the ABM Treaty.'' Really?\n  Here is what the ABM Treaty says:\n\n       Each party shall be limited at any one time to a single \n     area out of the two provided in Article III of the treaty for \n     deployment of antiballistic missile systems or their \n     components. . . .\n\n  English is the mother tongue. If you speak English, you understand \nthe word ``single.'' It means one. Our one site is now in North Dakota. \n\n\n[[Page S 11235]]\n\n  Here is what this bill says. Here is what the language of the bill \nclearly says if you speak the mother tongue.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--to deploy a \n     multiple-site national ballistic missile defense system . . . \n     .\n  I want to emphasize that--``a multiple-site'' NBMD system.\n  And section 235 of the bill says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall develop a national missile \n     defense system, which will attain initial operational \n     capability by the end of 2003 . . .\n       It shall include . . . ground-based interceptors deployed \n     at multiple sites . . .\n\n  Remember, the ABM Treaty bans multiple-site systems. If that in \nitself is not compelling, there is more. This bill says we will decide \nwhat is a national missile defense system, and what is a theater \nmissile defense system. We could not care less what the Russians think. \nDo you think people in Russia, the former Soviet Union, who crafted \nthis treaty with us and that we ratified with, should have any say \nabout what we are going to do in abrogating the treaty?\n  I read a very interesting article the other day in the Washington \nPost, an op-ed by someone named Sarah Roosevelt, who I do not know. She \nsaid, ``Do not tweak the bear.'' Russia is an economic basket case. \nThey are a military basket case. They were a military basket case and \nan economic basket case when Hitler decided he could take them with one \nhand behind him. They did not have any choice but to allow millions of \ntheir people to be slaughtered until they could arm and beat Hitler.\n  If I had asked this body 10 years ago standing beside my desk, \n``Senators, what would you give to see the Soviet Union disappear, and \nto see East Germany, Hungary, Poland, all of those nations free, how \nmuch would you be willing to cut the defense budget in exchange for \nthat?''--10 years ago--I daresay a consensus in the body, the smallest \nnumber would have been 30 percent, and a lot of people would have said \n50 percent.\n  So what are we doing with this bill, which is the most irresponsible \ndefense bill I have seen in my 21 years in the U.S. Senate? We say we \nare going to give to the Pentagon $7 billion which it doesn't even \nwant. What kind of insanity is sweeping over this body?\n  We spend already, without the additional $7 billion, twice as much as \nour eight most likely enemies including China, Russia, North Korea, \nIraq, and Iran--twice as much; and, with NATO, twice as much as the \nrest of the world combined. And in this bill we are putting an \nadditional $7 billion into defense.\n  If this bill goes to the President's desk in its present form and he \ndoes not veto it--I am going to say publicly he is a very good friend \nof mine, and I want him to be reelected--if he does not veto this bill, \nI am going to be terribly disappointed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, there is an old song that says: ``You \nkeep coming back like a song.''\n  Mr. President, in spite of the end of the cold war, in spite of the \nfact that the Russians are dismantling their nuclear weapons and we are \nbuying the plutonium and the enriched uranium, in spite of the fact \nthat there is no longer a threat from intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles to the United States, no longer targeted at this country, this \nsame issue, this military-industrial complex that the Defense \nDepartment does not want, keeps ``coming back like a song.''\n  Mr. President, I have had amendments on this I guess four or five \ntimes over the past few years; more than I think $25 billion ago. And \nwe have won it sometimes on the floor only to see it reversed by one \nvote or by two votes. But, Mr. President, this really at this time in \nour history is madness.\n  The biggest threat to this country right now is not from Russian \nICBM's and certainly not from Saddam Hussein, who is no conceivable \nthreat to the continental United States. Rather, the real threat to the \nUnited States is from this kind of spending, which would start a new \ncold war, which would hurt the economy of the United States and weaken \nthis country.\n  If you are really worried about nuclear weapons, I can tell you where \nthe threat would come. It is from a terrorist nuclear weapon which \ncould be easily brought into the United States in a suitcase.\n  Look, if they can smuggle bales of marijuana into this country \neasily, they can easily smuggle into this country a suitcase bomb which \ncan be put into something the size of a briefcase. And so why are we \nspending billions of dollars, even going into space-based lasers? Do \nyou know what it takes to drive a space-based laser? A nuclear bomb. \nThat is what it takes; otherwise, they do not have enough power.\n  That is what we are spending all this money for? What is the threat, \nMr. President? It is absolute madness. It is what President Eisenhower \nwarned against--the military industrial complex--which gets this \nenthusiasm, gets it going; we have jobs out there in the economy. That \nis what this thing is about. It is not about defending the United \nStates.\n  We really ought to go further than the Dorgan amendment. We ought to \ndo away with any thought of deploying any ballistic missile defense in \nthe continental United States. Do some research but do away with this \ndeployment. It makes no sense today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about \nour ballistic missile defense program and the ABM Treaty with an eye \ntoward dismantling several myths about our missile defense program and \nthe scope of the ABM treaty. Unfortunately, many of the opponents of a \ndeployable national missile defense system, including the President, \nconfuse the central issues at hand in this debate through the \nperpetuation of two central myths about national missile defense.\n  They maintain consistently that one, deploying a national missile \ndefense system is a return to star wars and two, that such a deployment \nis an abrogation of the ABM Treaty. Neither of these claims has any \ngrounding in fact.\n  First, the opponents of a deployable NMD system would have the Senate \nbelieve that in supporting NMD deployment we are committing ourselves \nto a long-term research program that would cost this Nation tens of \nbillions of dollars.\n  In addition, they would have the Senate think that this system is a \nspace-based system modeled along the lines of the star wars program of \nthe 1980's. The deployed NMD system called for in this bill is neither \na distant technological dream, a space-based system, nor an overly \nexpensive investment for the American taxpayer. This legislation calls \nfor a deployable, multiple site, ground-based interceptor system by the \nyear 2003. Let me repeat--a ground-based interceptor system.\n  The current GBI configuration of a national missile defense system \nbuilds off our current advances in theater missile defense--advances \nthat proceed from the concept of ground-based antiballistic missiles. \nSuch a system builds upon existing ground-based interception \ntechnology--technology that is currently deployed or is being validated \nthrough successful flight tests.\n  The only current limitation on rapid EKV development and deployment \nis the funding strangulation placed on our NMD program by the current \nadministration. The centerpiece of this system, the Exoatmospheric kill \nvehicle or EKV, has been in development for 5 years and has \ndemonstrated outstanding technological progress and achievements. The \nEKV is a real piece of hardware designed to perform a mission that is \nwell within our current intercept capabilities. As opposed to tens of \nbillions dollars in outlays to develop and deploy a ground-based NMD \nsystem, a deployable system will require a scant percentage of the \nfunding provided for space-based research in 1980's. In fact, this \nyear's authorization and appropriations bill call for an increase of \nonly $300 million for national missile defense--an amount that is \nroughly a third of the cost of one destroyer.\n The opponents of national missile defense also claim that the national \nmissile defense provisions in \n\n[[Page S 11236]]\nthis authorization bill would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty. While the ultimate goal of multiple site deployment of an NMD \nsystem will require modifications to the ABM Treaty, nothing in the \nrange of the coming year's research and development efforts will in \nfact, violate the constraints of the treaty. Therefore, the committee \nhas, wisely, asked only for a Senate study on the application and \nrelevance of the ABM Treaty to the current missile defense needs of \nthis country. The ABM Treaty is over two decades old. It is based upon \na doctrine of deterrence commonly known as mutually assured \ndestruction. While this doctrine was absolutely applicable to the \nrealities of the cold war, it has little place in a nonbipolar world of \nrogue regimes and proliferating ballistic missile technology. \nUnfortunately, the current administration continues to adhere not only \nto a belief that the parameters of the treaty remain valid in today's \nworld, but seem determined to apply unilateral interpretations to the \ntreaty that limit not only our national missile defense program, but \nalso our theater missile defense systems--limitations beyond those \nexpressly contained in the treaty. Therefore, the committee has \nrecommended a provision that would codify TMD speed and range standards \nfor treaty compliance--standards derived from the administration's own \nNovember 1993 proposal. Make no mistake, Mr. President, the global \npolitical situation and the nature of the ballistic missile threat has \nchanged dramatically from the time of the ABM Treaty's ratification. \nNorth Korea is nearing long-range ballistic missile capability. Just 2 \nmonths ago, the Chinese fired a truck-launched ICBM, demonstrating just \nhow easy it will be for rogue states to develop and launch ICBM's on \nthe cheap. Mr. President, the threat to the United States from long-\nrange ballistic missiles from rogue regimes will exist by 2003, if such \ncapabilities do not already exist.\n  It is absurd and irresponsible to continue to deny our citizens \nprotections from a real threat, especially if that protection can be \nprovided for limited cost and is based upon technology which is near \nfruition. I strongly urge my colleagues to see through the myths \nregarding national missile defense and resist any attempts to weaken \nthe commitment of this act to deploying an NMD system.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio, Senator Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, to strike the \n$300 million that was added to the bill by the majority of the Armed \nServices Committee for national missile defense [NMD].\n  The President had requested $371 million for NMD--and the committee \nis proposing virtually to double that amount.\n  I do not believe that sensitive national security and diplomatic \nissues should be allowed to sink into the unruly pit of partisan \npolitics. There have been appropriate lines drawn over the many years \nof this Republic by the various political parties, and I think most of \nus would have to agree that politics should stop at the water's edge \nwhen it comes the most sensitive issues of our national defense and \nsecurity.\n  The language on national missile defense in the bill and the \ncommittee report, however, vaults over this line in a manner that \ninfringes upon the constitutional prerogatives of the Executive in \nforeign policy, drains our Treasury, makes our country less secure, and \nultimately increases international strategic instability.\n  After having to listen to the litany of complaints by the current \nmajority party about tax-and-spend members of my own party, I find it \nironic to see the majority party has now embraced this same tax-and-\nspend doctrine as the Rosetta Stone of that party's entire approach to \nstrategic defense.\n  This is all the more ironic given that the Secretary of Defense, Mr. \nPerry--whose words can surely be taken as nonpartisan on this issue--\nhas stated quite clearly that, ``* * * a valid strategic missile threat \nhas not emerged.'' [Letter of Sen. Nunn, July 28, 1995] These words \necho the sentiments of our intelligence community. Gen. James Clapper, \nthe DIA Director, testified before the Armed Services Committee on \nJanuary 17, 1995, that ``* * * we see no interest in or capability, of \nany new country reaching the continental United States with a long \nrange missile for at least the next decade.''\n  The ABM Treaty authorizes its parties to have a limited national \nmissile defense capability, but the terms of the treaty are quite clear \nabout what is permissible and what is not permissible. The committee \nmajority seems determined to plus-up those programs that will \ninevitably drive us out of that treaty--a result that they earnestly \nbelieve will serve the national security.\n  Yet will it truly serve our security to spend a fortune to erect \nhigh-tech Maginot line defenses of dubious reliability against \nnonexistent threats, while we continue to underfund efforts to address \nclear and present dangers? I am speaking particularly of the challenges \nwe should be facing to prevent proliferation from occurring, as opposed \nto just trying to cope with it after it is a fact of life as the \nmajority evidently prefers to do. Proponents of the current bill seem \nmore eager to prevent Qadhafi from launching a blizzard of nuclear-\ntipped ICBM's at Chicago than in keeping Qadhafi from obtaining the \nnuclear materials he will need to manufacture such warheads in the \nfirst place. Let me say, it would be a much more efficient use of our \nresources to focus our efforts on the latter type of problem. By the \nway, if Qadhafi finally gets enough of that material, he will not need \nto--and probably will prefer not to--attach the United States using \nballistic missiles. There are plenty of other ways to get the job done.\n  Will it serve our security to place in jeopardy the progress that has \nbeen made in recent years in the START process to cut the size of the \nUnited States and Russian nuclear arsenals? If we march forward blindly \ninto the future and eventually abrogate the ABM Treaty, does anybody \nseriously believe that such an action will have no effect on Russia's \nreadiness to proceed with such cuts in its nuclear stockpile?\n  Will it serve our security to drain some $48 billion out of our \nTreasury to build a national missile defense system? That is what the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated it will cost to build a \ncomplex that covered Grand Forks, ND, and five other States. To this we \nmust add billions more for theater missile defense--which these days is \ngetting to look more and more like strategic missile defense. And the \ncosts just keep adding up. We must not forget the long-term costs of \noperating and maintaining such facilities. The legacy we will leave to \nfuture generations from this investment will not be a more secure \ncountry, but a less secure world, and a towering pile of budgetary \nIOU's.\n  Will it serve our security, in deploying an extensive national \nstrategic missile defense network, to drive China, Britain, and France \nout of international negotiations aimed at further nuclear reductions?\n  Will it serve our security to jeopardize the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, which was just extended indefinitely on the basis \nof solemn commitments by the nuclear-weapon states both to conclude an \nearly comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests and new progress on \nnuclear arms control and disarmament?\n  These are just some of my reasons for supporting the Dorgan amendment \ntoday. We are standing on a slippery slope leading to the demise of the \nABM Treaty. The Dorgan amendment merely seeks to remove one large \nbanana peel from that slope. I urge all my colleagues in joining me in \nendorsing his responsible proposal.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the President requested $371 million for \nnational missile defense. That was to do the basic research. And \nsomehow we come along now and want to say we are going to double that \namount; we are going to put another $300 million in here. And for what? \nI do not understand the rationale of this whole thing except it seems \nto me we have reversed parties here almost. Tax and spend, tax and \nspend, tax and spend, that is what we have heard leveled at the \nDemocratic Party all these years. Now, here we are with something that \nis not even needed and we are going to tax and spend, and now it is the \nRepublican tax \n\n[[Page S 11237]]\nand spend. I think that is a valid charge back at the Republicans on \nthis.\n  Tax and spend for what? The Secretary of Defense says that a balanced \nstrategic missile threat has not emerged. General Clapper, DIA \ndirector, testified before the Armed Services Committee, and I quote \nhim:\n\n       We see no interest in or capability of any new country \n     reaching the continental United States with a long-range \n     missile for at least the next decade.\n\n  At the same time we are going to endanger the ABM Treaty, which \nauthorizes its parties to have a limited national missile defense \ncapability--limited. But the terms are quite clear about what is \npermissible and what is not permissible.\n  I do not know why the majority is determined to plus up these \nprograms with something that will take a chance of eventually driving \nus out of that treaty. I think it is ridiculous. Will it really serve \nour security to place in jeopardy the progress that has been made in \nrecent years in the START process to cut the size of the United States \nand Russian nuclear arsenals? If we march forward blindly into the \nfuture and eventually abrogate the ABM Treaty, does anybody seriously \nbelieve such an action will have no effect on Russia's readiness to \nproceed with such cuts in its nuclear stockpile?\n  I just do not see how it is going to serve our security to drain $48 \nbillion--$48 billion--out of our Treasury to build a national missile \ndefense system that is not needed. And that is not my figure. That is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office estimated it will cost to build a \ncomplex that covers Grand Forks, ND, and five other States. That is $48 \nbillion, and it does not even cover the whole country. That does not \neven cover the theater missile defense, which I support.\n  I think it moves in the wrong direction. I do not see that it serves \nour security in deploying an expensive national missile defense network \nto drive China, Britain, and France out of the international \nnegotiations aimed at further nuclear reductions.\n  I am not sure either exactly what kind of system this is. Is this to \nbe an SDI system? The President provided research, and yet we do not \nknow what this system is. At best, it is going to be a $48 billion \noperation just to cover five States. It literally makes no sense \nwhatsoever to take a chance of driving us out of the ABM Treaty when we \nhave no international intercontinental missile defense necessity for \nthis country at this time.\n  Let us do the research the President wanted. Let us continue on down \nthe road with that research, which I favor, voted for it, support \nfully, and if we see a threat developing, we will have time to go to \nwhat this provides prematurely.\n  I know my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, three quick rebuttals. First, to my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio where he quotes General Clapper. \nThere are two fallacies in that argument I say. One, it is predicated \non a startup within a country to build it all the way up. But there are \nopen bids on the free market in this world today from many countries, \nprimarily Iran, Iraq, and others, that would buy a Chinese system which \ncould hit the United States within that lesser period than 10 years. \nAlso, it will take us 10 years to build the very system we are debating \nhere at this point in time. So there is a convergence, Mr. President, \nin time and need for this system.\n  Shifting to another argument from the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, who said it is madness. Well, let me tell you, Mr. \nPresident, a little story of madness. The distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia; myself; the distinguished Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye]; \nand the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] were in Tel \nAviv on February 18, 1991. I remember it very well. It happened, \ncoincidentally, to have been my birthday. We were there in the Defense \nMinistry when a Scud alert was sounded and in a very calm way we \nparticipated with the others in putting on our gas masks. The Scud fell \nsome 2 or 3 miles away. We were not in danger.\n  May I say to my colleagues, when we went out the next morning to \nvisit the community that was struck and to talk to the people, that was \nmadness. That was madness, to see in their faces the attack by Saddam \nHussein for no military reason whatsoever, strictly to use that type of \nweapon as a terrorist weapon, a single strike. Coincidentally, it was \nthe last to fall on Tel Aviv.\n  And I say, Mr. President, that same problem could happen, a single \none as a terrorist weapon to fall on this country, and we have an \nobligation to the people of this country to invest this comparatively \nsmall, modest sum to ensure against that.\n  Mr. NUNN. Would the Senator yield for a brief observation?\n  I remember that evening very well. And I do not want to say this with \nmuch humor. There is not much humorous about anything regarding a Scud \nmissile attack. The Senator said we were not in danger. If the Senator \nwould amend that by saying we were not in danger because the target was \nwhere we were, the Ministry of Defense, and the Scud missiles are \nnotoriously inaccurate. So we were probably in a safe place. But the \ntarget was the Ministry of Defense, we found out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I acknowledge that. I recall, if we want \nto close off on a note of humor, the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nsaid to me, ``Saddam Hussein just sent you a birthday present.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes, thirty seconds. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 1 additional minute to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I want to respond very briefly to my distinguished friend \nfrom Virginia. He is talking about theater missile defense. I am all \nfor theater missile defense.\n  What we are talking about here is starting down a track that if we go \nthis route and violate the ABM Treaty, we have got the Russians at that \npoint of probably putting the coordinates back into their missiles or \nICBM's. We have plenty of time, according to the people that do the \nestimates on these things, for Qadhafi and people like that before they \ndevelop true intercontinental capability. I am all for the theater \nmissile defense that would have taken care of the situation that he is \ntalking about that he was in. But I think when we go down this track of \ntaking a chance of knocking out the ABM Treaty, which this does, if we \ngo ahead with this whole process, then I think we just--the greatest \nlikelihood is we are going to encourage the former Soviets, the \nRussians, to go back on the track of missile activation again. I see \nthat as a real threat. That is an active threat. And I think this is \nfolly to go down that course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will make this real quick.\n  After my remarks, the Senator from North Dakota made a couple of \ncomments. Let me respond to him. First of all, he said we do not have \nany cruise missile defense in this bill. That is a greater threat. Let \nme suggest to you if you read page 119, we have $140 million in here \nfor cruise missile defense. And I hope that no one believes that we \nthink that the missile threat is the only threat to America. There are \nmany other threats that are being addressed.\n  Now, the other thing is that the two Senators from Wisconsin and \nNorth Dakota know very well that the defense budget is not causing the \ndeficit. We always hear about from the big spenders over there, ``Well, \nwe've got to do something about defense.'' The last 11 years our \ndefense budget has declined. And for that period of time for every $1 \nof defense cuts, we have had $2 \n\n[[Page S 11238]]\nof increase in domestic spending. To be specific, in using 1995 \ndollars, in fiscal year 1985 the defense budget was $402 billion. Today \nwe are considering one that is $265 billion.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the way I see this, I do not intend to vote \nfor this amendment. I believe the money that is added here, the $300 \nmillion, which puts this budget back on national missile defense, about \nwhere it was when President Bush left office, I think the money is \nconsistent with a limited thin defense but an effective defense against \nlimited attack against accidental launch or against third countries \nthat may develop a limited capability against the United States. What \nis inconsistent with that is the language in this bill which will be \nthe subject for the next amendment which puts us in a position of \nanticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty, will be read like that in \nRussia, with no reason to be in breach because we do not have any \nprograms in the next fiscal year that would in any way contravene that \ntreaty. So we are going to be paying a huge price for nothing because \nof the language in this bill. So I will not favor the money striking \nbecause the money is needed.\n  I will favor though the amendments that will try to correct this \nlanguage. If this language goes forward as it is, we are going to pay a \nbig price, probably not only in the failure of ratification of START II \nbut also in the Russians not complying or continuing to comply with \nSTART I. So we are buying ourselves perhaps 6,000 or 8,000 warheads \npointed at America by the language in this bill. And I hope people \nrecognize that when we get to the next amendment. But I do not believe \nthe answer is to strike the money which everybody agrees at some point \nwe are going to need some kind of limited defense. The administration \nagrees with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired.\n  Mr. NUNN. Could I get another minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina does not have \nany time.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dorgan's amendment to \neliminate the Armed Services Committee add-on of $300 million for the \nnational missile defense system. If I am not already listed, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The committee funded increase of $300 million is an initial \ndownpayment on what the committee majority advertises as a multisite, \nmultilayered missile defense system designed to protect against a large \nand sophisticated missile attack. The missile defense language in the \nauthorization bill makes clear that the system desired is one that will \nviolate the ABM Treaty and intercept a Soviet-type missile attack. The \n$300 million plus-up in the bill is the first installment of a bill \nthat could grow to a staggering $48 billion cost according to a March \n1995, CBO report. This $48 billion is in addition to the $35 billion we \nhave already spent on missile defense. Let no one misunderstand the \nsignificance of this vote. This is the first of many expensive \ninstallments to resurrect the Star Wars concept.\n  This vote is on a question of priorities. At a time when we are \nsignificantly slashing domestic spending and making tough, painful \nbudgetary choices, it would be irresponsible to add $300 million into a \nsystem concept designed to defend against a threat that does not exist \ntoday and will not exist by the operational deployment date of 1999.\n  I believe we should send a powerful signal to the American public by \napproving the Dorgan amendment and putting the Senate on record that \nthe domestic welfare of our citizens will not be sacrificed on the gold \nplated alter of star wars. This vote is on a question of priorities. We \ncan ill-afford to shrug our shoulders and say ``what is $300 million'' \nat a time when we are asking all Americans to tighten their belts. As I \nsaid earlier, a vote for this $300 million installment is only part of \na lengthy payment plan that will eventually drain our treasury by \nanother $40 to $50 billion. To buy into such a payment plan would be \nthe height of fiscal folly. I urge my colleagues to support the Dorgan \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this \namendment which would severely reduce the funding needed to develop \nmissile defenses. In light of our experiences in the Persian Gulf war, \nand the advanced weapon development programs of hostile countries such \nas Korea, this amendment should be soundly rejected by the Senate.\n  The dangers of leaving our own country unprotected cannot be ignored. \nPerhaps some Senators have forgotten that we had a demonstration of the \ndangers of a ballistic missile attack just a few years ago. The picture \nof an unprotected Israel being hit by Scud missiles chilled the hearts \nof all Americans, but that incident would pale in comparison to the \nconsequences of a nuclear missile strike. It was reported in the news a \nyear ago that the North Koreans vowed to launch missiles at Tokyo \nshould armed conflict occur with South Korea. While their capability to \nlaunch such an attack is questionable, the threat cannot be ignored.\n  It is my understanding that in reaction to this, Japan has approached \nthe Department of Defense to discuss the purchase of our THAAD missile \nsystem. Unfortunately, THAAD will not be ready for deployment until the \nturn of the century. I am sure that if Japan could have anticipated the \nthreat they now face, they would have invested in some type of missile \ndefense system much sooner. As it is, Japan will be vulnerable to North \nKorean blackmail for years to come. They can only hope that North Korea \nnever carries out its threat.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow the United States to be put in such a \nvulnerable position. I firmly believe, however, that the present crisis \nwith North Korea clearly demonstrates that need to continue the \ndevelopment of a national missile defense system. The cost of being \nunprepared to defend ourselves is too great to be ignored.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in defeating this unwise \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the remaining time to myself.\n  Mr. President, this has been a most unusual debate. I see a couple in \nthis chamber who are parents who have no doubt read their children the \nBerenstain Bears books. One of the Berenstain Bear books talks about \nthe ``give me's.'' Talks about ``give me, give me, give me, give me \nthis, give me that, give me this.'' You know, it is interesting to me \nas I read to my children and describe the Berenstain Bears books about \n``give me,'' it reminds me a bit of the folks who come to this floor \nwith every conceivable project, every conceivable program in national \ndefense that is proposed by someone and says--they say, ``We have got \nto build this. We have got to fund it. In fact, we cannot wait. We have \ngot to do it right now.''\n  I asked the question an hour and a half ago, where are you going to \nget the money? Where is the money? The Congressional Budget Office says \nthis will cost $48 billion. I ask, where is the money? Are you going to \ncharge it? Are you going to tax people for it? Where are you going to \nget the money? I have not heard one response in an hour and a half. And \nI know why, because they do not have the foggiest notion where they are \ngoing to get the money. They just have an appetite to spend it and \nbuild this program.\n  Let me end where I began. This is $300 million the Secretary of \nDefense says he does not want, and we do not need, that folks who say \nthey are opposed to the Federal deficit are now insisting we spend. To \ndescribe this as pork is to give hogs a bad name. At least hogs carry \naround a little meat. This is in my judgment pure lard to pay for a \nprogram this country does not need and cannot afford.\n  Now let me respond to a couple of the things that have been said. \nDuring this \n\n[[Page S 11239]]\ndebate it has been said that this national defense program does not \nviolate the ABM Treaty. Supposedly, this does not violate the ABM \nTreaty. How can anyone possibly say that? Of course it violates the ABM \nTreaty. To understand that is only to be able to read. This bill calls \nfor many sites. The ABM Treaty only allows one. This bill calls for \nmore than 100 interceptors. The ABM Treaty limits this Nation to less \nthan 100 interceptors. This bill on page 59 calls for weapons in space. \nThe ABM Treaty forbids weapons in space. Of course this bill violates \nthe ABM Treaty. Let us not debate this issue with that kind of \nrepresentation.\n  This leaves us vulnerable, one speaker said. That what folks want to \ndo is defend France and Israel and leave us vulnerable. There is $371 \nmillion in this bill for ballistic missile defense. I am not touching \nthat.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Has the time expired on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time left.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes, 45 seconds. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina has no time left.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are told by some speakers that our \nintention is to leave American cities vulnerable while at the same time \nwe defend Israel and France and Egypt and others.\n  Total nonsense. There is $371 million in this bill for a ballistic \nmissile defense system. All we want to do is take out the extra $300 \nmillion that was added that the Secretary of Defense says he does not \nwant and that we do not need. That is all we are trying to do.\n  I do not need to hear from folks about the threat to this country. \nNorth Dakota has been ground zero for 40 years. If we seceded from the \nUnion, we would be the third most powerful country in the world--300 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles with Mark-12 warheads, a B-52 base, \nwe had a B-1 base. We understand about ground zero. They built an ABM \nsystem in North Dakota, in fact, the only site in the free world. Spent \nbillions. Within 30 days after it was declared operational, it was \nmothballed. Tell that to the taxpayers.\n  We understand about missiles and bombers and national defense, and we \nunderstand about ground zero. But we also understand about Government \nwaste. We understand it when people say we cannot afford to send kids \nto school; we are going to make it harder for parents to send their \nkids to college; we cannot afford money for the elderly for health \ncare; we simply cannot afford money for nutrition programs; we have to \ntighten our belts.\n  And then the same folks say that it is our priority to add money to a \nsystem that the administration does not need. The Senator from \nLouisiana said this is madness. He is absolutely correct. This makes no \nsense at all. We ought to decide as a Senate what our priorities are. \nThe Senator from Ohio, a decorated combat veteran in service to this \ncountry, stood up and said it the way that it is. Let us build things \nthat are necessary for the defense of this country.\n  I am for a strong defense, but I am not for wasting the taxpayers \nmoney on boondoggles that we do not need and boondoggles that will not \nwork. Let us decide for a change that we mean what we say when we talk \nabout reducing the Federal budget deficit. Let us decide we cannot at \nthis point embark on a new venture, to spend $48 billion on a ballistic \nmissile program, a national defense missile system--yes, Star Wars, \nbecause part of it will be based in space--at a time when we are up to \nour neck in $5 trillion of debt, and when this year we will run a $170 \nbillion deficit.\n  If we have some courage and common sense in this body, we will, in \nthis case, say, ``You can't add $300 million for something this country \ndoesn't need and for something the Secretary of Defense doesn't want. \nTo do so makes no sense.''\n  That is the ultimate threat to this country: That debt, this deficit, \nthis kind of mindless spending. That is the threat to America, and let \nus decide to stand up and finally stop it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nnow expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 2087. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 354 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Campbell\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2087) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment I will send an amendment to the \ndesk which would strike language from the bill which violates the ABM \nTreaty, which establishes unilateral interpretation of the ABM Treaty, \nand which also would tie the President's hands in even discussing the \nABM Treaty with the Russians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, however, that I now be \nallowed to yield the floor to Senator Exon for 10 minutes, and then to \nSenator Baucus for 5 minutes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, may \nI ask the Senator from Michigan, as part of that, will he agree to a \ntime agreement on his amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are trying to see how much time will be required by \nvarious speakers. We are trying to put that together right now. We are \nworking on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, reserving the right to object, following your \namendment, there will be no more amendments on this issue?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I cannot say that; I do not know that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, reserving the right to object, I remind the \nSenator from Michigan, we have now been on this single issue for all \nintents and purposes for 2 days.\n  At this point, we will have thoroughly ventilated the ballistic \nmissile defense issue, and at some point we should acquire a list of \nproposed amendments and be prepared to move forward. I hope it is \npossible we could start reaching some time agreements.\n  The issue is a very important issue. I understand. It is critical. At \nsome point, I think we should move on to other issues. There are other \nMembers who plan on proposing amendments. I hope we can move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make an objection. Reserving the \n\n\n[[Page S 11240]]\nright to object, can I inquire of the Senator whether or not, given the \nsomewhat unusual procedure of asking two Senators be allowed to speak--\nyou now holding the floor--would the Senator include in his request \nthat those desiring to speak will not offer amendments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to do that. It is not my understanding \nthey want to offer amendments.\n  I will modify my amendment. But I also will modify my UC in another \nway.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is it in order for a quorum to be called at \nthis point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry, I did not hear you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it in order for a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it is not. The Senator from Michigan has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object to the unanimous-consent request of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the most dangerous portion of this bill, in \nmy view, is its head-on assault on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. \nThis is not a subtle issue. This is not an issue of interpretation. \nThat is a frontal, head-on assault which says that it is now going to \nbe the policy of the United States----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we have order in the Senate? The \nSenator is making a very important speech. He is entitled to be heard.\n  I make the point of order the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate is not in \norder. Will we remove the conversations, please, from the floor? Will \nwe remove the conversation over here on my left from the floor, please? \nThe Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the language we are going to analyze, that \nis in this bill, directly confronts the ABM Treaty and says it is the \npolicy of the United States--and these are the words of the bill--no \nlonger to abide by the ABM Treaty.\n  It does it in a number of ways throughout this bill, but the way in \nwhich it does it first is by simply stating, in section 233, that ``It \nis the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple site national \nmissile defense system.'' It goes on beyond that in section 233, but \nthat is a very clear statement of what the intention and what the \neffect is, of this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for one second?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to withdraw my objection to the unanimous-\nconsent request of the Senator from Nebraska to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Arizona. While we were going back \nto the unanimous consent, I would like to modify my UC in another way. \nThis relates to the question of how many amendments will there be on \nthis subject.\n  It was my intention originally to offer three different amendments \nstriking the bill in three different places. I believe there has been \nsome discussion between the ranking member and the chairman on this \nsubject. I am not positive. But my amendment strikes language in three \nseparate places and, rather than having three amendments striking three \ndifferent places, since the issue is generally the same, I would modify \nmy unanimous-consent request to make it in order that the amendment \nthat I send to the desk strike three different provisions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator work on a time agreement for that \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are working.\n  Mr. THURMOND. As I understand it, the Senator has one amendment; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have one amendment touching the bill in three different \nplaces rather than having three amendments. This is the only amendment \non ABM that this Senator has. But there are other Senators who may have \nother amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  If he wants to proceed with his unanimous-consent request, I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As modified?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it necessary, \nwhen a unanimous-consent request is made, is it necessary for a Senator \nto reserve the right to object to get the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When a unanimous-consent request is made, the \nSenator making the request retains the floor. Others may ask for a \nright to reserve the right to object at the sufferance of the Senator \nhaving the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But is it necessary for a Senator to be recognized? When \na request is made for a unanimous-consent agreement, is it necessary \nfor the Senator to say ``I reserve the right to object'' in order to \nstate whatever he wishes to state or she wishes to state?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the appropriate process to proceed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my question is, is it necessary?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But it is not necessary, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair says it is an appropriate process.\n  Is there objection now to the UC?\n  If there is confusion here, will the Senator restate his unanimous-\nconsent request, please?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not sure the confusion relates to my unanimous-\nconsent request. I will be happy to restate my unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If you would.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is, I now be allowed to yield the floor for 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Nebraska. Following his 10-minute remarks, \nwithout offering an amendment, that the Senator from Montana be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, and that he is not intending to offer an \namendment. And that, then, I retain my right to the floor.\n  It is now part of the modified UC that it be in order in the \namendment, which I will send to the desk, that it touch the bill in \nthree places.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from \nMichigan, Senator Lott, and others for their cooperation. I would \nsimply say, we have just gone through an exercise in futility, although \nfinally successful. Had the Senator allowed me to proceed, I would have \nbeen almost through with my statement at this time. But at least I \nappreciate the consideration that has been offered by both sides.\n  There has been some criticism about the possibility of redundancy \nwith regard to this authorization bill, particularly with regard to \nballistic missile defenses. I simply say, this is the time to pause, \nthis is the time to reflect, this is the time, if you will, to take \nsome time. Because what we are about, in this authorization bill, is \ngoing to have long-range, possibly serious implications, in the view of \nthis Senator, who has worked on these matters for a long, long time.\n  Later in the day, I believe, probably my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers, will be addressing some of the issues that I will be \naddressing now, and he will probably be referencing a statement that \ncame out of Moscow today with regard to what the Russians are doing and \nnot doing and thinking as we proceed in this area.\n  Certainly, the policies regarding the national security interests of \nthe United States should not be dictated by Moscow. But certainly, \nsince we are talking about the possible violation if not the outright \nviolation of treaties that we are a party to and a part of, we are \ntalking about serious business here. And whatever redundancy is \nnecessary to get that message across should be the order of the day.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer my thoughts on the fiscal year 1996 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Rarely in my 17 years in the U.S. \nSenate have I come to the floor to take issue with a Defense \nauthorization bill reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nAs a member of the committee, I have usually been satisfied that the \nreported bill was the product of a bipartisan effort to further advance \nour national security objectives. \n\n[[Page S 11241]]\nTo my dismay, the content and philosophy embodied in this year's bill \nis a significant departure from those of previous years. Crafted with \nlittle bipartisan consultation, the bill reported out of the committee \nrepresents a regrettable and potentially harmful U-turn in our national \nsecurity policy that will, unless corrected, return the United States \nto the confrontational cold war policies of the 1980's that predated \nthe fall of the Soviet Empire.\n  While much in the committee bill is laudable and will greatly enhance \nthe readiness and capabilities of our Armed Services, I am fearful that \nthese constructive elements of the authorization bill will be offset by \nmisguided efforts to defend against threats that do not exist and \nhostile attempts to scuttle international agreements intended to \nenhance our security through peaceful means. As originally drafted--I \nemphasize ``originally drafted''--in the Armed Services Committee, this \nbill attempted to: abolish the Department of Energy; gut the \ncooperative threat reduction program responsible for the removal of \nthousands of Russian nuclear warheads from their missiles; prevent the \nadministration from carrying out a number of important nuclear non-\nproliferation agreements relative to North Korea and the former Soviet \nUnion, and purchase unwanted B-2 bombers at a potential cost totaling \ntens of billions of dollars.\n  While the majority of the Armed Services Committee was successful in \noverturning these and other astonishing hardline recommendations, many \nprovisions remain in the reported bill that will return us to the cold \nwar mentality of yesteryear. Among the most objectionable of these \nreversals are bill provisions that: advocate violation of the \nantiballistic missile treaty; as has been briefly addressed and will be \naddressed more so by the Senator from Michigan on an amendment that I \nam a cosponsor of.\n  Add over $500 million in star wars missile defense funding; endanger \nratification of the Start II Treaty, and resurrect at least two \nbattleships.\n  Let me repeat that because this is an old battle that this Senator \nhas carried on against unneeded, unwanted, and useless battleships.\n  It resurrects at least two battleships at a cost of nearly a $0.5 \nmillion a year with untold future modernization and operations costs; \nand, mandates the resumption of nuclear weapons testing.\n  These are just a few of the things that I think are terribly wrong \nwith this bill.\n  The defense authorization bill is rife with legislative initiatives \nand reshuffled spending priorities intent on rekindling an arms bazaar \nthat will have both domestic and international repercussions. The bill \nincludes $7 billion--let more repeat that this bill includes $7 \nbillion--in additional spending above the administration's request, a \nlarge majority of which has been siphoned off for the purchase of \nships, planes, trucks, and other weapons not requested by the Pentagon. \nThe so-called readiness debate we used to hear so much about is dead \nafter only a year. The real winners in the committee reported bill are \nthe defense contractors who stand to receive billions of dollars in \nunexpected weapons buys.\n  While our domestic spending accounts are being squeezed tighter and \ntighter--and while the polls are showing very clearly that with all the \nhoopla the standing in the public with the newly created Congress is \ngoing down and down. The people are catching on.\n  So I emphasize again, Mr. President, while our domestic accounts are \nbeing squeezed tighter and tighter, this bill contains a Christmas list \nor unexpected gifts for home State contractors that carry staggering \nprice tags: $770 million more for missile defense contracts; a $650 \nmillion downpayment for two more DDG-51 destroyers; $1.3 billion for \nthe unrequested LHD-7 assault ship; 12 more F-18's than asked for and \nthe list goes on. Add in to this mix a committee initiative \nestablishing a loan guarantee program for defense contractors to export \ntheir weapons overseas and you can understand why defense contractors \nthroughout the country are popping champagne corks: Christmas has \nindeed come early.\n  But the bill to the taxpayer is not complete at the committee passed \nauthorization of $264.7 billion. There is a built-in cost overrun. In \nthe rush to fund these and other unrequested multibillion dollar \nweapons, the committee majority did not fund the anticipated expenses \nfor ongoing Department of Defense operations in Iraq and Bosnia. This \noutstanding bill, the cost of which will in the mean time come out of \nPentagon operation accounts, will come due next year and I warn my \ncolleagues to not be surprised when this $1.2 billion expense is funded \nin part by more domestic spending cuts. Ironically, this built-in cost \noverrun is nearly identical to the cost of the LHD-7 add-on. I would \nhope that the Senate will reconsider this issue during floor debate and \ndecide to place the operations funding of our troops in the field \noverseas above the cost of building an unneeded naval vessel.\n  While the funding priorities in this bill are questionable to say the \nleast, there should be no doubt as to the design and effect of the bill \non arms control and international relations. The defense authorization \nbill before the Senate takes aim at scuttling the ABM Treaty by \nrequiring that the United\n States break out of the treaty and deploy a multiple site national \nmissile defense system by 2003. Caught in the cross hairs of the \ncommittee's aim is the START II Treaty as well. Although this arms \ncontrol agreement is a good deal for the United States as well as \nglobal security, the defense authorization bill does its best to see \nthat it is killed in the cradle. That is precisely what will happen if \nthe bill provision to break out of the ABM Treaty is approved. \nRatification of START II will be blocked by the Russian Duma and the \nnew alliance between our two countries will, in turn, be irreparably \ndamaged, thrown into a resumption of the cold war, and still higher \ndefense budgets. The bill is filled with jabs at Moscow designed to \ncreate distrust toward the United States and harm our new alliance. As \nif breaking out of the ABM Treaty and derailing START II Treaty \nratification is not enough, the bill adds $30 million for a new \nantisatellite weapons program, it attacks and limits the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram that has been responsible for the safe and accountable \ndisarming of over 2,500 former Soviet nuclear warheads, it cuts Energy \nDepartment nonproliferation, arms control, and verification funding, it \nrecommends reconstituting our nuclear weapons manufacturing complex at \nuntold billions of dollars while at the same time advocating the \nresumption of U.S. nuclear weapons testing. This last committee \ninitiative is contrary to U.S. policy and is designed to scuttle \nongoing comprehensive test ban negotiations and any prospect of \nreaching a treaty agreement. I will have a great deal more to say about \nthe issue of nuclear testing later on during the consideration of this \nbill.\n\n  In summary, I am concerned with the tone and substance of the bill. \nThe level of micromanagement placed on the Pentagon and the Department \nof Energy is unprecedented and harmful to our Nation's standing in the \ninternational community. Many of the committee initiatives are driven \nby a desire to defend against a superpower threat to U.S. security that \nsimply does not exist. At a time when our one-time enemies are now \nallies and the world community is committed more than ever before to \nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts, the committee bill is at odds \nwith reality and in strong need of amendment before it can properly \nserve our Nation's security interests.\n  At a time when American leadership in the world community is strongly \nneeded, we cannot be viewed as a nation living in the past, jousting \nwith imaginary dragons in order to lay claim to the mantle of being \n``strong on defense.'' We are a strong country, the preeminent military \npower in the world by far. But we must also be forward looking and \nrecognize that it is in our national interest as well as in the \ninterest of other nations to encourage arms control and alliances based \non collective security. It is unfortunate that some feel more \ncomfortable in an adversarial environment than in one based on \ncooperation and a lowering of superpower antagonism.\n  Like a beehive, the world in 1995 has the capacity to be both \ndangerous and peaceful. If handled properly, the hive can be benign and \ncapable of producing sweet honey. If agitated, however, it can become \nhostile and threatening. The defense authorization bill in its present \nform is a sharp stick ready to be jabbed into the hive. The design and \n\n[[Page S 11242]]\nintent of the bill is to agitate the world community to the ultimate \ndetriment of ourselves. This is not the time in history to rekindle the \nrhetoric of the cold war. I urge my colleagues to support amendments \nthat will correct these and other self-defeating elements of this \nflawed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                  Vietnam Moving Wall Opening Ceremony\n\n  Mr. President, this morning, the Vietnam Moving Wall--the portable \nreplica of the Vietnam War Memorial--came to Bozeman, MT. I would like \nto offer my thanks and congratulations to retired Col. Ron Glock and \nJim Caird for their hard work in making it all happen, and say a few \nwords in honor of this solemn occasion.\n  Walls generally divide people. But this wall unites us. It unites us, \nas Montanans and Americans, in reverence and gratitude to the Americans \nwho gave their lives in Vietnam.\n  The Vietnam War Memorial allows people to touch the names of their \nfriends and their relatives, and remember those individuals who touched \nour lives so deeply. And the Moving Wall, as it travels our country, \nallows each of us to honor their lives and their gifts, and remember \nthe lessons of history.\n  The young people who were born after the war--many of them now \nentering adulthood--have a chance to experience and understand the \nmagnitude of a war where we lost over 50,000 Americans.\n  The families and comrades in arms see their brothers, fathers, and \nfriends given the honor which is their due.\n  And we all learn again the lesson of the cost of war.\n  So today we come together to honor and remember all those we lost in \nVietnam, and in particular those who went off to war from Bozeman and \nMontana State and whose names we can read on the Wall today:\n  David Jay Allison, Jack Herbert Anderson, Alan Frederick Ashall, \nRichard DeWyatt Clark, Air Force Capt.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan retains the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a head-on assault on the ABM Treaty. \nThere is nothing subtle about it. Unlike our existing policy which \npermits us to consider whether or not we wish to withdraw from the \ntreaty at the appropriate time, if and when there is a threat and after \nwe have done the research and development to see how much it would cost \nto put up a national defense and after we have gathered together the \ninformation that we need and the impacts that we need in order to make \nthat decision on a reasonable basis, this bill decides now that it is \nthe policy of the United States to pull out of the ABM Treaty. It makes \nno bones about it. The language of section 233 says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple-\n     site national missile defense system.\n\n  That is a clear breach of the ABM Treaty. Article III of the ABM \nTreaty says:\n\n       Each party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems at more \n     than one site.\n\n  The ABM Treaty has permitted us to do a number of things. First, it \nis permitting arms reduction in offensive weapons. Without the ABM \nTreaty, the Russians are not going to be reducing their offensive \nweapons, as they have agreed to in START I and we hope they will ratify \nin START II. That process is going to be ended because if they are \ngoing to be facing missile defenses, they are going to be increasing \nthe number of offensive weapons rather than decreasing the number of \noffensive weapons.\n  They have told us that. So the ABM Treaty has allowed us to do the \nmost important single thing we are probably doing right now in the \nnuclear strategic world, which is to reduce the number of offensive \nnuclear weapons.\n  The ABM Treaty has also allowed us to avoid a defensive arms race, \nwhere a defense is installed and there is a countermeasure to the \ndefense, and then there is a counter-countermeasure to the defense, and \nthen there is a counter-counter-counter, and on and on ad infinitum.\n  But first and foremost, what is going on right now is the dramatic \nreduction of offensive arms, and we have been told by the Russians--and \nI am going to read from General Shalikashvili's letter in just a moment \nabout how seriously he takes this issue--they are going to stop the \nreduction of offensive arms and forget the ratification of START II.\n  That is what the stakes are in this discussion. This is not some \ntheoretical discussion about defenses. This is a premature decision to \ndestroy a treaty which is allowing us now as we speak to reduce the \nnumber of offensive weapons that threaten us, that face us, that are \naimed at us now.\n  The bill also States in section 235 that to implement the policy that \nI just read in section 233:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall develop an . . . \n     operationally effective national missile defense system which \n     will attain initial operating capability by the end of the \n     year 2003.\n       It shall be developed in a way which includes ground-based \n     interceptors deployed at multiple sites.\n\n  There we go again with the multiple-site breach of the ABM Treaty. \nSection 235 also provides for an interim operational capability. It is \nall laid out very specifically as to the deployment schedule for the \nABM system.\n  Now, this is a head-on collision. This again is not like our current \nlaw provides, that we are going to continue to do research and \ndevelopment on nationwide defenses, on strategic missile defenses. This \nbill decides now that it is the policy to deploy such a system before \nwe have done the research and development and before we have concluded \nour negotiations with the Russians in an effort to make such a \nnationwide defense system permissible under an amended treaty.\n  This is not a question of interpretation. This is the head-on clash, \nthis is the trashing of the ABM Treaty. This is the establishing of a \npolicy now to pull out of the ABM Treaty. I cannot think of anything \nmuch more shortsighted than this. It is a provocative move to commit \nourselves now to deploy an illegal national defense system, the ABM \nTreaty be damned. This is going to wreck the START treaty which was a \nlandmark arms reduction treaty which was achieved by President Bush, \nand it is going to spark a buildup of offensive weapons instead of the \nreduction of offensive weapons which we have been trying to achieve.\n  Now, General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, wrote me the following on June 28:\n\n       While we believe that START II is in both countries' \n     interests regardless of other events, we must assume such \n     unilateral U.S. legislation could harm prospects for START II \n     ratification by the Duma and probably impact our broader \n     security relationship with Russia as well.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense has weighed in in strong opposition to these \nmissile defense provisions saying, in a letter to Senator Nunn dated \nJuly 28:\n\n       These provisions would put us on a pathway to abrogate the \n     ABM Treaty. The bill's provisions would add nothing to the \n     DOD's ability to pursue our missile defense programs and \n     would needlessly cause us to incur excess costs and serious \n     security risks.\n\n  Secretary Perry's letter continues as follows:\n       . . . certain provisions related to the ABM Treaty would be \n     very damaging to U.S. security interests. By mandating \n     actions that would lead us to violate or disregard U.S. \n     Treaty obligations--such as establishing a deployment date of \n     a multiple-site NMD system [national missile defense \n     system]--the bill would jeopardize Russian implementation of \n     the Start I and Start II Treaties, which involve the \n     elimination of many thousands of strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n\n[[Page S 11243]]\n\n  And Secretary Perry's letter went on to say the following:\n\n       The bill's unwarranted imposition, through funding \n     restrictions, of a unilateral ABM/TMD demarcation \n     interpretation would similarly jeopardize these reductions, \n     and would raise significant international legal issues as \n     well as fundamental constitutional issues regarding the \n     President's authority over the conduct of foreign affairs.\n\n  And he concluded as follows in his recent letter to Senator Nunn:\n\n       Unless these provisions are eliminated or significantly \n     modified, they threaten to undermine fundamental national \n     security interests of the United States.\n\n  That is pretty strong language. Here is the Secretary of Defense, \ntelling us this language, unless it is eliminated or significantly \nmodified, will ``* * * threaten to undermine fundamental national \nsecurity interests of the United States.''\n  Not only would this committee decision to deploy missile defenses \ndestroy a treaty which has been a cornerstone of global nuclear arms \ncontrol for over 20 years, it would increase the threat to the United \nStates by leaving more nuclear weapons pointed at us and it would, in \naddition, poison our relationship with Russia, a relationship which is \nimproving and beginning to stabilize. Now, why do we want to risk that? \nWhy do we want to hand the hard-liners in the Russian Duma an excuse to \nblock the ratification of the Start II Treaty and resume an offensive \narms race, instead of continuing and accelerating the dismantlement of \nnuclear strategic weapons? There is no new threat of massive nuclear \nmissile attack on the continental United States requiring a decision \nnow to pull out of the ABM Treaty.\n  The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Clapper, \nsaid:\n\n       We see no interest in or capability of any new country \n     reaching the continental United States with a long range \n     missile for at least the next decade.\n\n  For several years, we have had a bipartisan consensus in Congress for \ncontinuing research on national missile defense that is consistent with \nthe ABM Treaty. We have had a consensus that we should preserve the \noption to decide later to deploy a national missile defense system if \nthe threat increases or if it proves financially feasible, or both. At \nthe same time, we have had a national or bipartisan consensus that we \nshould seek ABM Treaty understandings or changes that are mutually \nagreeable between the United States and Russia, and we should be doing \nthese things simultaneously. We should be doing research and \ndevelopment of national missile defenses. We should be seeking \nunderstandings and modifications of the ABM Treaty while these research \nactivities are continuing, and we should keep the option open when the \ntime comes to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n  This bill before us breaks that bipartisan consensus, and instead \ndecides now that it is the policy of the United States to trash the ABM \nTreaty and to withdraw from it. This bill commits us to meet a \ndeployment program that is simply reckless because it is so \nintentionally provocative to the Russians without any military benefit \nto us because our present program is unconstrained by the ABM Treaty. \nWhat we are doing now in missile defense research is unconstrained by \nthe treaty.\n  We do not need to make this decision now to trash a treaty which is \nallowing us to reduce the number of offensive weapons that threaten us. \nThat is what is so reckless about this language. It prematurely commits \nus to a course of action which we need not take now and maybe never \nneed to take. We do not know that.\n  We have had a bipartisan consensus to keep an option open. This wipes \nout that bipartisan consensus. Now, there is another provision in this \nbill which is threatening to our security in the eyes of Secretary \nPerry, and that is the one that sets a demarcation line between short-\nrange and long-range missiles. Defenses against the former are \npermitted. Defenses against the long-range missiles are not.\n  What is the demarcation line? What is the range? We have been trying \nto negotiate that with the Russians as to what is the precise line \nbetween a short-range missile and a long-range missile. We put a \nproposal down on the table which we hope is going to be adopted. This \nbill incorporates our proposal as U.S. law.\n  We, in this bill, unilaterally adopt the proposal that the \nadministration is making at a negotiating session and saying they \ncannot deviate from their proposal. Now, that is a rather unusual way \nto negotiate: You are sitting down with the other side, trying to reach \nan agreement, and your Congress back there unilaterally puts into \ndomestic law what your first proposal is. Now, what would we think if \nthe Duma did the same thing? We say we would like a range of 3,500 \nkilometers and the Duma says, unilaterally, the ABM Treaty means a \nrange of 3,000 kilometers. Now, what would our reaction be? We are \nsitting at a negotiating table with the Russians, trying to figure out \na demarcation line, and the Russians unilaterally make their own \ninterpretation and make it their law, and tell their President he \ncannot deviate from that law. He cannot even sit down with the \nAmericans to talk about it. He cannot even listen.\n  Under this bill, the President's people are not even allowed to \nlisten to a Russian proposal because that would involve the expenditure \nof funds; that is, travel funds. So you can kiss goodbye those \nnegotiations. And, by the way, the language in this bill says it is the \nsense of the Senate that the President cease all negotiations for a \nyear. That is just sense-of-the-Senate language. But there is the power \nof the purse that is used here to prevent the President or the \nPresident's people from implementing any Presidential policy relative \nto the ABM Treaty. Negotiations to set a demarcation line are over.\n  Now, this is a country that has thousands of nuclear weapons that we \nhave been in a cold war with, that we are trying to improve our \nrelationship with, and we have had some real successes. And now we put \none stick, two sticks, three sticks right in their eyes. For what? A \nnew threat? Has our research carried us to the point where we now can \neven make a decision as to whether we can effectively and cost-\nefficiently deploy such a system? We are not at that point now.\n  The ABM Treaty does not constrain our research and development. That \nis why Secretary Perry said that the bill's unwarranted imposition \nthrough funding restrictions of a unilateral demarcation interpretation \nwould jeopardize these reductions and would raise significant \ninternational legal issues, as well as fundamental constitutional \nissues regarding the President's authority over the conduct of foreign \naffairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters from General \nShalikashvili and Secretary Perry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin. Thank you for your letter and the \n     opportunity to express my views concerning the impact of \n     Senator Warner's proposed language for the FY 1996 Defense \n     Authorization Bill on current theater missile defense (TMD) \n     programs.\n       Because the Russians have repeatedly linked the ABM Treaty \n     with other arms control issues--particularly ratification of \n     START II now before the Duma--we cannot assume they would \n     deal in isolation with unilateral US legislation detailing \n     technical parameters for ABM Treaty interpretation. While we \n     believe that START II is in both countries' interests \n     regardless of other events, we must assume such unilateral US \n     legislation could harm prospect for START II ratification by \n     the Duma and probably impact our broader security \n     relationship with Russia as well.\n       We are continuing to work on TMD systems. The ongoing \n     testing of THAAD through the demonstration/validation program \n     has been certified ABM Treaty complaint as has the Navy Upper \n     Tier program. Thus, progress on these programs is not \n     restricted by the lack of a demarcation agreement. We have no \n     plans and do not desire to test THAAD or other TMD systems in \n     an ABM mode.\n       Even though testing and development of TMD systems is \n     underway now, we believe it is useful to continue discussions \n     with the Russians to seek resolution of the ABM/TMD issue in \n     a way which preserves our security equities. Were such \n     dialogue to be prohibited, we might eventually find ourselves \n     forced to choose between giving up elements of our TMD \n     development programs or proceeding unilaterally in a manner \n     which could undermine the ABM Treaty and our broader security \n     relationship with Russia. Either alternative would impose \n     security \n\n[[Page S 11244]]\n     costs and risks which we are seeking to avoid.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn:  I write to register my strong \n     opposition to the missile defense provisions of the SASC's \n     Defense Authorization bill, which would institute \n     Congressional micromanagement of the Administration's missile \n     defense program and put us on a pathway to abrogate the ABM \n     Treaty. The Administration is committed to respond to \n     ballistic missile threats to our forces, allies, and \n     territory. We will not permit the capability of the defenses \n     we field to meet those threats to be compromised.\n       The bill's provisions would add nothing to DoD's ability to \n     pursue our missile defense programs, and would needlessly \n     cause us to incur excess costs and serious security risks. \n     The bill would require the U.S. to make a decision now on \n     developing a specific national missile defense for deployment \n     by 2003, with interim operational capability in 1999, despite \n     the fact that a valid strategic missile threat has not \n     emerged. Our NMD program is designed to give us the \n     capability for a deployment decision in three years, when we \n     will be in a much better position to assess the threat and \n     deploy the most technologically advanced systems available. \n     The bill would also terminate valuable elements of our TMD \n     program, the Boost Phase Intercept and MEADS/Corps SAM \n     systems. MEADS is not only a valuable defense system but is \n     an important test of future trans-Atlantic defense \n     cooperation.\n       In addition, certain provisions related to the ABM Treaty \n     would be very damaging to U.S. security interests. By \n     mandating actions that would lead us to violate or disregard \n     U.S. Treaty obligations--such as establishing a deployment \n     date of a multiple-site NMD system--the bill would jeopardize \n     Russian implementation of the START I and START II Treaties, \n     which involve the elimination of many thousands of strategic \n     nuclear weapons. The bill's unwarranted imposition, through \n     funding restrictions, of a unilateral ABM/TMD demarcation \n     interpretation would similarly jeopardize these reductions, \n     and would raise significant international legal issues as \n     well as fundamental constitutional issues regarding the \n     President's authority over the conduct of foreign affairs. \n     These serious consequences argue for conducting the proposed \n     Senate review of the ABM Treaty before considering such \n     drastic and far-reaching measures.\n       Unless these provisions are eliminated or significantly \n     modified, they threaten to undermine fundamental national \n     security interests of the United States. I will continue to \n     do everything possible to work with the Senate to see that \n     these priorities are not compromised.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William J. Perry.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill does not stop there.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question, or \ndoes he prefer to finish.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been listening with great interest \nto the Senator's comments, and I find them enormously persuasive.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that these negotiations on SALT I and \nSALT II have been worked out in a very comprehensive way by Republican \nPresidents, Democratic Congresses, Joint Chiefs of Staffs, Secretaries \nof Defense? They were all negotiated not just as a way of trying to \nease some pressure on the Soviet Union, but were negotiated because \nthey were considered to be in the United States national security \ninterest. It was Republicans and Democrats alike, after debate and \ndiscussion in the course of the hearings with the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee, and over a very difficult \nand complex period of time, as to the nature of the relationship \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and that these were put \ninto place because the leaders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nleaders of our military establishment, the Secretaries of Defense, the \nSecretaries of State, Presidents of the United States--Republican in \nthese instances in terms of the SALT agreements--believed that they \nwere in our national security interest.\n  As I understand from the Senator's excellent presentation, just by \nreviewing the particular words and phrases that are included in the \ndefense authorization bill, the provisions that are included in the \nlegislation, that this is effectively saying that a majority, in this \ncase probably in terms of the vote, are expressing a counterview; that \nsomehow they have better knowledge of the security interests and the \nnature of the nuclear threat to the American people than that long-term \nnegotiating process that took place by those who were very sensitive to \nthe security interests, the role of the United States and the \nrelationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n  Can the Senator comment briefly on the historic context? I found very \npersuasive the particular details.\n  Second, does the Senator from Michigan, if he assumes that all of \nthis was done in our security interest, believe that this is an \nextraordinary action on the floor of the U.S. Senate, when we are \nhaving our challenge in our relationship between China and the United \nStates--we recently have heard about two military officers who were \nactually arrested in China; we have the tragic circumstances around Mr. \nWu who has been apprehended, and the human rights violations--a range \nof different challenges that we are having with one of the other great \nworld powers, China?\n  Our Secretary of State is involved in trying to work out at least \nsome kind of modus operandi with the Chinese. As a student of history \nand as one of the leaders in the U.S. Senate on the whole issue of arms \ncontrol policy, does the Senator from Michigan feel that we should be \nunilaterally abrogating the solemn treaty of the United States with the \nSoviet Union on nuclear weapons that will certainly, in a very \nsignificant way, put in serious threat our relations with the Soviet \nUnion? Does this make any sense?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is right. The Secretary of State has written a \nletter to Senator Nunn dated August 2, which I also want to print in \nthe Record, which addresses the questions which the Senator from \nMassachusetts has raised.\n  These arms reduction treaties, starting with the ABM Treaty, which is \nlimiting arms, and then going to START I and START II--START II is \nbefore us now, supported by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--these have been negotiated by Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike. These are not partisan treaties.\n  President Nixon is the one who negotiated the ABM Treaty. This is a \nRepublican President who strongly believed that the ABM Treaty was in \nour security interest, and I believe every single President since has \nsupported keeping the ABM Treaty, modifying it at times. We have had \nprotocols to it, we have had interpretations to it, but it has allowed \nus to reduce offensive arms. So it has had broad bipartisan support in \nadministration after administration.\n  The Secretary of State points that out when he says in his letter to \nSenator Nunn that ``successive administrations have supported the \ncontinued viability of the ABM Treaty as the best way to preserve and \nenhance our national security.'' And the Secretary of State points out \nthat these unilateral interpretations ``would immediately call into \nquestion the commitment to the treaty and have a negative impact on \nUnited States-Russian relations and on Russian implementation of the \nSTART I Treaty and Russian ratification of the START II Treaty.''\n  The START II Treaty is going to come to the floor of the Senate one \nof these days, I understand with the support of the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, negotiated by a Republican President. It \nallows us to significantly reduce, dramatically reduce, the number of \noffensive nuclear weapons which we face.\n  We are told by General Shalikashvili and Secretary Perry that for us \nto trash the ABM Treaty will threaten the ratification of the START II \nTreaty. It makes absolutely no sense in terms of the bipartisan \nconsensus which has been put together for these treaties over the years \nand in terms of reducing the number of offensive weapons. So I agree \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator's conclusion be that should the \nviolation of the ABM Treaty--and I think the Senator has made that case \nboth with regard to the multiple-site issue and also for the unilateral \ndeclaration on the theater and strategic systems, which are in the \nprocess of being negotiated, and the unilateral action or statement or \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, that as far as our chairman of our \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, according to \n\n[[Page S 11245]]\nthe President of the United States as well as the Secretary of State--\nthose who have responsibility in the nature of both defense policy in \nthis area and diplomacy--that the counteraction will be an action by \nthe Soviet Union which will result in more nuclear missiles being \npointed toward the United States, there will be more nuclear missiles \npointed to the cities in my State, there will be more nuclear missiles \npointed to cities in the Senator's State, and that there will be less \nsecurity in terms of the citizens of our Nation from the dangers of \nnuclear war?\n  Finally, let me just ask the Senator, how does the whole Nunn-Lugar \neffort fit into this whole process? We have been involved in the very \nrecent times with a bipartisan effort to try and help and assist the \ndismantling of Soviet weapons systems. For the obvious reason, as the \nSenator and others have pointed out, we believe that kind of reduction \nis in our security interest.\n  There have been difficulties in terms of the expenditure of funds and \nother factors which I know that the Armed Services Committee and DOD \nare interested in. The Congress has been reviewing that effort in terms \nof trying to see further action in the dismantling of nuclear weapons.\n  Does he think that this kind of unilateral action will enhance that \nwhole kind of effort for further dismantlement, or does the Senator \nbelieve that whole effort will be undermined in a significant way as \nwell?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Nunn-Lugar effort is totally undermined, \nbecause instead of being willing to dismantle weapons, which Nunn-Lugar \nhelps them achieve, our best experts in the State Department, the \nDefense Department say they are going to go the other way, they are \ngoing to stop the dismantlement and stop the ratification of START II, \nbecause now they are going to be told by the U.S. Senate that it is the \nAmerican policy to put up defenses to their weapons, and that means in \norder for whatever they have left after START II to be effective, they \nare going to have to have more, not less, in order to overcome whatever \ndefense.\n  This is a very threatening thing, we have to understand, to us. This \nis a threat to our security, what is going on in this bill language, \nbecause instead of seeing offensive weapons aimed at our States \ncontinuing to be reduced, the numbers of those weapons are suddenly \ngoing to go up instead of down. At a minimum, we are going to see the \ntermination of these dramatic reductions which we have been able to \nachieve under START I and START II.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator has further comments to make, but I \nwant to ask him, as I understand the situation we are facing in the \nSoviet Union--we are facing local elections that are going to be taking \nplace in the next year.\n It is also a commitment in terms of the Presidential election which is \nto take place next year--there is movement in terms of the Soviet Union \nand, as I understand it, in terms of the political process and activity \nof increasing involvement and intensity and increasing United States \ninvestments.\n\n  Obviously, there are the creaking problems of a new nation finding \nitself in terms of trying to develop democratic institutions in that \nnation. Does the Senator, as someone who is a student both of the \nSoviet Union and the recent history of this time, does he think that \nthis will help to stabilize the nature of the political discussion in \nthe Soviet Union? As he has pointed out, the reduction of these nuclear \narms was done because we believed they were in the security interests \nof the United States. As the Senator pointed out, if we take this \naction, that will be threatened.\n  Does he believe, as well, that if the Soviet Union did this action to \nthe United States, there could be a counteracting reaction here in the \nSenate and among the American people? Does he anticipate that this may \nvery well have some factor and force in terms of the domestic politics \nand defense politics of the Soviet Union?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This unilateral action in setting the dividing line \nbetween short-range and long-range missiles, which has been subject of \nthe negotiations, suddenly is yanked out from those negotiations, the \nU.S. Senate usurps this and puts into American law what it believes the \ndemarcation line is and prohibits the President from negotiating any \nother demarcation line. At the same time, we establish the policy of \nthe United States to deploy a system which clearly violates the ABM \nTreaty.\n  Doing those things will play into the hands of the most rabid, anti-\nWestern political forces in Russia. We are going to pay a terrible \nprice, not just in having more weapons face our States, we are also \ngoing to pay a terrible price in terms of lending unwitting support to \nthe very anti-Western forces in Russia which are creating so much \ndifficulty already, not just for Russia, but for the rest of the world.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, the Senator spent a great deal of time in \nrecent years, along with others, in terms of the meaning of the ABM \nTreaty. I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. All of us were \nenormously impressed during the 1980's and 1990's when the ABM Treaty \nissue and related issues were being reviewed as to the meaning. I think \nall of us who followed this whole issue in terms of arms control and \nthe ABM Treaty are very mindful of the expertise which the Senator from \nMichigan has.\n  I hope at some time during the debate that at least included in this \nrecord, there will be some references to that review and that study, so \nthat those that may be newer Members of this body can have some \nappreciation for the extensiveness and the depth of the hearings that \nwere held on the meaning and significance of the ABM Treaty, which was \nchallenged and reviewed and reviewed. So that the presentation will be \ngiven the weight that it should have. I think some reference or \nincorporation of some past discussion of that history is important for \nthe understanding of the Senators.\n  I thank the Senator. I hope that our colleagues listen carefully to \nthe excellent presentation. I find it absolutely persuasive. We have \nnot gotten into if the Soviet Union takes corresponding action, what \nwill be the corresponding action here in the United States. I think \nanybody who has followed the arms issue with the Soviet Union can \npredict that very easily and with certainty, not only with the cost but \nthe instability that will be brought about.\n  So I thank the Senator. I think it has been a very important \npresentation. I think, in many respects, this may very well be either \nthe first or second most important vote that we will have this year. I \nhope our colleagues give it attention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He reminds us that \nwe had a debate here, and there was an effort made by Senator Nunn and \nmyself, and many others, to avoid a unilateral reinterpretation of the \nABM Treaty during the 1980's. This Senate has had a long history in not \nundermining treaties or not undermining chief executives who are aimed \nat negotiating treaties. We have an advise-and-consent function that is \nvery different from putting into American law unilateral \ninterpretations and prohibiting Presidents from even negotiating \nrelative to treaties.\n  Senator Nunn's leadership during the 1980's on the whole ABM issue--\nand the Senator from Massachusetts was correct, he was deeply involved \nin it, as well--was part of a long-time bipartisan effort, generally, \non the part of the Senate to avoid this kind of unilateral \ninterpretation of treaties being put into American law and undermining \nthe executive branch in their negotiating function, as well.\n  Now, Mr. President, the language in this bill, by saying that \n``appropriated funds may not be obligated or expended by any official \nfor the purpose of implementing any executive policy that would apply \nthe ABM Treaty to the research, development, or deployment of a missile \ndefense,'' means the President and the President's representatives \ncannot even listen at a negotiation. They cannot even use travel money. \n``Appropriated funds are prohibited here from being obligated or \nexpended by any official for the purpose of implementing an executive \npolicy that would apply the ABM Treaty to the deployment of a missile \ndefense.''\n  That is section 238(b). In another subsection: ``Or from taking any \nother action to provide for the ABM Treaty to be applied to the \ndeployment of the missile defense.''\n  That is what the ABM Treaty is all about. \n\n[[Page S 11246]]\n\n  So this language does three things. First, it unilaterally says what \nthe demarcation is between short-range and long-range, and makes that \nthe law of the United States. It prohibits the President of the United \nStates from negotiating anything other than that. He cannot even listen \nto anything other than that.\n  It does one other thing. This is some of the most, I think, extreme \nlanguage I have read in any bill, almost on any subject that has come \nto the floor because, under this language, if there were a test that \nviolated this definition of a long-range system, nobody could act to \nstop it, because it says here that ``appropriated funds may not be \nexpended by any official to implement any policy that applies the U.N. \ntreaty to the deployment of a missile defense.''\n  What happens if you have a test here of an ABM system against a \nmissile with a range of 4,000 kilometers, clearly in violation of the \ndemarcation line, by this new demarcation line. Under this language, \nuntil the test is completed, the prohibition on the use of any funds to \nstop that test stands.\n  This language says that ``unless and until there is an ABM qualifying \nflight test of a system, this prohibition stands.''\n  This language goes so far as to say that even if there is going to be \na flight test of an ABM system against a missile, with a range that \nclearly violates this unilateral declaration, that nobody can stop that \nillegal action on our part, which is admittedly illegal under this \nunilateral definition because the flight test has not occurred. Unless \nand until the flight test is completed, this restriction stands.\n  The ABM Treaty cannot be used to stop a test, even if it is illegal, \nby the definition in this bill.\n  Now, if we want to talk about language which is so excessive, this \nfits the test. That is what it says, what I guess is the frosting on \nthe cake. What the bill provides is that we will have a commission to \nlook at this whole thing. On page 61 of this bill, section 237, it says \nthat the Senate should undertake\n\n     . . . a comprehensive review of the continuing value and \n     validity of the ABM Treaty, with the intent of providing \n     additional policy guidance on the future of the ABM Treaty \n     during the second session of the 104th Congress.\n\n  Now, in addition to undertaking a comprehensive review of the ABM \nTreaty, we were are also told in subsection B we should consider \nestablishing a select committee to carry out the review, and to \nrecommend such additional policy guidance on future application of the \nABM Treaty, as the select committee considers appropriate.\n  Now, that is a little bit like having the hanging first, and then the \ntrial. This bill says it is our policy to trash the ABM Treaty; this is \nthe dividing line unilaterally; the President cannot negotiate anything \nelse. But it is our policy now under this bill to withdraw from the ABM \nTreaty. That is what this bill says.\n  Then the same bill that says that says: But we are going to have a \nstudy; we are going to have a comprehensive review of the continuing \nvalidity of the ABM Treaty.\n  We ought to have the study before we trash the treaty. Looking at the \ncommittee report on page 119, it says:\n\n       The committee believes that Congress should undertake a \n     comprehensive review of the continuing value and validity of \n     the ABM Treaty, with the intent of making a well-informed and \n     carefully considered recommendation on how to proceed by the \n     end of the 104th Congress.\n\n  That is supposed to be the purpose of this comprehensive review.\n  On page 120, the majority says it is prudent--prudent--to dedicate a \nyear to studying all ABM Treaty-related issues and alternatives, and \nrecommends the review of the continuing value and validity--a careful \n1-year review, the report says--of the continuing value and validity of \nthe ABM Treaty. Why not do the ``careful'' study before we decide to \ntrash the treaty?\n  If it is prudent to have a 1-year study of the ABM Treaty's value, is \nit not prudent to have the review prior to saying it is the policy of \nthe U.S. Government to trash the ABM Treaty? Does not prudence dictate \nthat you withhold your conclusion until after the study?\n  If the purpose of our ``comprehensive careful 1-year review'' is to \nmake a study of the value of the ABM Treaty, for heaven's sake, we \nshould withhold the conclusions until after the study. That is not what \nthis bill does. This bill says it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy a multiple-site system. That is an illegal system under the ABM \nTreaty. That is why Secretary Perry says that these serious \nconsequences argue for conducting the proposed Senate review of the ABM \nTreaty before considering such a drastic and far-reaching measure. He \nunderlines the word ``before.''\n  It seems to me it is just absolute common sense that we do not reach \nconclusions and implement those conclusions the way this bill does, \nwith initial operating capability, with a date set, 2003. There is an \nIOC of 2003 for a national missile test, an interim capability mandated \nby the bill for this system.\n  We are mandating violations of a treaty when at the same time in \nanother part of the bill we say we are studying the continued validity \nof that treaty. That makes no sense at all.\n  Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the desk which \naddresses these three issues that I have just outlined. It will strike \nthe words that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a \nmultiple-site system, since that is directly violative of the ABM \nTreaty; we will also strike the language which sets forth in permanent \nlaw what the demarcation line is between long-range and short-range \nmissiles, since that is the subject of negotiations; and we will also \nstrike the language which prevents the President from even discussing \nany matters relative to the ABM Treaty with the Russians.\n                           Amendment No. 2088\n\n    (Purposes: (1) To strike section 233(2); (2) To strike section \n237(a)(2), which states that the President should cease all efforts to \n   clarify ABM Treaty obligations; (3) To strike Section 238, which \nestablishes a unilateral interpretation of the ABM Treaty and prohibits \n                       treaty-compliance efforts)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at this point, I send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Exon, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Biden, Mr. Moynihan, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Pell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2088.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 52, strike out lines 20 through 25.\n       On page 62, strike out lines 8 through 11.\n       Beginning on page 63, strike out line 11 and all that \n     follows through page 65, line 24.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished manager of the bill on \nthe majority side, Senator Thurmond, is anxious to get a time \nagreement.\n  I wonder if I might inquire of the distinguished ranking member as to \nthe progress we are making on that. Many Senators are working on their \nschedules. Many Senators are anxious to engage in the debate on this \nparticular amendment, I think at the convenience of the Senate. And \nthis means to keep this momentum that we have this morning going \nforward, I wonder if I might inquire as to this.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I think we ought to \ninquire of the Senator from Michigan as to his intentions.\n  We talked about a time agreement. The Senator from Michigan informed \nme he would prefer to come to the floor and determine how many people \nwanted to speak on this amendment.\n  I welcome a time agreement. I hope we can reach one. Perhaps the \nSenator from Michigan could give an indication of his feeling at this \npoint.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not have the final figure yet, but it is \napproximately--and there are a couple more Senators we must consult \nwith--2\\1/2\\ hours on this side that will be needed so far. We think \nthat is fairly close to the total, but we are not quite there yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is a period of time considerably \nlonger than I had hoped. That would mean if this side were to require \nan equal amount, we would be 5 hours.\n  Credit, perhaps, is being given on the 2\\1/2\\ hours for this time, so \nwe are beginning as of this moment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be 2\\1/2\\ additional hours, but that is not \nquite yet the total. There are two other Senators \n\n[[Page S 11247]]\n\nwe have yet to hear from that we believe want to speak, and we have not \nheard how much time.\n  Mr. NUNN. If I may say to my friend from Virginia, the Senator from \nMichigan made such a powerful speech on this subject, with the \nintervention of the Senator from Massachusetts, and I plan to make a \nspeech on it, and I know the Senator from Nebraska plans to speak, \nperhaps by the time our colleagues hear these speeches, they will not \nfeel the need to speak as long on this subject. That remains to be \nseen.\n  I hope we can cut that time down. I will work with the Senator from \nMichigan. This is an important amendment. This is the heart of the bill \nin terms of the opposition to the bill. This is the heart of it.\n  While I would like to accelerate this process and will work hard to \ndo that, I do think that once this matter is settled one way or the \nother on this amendment, and perhaps on another amendment that may \nfollow if this one fails, I think once we do that, we will begin to \nmake a lot more progress on the bill.\n  So, I say to my friend from Virginia and my friend from South \nCarolina, I know they want to move this bill, I will continue to work \nwith them to see if we cannot reach some time agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague. It is very reassuring to hear him say we can try to reduce \nthe amount of time. Because the majority leader is very anxious to have \nthis bill completed, as you know, on the timetable this week. I hope we \ncan reduce the amount of time.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan indicating----\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if Senator Exon has a question?\n  Mr. EXON. No, I was going to follow up on some of the remarks that \nhad been made by the other Senators on this matter. The Senator from \nGeorgia probably wishes to do the same.\n  Mr. NUNN. Has the Senator from Nebraska had a chance to make a \nstatement this morning?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I got that statement made.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am going to make some remarks on the Levin \namendment and I am going to try to cut my remarks down. I think this is \na very important amendment. I support the amendment. I would like to \nlay out what I consider to be the defects in the bill as it now exists \nand why I think this amendment is important and why I will support the \namendment.\n  If this amendment fails I anticipate another amendment in this area.\n  Mr. President, the defects in the majority's Missile Defense Act of \n1995 are simple and straightforward. First, the Missile Defense Act \nconstitutes what, in law, I would call--reflecting back years ago on my \nlaw school courses--I would call this an anticipatory breach of the ABM \nTreaty. Only in this case, it is not a contract, as in law school. The \nbill before us proposes to breach an international treaty, the treaty \nbetween the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics, now succeeded by Russia, on the limitation of the \nantiballistic missile systems known as the ABM Treaty. Thus the Missile \nDefense Act if we pass it, if it became law, puts this body on record \nas directing the United States to knowingly violate an existing \ninternational treaty without first seeking amendments to the treaty and \nwithout reference to the provisions in the treaty which permit either \nparty to withdraw upon 6 months' notice.\n  The ABM Treaty was entered into, not as a sacred document to be \nadhered to forever, but rather as a document that reflected the \nsecurity interests of both the Soviet Union and the United States at \nthat time. I am not wedded to every word in the ABM Treaty, as I will \nreview in a moment. I do believe amendments are in order. But why not \nnegotiate the amendments? Why act as if there is no treaty? That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  If we cannot negotiate the amendments, if the Russians will not budge \nafter a good-faith effort, why not then consider whether to withdraw \nfrom the treaty under the provisions of the treaty? That is the way you \nget out of a treaty if you do not feel it is in your national security \ninterests.\n  The second problem with the Missile Defense Act is that this breach \nis wholly unnecessary to the conducting of the near-term missile \ndefense program run by the ballistic missile defense organization. In \nother words, we are basically serving notice that the treaty is going \nto be breached and it is not getting us anything in the next fiscal \nyear--nothing. There is no program in this bill that would violate the \nABM Treaty in the next fiscal year.\n  Enactment of the Missile Defense Act authorizes no activity by the \nballistic missile defense office during fiscal year 1996 that would \notherwise be proscribed by the ABM Treaty.\n  So, what we have is we are asked to take a gratuitous poke at the eye \nof the Russians, while helping to persuade them that the United States \nCongress is bent on resurrecting what some have called star wars.\n  In my view the Russians do not have the resources to compete in this \narena in the near term. So they will certainly be frustrated, in the \nsense that they see us moving to breach the ABM Treaty when they do not \nhave the resources to compete. They just simply do not have the \nfinances to compete.\n  But, what they do have is thousands of missiles. Not a few hundred, \nbut thousands of missiles that they are supposed to dismantle under \nSTART I, and they already are doing that under START I, and thousands \nmore missiles they are supposed to dismantle under START II, which has \nbeen negotiated, and signed by President Bush but is now pending \nratification both in the Duma and here in the Senate.\n  What they can do very easily is they can simply continue to target \nthose thousands of missiles at the United States. That is likely to be \ntheir response to what they see as a breach of the ABM Treaty.\n  Do we really, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, after going through \nthe Reagan administration, the Bush administration, basically \nnegotiating carefully arms control agreements and trying to carry them \nout, getting thousands of nuclear warheads dismantled, do we want to \nturn around and do something in this bill that is going to say to the \nRussians, in effect: We are going to break out of the ABM Treaty. Now \nwhatever you do is up to you?\n  I know what they are going to do. I believe I know what they are \ngoing to do. They do not have billions of dollars to conduct defenses \nnow. They may in the future. In the future I think it is in their \ninterests also to have some defenses. I think both countries ought to \nhave some limited defenses against accidental launch, against any kind \nof unauthorized launch or against a Third World country that emerges as \na threat. I think we ought to have those kind of defenses. I think the \nRussians ought to, too.\n  But if we strike out unilaterally they are going to do what we would \ndo if we were in their circumstances. What is that? We would not \ndismantle our strategic offensive forces. We would find a way to \nproliferate the offensive forces because those offensive forces are \ngoing to have defenses that they have to contend with. And, what the \nRussians would fear, as we would fear, is that the combination of going \nto a lower START level, dismantling warheads, going down to START II, \ndoing that, limiting the number of warheads; then having the United \nStates embarked on a breach of the ABM Treaty, saying we are clearly \ngoing to deploy defenses without regard to negotiation, without regard \nto amendments, without regard to the provisions of the treaty--the \ncombination of those two things says to them: Limited warheads, \ndefenses by the United States, possible preemptive attack. We would \nnever do that. We know that. But they do not know that just like we do \nnot know that about them. That is the basis of our deterrence policy. \nWe do not know that and we are not going to bank on it.\n  But the combination limiting the number of warheads, defenses in this \ncountry that basically breach the ABM Treaty, plus a preemptive attack, \nmeans that they would lose the ability to retaliate.\n  That is paranoia. But the whole equation of deterrence for years has \n\n[[Page S 11248]]\n  been based on both sides being somewhat paranoid. And not irrationally \nso, based on the former confrontation all over the globe.\n  This breach of the ABM Treaty is wholly unnecessary. This poke in the \neye to Russia leads to a third problem. That problem is one with \nserious, perhaps even tragic consequences. While enactment of the \nMissile Defense Act permits nothing within our own missile defense \nprograms that we cannot already do in the next fiscal year, it may very \nwell persuade the Russians that we have abandoned our obligations under \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  Perhaps the majority does not really want to do that. If so, we have \nroom to work out wording that would change that impression in this \nbill. The Russians have repeatedly told us, those in the executive \nbranch as well as those of us in the Senate who have met with them on \nmany occasions, they have told us of the importance they attach to \ncontinued compliance with the ABM Treaty by both parties. And they have \nsuggested if they conclude we are abandoning the ABM Treaty \nunilaterally, this would call into question Russia's continued \ncompliance with their international agreements.\n  Thus we may be jeopardizing START I and START II, thousands of \nwarheads that would continue to be pointed at the United States, it \nwill take us 10 or 12 years at best to build the defenses, yet we have \na chance of dismantling thousands of warheads that are aimed at us.\n  Which is more cost effective? Embarking on a unilateral course \nwithout regard to the people we entered into the treaty with? Or \nnegotiating with them, and determining what we would do if negotiations \nfail?\n  Why do we want to get thousands more warheads pointed at the United \nStates? I do not. I do not think anybody in this body does. I do not \nthink the American people do. That is the result of where we are \nheading, unless this bill is changed.\n  Mr. President, it is not only the two START agreements, it is also \nthe Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. That is the treaty where the \nRussians dismantled and continue to dismantle literally thousands--they \nare moving at least thousands and thousands of tanks and other \nthreatening equipment, artillery tubes under the CFE Treaty in Europe.\n  They already are frustrated by that treaty. They already are making \nsigns that this treaty causes them big problems. It is going to be a \nproblem whether we pass this amendment or not. But, if we pass this \namendment, it is going to be a bigger problem very quickly.\n  The two START treaties, if fully entered into force, will reduce by \nthree-fourths the number of Russian ballistic missile warheads in their \narsenal--a far greater reduction of nuclear warheads potentially \nthreatening the United States than any defensive system could possibly \noffer or that we have any capability of developing and paying for in \nthe next 10 years. Three-fourths of the warheads are coming off under \nSTART I and START II.\n  Do we really want to jeopardize that? The Russians have complained \nfrequently about the enormous cost to them of compliance with these two \nSTART treaties and the CFE. But so far they are complying. We may reach \na point where they do not. But they are so far complying. How much more \nwill it cost us in our own defense budget if the START treaties go by \nthe boards? Also, many Members are aware the Russians have been\n seeking relief from the limitations imposed under the CFE Treaty on \nthe level of conventional forces and equipment they are permitted to \nstation on their volatile southern flank. If the full Senate adopts the \nMissile Defense Act, this will give them a plausible excuse to ignore \nthe CFE limits on stationing forces and equipment. To repeat, Mr. \nPresident, all of these serious consequences and costs may be brought \nupon us by adoption of the Senate Armed Services Committee majority's \nMissile Defense Act, which itself allows us to do no more than we \nalready planned to do in the short run, unless the bill is changed.\n\n  The fourth problem with the Missile Defense Act is that it tries \nlegislatively to have it both ways: the Senate Armed Services Committee \nmajority wants the ABM Treaty to go away, and legislates as though it \nhad already gone away; yet they do not take the straightforward \napproach of using legal remedy. Mr. President, if the Senate believes \nadherence to the ABM Treaty is no longer in our national interest, then \nwe should have availed ourselves of a straightforward and honorable \nresolution. Under article XV, paragraph 2, of the ABM Treaty, the \nUnited States can withdraw from the ABM Treaty, after giving 6 months \nnotice to Russia. Is the Senate ready to take that step? Or will we \nadopt the language of the Missile Defense Act to squeeze past, a direct \nconfrontation with the ABM Treaty, by pretending that it is not there.\n  It seems to me that is the course we are on, pretending it is not \nthere.\n  This unwillingness to confront the ABM Treaty head-on, Mr. President, \nleads to the fifth problem with the Missile Defense Act. By ignoring \nthe ABM Treaty, rather than proposing U.S. withdrawal from it, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee majority are forced to try to negate \nits effect by the following legislative device: They restrict the use \nof appropriated funds to enforce our obligations under the ABM Treaty. \nIn attempting to negate the treaty in this way, Mr. President, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee majority sets up a direct \nconstitutional conflict between the executive and the legislative \nbranches regarding responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy and \nthe enforcement of this Nation's international obligations.\n  Mr. President, consider what is at stake here. Should the Missile \nDefense Act approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee majority be \nenacted in the next couple of years, we stand to gain nothing, but we \nstand to lose a great deal: we could lose the agreed drawdowns of \nnuclear arsenals under START I and II; we could lose the CFE Treaty's \nconstraints on Russian conventional force deployments near troubled \nareas.\n  Now, some in the Senate Armed Service Committee majority will argue \nthat the Missile Defense Act does not really breach the ABM Treaty, \nbecause only some subsequent testing or deployment action would \ntechnically place us in violation of the treaty.\n  They will argue this by saying that only some subsequent testing or \ndeployment would technically place us in violation of the treaty.\n  Mr. President, this is too clever by one-half. If the Russian \nRepublic were to announce tomorrow that it no longer intended to meet \nthe timetable for reduction of nuclear systems under the START I \nTreaty, that it was not going to renegotiate them, that it simply was \ngoing to move forward as if START I did not exist, and that there was \nnothing we could do about it, would the Senate Armed Services Committee \ncome to the Senate floor to calmly inform us that this is not a breach \nof their obligations under the treaty? Would they argue that the START \nI Treaty can only be breached once the deadline for implementing \nreductions is past? Or would they say instead, as I think would be the \ncase, breach is inevitable, and based on what the Russians have told \nus, we should now move to prepare for this breach and take the \nnecessary security precautions?\n  I think that the majority--and I would be in that majority--would say \nlet us assume that they are going to do what they say they are going to \ndo; they are going to breach the treaty, and we had better start \nrecognizing that.\n  To recap, Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nMissile Defense Act provision has major problems: First, it abandons \nUnited States adherence to the ABM Treaty; second, abandoning adherence \nnow is unnecessary--we can conduct an effective missile defense program \nin the near-term while continuing adherence; third, abandoning \nadherence now is likely to impose huge costs on us, if Russia declines \nto carry out some of its legal obligations in response to our breach; \nfourth, the Senate Armed Services Committee bill abandons adherence by \nstealth, rather directing the administration to use the legal \nwithdrawal procedures contained in the treaty; and fifth, by failing to \nuse the legal option, the Senate is forced to try to compel the \nexecutive branch to abandon adherence by usurping certain powers of the \n\n\n[[Page S 11249]]\nexecutive branch over the conduct of foreign policy, a move that raises \nserious constitutional issues, and\n could lead to this act never becoming law even if it passed as is.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not want any Senator to misconstrue my message \nregarding the ABM Treaty, and I am sure there will be people on this \nside who will not listen to the latter part of this message. I am not a \ndiehard supporter of the ABM Treaty as some sacred document that cannot \nbe changed. I think that would be a mistake in view of this treaty. \nCircumstances change. The circumstances surrounding the treaty's \nestablishment have changed significantly since it was entered into in \nthe early 1970's. Therefore, either the treaty itself must be changed \nto reflect the new realities, or the Congress and the President must at \nsome point make the decision that the treaty's usefulness has ended and \nexercise our legal right to withdraw from the treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty condition contains provisions for renegotiation; \nindeed, that is precisely what the Clinton administration has been \ntrying to do at Geneva, and they really need the backing of Congress to \ndo that. Thus, it is not a foregone conclusion that the treaty cannot \nbe amended by mutual agreement to allow us to deploy the missile \ndefenses we consider necessary to meet our national security \nrequirements. But Russia must understand that these negotiations must \nmake progress and that the time period available for negotiations is \nnot infinite. It is finite.\n  I think that message needs to go forth to the Russians clearly. It \nwould be useful if it went forth in a united way from both the \nadministration and from the Congress. But we will not have any united \nmessage because we are going to be too busy deciding whether there is \nan anticipatory breach by ignoring any negotiations and by ignoring the \ntreaty itself.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the amendment by the \nSenator from Michigan; I hope it is successful. If it fails to pass, I \nbelieve the Senate then will face a major dilemma. I believe that, \nunless the problems I have outlined above are dealt with, this bill \nfaces a bleak future. The administration is already on record that the \nHouse version of the Missile Defense Act is unacceptable, as is the \nprovision in this bill as passed by the committee.\n  Thus, the prospects for an outcome in conference that will become law \nare indeed bleak unless we make some fundamental changes.\n  The Senator from Michigan seeks to correct the flaws by striking \nwhole sections. If this approach is shown to be unacceptable to a \nmajority of Senators present and voting, then the only remaining \npossibility will be to try to modify the language. And I will certainly \nhave an amendment to do that after we decide what happens on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have worked for many years with my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, and more often than not we have \nhad a joinder of views and positions. But on this we are strong \nopponents.\n  I was the author of a number of provisions in this bill which are the \nsubject of the strike of my good friend, the Senator from Michigan.\n  I vigorously oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the administration is \norchestrating a full court press to defeat the Missile Defense Act of \n1995 and in particular section 238 of that act which was known as the \nWarner amendment during our markup.\n  I was the author of the previous Missile Defense Act, and the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995 builds on the act that was put in in I believe \n1991.\n  Therefore, it seems to me that it is a logical sequence of \nlegislative steps by the Congress to build on the foundation that we \nlaid in 1991.\n  I have tried for many years together with a number of my colleagues \nthrough many, many legislative initiatives to ensure that the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces are not once again sent into harm's way \nunless they are provided with the most effective defenses that not only \nwe can buy with the dollars but that we can devise with the brains. I \nwish to emphasize that--devise with the brains.\n  My basic premise is that successive administrations have used the ABM \nTreaty as a means to limit the use of the intellectual capacity of the \nUnited States to develop the most efficient, the most cost-effective \nand the most technically sound and reliable systems for the defense \nagainst short-range ballistic missiles.\n  We failed in many respects during the gulf war. The crude Scud \nmissile was utilized by the Iraqi military forces not only against the \ncoalition of allied military forces but against the innocent people, \nthe defenseless people of Tel Aviv.\n  Israel was not a combatant in the gulf war, yet Saddam Hussein rained \ndown upon those innocent people the Scud missile, not for military \npurposes but solely for terrorist purposes.\n  Here we are some several years later still wrestling with the \nfundamental question: Are we going to unleash the full magnitude of the \nbrains of this Nation, working with other nations, and in particular \nIsrael, to devise the finest and most technically capable system to \ndefend against the short-range missile?\n  That is what this is all about--that is that section of the strike \nthat goes to the Missile Defense Act of 1995.\n  Over 30 nations now have short-range ballistic missiles--30 nations. \nTalk about the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty is between the United States \nof America and the former Soviet Union. And at that time in 1972 there \nwas not even on a drawing board, so far as anybody can recall, an idea \nabout a short-range system. Today, there are 30 nations with some \nmeasure of capability, and yet we are sitting here dealing with this \narchaic act, treaty, whatever you wish to call it, saying that it \nshould stand there as a guardian against the ability of this country to \ndevise our best systems.\n  Seventy-seven nations have cruise missiles, the flat trajectory. Many \nof the systems that we are looking at now to deter the ballistic \nmissile also have a technical capability of being adapted to defend \nagainst the cruise missile.\n  As the gulf war demonstrated, the threat such missiles pose to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces is real, immediate, and growing. At \nthis very moment and while we are debating this issue, all across the \nworld are men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces on watch as a means to \ndeter against attack, many of them within the range of the short-range \nballistic systems posed as a threat by these 30 nations.\n  How many recall the incident in the gulf war which resulted in the \nlargest number of American casualties? It was a single Scud missile \nthat landed on a barracks killing and wounding the greatest number of \nAmericans during that war.\n  Are we to say to the American people, particularly the mothers and \nfathers, the uncles and aunts, the loved ones of those on duty in \nplaces throughout the world today that this could happen once again \nbecause the United States will not unleash its full brain power to \ndevise the best system to defend against that type of weapon?\n  If you look at the balance between the launch pad of a short-range \nsystem, that is fairly elementary. You can cobble that together. We \nknow that from the crude Scud missile system. You can put it together. \nBut the defense, the interceptor, the electronics needed to bring that \nmissile into the bore sight of some weapon, that is many times more \ncostly than the launch system. But we are going to stand here, if I \nlistened correctly to the proponents of this amendment and once again \ngo back to a treaty of 1972 and allow it to stand, stand there and \nblock the full resources, mental and dollarwise of this great Nation to \nprevent another incident like we experienced in the gulf.\n  In the judgment of this Senator, we must accelerate the development \nand deployment of highly effective land- and sea-based theater missile \nsystems to protect our troops, defenses that are not artificially or \nwrongfully limited, constrained by this ABM Treaty.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, it was in April of this year that I \nintroduced an amendment along with dozens of cosponsors to clearly \nestablish a policy for the United States of America which states that \nthe ABM Treaty does not apply to short-range theater ballistic systems. \n\n\n[[Page S 11250]]\n\n  In effect, this legislation is intended to prevent the Clinton \nadministration from making the ABM Treaty in effect a TMD treaty. That \nis what is underway and has been underway for some several years, to \ntake this 1972 treaty and somehow wrap it around the short-range \nsystem. Despite administration claims that this provision is \nunconstitutional, I carefully chose the congressional power of the \npurse as the vehicle to get congressional views on the issue of ABM-TMD \ndemarcation, to take those into consideration.\n  Contrary to the assertion of its critics, this provision does not \nprohibit negotiations with the Russians. I listened to this this \nmorning. I cannot believe it. That is a weak reed to walk out on, I say \nto the proponents of the Levin amendment, a very weak reed to walk out \non.\n  Instead, the provision would in effect prohibit the implementation of \nany resulting agreement which would have the effect of making the ABM \nTreaty a TMD treaty. That was the purpose of my legislation. I have \ntried in the past, and many others have tried, but to no avail to \nensure that the Senate of the United States would be involved in \ndecisions the administration might make in the demarcation \nnegotiations.\n  Last year, I sponsored legislation requiring that any international \nagreement entered into by the President that would substantially modify \nthe ABM Treaty be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent \npursuant to our constitutional authority on treaties.\n  Despite that legal requirement, it became clear to me during the \nadministration briefings on the demarcation issue--and I will say to \ntheir credit, particularly to a former Senate Armed Services staff \nassistant, Robert Bell, there has been considerable consultation on \nthis demarcation series of negotiations, but we have not been able to \npresent what I regard as a convincing argument.\n  I repeat, despite that legal requirement of last year, it became \nclear to many of us here in the Senate during these briefings on the \ndemarcation that the administration had no intention of submitting any \ndemarcation to the U.S. Senate, no intention, despite the fact that the \nadministration's negotiating position would result in an international \nagreement that would impose major new limitations on the United States.\n  Therefore, many of us saw the need to act, and act we did. And as a \nconsequence, we have before us today a bill that will give this country \nneeded protections. Regrettably, one of our colleagues, joined by \nothers, is wishing to strike that provision.\n  Mr. President, the ABM Treaty was never intended to limit or restrict \ntheater missile defense systems. That is clear. The administration, in \na sense, concedes the point. In addition, I had the opportunity to \ndiscuss this issue with two individuals who were intimately involved in \nthe ABM Treaty negotiations at that period of time, 1972. I was \nprivileged to be the Secretary of the U.S. Navy and was in Moscow \nprimarily for the purpose of the Incidents of the Sea Agreement with \nthe delegation that signed the ABM Treaty. These were persons that I \nhad worked with for some several years prior thereto in the Department \nof Defense. The ABM Treaty was not a matter primarily in any respect \nunder the jurisdiction of the military departments. But nevertheless, \nthe military departments, including, of course, the Navy Department, \nhad access to the negotiations, the papers, and were asked from time to \ntime for views on this issue.\n  So I do have a contemporary recollection firsthand of this period of \ntime in history. And I went back and talked with my former colleague, \nDr. John Foster, who at that time was the head of the research and \ndevelopment section in the Department of Defense, an eminent scholar, \nmathematician, physicist. And he reassured me that the issue of short-\nrange systems was not a product in any respect of the treaty. I \nlikewise talked to former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was \nthe National Security Adviser during that period of time. And he also \nreaffirmed just a short time ago that theater missiles were never \ncontemplated during the ABM Treaty negotiations.\n  Specifically, according to Dr. Kissinger, the focus of the \nnegotiation was on defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles \nbecause they were the only systems that were then in existence. \nUnfortunately, the administration appears intent on concluding an \nagreement with the Russians that would severely limit the technological \ndevelopment and deployment of United States theater missile defense \nsystems, an agreement that would transform the ABM Treaty, in my \njudgment, into a TMD treaty.\n  These are examples of what the administration has been doing, is \ntable proposals; that is, put on the table for discussion with the \nRussians, proposals that would accept performance limitations on the \nTMD systems. The ABM Treaty does not even impose performance \nlimitations on the strategic systems.\n  Second, the administration initially accepted a Russian proposal to \nprohibit deployment of the Navy upper-tier system, a system that was \nsubsequently deemed to be treaty compliant by the administration. \nInitially they put that on the table as a proposal.\n  The negotiations clearly then and indeed now are headed in the wrong \ndirection. In my view, it is time for the Congress to act to pave the \nway for the development of the most capable, most cost-effective \ntheater missile defense system to protect the lives of the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces. My legislation does just that. It would \nprohibit the obligation or expenditure of any funds by any official of \nthe Federal Government for the purposes of prescribing, enforcing or \nimplementing any Executive order, regulation or policy that would apply \nthe ABM Treaty or any limitation or obligation under such treaty to \nresearch, development, testing or deployment of a theater missile \ndefense system, upgrade or component. The standard which I have used in \nthis legislation to define the demarcation line between antiballistic \nmissile defenses are limited by the ABM Treaty.\n  Let me repeat that. The standard which was used in this legislation \nand adopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee to define the \ndemarcation line between antiballistic missile defenses which are \nlimited by the ABM Treaty and theater missile defenses which are not so \nlimited by the treaty, is the one, the very one used by the \nadministration at the beginning of the demarcation negotiations in \nNovember 1993. That is, a missile defense system which is covered by \nthe ABM Treaty is defined as a missile defense system that has been \nfield tested against a ballistic missile with, one, a range of more \nthan 3,500 kilometers, or, two, a maximum velocity of more than 5 \nkilometers per second.\n  Put simply, if a missile defense system does not have a demonstrated \nfield-tested capability to counter intercontinental ballistic systems, \nit should not be limited in any way by the ABM Treaty. Without this \nlegislation, Mr. President--I acknowledge that the current occupant of \nthe chair was a most valuable participant in drawing up this \nlegislation--without this legislation, Mr. President, the Senate will \nhave no role to play in an international agreement which will impose \nmajor new obligations and restrictions on the military capabilities of \nthe United States. This is an issue which is vital to our national \nsecurity and which can be ignored no longer.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Two sentences, and then I will be happy to yield. We \nwill no doubt debate this issue at length, as we are doing right now. \nAnd I welcome the debate, and I urge all to support those who seek to \ndefeat the amendment by our distinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I cannot speak for the Senator from Michigan. Of course, he \nis on the floor to speak for himself.\n  What I hear the Senator from Virginia say is his main purpose is to \nprotect the theater missile defense systems and to have a demarcation \npoint of definition between those systems and the strategic systems \nthat would be affected by the ABM Treaty. Assuming that is the \nSenator's main objective, it seems to me we can reach some agreement on \nthis because that is not the language that gives me the problem. I do \nnot think it is the language \n\n[[Page S 11251]]\nthat gives the Senator from Michigan the problem. It is all language \nthat basically states we are going to deploy national missile defenses \nwith multiple sites without any negotiation and without any regard to \nthe ABM Treaty, which has nothing to do with theater missiles. That is \nall strategic and it is all clearly involved with the ABM Treaty.\n  But if the Senator's main goal is to protect the theater missile \ndefense system and have a demarcation more than a definition, as long \nas there is some flexibility for the administration so that there is \nnot an absolute ruling out of any administration efforts--because \nsomebody has got to negotiate this demarcation point no matter what we \nsay--if that is the Senator's goal, I agree with him on the demarcation \npoint. I think that is a very sensible point. If that is the Senator's \ngoal, then there is no reason we cannot find a way, whatever happens on \nthe Levin amendment, to deal with this language,\n because that is not the language we are trying to take out of this \nbill.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in reply, that is encouraging to hear the \nviews from my distinguished colleague. The Levin amendment, \nnevertheless, strikes the Missile Defense Act of 1995, which in turn \nincorporated in the committee markup the Warner provision, which I have \njust addressed.\n  Do I understand that there is some thought about amending the Levin \namendment to----\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. NUNN. I think the Senator from Michigan stated----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to go through the language of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and apologize for jumping in without \nbeing recognized.\n  My amendment strikes the language in the bill which commits us to \ndeploy a system which clearly violates the ABM Treaty. It leaves the \nlanguage about deploying as soon as possible highly effective theater \nmissile defenses. That is in the bill. It is left in the bill. I was \nsurprised to hear the Senator from Virginia say the issue here is \nwhether we want to deploy theater missile defenses. Boy, that is not \nthe language we are after. We left that language in there.\n  Section 233 says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible highly effective theater \n     missile defenses capable of countering existing and emerging \n     theater ballistic missiles;\n\n  We did not touch that. It is the next paragraph we touched. The next \nparagraph says it is the policy of the United States:\n\n       (2) deploy a multiple-site national missile defense system. \n     . .\n\n  Which I am absolutely confident my friend from Virginia will agree \nthat a multiple-site national missile defense system is inconsistent \nwith the ABM Treaty, just as I concede that the ABM Treaty does not \nprohibit theater missile defenses. It does not and we should proceed to \ndeploy those, and we are.\n  By the way, General Shalikashvili says the ABM Treaty does not \nconstrain our development of theater missile defenses. He said in his \nletter to me ``the progress on these programs''--referring to theater \nmissile defenses--``is not restricted by a lack of a demarcation \nagreement.''\n  Just as I would be the first to concede, indeed proclaim, that the \nABM Treaty does not restrict theater missile defenses, I hope my friend \nfrom Virginia will agree that his language in section 233(2) that it is \na policy to deploy a multiple-site national defense system that would \nviolate the treaty unless the treaty were amended. We are seeking to \ntry to amend this treaty. Yes, theater missile defenses are not \nconstrained by the ABM Treaty, nor should they be, nor are they. But it \nis the language in subparagraph (2) that makes it the policy to deploy \na multiple-site national defense system which clearly violates the ABM \nTreaty, which is the first target of the amendment.\n  So we leave in the theater defense language in subparagraph (1). We \ndo not touch that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator address section 238?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the provision of the Senator from Virginia, and \nthat is subject to the strike.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is the bill that I am addressing in three different \nplaces. In section 238----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is the subject of the amendment of \nthe Senator from Virginia and the subject I just covered in my floor \nremarks. Looking at the Senator's amendment at the desk, in section 3, \nit says ``to strike section 238 which establishes a unilateral \ninterpretation of the ABM Treaty and prohibits treaty compliance \nefforts.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 238 does establish the dividing line between long-\nrange and short-range missiles. It does it unilaterally, it does it in \nlaw. The reason that that is inappropriate is these are the subject of \nnegotiations now, should be the subject of negotiations. If the Duma \nestablished a range of 4,000 kilometers for a short-range missile, I \nthink the Senator from Virginia would be on his feet saying, ``What, \nthe Russian legislative body is unilaterally determining what is a \nshort-range system and they said 4,000 kilometers? What is going on? We \nthought this was the subject of negotiations, this is bad faith. You \nhave a Russian legislative body unilaterally saying 4,000 kilometers?''\n  Yes, we should not be establishing in law--in law--the demarcation \nline between the two when two things are true: One is the subject of \nongoing negotiations and two, and this is critically important, is that \nGeneral Shalikashvili told us that the absence of a demarcation line, \nhaving been agreed to, is not a constraint on the research and \ndevelopment of the theater missiles that we all support. In other \nwords, it is not constraining us. So for us to prematurely, \nunilaterally have the Congress say this is the demarcation line between \nlong-range and short-range does great mischief in terms of reaching an \nagreement with the Russians on a bilateral basis and militarily does \nnot achieve anything for us because the absence of a demarcation line \nis not constraining the research and development of theater missiles.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief question \nand observation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think it is important, and I state this \nonly for my own view and the Senator from Michigan can respond. There \nis a difference in making a finding and saying that this is where the \nCongress thinks the demarcation line ought to be and passing a line \nsaying this is the way it is. Passing a law knocks out the executive \nbranch of Government, if they sign the law and if it is constitutional, \nin any kind of negotiation. So you do not even have the ability under \nthis bill, the way I read it now, for the President to say to the \nRussians or his Ambassador to say to the Russians, this is what the \nSenate passed. I believe the bill is so sweeping in its denial of \nexecutive authority to have any negotiations on this point that I do \nnot think they would be able to inform the Russian Duma or the Russian \nleadership, Yeltsin and others, as to what the Senate did.\n  If the Senator wants to say this is where we think the line ought to \nbe, and this is what we believe the administration ought to negotiate \nwith the Russians, and this is what we think the Russians ought to \naccept, or these are the sensible findings we make, that would be a \ntotally different matter. It is when you put it in law so it knocks out \nnot only the Russians from having any say whatsoever in it, no \nnegotiations, no say, no response, it knocks out even the President and \nthe executive branch.\n  First of all, I do not think this will become law, but if it does, \nyou will have almost an absurd situation. In fact, there is some \nlanguage in here that is so broad that it might be interpreted if this \nbecame law to preclude the U.S. Senate from even debating it again. It \nsays no Federal official. We are Federal officials, last time I got my \npaycheck. We are included in that, too. We cannot even talk about it \nonce it is passed.\n  I think the Senator's language goes much further than the Senator's \nintent. That is what I think we need to work on, and if we can make \nfindings on demarcation and urge the President forward and urge him to \ntake this position, then I believe we can reach some \n\n[[Page S 11252]]\nconsensus. It is the law part of it that bothers me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may reply----\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe I was to ask a question. That is a question mark \nat the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Chair observes the Senator \nfrom Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia to \nanswer the question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. The three of us who are now engaged in debate and, \nindeed, the occupant of the chair and others have been in the briefings \non the negotiations of this demarcation issue.\n  As I said in my remarks, it was the fear that the administration \nwould not come back to the U.S. Senate for ``advise and consent'' that \nhas required this Senator and others to take this action. We cannot sit \nhere knowingly, allowing the administration to go forth with a \ndemarcation which would, in our collective judgment, not be in the best \ninterest of this country, and the only way we would have a means to \nexpress that would be through the advice-and-consent procedure.\n And the administration, very forthrightly, said they would not bring \nit back. And that is the reason we acted.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield to me for 1 minute?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to add to the comments of the Senator from Virginia \nthat at least some of us on this side have sent no fewer than five \nletters to the President on this subject asking to be consulted and \nadvised, suggesting that the administration, frankly, was going too far \nin these discussions with the Russians and asked him not to do so.\n  As the Senator from Virginia just noted, one of the reasons for \nfinally putting the language in the bill is that our entreaties have \ngone unheeded, the administration has gone forward. This is apparently \nthe only way we can get their attention. We had 50 Senators, all \nRepublicans, urging the administration not to go forward, and they did \nso anyway. That is the reason for finally acting in a legislative way.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As the Senator from Georgia said, it is very different to \ngive a recommendation to the President, which is one thing. To put into \nlaw what we believe the demarcation line is unilaterally, saying that \nthe President cannot deviate from it, and he cannot negotiate even an \nimprovement from our perspective. By the way, this language even goes \nbeyond that. This language literally, when you read it, would prevent \nan official of the United States from stopping a test which violates \nthis demarcation line by its own terms. In other words, let us assume \nthat we were testing an ABM system against a missile that had a range \nof 4,000 kilometers. This language says that until it is flight tested, \nthis prohibition is in place. That is what the language says. The \nSenator from Virginia and I have worked a long time on lots of bills \ntogether. But this language violates common sense because you could not \neven stop a test from occurring, which, by the terms of this bill, \nviolates the ABM Treaty. That is how extreme this language is.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be very brief. The Senator from Michigan put in a \nletter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili. I \nwish to put in the Record at this point in our colloquy my reply to \nGeneral Shalikashvili and in the spirit of total fairness, again his \nreply back to my letter. Clearly, we disagree.\n  I would like to read one paragraph to the Senator. I said to the \ngeneral:\n\n       Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening. Our \n     ongoing TMD efforts--in particular THAAD and Navy Upper \n     Tier--have been artificially limited by ABM Treaty \n     considerations. For example, neither system has been allowed \n     to incorporate space-based sensors because of concerns that \n     the use of such sensors would not be ABM Treaty-compliant. \n     This despite the fact that all of the military experts with \n     whom I have consulted have assured me that we could develop \n     and deploy more cost-effective and technically capable TMD \n     systems if such systems incorporated space-based elements.\n\n  Mr. President, that is it, clear and simple. It is right there.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.\n     Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, USA,\n     Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your June 28 \n     letter to Senator Levin concerning the impact of the ``Warner \n     Amendment,'' which prohibits the application of the ABM \n     Treaty to U.S. theater missile defense systems.\n       I introduced this amendment in April with only one goal in \n     mind--to rapidly provide the brave men and women of the Armed \n     Forces with the most technically advanced, cost-effective \n     theater missile defense systems which the United States is \n     capable of producing. As you well know, over 30 nations \n     currently possess short-range ballistic missiles. The Gulf \n     War demonstrated that such missiles pose a threat to our \n     troops which is real, immediate and growing.\n       In my view, work on defenses against these missiles should \n     not in any way be constrained by restrictive and erroneous \n     interpretations of the ABM Treaty--a Treaty which was never \n     intended to limit or restrict theater missile defenses.\n       I was there, General, in Moscow in May 1972 when this \n     Treaty was signed. Further, as Secretary of the Navy, I knew \n     and had access to the people conducting the negotiations and \n     preparing the working papers for those negotiations. I have \n     since--recently--spoken with some of thee people to confirm \n     that short-range systems were not the subject of their work. \n     The ABM Treaty was intended only to apply to strategic, long-\n     range systems. It should not now be stretched to cover the \n     short-range, or theater, systems.\n       Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening. Our on-\n     going TMD efforts--in particular THAAD and Navy Upper Tier--\n     have\n      been artificially limited by ABM Treaty considerations. For \n     example, neither system has been allowed to incorporate \n     space-based sensors because of concerns that the use of \n     such sensors would not be Treaty-compliant. This despite \n     the fact that all of the military experts with whom I have \n     consulted have assured me that we could develop and deploy \n     more cost-effective and technically capable TMD systems if \n     such systems incorporated space-based elements. And I \n     might add that this is not a new problem. This course was \n     followed by previous administrations as well as the \n     current one.\n       My amendment establishes a clear demarcation line between \n     anti-ballistic missile defenses which are limited by the ABM \n     Treaty, and theater missile defenses which are not. The \n     demarcation standard which I selected for my amendment is the \n     one used by the Clinton Administration at the beginning of \n     the demarcation talks in November 1993, and one that was \n     accepted by the Russians at that time. It is a standard \n     which, to my knowledge, has not been disputed by either party \n     to the negotiations.\n       Contrary to the assertion in your letter, my amendment does \n     not prohibit the Administration from conducting demarcation \n     negotiations with the Russians. Instead, the amendment would, \n     in effect, prohibit the implementation of any agreement which \n     might result from those negotiations which would have the \n     effect of making the ABM Treaty a TMD Treaty. To remain on \n     solid Constitutional grounds, I carefully chose the Congress' \n     power of the purse as the vehicle to ensure that \n     Congressional views on this issue are taken into \n     consideration.\n       I, and many of my colleagues, have grave reservations about \n     the direction the Administration has been pursuing in the \n     demarcation talks with Russia. It appears that the \n     Administration is intent on concluding an agreement with the \n     Russians that would severely limit the technological \n     development and deployment of a U.S. theater missile defense \n     system. For example, reportedly over the objections of senior \n     military\n      officers, the Administration earlier this year tabled a \n     proposal which would impose performance limitations on our \n     theater missile defense systems, and accepted a Russian \n     proposal to prohibit the deployment of the Navy Upper Tier \n     system--a system that was subsequently deemed to be \n     Treaty-compliant by the DoD. The negotiations are clearly \n     headed in the wrong direction. A change of course is in \n     order.\n       Your letter mentioned the potential impact my amendment \n     might have on Russian ratification of START II. I might point \n     out that START II Treaty ratification by the Russian Duma is \n     in doubt for reasons having nothing to do with the ABM Treaty \n     or U.S. theater missile defense efforts. Put simply, many \n     Russians do not want to give up their multiple warhead ICBMs, \n     as called for under START II. We must not hold our TMD \n     efforts hostage to Russian threats concerning START II \n     ratification, or any other issue.\n       While I share your desire to maintain a good security \n     relationship with the Russians, I am not willing to sacrifice \n     vital and legitimate U.S. defense efforts in the interest of \n     that security relationship.\n       I think you would agree with me that our goal should be to \n     provide our troops with the best defenses that our technical \n     experts are capable of producing. I believe that my amendment \n     advances that goal.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S 11253]]\n\n                                                     The Chairman,\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: Thank you for your letter and strong \n     support of efforts to protect US troops from the theater \n     missile threat. The explanation and clarification of the \n     intent and effect of your amendment are sincerely \n     appreciated.\n       Since the beginning of the demarcation discussions, the \n     first priority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been \n     protecting US troops. I share the view that the ABM Treaty \n     was never intended to limit theater missile defenses, and \n     agreed to an initial demarcation approach to the Russians \n     based on the standard specified in your amendment. As you \n     note, the Russians appeared to accept the limiting parameters \n     of 3500 km and 5 km/sec for testing against theater ballistic \n     missiles, but pushed for interceptor performance limits as \n     well.\n       In June 1994, in an effort to each early, acceptable \n     demarcation agreement, some limits on interceptor velocity \n     were proposed by the United States. As negotiations \n     progressed, a subsequent proposal for an interim agreement \n     which would have deferred some unresolved issues--such as \n     deployment of Navy Upper Tier--was also proposed. The \n     Russians rejected both US approaches.\n       The May 1995 Joint Summit Statement was an effort to move \n     the negotiations away from technical parameters back to a set \n     of principles which would preserve both the ABM Treaty and \n     our ability to test and deploy needed theater missile \n     defenses. The latest US negotiating position was based on \n     that joint statement and was intended as just the sort of \n     ``change of course'' you suggest.\n       The Chiefs and I have been fully involved in developing US \n     positions and have never lost sight of our first \n     responsibility to protect US forces. We are unanimous in our \n     commitment to develop and field highly capable theater \n     missile defense systems. While cueing from space-based \n     sensors has yet to be incorporated into those systems, this \n     is currently in our plans.\n       With regard to broader security issues, the linkage between \n     the ABM Treaty and START II has been stressed repeatedly by \n     the Russians with US military representatives in many fora, \n     including discussions with members of the Duma. While there \n     are, of course, other factors at play in the Duma \n     considerations, one must assume that unilateral US \n     legislation could harm prospects for START II ratification \n     and probably impact our broader security relationship as \n     well.\n       In closing, the priority goal has been to provide the US \n     Armed Forces with best defenses technical experts are capable \n     of producing. But we also seek to reconcile requirements for \n     protection from theater ballistic missiles with further \n     strengthening of the framework of strategic stability, \n     including strategic arms reduction and the ABM Treaty. We are \n     working to achieve both these goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nstrike the missile defense provisions in the bill, because, if passed \nas is, I think this language will greatly complicate the work of our \nmilitary and of our diplomats in the years ahead. I have been \ninterested to hear that one of the reasons we have this in the bill, \napparently, is because we have sent a number of letters, or some \nMembers have sent a number of letters to the President, and did not get \na response. They either got no response or one they did not like, so \nthey decided to put it in legislation.\n  I can only say that I think taking that kind of action, when the \nleadership, in negotiating treaties and in seeing they are adhered to, \nis a function of the executive branch, does not ring very strongly with \nme, because I can remember--I could probably go back to the files and \nbring out a dozen or more letters I wrote during the Reagan \nadministration, during those 8 years and during the 4 years of the Bush \nadministration, and I may have gotten responses to some of those but \ncertainly not to all of them. That did not mean to me that I took over \nwhat the constitutional powers of the President are and put into law \nthings that would have tried to put my view into law, as opposed to \nwhat treaty requirements were or what treaties had been negotiated.\n  I say further that I think we are, obviously, talking a lot here \nabout the demarcation between theater missile defense and national \nmissile defense. That is a legitimate thing to try and work out. But to \ntake over and unilaterally on the part of the Congress define language \nthat would change the ABM Treaty or have that potential, I think, is \nwrong. I think we have to tread very carefully when we do that.\n  I think this could possibly harm our efforts to proceed with nuclear \narms reduction, not just with Russia, when we try and negotiate these \nthings with China, Britain, and France. It will raise new threats to \nthe global nuclear nonproliferation regime, especially its cornerstone, \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. It could establish an \nextremely undesirable new method for unilaterally reinterpreting \ntreaties, thus setting up a precedent that will obviously be used \nagainst us in the years ahead.\n  I think it could establish programs that would cost us a fortune. It \ncould divert money from military needs that are, in my opinion, much \nmore vital to the country and ultimately leave America substantially no \nsafer as a result. It tramples on the President's constitutional \nresponsibilities as Commander in Chief and as the individual in charge \nof American foreign policy. In short, I think this would be a very bad \nmistake for this country.\n  I would like to begin with a few comments about the general level of \npartisanship that we have seen from the proponents of these provisions \non the ABM Treaty. I hasten to add that I think missile defense should \nnot be a partisan affair. All Americans understand that (a), the \nnational interest may require the deployment of U.S. forces in unstable \nareas around the world. This bill contains some very undesirable \nfeatures, I feel, that, if enacted, could greatly complicate the work \nof our military and our diplomats in the years ahead.\n  Let me talk about ballistic missile defense. So (a), the national \ninterest may require deployment of U.S. forces in unstable regions \naround the world; and (b), these forces may be the targets of missile \nattacks, including missiles delivering weapons of mass destruction; and \n(c), such forces must be protected. That is something I am sure we can \nall agree on.\n  Now, though the committee has approved many of the administration's \nrequested theater missile defense projects, the majority's refusal to \nyield on several controversial proposals dealing with key missile \ndefense issues gives these proposals the quality of partisan ultimata \nrather than a sound foundation for policy. In other words, it is either \nor else.\n  Similarly, the bill's heavy emphasis on investing in expensive \nhardware for missile defense detracts from an equally, if not more \nimportant, goal: Pursuing means to reduce the numbers and performance \ncharacteristics of offensive missiles that may be fired against us in \ntheater conflicts. This goal typically requires significant \nimprovements in export controls, intelligence capabilities, analytic \ncapabilities for the conduct of arms control and nonproliferation \nverification activities,\n better coordination between our military and our diplomats and other \nsuch means.\n\n  The committee, however, is placing inordinate reliance upon technical \nfixes to counter missile attacks, rather than strengthening efforts to \nslow our halt of the proliferation of such missiles in the first place. \nThis position is unfortunate, since the latter will ultimately prove to \nbe a better investment of scarce taxpayers' dollars.\n  With respect to the missile defense provisions the bill does support, \nmany of these would considerably erode the stable consensus that exists \nto support ballistic missile defense efforts, would jeopardize both \nantiballistic missile, ABM and START II treaties, usurp the President's \nconstitutional powers with respect to the conduct of foreign relations \nand the performance of the role of Commander in Chief, or otherwise \nerode, rather than enhance, U.S. national security.\n  These conclusions, to me, follow from an examination of the following \nprovisions of the bill: First, the bill mandates, as a statutory policy \nobjective, an action that would violate the ABM Treaty. It establishes \na policy of deploying a multiple-site national missile defense network \nby the year 2003. That is in violation.\n  Second, the majority places into U.S. law a formal definition of an \nABM-permissible ballistic missile defense system. We can justifiably \nassume, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John \nShalikashvili, has warned, any such statutory definition could \njeopardize prospects for early ratification of the START II Treaty in \nthe \n\n[[Page S 11254]]\nRussian Parliament and negatively impact our broader security \nrelationship with Russia.\n  It seems only prudent that before the Congress ventures off with a \nunilateral interpretation of a major bilateral arms control accord, we \nshould consider very carefully several implications of such an action.\n  They would include: Is this the type of precedent we wish to \nestablish as a basis for treaty interpretation? Do we want to set an \nexample that can lead the Duma to legislate its own preferred \ndefinitions of vital terms of Russia's arms control and disarmament \ntreaties?\n  In other words, what if the Russian Duma, what if we had word coming \nthrough or had pictures on TV this evening on the news that the Russian \nDuma is unilaterally deciding to put a new interpretation into the ABM \nTreaty. What would we do? I know what we would do. We would think the \nwhole thing is null and void if they went ahead and legislated \npreferred definitions of vital terms of Russia's arms control and \ndisarmament treaties.\n  If Russia deployed enough ballistic missile defense sites containing \nmissiles just falling below the dictated threshold, could they \ncollectively acquire an ability to counter United States strategic \nnuclear forces? What will be the reactions of China and other powers if \nthe United States moves away from its ballistic missile defense \nrestraints?\n  I point out that these agreements are hammered out word by word by \nword over agonizingly long negotiations. The ABM Treaty was no \nexception to that. To change some of that wording, or to change an \ninterpretation of it unilaterally, means that our word in any other \ntreaty that we might have with any other place around the world--\nwhether China, Russia, wherever--is not going to be looked at as being \nworth very much.\n  While the committee majority has raised the specter of structural \nnuclear disarmament--a term that is supposed to describe our alleged \ninability to expand our nuclear arsenal in the event of future \nthreats--it ironically ignores completely the effects on our deterrent \nforce of releasing Russia from the treaty obligations that prevent it \nfrom acquiring a national missile defense capability.\n  The Russians are not going to just stand by and see us reinterpret \nthat treaty without feeling free to go their own way. They will no \nlonger be bound by that agreement that was hammered out over a long \nperiod of time.\n  So, if the opponents in the ongoing missile defense debate have their \nway, and that ``fearsome beast,'' the ABM Treaty, is finally slain, the \ncredibility of America's strategic missile forces would almost \nimmediately be called into question as Russia begins to deploy its own \nlarge-scale national missile defense force.\n  What would prevent them from doing it? Certainly not the treaty that \nwe would have violated at the time. It seems to me, if the majority is \ntruly interested in avoiding this structural nuclear disarmament, as it \nis called, it should do all it can to ensure that U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent retains its credibility. This is exactly what the ABM Treaty \nhelps to achieve, by barring Russia from creating its own national \nstrategic missile defense system.\n  The treaty accomplishes this, moreover, without the need for a \ndiplomatically and financially costly expansion of our offensive \nnuclear capabilities. So-called deficit hawks in Congress today should, \ntherefore, love the ABM Treaty, not revile it. It works to preserve our \ndeterrent and saves plenty of money at the same time. One of the \nestimates by CBO has indicated that even a partial national missile \ndefense system would cost about $48 billion, at a time when we really \ndo not need it, as testimony and as the letters from the Secretary of \nDefense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have indicated.\n  I am afraid our colleagues in the majority, however, have turned a \ncollective blind eye to these considerations. They appear to believe \nthat unilateral United States actions to ensure against our own \nnational missile vulnerability will instantly translate into a safer \nAmerica and not lead Russia to reduce its vulnerability to our own \nstrategic missile attacks.\n  In its enthusiasm not to miss an opportunity to bash the ABM Treaty, \nthe majority is urging a course of action that can weaken our nuclear \ndeterrent capability, can stimulate an offensive nuclear arms race, and \neventually funnel tens or hundreds of billions of dollars into \nelaborate strategic national missile defense schemes, none of which, of \ncourse, will ever free American citizens from risk of nuclear attack.\n  The bill seems to enshrine into law what is known as the fallacy of \nthe last move, which holds that any increment in our own security will \ntake place without any detrimental side effects. I lose a lot more \nsleep over the side effects than I do over the slogan of ``structural \nnuclear disarmament.''\n  The Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings, coupled with the \nTokyo gas attacks should serve as a sobering reminder that weapons of \nmass destruction can be delivered by a variety of means other than \nmissiles. It does not mean we are not concerned about missiles. We are. \nFurthermore, our intelligence officials have repeatedly testified the \nUnited States will not face a new missile threat until sometime in the \nnext century.\n  The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. James \nClapper, testified before the Select Committee on Intelligence last \nJanuary: ``We see no interest in or capability of any new country \nreaching the continental United States with a long-range missile for at \nleast the next decade.''\n  We should not permit a fixation with delivery systems to distract our \nattention from the important goal of halting the proliferation of \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.\n  Third, the majority voted down on a straight party vote a proposal by \nSenator Levin to ensure that America's theater missile defense systems \nwill not be given strategic antiballistic missile capabilities, a \nproposal that was essentially a restatement of existing law, existing \nlaw under the ABM Treaty.\n  Fourth, the majority insisted on almost doubling the size of the \nadministration's request for national missile defense projects, despite \nthe majority's complete inability to identify any new foreign threat \nagainst which such a defense would be directed.\n  I do not believe that a highly conjectural North Korean missile \nthreat to the Aleutian Islands sometime in the 21st century is \nsufficient grounds for America to abandon the ABM Treaty. I doubt North \nKorea will even manage to survive as a country by that time. It may \nnot, anyway.\n  Furthermore, there is a fundamental contradiction in the majority's \nwillingness to write a blank check on behalf of national missile \ndefense and yet apply the sternest possible accounting standards for \nthe more modest sums that we authorized elsewhere in this bill to such \nprograms as humanitarian assistance and foreign disaster relief.\n  I would add, the systems we are talking about have yet to be \ninvented. We made some progress in setting up systems, or doing some \nresearch in years past, but to mandate at this point we will have any \nof these systems by the year 2003, which is what is in the systems we \nare proposing here, is wishful thinking. Some of the claims under star \nwars were made back some years ago. I talked to the people at the \nPentagon who were working in these areas, who had some confidence in \nthose systems, or said they did. I thought some of the claims were so \npreposterous I went out to some of the laboratories where work was \ngoing on on the so-called star wars system. The scientists who were \nworking on the systems out there almost laughed about some of the \nclaims being made on star wars at that time. It was not just a matter \nof having the money to deploy, to cut the hardware and deploy it. We \nhad not yet invented the systems. Yet we are talking about now we can \nset up a national missile defense system, just a partial one, for $48 \nbillion, with equipment that has yet to be invented and certainly \nshould not be deployed on a timetable between now and the year 2003. \nWithin 8 years, we are supposed to now have this and it has to be \ndeployed. And that is ridiculous.\n  Star wars before was talking about deformable laser mirrors, 12 feet \nacross, that could take lasers of a power not yet invented, and focus \nit on a spot out there several hundred miles in space the size of a \ngolf ball. At least \n\n[[Page S 11255]]\nthe first step would be to focus it on a mirror in space that could be \ndeformed, then focus it in turn on a spot the size of a golf ball \nseveral hundred miles away on a missile coming up at a changing rate of \nspeed, and keep it focused on that area. We do not have the computer \ncapacity nor the technology yet developed to enable us to do some of \nthose things that were claimed years ago.\n  Now we are saying we have some different systems. But those systems \nare anything but proven and are anything but systems that should be set \nup on a time schedule that would have to be in place by law by the year \n2003.\n  What do we think the Soviets would be doing all this same time? I \nknow what the Duma would probably do, our counterpart over there in \nRussia. The Duma probably is going to say, OK, if all bets are off on \nthe ABM Treaty, then the very first thing we are going to do is put all \nthe coordinates back in on American targets we just took out of our \nmissiles in agreement with the Americans, back just a few months ago. \nTo me, that would be very silly if we did anything that might lead them \ninto that kind of activity.\n  Yet, if the Russians were doing the same thing we are debating here \ntoday, I can guarantee the first thing I would be doing on the floor \nwould be demanding we put their coordinates back in our missiles if \nthey were advocating abrogating the ABM Treaty and deploying a missile \ndefense system that neither side thought we needed to deploy.\n  Much has been written about the dangers of new isolationism as a \nforeign policy doctrine. Its companion in defense policy I guess would \nbe called a fortress America. Nothing is more reflective of this \ndoctrine than the current bill's fundamentally misguided policy \napproaches on nuclear testing and the ABM Treaty.\n  So I am still hopeful a new bipartisanship will emerge in the years \nahead, however, behind policies that reflect a greater awareness of the \ncosts of a modern national defense, a greater sensitivity to \ninternational reactions to U.S. defense actions, greater appreciation \nof the unexploited potential that lies in creative international \nsolutions to security problems, and a greater emphasis on preventing \nproliferation rather than trying to manage it. If we abrogate the ABM \nTreaty or put language in here, in this legislation, or permit language \nto stay in that allows the Duma, in its own right, to start \nreinterpreting the ABM Treaty, then I do not see any option but what we \nare into an arms race again. Just as we spent probably most of the past \ndecade taking some of those dangers down, reducing our arms, taking the \ntargeting out of our missiles and the Soviets took it out--the Russians \ntook it out of their missiles, I think we are in danger of reversing \nthis whole direction, this trend that has been set in place over the \npast 10 years, and to cope with a threat that is not out there, by the \nbest testimony we have from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and spend a lot of money in the whole \nprocess, $48 billion for a very limited defense system that will not be \na full national missile defense. It would be, basically, a missile \ndefense that covers five States.\n  So I support the change proposed by the Senator from Michigan. I hope \nour colleagues will look at this very, very carefully. If we are to put \ninto law something that encourages the ABM Treaty to be questioned and \nthe Soviets to have less confidence in the American willingness to \nabide by that treaty, I think we will have made a drastic mistake in \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just take a minute. I want to see if we cannot get \nagreement on time here. We have been on this amendment since 11 \no'clock. I have been listening to people ask for time agreements. We \nare not even close to a time agreement.\n  This bill is dying on the floor. This may be a very important \namendment, but we intend to complete action on this bill by tomorrow \nnight or I do not see when it comes up again. Because Friday--Saturday \nwe will do appropriations bills, maybe one or two appropriations bills. \nMaybe late Saturday afternoon we can start on welfare reform, and then \nlate in the week take up the defense appropriations bill.\n  If we want to pass the DOD bill we have to have cooperation. If we do \nnot want to pass it, I assume we can take 6 or 7 hours on this \namendment. It has been 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Is there any indication, any willingness to enter into a time \nagreement at this point? The Senator from Michigan----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If that is addressed to me, we are very willing to enter \ninto a time agreement. Two Senators who wanted to speak have already \nspoken. There is one now who says he is willing to give up his time. I \nam adding it up and I will come up with a figure in about 2 minutes, \nnow.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just wait until the Senator adds it up. If we do not \nget it now, it may be another hour.\n\n\n                                Title 31\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the majority leader yield so I may make an announcement \non behalf of Senator Thurmond? This is a very important announcement \nfor all Members of the Senate. Senator Thurmond and Senator Domenici \npropose to offer a substitute amendment to title 31 of Senate bill \n1026. This amendment contains numerous changes. In order to allow all \nSenators an opportunity to review it, copies of the amendment will be \navailable in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe, if I may just add to the statement of my \ncolleague from Arizona, that is the energy section of the bill that has \nbeen worked on for 2 or 3 days.\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, when the Senator from Michigan adds the time \nthere, we may want some time on the other side of the amendment. \nHopefully not as much. I do not think it would take as much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We need 1 hour and 50 minutes on this side.\n  Mr. DOLE. Say 2 hours on that side, and 1 hour on this side? So we \ncould vote, then, by maybe 4:30, depending on how much time we use? I \ndo not think we need 2 hours on this side. I just want to get the time \nagreement.\n  If there is no objection, let me propose this consent agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 3 hours on the Levin amendment \nprior to a motion to table, to be divided 2 hours for Senator Levin or \nhis designee, 1 hour for Senator Thurmond or his designee, no second-\ndegree amendments or amendments to the language proposed to be stricken \nbe in order prior to a failed motion to table, and any second-degree \namendment or amendment to the language proposed to be stricken be \nrelevant to the first-degree amendment, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, Senator Thurmond or his designee \nbe recognized to table the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nintend to object, did the unanimous consent preclude second-degree \namendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. No, not until after a motion to table, if it is not tabled.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would be open to second-degree amendments which are \nrelevant.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, I would hope we are about to \nbe in a place where we could agree to this. I heard the leader say that \nthere would be no second-degree amendments. Now I understand. I was not \nclear.\n  If I understand correctly, the amendment offered under the unanimous \nconsent agreement by the majority leader, if we agree to this time \nagreement, as he has just spelled out, there would be no allowable \nsecond-degree amendment to the Levin amendment until after a tabling \nmotion.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. After a tabling motion, then a second-degree amendment \nwould be in order.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is what we have done here the last several times.\n  Mr. EXON. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object for one more moment, in the \n\n[[Page S 11256]]\n  event that it is not tabled, then in the event more second-degree \namendments are offered, there is not in this unanimous consent any time \nlimit on those second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is true. This only refers to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, under this time agreement I would like to \nyield myself 20 minutes, and I ask to be notified when that 20 minutes \nhas expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since the Senator from Ohio just spoke in \nfavor of the amendment, I thought I would take some of our time to \nspeak in opposition to the amendment.\n  It seems to me that the arguments in favor of the amendment boil down \nto three: First of all, variations of the theme of the ABM Treaty is \nrelatively sacrosanct; second, we have to do everything possible to \navoid riling the Russians, doing something they may not like; and, \nthird, that we should not limit the power of the President.\n  Let me discuss each of those arguments in turn. First of all, \nregarding the 1972 ABM Treaty, I think it is important to recognize \nthat the ABM Treaty has, since its inception in 1972, been under the \nprocess of negotiation. There have been discussions going on between \nour two countries almost throughout that period of time. So the fact \nthat we may be talking about making changes in it is nothing new, and \nit has never been interpreted as a breach or an anticipatory breach of \ntreaty for the United States to be stating that we want to change a \nparticular part of the agreement. As a matter of fact, the original ABM \nTreaty called for two national ballistic missile sites, not one. That \nwas amended to one site. And one of the things that is being called for \nin the underlying legislation here is multiple sites.\n  I think almost all of us would agree that it does not make sense for \nus to deploy an ABM system in this country if we cannot have multiple \nsites. It just will not be effective. So that is our stated policy in \nthe legislation. That is nothing new. It is nothing that the Russians \nshould get excited about. As a matter of fact, I am not even sure what \ntheir position would be. I would not be surprised at all if they would \nagree that multiple sites are appropriate. So I do not think that is a \nbig problem with the policy stated in the bill for multiple sites.\n  The second point under this first argument is that demarcation, as \ncalled for in legislation here, does not violate the ABM Treaty. As a \nmatter of fact, the administration has already been demarking what is \nappropriate testing for a theater ballistic missile system, and has \nalready been discussing that with the Russians.\n  Bob Bell, former staff member of the committee, a prominent \nspecialist at the National Security Council, told the National Defense \nUniversity that, ``We have already reached an agreement with the \nRussians that you can shoot at a target that goes 5 kilometers per \nsecond and not have it captured as an ABM.'' The problem here is, of \ncourse, that the negotiations that the administration has been engaging \nin went further than that, and accepted, at least temporarily, Russian \ndemands that the proposed demarcation also include a speed limit on the \nUnited States' interceptor of 3 kilometers per second, which would in \neffect dumb down our system to the point where it would not be as \nrobust as we would want it to be.\n  The point here is that you cannot argue demarcation per se is a \nviolation of the ABM Treaty. The administration has done it. That has \nbeen policy. The question before us is whether or not we will in \nlegislation demark that limit at which we can test our theater \nballistic missile system since it has never been a part of the ABM \nTreaty. I think that is an important point for us to make. Again, the \nABM Treaty only limits strategic systems. It does not limit theater \nsystems.\n  All the demarcation in the Warner language does is to define the \nlevel of testing that can be engaged in for theater systems. There \nshould not be anything wrong with that. The administration has already \nengaged in demarcation. As a matter of fact, in a speech before the \nNational Defense University, again referring to Bob Bell, he ably \nexplained that this question of identifying the demarcation between ABM \nand TMD has been an issue for as long as the treaty has been around, \nand, as a matter of fact, it has changed. One of the things he said is, \nwhat is a TMD and what is not a TMD goes back to the ratification \nhearings and the negotiations themselves.\n  During the Senate hearings on the ABM Treaty in 1972, then-Director \nof Defense Research and Engineering, Johnny Foster, was asked by \nSenator Proxmire, ``Where is the line? Where is the distinction between \nthe two?'' He said, ``If you shoot a missile interceptor at a target \nthat goes faster than 2 kilometers per second, that is an ABM.''\n  Of course we all know that demarcation is unacceptable today. That is \nthe point. Technology changes. It has been 23 years since the ABM \nTreaty was adopted.\n  What we are trying to do in this legislation is to keep up with the \ntimes. As a matter of fact, our own Defense Department has made the \npoint that the treaty has not kept up with the times, and the gentleman \nwho is now the CIA Director, John Deutch, has made the point that the \ntreaty, the ABM Treaty, constrains us in ways that technology should \nnot anymore. And, as a result, it seems to the committee--and it seems \nto me--that it is important for the United States to draw this \ndemarcation so that we can test the systems that we could ultimately \ndeploy against theater threats.\n  Why is it important to have the language in the bill? Because the \nadministration in effect proposes to dumb down our TMD. And that is the \nproblem. In both the Patriot system and the THAAD system earlier, we \ndumbed them down. The reason the Patriot could not be any more \nsuccessful in the gulf war was because of decisions made right after \nthe ABM Treaty that in effect preclude the use of certain sensors to \nenable it to be more robust.\n  We have done the same thing with the THAAD system in taking out \ncertain software and making certain hardware changes that precluded it \nfrom being as robust as it otherwise would be in meeting these threats. \nWe cannot do this anymore. And we should not dumb down our TMD system.\n  Our demarcation language in the bill merely proscribes tests against \nstrategic missiles, as I said, and that enables us then to continue to \ntest the theater system in a way that would make it effective against \nfuture threats.\n  Let me quote, as a matter of fact, from General Shalikashvili. He has \nbeen quoted before. Let me first of all quote a January 3 memo to \nDeputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch. Here is what he said General \nShalikashvili said:\n\n        The United States should make no further concessions and \n     even start thinking about rolling back the U.S. negotiating \n     position.\n\n  The reason that General Shalikashvili, I believe, made that statement \nis because he understood that the position that Bob Bell had negotiated \nwith the Russians that I referred to earlier was as far as this country \nshould go; that if we went any further, we would arbitrarily be putting \nlimits on our theater systems in ways that we should not do. That would \nmake them less capable of meeting future threats. That is why he said \nat that time that we should make no further concessions and even start \nthinking about rolling back the U.S. negotiating position.\n  That is the real position of General Shalikashvili. That is the \nposition which is embodied in this legislation, to make no further \nconcessions with regard to this demarcation.\n  Finally, with respect to this argument that the ABM Treaty is sort of \nsacrosanct, I want to make this point. There is no anticipatory breach \nin the bill at all because, of course, there are two specific \nconditions. No. 1, there can be amendments to the ABM Treaty. That is \nall we are suggesting should eventually occur here. But it is suggested \nthat maybe the Russians will not agree with the policies stated in the \nbill, and they will not agree to those negotiations or to our position.\n  The United States can always withdraw from the ABM Treaty after \nhaving given 6 months' notice if that is \n\n[[Page S 11257]]\ndeemed to be in the interest of the United States. So should we deem it \nto be in the interest of the United States to act in ways that the \nRussians would deem inimical to continuation with the ABM Treaty, they \ncan either negotiate or the United States can step out of the treaty. \nThe bill itself does not violate the treaty.\n  I want to make that point crystal clear.\n  There is some notion that has been seeping into this debate that \nsomehow there is still a cold war going on here.\n  The cold war is over. The Soviet Union, with whom we negotiated the \nABM Treaty, is no longer even in existence. The threats that the \ntheater ballistic missiles are designed to thwart are not necessarily \nthreats emanating from the Soviet Union or now Russia but, rather, are \nthreats coming from countries like North Korea and Iraq and Iran, and \ncountries of that sort.\n  Therefore, we cannot be proscribed from acting against those threats \nbecause of an ABM Treaty with the Russians. We need to proceed to \ndevelop theater missiles that can protect the United States, protect \nour forces deployed abroad, and protect our allies against these \ntheater threats, whether they come from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, or \nwhatever. So the ABM Treaty really ought not to stop us from doing it.\n  The second point is that it would cause the Russians to react \nnegatively. It would not be a reason for the United States to forego \nactions which are clearly in our national interest. The argument that \nis being made here is the same argument that was used against the \nReagan initiatives that in fact today are credited with ending the cold \nwar. Maybe the Russians will react badly to this. Well, as it turned \nout, by taking bold action, we were able to win peace through strength. \nThe cold war is over because of the initiatives we took and because we \ndid not listen to those who said the Russians might react badly to this \nif we do it. So I do not necessarily think that is a good argument.\n  I again refer to the now CIA Director, John Deutch, on the ABM \nTreaty. In some respects, the technology has exceeded the limits of the \nABM Treaty, and we have to go forward with the technology to protect \nourselves not just from Russian threats but from threats around the \nrest of the world. And the problem of waiting for the Russians to agree \nis that this is no longer a bipolar world and we have these other \nthreats to be concerned about.\n  It is also, I think, an important point to make that the Russian Duma \nis not likely to ratify the START II Treaty in any event, and this is \nclear from a variety of things that come out of Russia. So to suggest \nthat the action we take here is going to prevent Russia from ratifying \nthe START II Treaty is not relevant.\n  Chairman of the Duma's Foreign Relations Committee, Vladimir Lukin \nsaid:\n\n       We need big money to carry out these reductions [in START \n     II], and we don't have it. We do not want to ratify this \n     treaty and then not be able to comply with its terms. We will \n     have to wait until we see how to pay for our promises.\n\n  That is the reason--or at least that is one of the reasons--nothing \nto do with what we are talking about today.\n  Others suggest that ratification should be tied to other \ninternational issues.\n  The Speaker of the Federation Council, their upper chamber, Vladimir \nShumeyko, said:\n\n       We closely link [START II] ratification with the overall \n     situation existing between Russia and NATO. . . We consider \n     the perseverance of NATO as a stumbling block to our \n     cooperation in the era of disarmament and advancement on the \n     road to peace.\n\n  And still others see START II as inimical to Russian interests. \nViktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, said:\n\n       If this treaty [START II] is fully implemented, the United \n     States will almost double its superiority, while the damage \n     to Russia's national security will be unrecoverable.\n\n  There are many more quotations that I could cite.\n  The point is there are a lot of reasons why a lot of Russians do not \nwant to ratify the START II Treaty. It is not because of what we are \ndoing in this legislation here today.\n  Finally, let me just refer to this notion of anticipatory breach. If \nwe are going to use that legal doctrine here, we also ought to refer to \nthe equitable doctrine of clean hands.\n  I will not take the time here to recite the numerous instances of \nSoviet and Russian violations of treaties that we have negotiated, but \nthey are numerous. And in some respects we have chosen to ignore those \nviolations because we believe that it is important to continue the \ndialog and to keep the process moving. But the fact is it would be \nanomalous for the Russians to consider that a policy we state today \nthat in no way involves a violation of the treaty is some kind of a big \ndeal when they are in violation of a variety of treaties, and should my \ncolleagues desire we can put that information in the Record.\n  The final argument that is given as a reason to support the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan is that the language of the bill ties the \nPresident's hands. What we do here is two things. We call for a study \nto determine what the administration should negotiate relative to the \nABM Treaty. We are not saying what the administration has to negotiate. \nWe are saying let us have a study and pick those areas where we want to \nmake a change. One of them I think is going to be clear. We should not \ngo forward in this country to deploy a national defense missile system \nat one site. That would not make sense. So one of the items clearly is \ngoing to be let us ask the Russians to negotiate this multiple site. \nThat is the only way we should deploy a national system. And I do not \nsee what the problem with that is.\n  In the meantime, we are saying let us not use defense funds to \ncontinue, the administration should not use the 050 account to continue \nto make concessions to the Russians on matters that ought to be either \nthe subject of further negotiation or at least the administration ought \nto come to the Senate to discuss them with us.\n  That is the final point I wish to make here. We have been trying for \nmonths to get the administration to work with us. That is what advice \nand consent is all about. And it is true that there are prerogatives of \nthe administration that are important to be protected, and I do not \nwant to step on those. But it is also true that the Senate has \nprerogatives. We have the right of advice and consent, and thus far the \nadministration has generally ignored the position that at least those \nof us on this side have taken. What we are asking in this legislation \nis that you not go any further--in fact, we are demanding that the \nadministration go no further in the direction of making further \nconcessions to the Russians in ways that would limit our ability to \ndevelop our theater systems which can be used not just against Russians \nbut against other potential threats; that they do not do that; that \nthey not use defense funds for that purpose. That is why we are saying \nit is important for us to be talking to the administration.\n  If the administration wants to get together with us and talk about \nwhat they can do, if they want to submit the changes to the Senate, \nthen well and good. So far that has not been the administration's \nposition.\n  So with regard to the argument that we are stepping on the \nadministration's prerogative, I would just note that the administration \nhas been ignoring the Senate and its advice and consent prerogatives, \nand it is time for us to be giving a little advice and asking for the \nability to consent to what the administration is doing.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line here is that the Armed Services \nCommittee came up with a very good bill, and I wish to commend the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, who is here; Senator Lott \nis a member of the committee; Senator Warner made an excellent \nstatement here this morning in opposition to the amendment of the \nSenator from Michigan, and I believe that it would be in the best \ninterests of the United States for this body to agree with the Armed \nServices Committee to vote down the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska. \n\n[[Page S 11258]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening and waiting very \npatiently for my turn to make some remarks on this matter. I had \nhesitation about the unanimous-consent agreement because this is one of \nthe most important matters, if not the most important matter in my view \nthat I have been a part of in my 17 years in the Senate.\n  Notwithstanding the desire to move on briskly, I simply say that I \nhope, regardless of political affiliation, we will all take a very \nclose look at what we may be about to do unless the Levin, et al, \namendment, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor, is passed.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from Arizona and his rather \ninteresting remarks, and during those remarks the Senator from Arizona \nmentioned the names of several very prominent administration officials, \nincluding Bob Bell at the White House, National Security Council. He \nmentioned the present CIA Director, the former second man at the \nDepartment of Defense. He mentioned the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shalikashvili.\n  I simply want to say that I am not indicating the Senator from \nArizona has misrepresented any of the statements that those individuals \nhave made, but I have checked, while the Senator from Arizona was \naddressing the Senate, with Bob Bell at the White House. Bob Bell tells \nme that, notwithstanding the name dropping, all of the individuals \nmentioned by the Senator from Arizona to substantiate his position of \nbeing against the Levin amendment is not shared by anyone in the \nadministration including each and every one of the officials mentioned \nin support of his argument by the Senator from Arizona.\n  This is a tremendously important matter. My judgment is that this \nshould not come down to a party-line vote.\n  I am afraid it is going to be a party-line vote. Maybe if we can just \nreach a few Republicans. I would guess at this time that we would not \nlose more than one or two Democratic votes, two at the most, on this \nside of the aisle, maybe none, which means that we Democrats are \ntalking to five, six or seven of our Republican friends asking that \nthey look very closely at this before they vote against the Levin \namendment.\n  I thought it was rather ironic a couple hours ago while I was on the \nfloor at that particular time there were four Senators on the floor. \nThere was Senator Nunn, for whom I have great respect and with whom I \nhave worked closely for 17 years; there was the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, my dear friend, and no one has more respect in this \nbody, in the view of this Senator, than my friend Strom Thurmond from \nSouth Carolina; there was John Warner, who came to the Senate the same \ntime as this Senator. And the four of us happened to be here on the \nfloor.\n  There have been many very important statements made and, I thought, \nwell thought out by Members on both sides of this issue. It is an issue \nthat may not be clear-cut in some people's minds. For 17 years, I \nbelieve, on national defense matters I have stood hand in hand with the \nSenator from South Carolina, the Senator from Virginia and others. I do \nnot know that we have been very far apart, if far at all, on many \nissues. I can include Senator Lott, a Member of the Senate that I work \nvery closely with; Senator Levin; and others.\n  I simply say that we are at a point where I do not feel it is fair to \nindicate people are in bad faith on that side of the aisle on the \nmatter. I just hope they will listen to the pleas that we are making on \nthis side. Maybe a good way to put it is, I think they know not what \nthey do. They are not badly intentioned. I think they know not what \nthey do.\n  To put this in perspective, I would like to ask a question of the \nSenator from Michigan on this matter that may put this in some kind of \nperspective as far as this Senator sees it. Notwithstanding the \nprotestations to the contrary, if the Levin amendment is not adopted, I \nfeel that we have gone a long way down the road to disrupt some of the \nadvances that have taken place over the last few years with regard to \ndownplaying the role of dependence on nuclear devices. It is this \nSenator's feeling--and I am wondering to what degree this is shared by \nmy friend and colleague from the State of Michigan. Senator Levin and I \ncame here at the same time. We have sat side by side on the Armed \nServices Committee. We have generally agreed. And I would generally \ninclude him in that group of bipartisan Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, that have worked hand in hand on critical defense matters.\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I want to ask Senator Levin \nthis question: If your amendment striking basically the references to \nthe ABM Treaty fails, it is the opinion of this Senator that such \naction, if your amendment fails, will probably end any chance of \nfinally completing in a successful fashion the implementation of the \nSTART I treaty. In all likelihood, further, it will scuttle any chances \nof cooperation to obtain ratification of the START II treaty and then \nfurther eliminations of the number of nuclear warheads that were \nplanned to follow on beyond that. I think it drives a stake through the \nheart of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. I think it certainly would do \ngreat harm to any chances that we have with regard to the \nnonproliferation treaties that we are interested in. And last and \ncertainly not least, I would think this action very likely would go a \nlong way to maintain a conventional forces understanding in Europe \nmeaningful from the standpoint of seeking some form of stability in the \nworld. All of these things, I think, have a very grave threat of \nextinction if we proceed in the fashion that the ABM Treaty language \nthat the Senator from Michigan is trying to strike as it came out of \nthe committee remains.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is right. In my view and, even more important \nby far, in General Shalikashvili's view when he says in his letter to \nSenator Warner, the following:\n\n       With regard to broader security issues, the linkage between \n     the ABM Treaty and the START II has been stressed repeatedly \n     by the Russians and U.S. military representatives in many \n     forums, including discussions with many Members of the Duma. \n     While there are, of course, other factors that play in the \n     Duma consideration, one must assume that unilateral U.S. \n     legislation could harm prospects for START II ratification \n     and probably impact our broader security relationship as \n     well.\n\n  And it is that broader security relationship that I think my good \nfriend from Nebraska is referring to. And I do agree with his \nassessment of the impact. But again, our top military officer agrees, \nour Secretary of Defense agrees, our Secretary of State agrees with \nthat assessment.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Michigan. Let me summarize, if I \ncan, some of the overall problems that I see with this measure that I \npartially addressed in remarks this morning.\n  The way this came out of the committee it attacks the limits of the \nNunn-Lugar proposal that has been responsible for the safe and \naccountable disarming of over 2,500 former Soviet Union warheads. It \ncuts the Energy Department nonproliferation arms control and \nverification funding. It recommends reconstituting our nuclear weapons \nmanufacturing complex at untold billions of dollars, while at the same \ntime advocating the resumption of U.S. nuclear weapons testing. This \nlast committee initiative is contrary to U.S. policy, and it is \ndesigned to scuttle ongoing comprehensive test ban negotiations and any \nprospect of reaching a treaty agreement.\n  I will have some more to say about this later on as we go into other \nparticular issues under consideration in this bill. Let me simply say, \nthough, I am concerned with the tone and the substance of the bill and \nthe level of micromanagement placed on the Pentagon and the Department \nof Energy is unprecedented and harmful to our Nation's standing in the \ninternational community. Many of the committee initiatives are driven \nby a desire to defend against a superpower threat to U.S. security that \nsimply does not exist. At the same time, when one-time enemies are now \nallies and the world community is committed more than ever before to \nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts, the committee bill is at odds \nwith the reality and the strong \n\n[[Page S 11259]]\nneed of amendment before it can properly serve our Nation's security \ninterests. At a time when American leadership in the world community is \nstrongly needed, we cannot be viewed as a nation living in the past, \njousting with our imaginary dragons in order to lay claim to the mantle \nof being strong on defense. We are a strong country, the preeminent \nmilitary power of the world by far. But we must also be forward looking \nand recognize that it is in our national interest as well as the \ninterest of other nations to encourage arms control and alliances based \non collective security. It is unfortunate that some feel more \ncomfortable in an adversarial environment than in one based on \ncooperation and lowering of superpower antagonism.\n  Like a beehive, the world in 1995 has the capacity to be both \ndangerous and peaceful. And handled properly, the hive can be benign \nand capable of producing sweet honey. If agitated, however, it can \nbecome hostile and threatening. The defense authorization bill in its \npresent form is a sharp stick ready to be jabbed into the hive. The \ndesign and intent of the bill is to agitate the world community to the \nultimate detriment of ourselves. This is not the time in history to \nrekindle the rhetoric of the cold war. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment that will correct these and other self-defeating elements \nof this flawed legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a defense bill must meet threats, real \nthreats, not shadows or ghosts of threats disappeared.\n  Our military leaders and our intelligence services have properly \nidentified the threats our Nation faces.\n  They have come before us and told us what threats we face.\n  We have ignored much of their counsel and drafted a bill addressed to \nthe realities of yesterday and a dark view of a possible future tens of \nyears away.\n  This provision if enacted will take a step toward abrogating the \nantiballistic missile treaty, scuttling the START II Treaty, and \nlaunching us back into the arms race of the cold war.\n  This bill includes many weapons systems designed to match a missile \nthreat from the Soviet Union that does not exist. Due to the diligent \nefforts of former President Bush, President Clinton, our diplomats and \nSenators like Mr. Nunn and Mr. Lugar, we have been able to \nsubstantially curtail that threat, to destroy hundreds of the missiles \nthat used to be aimed at our nations, and to divert the targeting of \nthe others that still remain.\n  Since 1991, the Nunn-Lugar program has helped the states of the \nformer Soviet Union to destroy their weapons of mass destruction and \nreduce the threat posed by proliferation of these weapons. This program \nremains an example of concise policy designed to meet an identified \nthreat and has significantly improved our national security.\n  We cannot stress to the appropriate degree how important arms control \nefforts have been to our national security. Today, as a result of \nbipartisan efforts from different administrations, Russia is planning \nto eliminate 6,000 nuclear warheads that formerly were directed toward \nour Nation. That is far more than any national missile defense could \nhope to destroy.\n  It would be a shame if the other provisions of this bill caused this \nprogress to be in vain.\n  Therefore, I reject the provisions in this bill that if enacted will \nmost likely resurrect an arms race between the United States and \nRussia.\n  By unilaterally deciding what the ABM standard is in regard to \nmissile interceptors, the Senate would disrupt the negotiating process \ncurrently underway. Not only is this an unwarranted intrusion into the \nnormal working of foreign policy, this provision dangerously increases \nthe risk that the ABM and other weapons treaties will be abrogated \ncompletely by the Russians.\n  Later this year the Russian Duma was to vote on the ratification of \nSTART II. After they see the provisions in this bill regarding the ABM \ntreaty, and realize how we plan to have a missile defense system that \ncould theoretically counter an attack on the United States, the \nincentive to destroy the thousands of weapons called for in START II \nwill be greatly diminished.\n  Regardless of what we tell them, the Russians will logically be \nthinking, why destroy our missiles when we may need them to get through \na U.S. missile defense system?\n  Though its proponents claim this measure will protect us from a \nchange in Russian policy, this measure will only further destabilize \nour relations and cause the hardliners in Russia to question our \ncommitment to START II.\n  We would be throwing away a chance to destroy literally thousands of \nnuclear weapons on the faint hope that we can build an impenetrable \nmissile defense system.\n  To justify the national missile defense system now when the Soviet \nthreat is gone, the supporters of this bill are countering the views of \nour professional military and intelligence personnel and telling the \nAmerican people a threat exists elsewhere when in fact it does not.\n  The supporters of this bill say that North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or \nLibya now have or will have shortly the ability to launch a missile \nthat can reach our shores. That is simply not the case.\n  The report to this bill specifically notes the possible threat from \nthe North Korean Taepo Dong II missile, which the report claims may \nhave the range to hit Alaska. Since this weapon is in development, we \ndo not in fact know that this missile will be capable of that range. \nBut with North Korea in such dire straits economically and the growing \npossibility of its opening, with reunification with the south \nincreasingly likely, should we spend billions on a missile defense \nsystem that probably won't work to counter a threat that may never \nexist?\n  Our professional military and intelligence personnel, the people who \nhave the training, the knowledge, and the access to the most sensitive \nof information to judge these threats, say there is no threat from any \nindigenously developed missile for the next 10 years. Yet the \nsupporters of these provisions do not believe those who know the most \nabout this subject.\n  This presumed threat does not justify spending the tax money of \nAmerican citizens on unproven and untested antiballistic missile \ndefense.\n  This bill adds $300 million this year toward a national missile \ndefense system. In 1993, the GAO reported that the cost of such a \nsystem would total $35 billion and a CBO estimate from earlier this \nyear pegged the cost at $48 billion. As we know from past estimates, \nthese estimates would probably be low.\n  The bill calls for the deployment of this system even though it is \nunproven and untested.\n  Under the most likely of scenarios, the nuclear umbrella this would \ncreate would be a leaky one that fails to completely protect our Nation \nif the nonexistent threat were to become real. With nuclear, chemical \nor biological weapons, anything less than 100 percent certainty will \nnot suffice.\n  One clear lesson from history is that in military affairs, those who \nconcentrate their efforts on defense are bound to fail. In the 1930's \nand 1940's France felt secure behind the Maginot Line. Their defensive \nposture was outwitted and decimated by a German Army dedicated to the \noffensive. When it comes to threats to the United States today, the \nmeans chosen to deliver a weapon of mass destruction would very likely \nbe something other than a missile. It may be a cliche that the best \ndefense is a good offense, but it is also true. We should look to \ncounter any incipient threat from rogue nations through a robust \noffensive capability.\n  If someone is intent on attacking the United States, they need not be \nrocket scientists to figure out our Nation's vulnerabilities. Why spend \nmillions of dollars on missiles whose launch we can instantly trace and \nrespond to with enough devastating force to destroy an entire \ncivilization? No, our potential adversaries would most likely seek the \npath of least resistance. The delivery system posing the greatest \nthreat is the rental truck, not a ballistic missile. We face that real \nthreat through offensive actions against rogue nations and terrorist \ngroups.\n  We can support and focus our offensive capability through intense \nintelligence activities, so our policymakers and military commanders \nknow most about what countries or groups are developing weapons of mass \ndestruction, delivery systems, and the characteristics and locations of \nthese systems. Next, the full diplomatic and economic \n\n[[Page S 11260]]\npowers of our Nation can be used to counter the threat that may \ndevelop. Then, if the developers cannot be dissuaded in peacetime, the \nweapons themselves can be destroyed either preemptively or in war.\n  I have heard other Senators state that the United States is \nvulnerable to an accidental ballistic missile attack. The truth is, the \nsituation today is the same as it has been for 30 years. We have \nmanaged to survive this long because governments have stressed proper \nsecurity and operating procedures for these terrible weapons. Nations \nunderstand the gravity of a mistake when nuclear weapons are involved. \nThat is why the launching of one of these missiles involves so many \nintricate, redundant steps with multiple built-in safeguards.\n  Yes, Murphy's law is true. Accidents can happen. But to have an \naccidental ballistic missile launch, several accidents must occur. \nSeveral redundant safeguard systems would have to fail all in the \nproper sequence at the precise moment, not just multiple failures of \nequipment but also multiple failures of human judgment, communication, \nand authority.\n  I am no statistician, but I bet the likelihood of all that occurring \nsimultaneously is far more remote than other Senators have led the \npublic to believe. It would be far more likely that an interceptor \nmissile in the national missile defense aimed at a moving target would \nmiss its mark. The threat of an accidental ballistic missile launch \ntoward our shores does not meet even the lowest threshold to qualify as \na legitimate threat.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, we need to have a rational assessment \nof the threats our Nation faces. And the threat we face from a Russia \nwith several thousand more nuclear weapons is far greater than the \nthreat from a Russia that abides by the START II agreement.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerrey be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask the Chair how much time is remaining of the time \nassigned to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at this \ntime, I be allowed to yield in this order: 8 minutes to Senator Simon; \n15 minutes to Senator Kerry; 8 minutes to Senator Bingaman, and that \nthey be recognized in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, it was just a few days ago when Senator \nByrd, in the middle of a series of votes, was acknowledged for his \n14,000th vote in a row. He got up and, among other things, he said \nthere is a growing and excessive partisanship in this body.\n  I was on the subway this morning with Senator Lugar, and some young \neager student asked me what was different from when I came here. I \nsaid, ``The body, the Congress as a whole, is more partisan than it \nused to be.''\n  I mention that because if we end up with a straight party vote on \nsomething as vital to the future of our Nation as this is, we have not \ndone our two parties a favor. I think the Levin amendment is extremely \nimportant to the security of our country.\n  If we just decide we are going to abrogate the ABM Treaty on our own, \nwe are going to interpret it the way we want to, and that is what this \namendment calls for, we are going to raise fears all over the world. We \nare going to be playing into the hands of the Russian hardliners. No \none should misunderstand that for a moment. If we pass this bill \nwithout the Levin amendment, the Russian hardliners are going to say, \n``We're going to have to stop this elimination of nuclear warheads. \nWe're going to have to move in the other direction.''\n  Unilaterally to say this is what the ABM Treaty is going to be--and \namong other things in this bill it says, no U.S. official, presumably \nthe Department of Defense, can discuss with any other country what the \nABM Treaty means. That is a restriction on freedom of speech, among \nother things, that is unwise.\n  What we have is the present course where we are gradually reducing \nthe nuclear threat, the arms threat in the world where we have moved \nfrom the great threat being nuclear annihilation, to the great threat \nbeing instability around the world, and we are going to move to a world \nwhere the threat is both instability and a nuclear threat.\n  Our present course reduces the nuclear danger. I happen to think we \nare spending way too much on arms. We are spending more than the next \neight countries combined. If you take a look at the 1973 defense \nappropriations and add the inflation factor to it, we are spending more \ntoday than we were in 1973. That is when the Berlin wall was up, that \nis when we were in Vietnam, that is when we had almost twice as many \ntroops in Europe.\n  I think some sensible reduction in arms expenditure is desirable and, \nfrankly, I think even the high number requested by the administration \nwould not be there but for the sensitivity of the President, because he \nwas not part of the military, he does not want to look like he is \nantimilitary. But this $7 billion increase is just unwarranted.\n  On top of that, to say we are going to just unilaterally decide what \nthe ABM Treaty means, on top of that to escalate the nuclear threat, I \nthink, just does not make any sense at all, and it is going to waste \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars in addition to increasing \nthe threat to our country.\n  If this bill passes in substantially the present condition, then I \nthink the President of the United States has no option but to veto it, \nand I will strongly urge the President to veto it.\n  We have to move away from an arms race. This bill, without the Levin \namendment, increases the probability of an arms race.\n  Madam President, I yield whatever time I may have left to Senator \nLevin.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Michigan and \nalso thank the Senator from Illinois for his comments with respect to \nthis amendment. It seems that some of our colleagues in this body, in \nthe wake of losing the former Soviet empire and the monolith of \ncommunism as targets of their opposition, now have lost their compass. \nThey seem unsure of where to direct their energies and our taxpayers' \nmoney, and so are struggling to find another opponent at which to throw \nthis Nation's treasure--regardless of the costs or risks entailed.\n  The Soviet Union has ceased to exist, and we are well into \nimplementation of the START I Treaty limiting nuclear weapons and on \nour way to a START II Treaty to dismantle strategic delivery systems \nand further limit nuclear weapons.\n  So we are on a course where the compass clearly points toward \nreduction in the number of nuclear weapons present in our world, toward \nthe reduction of risk to our citizens and our society itself from an \naggressor's attack, toward the control and reduction of weapons, and, \nindeed, toward the creation of stability in our world's political \nequation.\n  As all of us who grew up in the 1950's and 1960's understand, nuclear \ndeterrence is built on the concept of mutually assured destruction. \n``They'' can destroy ``us,'' ``we'' can destroy ``them,'' so neither \nchooses to destroy the other because nobody knows what would be left.\n  In effect, that has maintained a state of rough peace--even if an \nuneasy peace--since the end of World War II. Certainly there have been \nsurrogate wars and smaller skirmishes and client-state struggles around \nthe globe, but the great nuclear powers have never seen fit to attack \neach other because of the belief that the damage that would be returned \nwould be unacceptably great.\n  Now, in 1995, we are no longer faced with Soviet expansionism, a \nSoviet desire to exploit every conceivable Western weakness, and, in \nevery way short of initiating an all-out conflict, a Soviet desire to \nachieve and maintain the \n\n[[Page S 11261]]\nadvantage in every competitive situation. We no longer stare across the \nNorth Pole at thousands of Soviet nuclear warheads targeted on \nAmerica's cities, its industrial and military facilities, and its \ngovernmental and social lifelines. Yet in the bill that is before the \nSenate today, we have a provision that unilaterally abandons--and, I \nwould argue, effectively nullifies--one of the critical ingredients \nthat has brought us to the point where the compass is pointing in the \nright direction.\n  The Antiballistic Missile--or ABM--Treaty is a keystone to this arms \ncontrol progress--which already has made huge contributions to the \nsecurity and safety of our Nation and its people, and offers the \npromise of even greater safety and security in the foreseeable future.\n  The bill brought before the Senate by the Republican-controlled Armed \nServices Committee establishes as our national policy that we will have \na national missile defense system at ``multiple locations,'' which \nviolates the ABM Treaty. It says that we will develop defense systems \nagainst theater ballistic missiles without regard to the ABM Treaty \nrestrictions. It prohibits our President from even negotiating on this \nsubject. It prohibits any interference with TMD missile testing that is \nself-apparently illegal under the ABM Treaty which our Nation signed \nand this very body ratified.\n  The bill before us unilaterally obliterates the ABM Treaty, Madam \nPresident.\n  Anyone who understands the history and psyche of the Russian people \nknows that they adamantly insist on realistic means of defending their \nnation. Fundamental to their willingness to enter into arms control \nagreements, and to continue to abide by them, is a requirement that \ntheir strategic weapons systems be effective in order to serve as a \nreal deterrent to aggression against their nation, and an effective \nmeans of retaliation if that deterrence fails.\n  If the United States moves ahead unilaterally to build a system that \ncan defend successfully against their strategic forces, we undo a \ndelicate balance, and in the process almost surely destroy the \nwillingness of the Russian nation to continue to honor arms control \nagreements that further damage their side of the balance-of-power \nequation.\n  Madam President, nuclear deterrence is already tricky enough. But it \nreally has always rested on each nation's perceptions of the others' \nforces and of the threat that is poised against it. We hold the upper \nhand with respect to that today, relative to every country on the face \nof this planet.\n  Today, to break out of the ABM Treaty, or signal our intention to do \nso, is to invite a return to the days of suspicion and \ncountersuspicion, and far more dangerously, to invite a diminishment of \nthe stability of our current world order. It is not perfect, of course, \nbut I think few would argue with the assertion that it is better than \nit was for the 40 years between 1949 and 1989.\n  We do not attack each other, because we know to do so would be to beg \nthe ultimate destruction. But if we develop a capacity to knock down \nanything that could be sent at us, we have changed the threat \nperception--the perception of whether a balance exists--changed it in \nour own mind, and changed it for those who are our adversaries.\n  Changing the threat perception or the perception of whether a balance \nexists initiates the very hopscotching process that is the simple \nhistory of the entire cold war. We detonated the first atom bombs; the \nSoviets followed. We detonated the hydrogen bomb; they followed. We put \nlong-range bombers in the air with nuclear weapons; they followed. We \ndeveloped intercontinental ballistic missiles; they followed. We \ndeveloped long-range submarines with ballistic missile capability; they \nfollowed. We developed multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicle \nor MIRVed nuclear warheads; they followed. Every single major episode \nof the cold war consisted of a first effort by the United States to \ndevelop technology that would give us an advantage. In every case, the \nSoviets responded by countering that advantage. After the Berlin wall \nfell, finally it became evident that this was an insane and vicious \ncircle, consuming precious resources in our Nation and bankrupting the \nSoviet Union--in more than one respect.\n  But now, at long last, that threat has receded. The Soviet Union is \nno more. And the threat of ballistic missile attack of the United \nStates is virtually nil--and will be virtually nil for many years.\n  Only Russia and China today can reach the United States with a \nnuclear warhead carried on an ICBM. All our intelligence agencies agree \nthat there is no significant threat of such a missile attack today from \neither of those nations. Russia, while one must respect the military \npower still at its disposal, including intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, is not in any wise prepared to engage our Nation in an armed \nconflict. China has some strategic ballistic missile capability, but \nnot anywhere close to enough to initiate a war with the United States. \nWe are the only remaining superpower.\n  And our intelligence community further agrees that no other nation \nwill be able to develop the ability to hit the United States with \nballistic-missile-conveyed weapons of mass destruction for a minimum of \n10 years.\n  Let me share with my colleagues an excerpt from the prepared \nstatement of Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper, Jr., Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at \na public hearing on January 10 of this year on the threats faced by our \nNation. General Clapper said, in part:\n\n       We see no interest in or capability of any new country \n     reaching the continental United States with a long-range \n     missile for at least the next decade.\n\n  Then-Acting Director of Central Intelligence Adm. William Studeman, \nin response to questions asked at that same hearing, replied that\n\n       No new countries have emerged with the motivation to \n     develop a missile to target CONUS and the four that we \n     previously identified--North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya--\n     are at least a decade away.\n\n  The administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of \nState are all opposed to the missile defense and ABM provisions of this \nbill. Let me share the Secretary of State's letter with the Senate. In \na letter to the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he \nsays:\n\n       I am writing to you to express my deep concern over certain \n     provisions in S. 1026. Specifically, it contains missile \n     defense and ABM Treaty-related provisions that raise serious \n     constitutional foreign policy and national security concerns. \n     Unless these provisions are removed or modified, I will \n     oppose this bill.\n       If enacted into law, the provisions related to missile \n     defenses and the ABM Treaty would put the U.S. on a path to \n     violate the ABM Treaty by developing for deployment a non-\n     compliant, multi-site, National Missile Defense by the year \n     2003. Such a program is unnecessary and would place the START \n     I and START II treaties at risk.\n  I know that the Secretary of Defense also has opposed these \nprovisions.\n  Successive administrations, this one included, have supported the \ncontinued viability of the ABM Treaty as the best way to preserve and \nenhance our national security.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the entire letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC. August 2, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Pell: I am writing to you to express my deep \n     concern over certain provisions in S. 1026, the Senate's \n     National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1996. Specifically, \n     S. 1026 contains missile defense and ABM Treaty related \n     provisions that raise serious constitutional, foreign policy \n     and national security concerns. Unless these provisions are \n     removed or modified I will oppose this bill.\n       If enacted into law, the provisions related to missile \n     defenses and the ABM Treaty would put the U.S. on a path to \n     violate the ABM Treaty by developing for deployment a non-\n     compliant, multi-site National Missile Defense (NMD) by the \n     year 2003. Such a program is unnecessary and would place the \n     START I and START II Treaties at risk.\n       Successive Administrations have supported the continued \n     viability of the ABM Treaty as the best way to preserve and \n     enhance our national security. Not only has it been critical \n     to preventing an arms race, but it has also made possible the \n     extraordinary progress that both Republican and Democratic \n     Administrations have made in reducing strategic offensive \n     arms. Our allies, including Britain and France, also view the \n     ABM Treaty as crucial to strategic stability and the \n     viability of their own independent nuclear deterrents. \n\n[[Page S 11262]]\n\n       Another provision seeks unilaterally to impose a solution \n     to the on-going negotiations with the Russians on the ABM/TMD \n     demarcation. By prohibiting the obligation and expenditure of \n     funds to implement Article VI(a) of the ABM Treaty according \n     to any interpretation except the interpretation specified in \n     the bill, the bill would infringe upon the President's \n     exclusive responsibility for the execution of the law and \n     would impair the conduct of foreign relations consistent with \n     U.S. treaty obligations.\n       Further, such actions would immediately call into question \n     the U.S. commitment to the ABM Treaty, and have a negative \n     impact on U.S.-Russian relations, Russian implementation of \n     the START I Treaty, and Russian ratification of the START II \n     Treaty. This would leave thousands of warheads in place that \n     otherwise would be removed from deployment under the two \n     Treaties, including all MIRVed ICBMs such as the Russian \n     heavy SS-18.\n       There is no need now to take actions that would lead us to \n     violate the Treaty and threaten the stabilizing reductions we \n     would otherwise achieve--and place strategic stability at \n     risk. We have established a treaty-compliant approach to \n     theater missile defense that will enable us to meet threats \n     we may face in the foreseeable future--and one that preserves \n     all the benefits of the ABM, START and START II Treaties.\n       I hope that you will join with me to ensure that future \n     generations enjoy the benefit of these treaties and remove \n     these provisions that place these benefits at risk.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, we do not need to abrogate the ABM Treaty \nin order to defend against a threat that does not exist, and will not \nexist for at least 10 years. Indeed, there are many things that we can \ndo while remaining in full compliance with the ABM Treaty to prepare a \ndefense, should the decision be that such preparations are warranted \nand their cost is justified. And we always retain the option, under the \nterms of the treaty, to withdraw from the treaty under its terms, or to \nnegotiate modifications to the treaty if the Russians will agree to our \nobjectives.\n  I might add, respectfully, that there are other ways to respond to a \nperceived threat that do not require building $40 billion systems that \nwe do not even know will work when they are completed. We could use \npermissive action links; we could be negotiating harder with the \nRussians, and others, to take steps to prevent any kind of accidental \nlaunch; we could pursue the activities supported by Nunn-Lugar program \nfunding, including strengthening Russian government controls over their \nnuclear weapons, safely and surely dismantling surplus nuclear weapons \nand delivery systems, and preventing technicians from transferring \ndangerous technologies to rogue states; we can provide for integral \nsystems that literally destroy a missile before it is launched if \nsomeone tries to fire it without authorization.\n  Indeed, under the terms of the ABM Treaty, we already are allowed to \ndevelop an antiballistic missile defense system in one location, and we \nstarted to do some years ago in Grand Forks and then we decided it was \ntoo expensive and we gave it up.\n  But that is not the course this bill takes, Madam President. The \nmissile defense and ABM provisions of this bill are an exercise in \nsheer lunacy. This is an attempt to create from thin air a reason to \ncontinue the numbingly expensive defense systems that the demise of the \ncold war has made superfluous--while simultaneously threatening the \ntremendous progress we have made in reducing the threat to our people \nfrom nuclear weapons.\n  The effect of this bill is to jettison the current, real, \ndemonstrable protections of the START I and START II Treaties in \nexchange for spending a minimum of $40 billion to develop a system to \nattempt to defend our Nation against ballistic missiles--an entirely \ntheoretical system that may or may not function as designed.\n  There are some Senators who have argued that we must be prepared, \neven if the risk is small and distant, for the possible threat of a \npotential aggressor nation developing and choosing to use against the \nUnited States a ballistic missile carrying a weapon of mass \ndestruction. Others have said that the biggest risk is that some rogue \nnations may purchase such systems from either Russia or China. Mr. \nPresident, the fact is that if such nations wish us ill, and choose to \nact on those wishes, there are far less expensive, far faster, far \neasier, and far less technically complicated and failure-prone ways to \nwreak ill on the United States--ways against which a national missile \ndefense system would be powerless to defend.\n  Should a rogue nation, for whatever reason, choose to pursue \ndevelopment and fielding of a ballistic missile system capable of \nreaching our Nation, that capacity is so far down the road, so prone to \ndetection, and so capable of being preemptively neutralized if \nnecessary, that the world should not shudder at the notion that we are \nsomehow defenseless.\n  The main threats to our Nation today are from terrorists rolling \nbombs, nuclear or conventional, into our cities in cars or trucks, or \ncarrying them in suitcases. Or cruise missiles launched from offshore. \nThese are threats that the $40 billion-plus national missile defense \nsystem either cannot defend against at all, or against which the system \ncould defend only incompletely.\n  The biggest threat of all, Madam President, is one right before our \nfaces. It is the very same threat with which we have lived for the \nduration of the cold war, and which we finally reduced dramatically and \nare reducing further by the arms control treaties which are constructed \non the bedrock foundation of the ABM Treaty. Trashing the ABM Treaty \nwill rekindle the strategic/nuclear arms race with Russia, because even \nin its current condition of economic distress, Russia will do whatever \nis necessary to ensure it has an effective deterrent and retaliatory \ncapability. Russia, at a minimum, will retarget its ICBM's and SLBM's \non American cities, industries, and military installations. It will \nstop retiring and disassembling nuclear warheads and delivery systems. \nThe progress toward a safer world that was so painstakingly and \npainfully achieved over two decades by Presidents of both parties would \nbe demolished. Surely, in a world that lacks the Soviet empire, in a \nworld where we do not have the same kind of threat we have lived with \nfor the last 50 years, we do not have to turn around and create a new \narms race.\n  Let us review the effects of this provision of the bill: In one \nsweeping movement, we are effectively demolishing--unilaterally--a \ntreaty to which our Nation is a party and which this Chamber ratified. \nThis action simply ignores procedures to withdraw legally from a treaty \nwe determine no longer is in our best interests.\n  We are countenancing in law the known, deliberate violation of U.S. \nlaw.\n  We are pushing Russia to cease abiding by the terms of START I and \nhalt progress to implementation of START II.\n  We are tying the hands of our President in terms of negotiating arms \ncontrol agreements.\n  And we are launching this Nation on the course of spending a minimum \nof $40 billion for an untried, untested missile defense system that \nwill not protect against the greatest threats of attack on this Nation.\n  The people of this Nation have long ago concluded that we in the \nCongress often make decisions and laws that make no sense to them. The \nprovisions of this bill that pertain to missile defense and, in \nparticular, to the ABM Treaty, result from fanning the flame of an \nirrational fear built on a fiction--a fiction with which none of our \nsenior intelligence community officials agrees, and that has no basis \nin our foreign policy history, in our arms control history, or in \ncurrent threat analysis. If the Senate approves these provisions, it \nwill take one of the most outrageously nonsensical steps it has taken \nin my 11 years of service here.\n  I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Michigan in \ndeleting the offensive language from this bill. I believe Senate \nadoption of his amendment is absolutely essential. Without approval of \nthis amendment, I will vote against this bill and urge all Senators to \ndo the same. I will join with other Senators to urge the President to \nveto it--a step he already has indicated he expects to take if these \nprovisions are not acceptably modified.\n  I believe this bill is destined for the trash heap if the amendment \nis not approved. I hope it will be approved by an overwhelming vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I opposed this bill when it was being \nconsidered in the Armed Services Committee. The main reason I did so \nwere the \n\n[[Page S 11263]]\nprovisions in the bill entitled the Missile Defense Act of 1995.\n  I believe these provisions will do this Nation's security more harm \nthan good, by ensuring that START II will not be ratified by the \nRussian Duma.\n  Madam President, I am not going to repeat the analysis which Senator \nLevin, Senator Nunn, Senator Exon, Senator Kerry, and various others \nhave already made about the specific provisions that the Levin \namendment would strike. They are clearly the most provocative of the \nprovisions on missile defense that the bill contains and the ones that \nare most certain to incite the Russians to react.\n  I would like, however, to ask my colleagues how we, here in this \nSenate, would react if the Russian Duma passed a defense bill that \ncontained the following provisions: First, how would we react if the \nRussians adopted a provision that committed Russia to deploy a \nmultisite antiballistic missile defense by the year 2003, with an \ninterim capability by the year 1999, which constituted an anticipatory \nbreach of the ABM Treaty and that added hundreds of millions of dollars \nin ruble equivalence in order to pursue that goal.\n  How would we react here in this Senate if the Russians adopted a \nprovision that revived a space-based missile defense program, in the \nhope that it would allow Russia to dominate space in the long run, \nwhile providing a second layer of missile defense for that country?\n  How would we react here in this Senate if the Russians adopted a \nprovision that unilaterally resolved the theater missile defense \ndemarcation line at a point that would clearly make the American \ntheater missile defense systems beyond Patriot violations of the ABM \nTreaty in Russia's view?\n  How would we react here in this Senate if the Russian Duma adopted a \nprovision that limited President Yeltsin's ability to retire strategic \nweapons systems before START II is ratified by the U.S. Senate?\n  Finally, how would we react in this body if the Russians adopted a \nprovision that proposed to resume hydronuclear testing with yields up \nto hundreds of tons of TNT, which is a level that is not usually \nassociated with the term hydronuclear.\n  Madam President, if that bill were to pass the Russian Duma, the din \non this floor would be deafening. Member after Member would stand up \nand declare that the right wing had won the internal political \ncontroversy in Russia, that the cold war was back on, and that in light \nof this deeply provocative attack by the Russian Duma, ratification of \nthe START II Treaty was out of the question.\n  I am certain that at least 34 Senators here would dispatch a letter \nto the President declaring their opposition to START II, and demanding \na defense supplemental bill be submitted to the Congress so we could \nreact to what has happened.\n  Now, of course, if we do this sort of thing, in this defense bill \nthat we are now considering on the floor, I presume the expectation is \nthat the Russians would not be similarly provoked.\n  Madam President, I do not buy that assumption. The one thing that the \nRussian industrial base could effectively compete with us on is \nfabricating nuclear weapons and missiles. Some of that base is in the \nUkraine and would have to be revived in Russia.\n  I, for one, do not want to take the chance that the extreme \nprovisions in this bill will reignite the arms race. I, for one, do not \nwant to subscribe it a double standard in our dealings with the \nRussians, now that the cold war is over.\n  The extreme and provocative actions by our so-called \n``conservatives'' in this bill, in my view, will undoubtedly play into \nthe hands of those who consider themselves conservative from a Russian \nperspective--those, in many cases, in Russia at least, who are bent on \nunraveling START II and other arms control efforts.\n  The only thing that is attempting to be conserved by this \ntransnational alliance would be the cold war.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues, as many others have this \nafternoon, to support Senator Levin's effort to strike the most extreme \nprovisions of this bill. If they are not struck, I trust that the \nPresident would veto the bill. I hope that is not necessary. I hope \nthat we can act appropriately on this amendment and this bill can be \nimproved to an extent that the President could sign it. Thank you. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, in sitting here in the past few moments \nlistening to the debate, I am somewhat surprised at the level of \nrhetoric that is currently being used.\n  We heard Senator after Senator get up and say this declaration in the \nDOD authorization bill is one to violate the ABM Treaty, or to signal \nour intent to do so. They say this is a unilateral abrogation of the \ntreaty against a fictional threat.\n  I point out to my colleagues that nothing in this bill calls for the \nabrogation of the ABM Treaty. Nothing in this bill calls for us to \nviolate the treaty.\n  Fictional threat? I wonder how our supporters on the other side feel \nabout the fictional threat that was launched against the state of \nIsrael? What if the state of Israel had no defensive systems? What if \nthey had no Patriots to defend against the Scud missile?\n  I wonder how many would take the floor and say it is tough luck that \nthey are out of business. All we had to have is a few Scud missiles \ncarrying chemical warheads land in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem and wipe out \ntheir populations. They had no defensive mechanism available against \nit.\n  We are talking about something quite different in terms of ICBM \nthreats. I recall the debate on the threat from Iraq, during the debate \non the Persian Gulf war. I remember those citing estimates by our CIA \nand our DIA and other intelligence agencies at that time. They said, we \ncannot give you an estimate. It could be 1 year, it could be 10 years, \nand we are guessing it is closer to 10 years than 1 year.\n  Following the war with Saddam Hussein, I think we came to an entirely \ndifferent conclusion. We discovered that Saddam had achieved much \ngreater progress toward that goal than we had been aware of.\n  Members on the other side say this should not be a partisan issue. \nWhy is it that every time the Republican majority suggests a policy, it \nis partisan, but when everybody on that side lines up and vote against \nit, it is not partisan.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It ought to be bipartisan. We ought to \nsay, as a body, that we are concerned about the proliferation of \ntechnology--missile technology--in the world. We are concerned when we \nsee major powers selling technology to potential enemies. We are \nconcerned when we see China, for example, selling technology to other \ncountries that may pose a threat to us in the future. We ought to be \nconcerned about the proliferation of technology that one day--and we \ncannot predict when that one day will be--will pose a threat to our \npopulation.\n  Now, admittedly, if we were to engage in a war with the former Soviet \nUnion, that would not involve a limited attack or an accidental launch \nagainst us. That would be a massive exchange, against which there is no \ndefense.\n  I am one who, at different times over a number of years, has stood on \nthis floor opposing the notion of having a so-called dome over the \nUnited States to protect us from an all-out attack. I never believed it \nwas possible to do so and led the effort to defeat spending money in \npursuit of that kind of system.\n  But I have also stood on the floor with the Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, when he expressed concern about limited attacks, about \naccidental launches, about what we would do if suddenly received a \nmessage stating: ``Sorry, some accidental launch has taken place. There \nis an ICBM headed for New York City or Washington, DC, or Los \nAngeles,'' and all we can do is wait for it to hit?\n  We are talking about constructing a system that will protect against \na limited attack or accidental launch and nothing more, and it is all \nto be done in accordance with the ABM Treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty as originally written called for multiple site \ndefenses, two sites for each side. We renegotiated that treaty--at that \ntime with the Soviets--to one site. Now we are saying, in view of the \nproliferation of technology, we ought to renegotiate it to \n\n[[Page S 11264]]\nallow each of us, the Russians and the United States, to have some \nminimal capability to protect our respective countries against an \naccidental launch or a limited attack. We can do that within the ABM \nTreaty.\n  The ABM Treaty explicitly anticipates ``changes in the strategic \nsituation'' and provides a means to negotiate amendments to deal with \nsuch changes. It also allows for us to pull out of the ABM Treaty upon \n6 months' notice.\n  Following what I hope will be the defeat of the Levin amendment, I \nintend to offer an amendment--perhaps joined by the Senator from \nGeorgia, perhaps not--to make it clear that we intend to act in \naccordance with the ABM Treaty. We intend also to call upon the \nPresident to seek to negotiate with the Russians to allow each side to \ndevelop and deploy a limited system to protect our respective countries \nagainst this proliferation threat. And if the President should fail to \ndo so, it will be my recommendation that the President come back and \nreport to the Congress and then seek our advice as to whether or not we \nshould continue with the ABM Treaty or at that time should indicate our \ndesire to withdraw.\n  That is all within the ABM Treaty. And contrary to what is being \nrepresented here on the floor this afternoon, we are not seeking a \nunilateral abrogation. I do not want to see that. I hope, later on \nduring the course of this afternoon, I can make that very clear with \nexplicit language that will resolve any doubts about that. We want to \ncontinue to act in accord with the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty allows us \nto negotiate to seek amendments. We want to see if we cannot negotiate \nwith the Russians to allow for a deployment on a land-based system with \nmultiple sites--and the Russians would have the same right to do so--to \nprotect us against miscalculation or accident.\n  Madam President, there is an assumption in all of this debate that \nsomehow the threat will only come from the former Soviet Union. I do \nnot make that assumption. We are concerned about what is taking place \non a global basis. We are concerned about potential threats from other \nsources. We cannot predict who they are, where they may be, or how far \nalong the line of technology development they have proceeded. But we \ncannot face our constituents in good conscience and say: ``Sorry we \nfailed to take any measures to protect you. Our only defense is to \nlaunch an all-out attack on whomever launched that missile.'' That is \nour only option today. Is that a rational, sound option, to say if you \nlaunch one or two missiles against the United States, we end up \nlaunching ours against yours?\n  What we need to do is to have a limited protective system. That is \nwhat the Armed Services Committee seeks to do in this authorization. I \nintend, following the debate and conclusion of the Levin amendment, to \noffer an amendment to make that very clear.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will just yield myself 1 minute and \nthen I will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the language of this bill which we strike \nsays it is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple site \nnational missile defense system. A multiple site national defense \nsystem is not allowed by the ABM Treaty. Period.\n  It also says we should negotiate. That is great. But it is very \nprecise, and we tried to get these words out in committee and we \nfailed. I am very glad to hear from the Senator from Maine he does not \nsupport abrogating the treaty and he will offer language making it \nclear we want to stay inside the ABM Treaty. That is what my amendment \ndoes. That is precisely what my amendment does, is to strike the \nlanguage which says that it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy a multiple site system--which violates the ABM Treaty.\n  There is one other provision in here. The Senator from Maine talks \nabout, ``We should negotiate,'' and I surely agree with him on that, \ntoo. It is stated right here in language which the amendment will \nstrike, if it succeeds, that it is the sense of the Senate the \nPresident should cease all efforts to modify or clarify obligations \nunder the ABM Treaty.\n  So while the Senator from Maine, in a way that I fully support, says \nhe thinks we should negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty, the bill has \nlanguage, which the Levin amendment will strike, which says that for 1 \nyear pending this study the President should not seek to modify, to \nclarify obligations under the ABM Treaty.\n  So I think the amendment which the Senator from Maine says he will \noppose actually gets exactly at the language which I believe he \nbasically will oppose as well, at least from the statement he gave this \nafternoon on the floor, that is to make it clear we are not now going \nto declare we are going to violate the ABM Treaty. The purpose of the \nLevin amendment is to strike the language in the bill that says we are \ngoing to violate the ABM Treaty. It is clear, as you can read it. ``It \nis the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple site system.'' \nThat is what is not permitted by the ABM Treaty. That is the language, \nspecifically targeted, rifleshot language that we seek to remove from \nthis bill.\n  Now I will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I listened to the interventions of my friend and \ncolleague from Maine and the response from the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, about whether the provisions in question effectively \nabrogate the ABM Treaty. I would like to refer to the committee report \nwhich I believe gives us an answer. The report reads, ``The committee \nacknowledges that many of the policies and recommendations contained in \nthe Missile Defense Act of 1995, if implemented, would require relief \nin one form or another from the ABM Treaty.''\n  It cannot be much clearer than that. This language, agreed upon by \nthe majority of the members of the committee, acknowledges that many of \nthe policies and recommendations contained in the Missile Defense Act \nof 1995, if implemented, would require relief from the ABM Treaty.\n  It is the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from Michigan to \nremove those particular provisions that would require such relief. \nThose who oppose his amendment want to maintain the provisions in the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995 which effectively will emasculate the ABM \nTreaty.\n  There is no question--certainly there was no question on the minds of \nany of the members of the Armed Services Committee--as to what was \nintended, and the Senator from Michigan has outlined in careful detail \nthose parts of the ABM Treaty that are inconsistent with the provisions \nincluded in this bill. So we should be under no illusion about what was \nintended by the majority of the members of the Armed Services Committee \nand what the remedy will be if the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan is accepted.\n  Madam President, during the course of the debate on the issue, some \non the other side have argued that we need to build and deploy a \nnational missile defense to protect our citizens against the accidental \nand unauthorized launch of Russian nuclear missiles. The Defense \nDepartment has looked at this matter. It is not a new issue. It is not \na new argument. It is a matter that was considered and has been \nconsidered in its various forms over recent years in the fashioning and \nshaping of the START I, START II and the ABM treaties. During that \nconsideration, the Defense Department determined that the best way to \ndefend our Nation against accidental launches is to do two things: \nfirst, reduce the number of nuclear missiles in the Russian arsenal, \nthereby reducing the likelihood of an accidental launch. Republicans \nunderstood that. President Nixon understood it when he advanced the ABM \nTreaty. President Bush understood it when he advanced the START I and \nSTART II treaties. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the various \nSecretaries of Defense and State understood it as well.\n  There must be some new revelation that has come over the members of \nour committee to undermine that very \n\n[[Page S 11265]]\nbasic and fundamental concept embraced by Republicans and Democrats, \nPresidents, Secretaries of Defense, and members of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. They agreed that the most important thing that can be done for \nthe security of the United States was to achieve nuclear arms \nreductions. These agreements were initiated and supported because \nPresidents over a long period of time believed that they were in the \ninterest of the security of the American people, and of the nations of \nthe globe.\n  The Missile Defense Act would undermine these achievements, the \nsuccessful arms reductions negotiated in START I and START II. We have \nbeen warned of that. The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nSecretary of State have outlined the statements, comments, and \nconditions of Russian leaders that indicate they would not go forward \nto ratify START II if the ABM Treaty is abrogated.\n  Before taking the second step to protect our Nation against the \nunauthorized or accidental launch of nuclear missiles one must \nunderstand that the Soviet Union is not our adversary and that it is \nnot our ally. We can expect one form of conduct from our adversary and \nanother from our ally. But the Soviet Union is neither.\n  So the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs have recognized a \nsecond step, which they have put into practice, that will be further \nundermined if the Levin amendment is not agreed to, and that is to work \ncooperatively with the Russians to assure firm command and control over \nour respective forces. For example, in 1994 we reached the nuclear \ndetargeting agreement with the Russians. We agreed that our nuclear \nmissiles deployed in silos or on submarines would not be targeted \nagainst each other--an important step.\n  The Russian missiles are not targeted against us today. I do not want \nto see them retarget their missiles on our territory because they have \nadditional concern about the United States breaking out of the ABM \nTreaty. Our friends on the other side cannot guarantee that. We cannot, \nas supporters of the Levin amendment, guarantee it. But we can say with \nsome degree of predictability that the arguments for changing that \npolicy of retargeting and increasing instability are further advanced \nby the defeat of the Levin amendment.\n  We agreed in 1994 that we would change the targeting of our missiles \nboth on land and on the seas, and, in that way, if there were an \naccidental launch of a Russian nuclear missile, it would not land on \nUnited States cities but harmlessly in the ocean. We achieved this \nimportant agreement through cooperative discussions, not by mandates \nsuch as those included in this particular proposal that would mandate \nthe President's negotiating position on the demarcation between theater \nmissile defenses and strategic defenses. We get it through cooperative \nmethods, not by sending bulletins to the Russians. We did it through \ncooperation, and it has worked and is working, and we are safer and \nmore secure today because of that.\n  How are we going to make similar progress if there is no cooperative \nrelationship with the Russians? How are we going to do that? We have \nnot heard an explanation of how cooperation will continue if this bill \nis not amended. Once again, the key to United States-Russian nuclear \nsafety is maintaining the productive relationship we have struck since \nthe end of the cold war: to continue with the START reductions and \ncooperative threat reduction efforts. And the best way to protect \nAmericans from unauthorized and accidental launches of Russian missiles \nas maintained by the Defense Department is through cooperative \nmeasures, not through active defenses.\n  There are two efforts--continued reductions in strategic nuclear \nweapons and the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction programs--that \nwe must ensure will continue. There is no question that there would be \nserious damage to these efforts if we allow this bill to put \ncooperative ventures at risk.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in the committee report on this bill, there \nis the discussion in the section on the Missile Defense Act that states \nthat in the near term, national missile defense deployments serve to \nstabilize mutual deterrence by reducing prospective incentives to \nstrike first in a crisis.\n  That has been an issue that has been debated by Republicans and \nDemocrats for as long as I can remember, for as long as we have been \ntalking about strategic nuclear weapons. That was the argument when we \nwere looking at star wars, and it has been resurrected even with the \nchanged world conditions.\n  I have great difficulty understanding the logic behind this point. If \nwe were to deploy a national missile defense, we would be degrading the \neffectiveness of the Russian offensive missiles. And as anybody who \nfollows strategic nuclear policy understands, any time you degrade the \neffectiveness of a nation's missiles, you shorten the fuse on those \nmissiles in a time of crisis, you increase the incentives for the other \nside to strike first.\n  Mutual deterrence remains as the ultimate guarantor of our safety \nfrom nuclear attack. There are ways to make deterrence more stable and \nmore secure. That is through negotiation of arms reductions and \nnegotiations on command and control agreements that improve the safety \nof U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals.\n  I believe that is the way to go, and all of those efforts will be \nadvanced by the acceptance of the Levin amendment.\n  Madam President, I strongly support the amendment to save the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty from unilateral abrogation, which would be the \nresult if this bill is enacted in its present form. Since the United \nStates and the Soviet Union signed this landmark treaty in 1972, it has \nbeen the cornerstone of United States nuclear arms control policy. By \ninsuring that nuclear arsenals remain effective deterrents, the ABM \nTreaty has brought stability to the nuclear relationship for the past \nquarter century.\n  Unilaterally discarding the ABM Treaty would severely undermine the \ncooperative United States-Russian strategic relationship. Just as the \nUnited States is beginning to reap the greatest rewards from the \nstrategic nuclear policy constructed on the foundation of the ABM \nTreaty, many Members of Congress want to throw it all away.\n  The START I and START II accords, signed by President Bush, would \nverifiably eliminate three-quarters of all the nuclear weapons ever \npointed at the United States. Through the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat \nreduction Program, the Russians are actually accepting United States \nhelp to dismantle their nuclear weapons, a situation that none of us \nwould have dared imagine only a decade ago.\n  The bill's provision is a clear and present danger to the ABM Treaty. \nIt would turn United States-Russian cooperation into mistrust. We would \nbe discarding tangible present advances in arms control for the \nillusion of future security through a national missile defense system \nthat will cost billions of dollars above and beyond the huge defense \nburden we already carry in this era of deep budget cuts.\n  The only way that opponents of the ABM Treaty could develop a \nrationale in support of the offending provisions in this bill is by \nmisrepresenting the nature of nuclear threats to the United States in \nthe post-cold war era, the value of the ABM Treaty today, and the need \nfor building and deploying strategic defense in the near future.\n  Five transparent myths underlie the case for building national \nmissile defenses and abrogating the ABM Treaty. Once the myths are \nexposed, the case for abrogating the ABM Treaty crumbles.\n  Myth No. 1 is that the ABM Treaty is a cold war relic whose value \ndisappeared with the demise of the former Soviet Union, so that we can \nabrogate the ABM Treaty at no cost to United States security.\n  The cold war may have ended, but nuclear deterrence still remains as \nthe centerpiece of U.S. nuclear security.\n  The end of the cold war and the relaxation of military tensions \nbetween the United States and the Soviet successor states have not made \nthe ABM Treaty obsolete. The nature of nuclear weapons and their \nmassive destructive power has not changed. No matter how much the \nopponents of the ABM Treaty wish it were otherwise, effective mutual \ndeterrence is what keeps Americans safe from nuclear war.\n  Today, 6 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and nearly 4 years \nafter the breakup of the Soviet Union, the relationship between the \nUnited States and \n\n[[Page S 11266]]\nRussia is in transition. Russia is no longer our adversary, but it is \nnot our ally either. Although we see no apparent tensions that could \nlead to nuclear conflict, prudence dictates that we structure our \nremaining nuclear arsenals to achieve the most stable nuclear \ndeterrence possible.\n  The end to the hostile relationship allows us to cooperate much more \nextensively than in the past to solidify and stabilize nuclear \ndeterrence at much lower levels of nuclear weapons. Over the past 6 \nyears, we have managed to use this change in the relationship in a way \nthat leaves deterrence more stable, and the American people safer than \nat any time since the beginning of the cold war.\n  Consider the progress we have made in recent years. In 1991, \nPresident Bush and President Gorbachev signed the START I Treaty. Two \nyears later, President Bush and President Yeltsin signed the START II \nTreaty, which will reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads \npointed in our direction from 10,000 to 3,500.\n  In addition, through cooperative initiatives, the so-called Nunn-\nLugar programs, we are working with the Russians to assist them in \ndismantling their nuclear warheads, thereby substantially reducing the \nRussian arsenal's threat to the United States and substantially \nreducing the likelihood that nuclear weapons will end up in the hands \nof renegade regimes or terrorists.\n  The ABM Treaty is the indispensable foundation for these steps. \nAbrogating the treaty would jeopardize all of these important advances, \nand endanger the future of United States-Russian nuclear relations.\n  Some argue that the ABM Treaty is obsolete because deterrence is no \nlonger needed. They pretend that we can rely on missile defenses to \nprotect the American people from nuclear war. This is the same \npreposterous argument we heard during the 1980's, when star wars was \noversold as a miracle protection from the nuclear threat.\n  SDI never came close to meeting the standards of operational \neffectiveness and cost-effectiveness that the Reagan administration \nsaid would be necessary to make the transition from deterrence to \ndefense. No technical advances since the abandonment of that ill-\nconceived and wasteful adventure make the reality today any different. \nDefense cannot replace deterrence, and we would be foolish to try it. \nThe ABM Treaty is not obsolete. It is still the foundation for stable \ndeterrence, and it deserves to be maintained.\n  The second myth is that the Russians will not mind if we abrogate the \nABM Treaty. It is said that we can deploy a national missile defense \nand still maintain a cooperative strategic relationship with Moscow.\n  This groundless assertion is refuted by the Secretary of Defense, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and most important of all, by \nthe Russians themselves.\n  Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nin a June 28 letter to Senator Levin stated that undermining the ABM \nTreaty will make START II ratification by the Russian parliament highly \nunlikely. In the letter, he addresses this issue clearly. He writes:\n\n       While we believe that START II is in both countries' \n     interests regardless of other events, we must assume such \n     unilateral US legislation could harm prospects for START II \n     ratification by the Duma and probably impact our broader \n     security relationship with Russia as well.\n\n  General Shalikashvili is the top military officer in the Nation. He \nhas had extensive contacts with senior Russian military officers. In \nhis view, enactment of legislation that harms the ABM Treaty will \ndamage our cooperative security relationship with the Russians at the \nvery moment when we are trying to move forward in arms control.\n  Secretary of Defense Perry, in a letter to Senator Nunn, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, feels the same way. He writes \nthat the provisions in this bill ``would jeopardize Russian \nimplementation of the START I and START II treaties, which involve the \nelimination of many thousands of strategic nuclear weapons.'' Secretary \nPerry understands full well the damage this bill would inflict on U.S. \nsecurity, which is why the administration strongly opposes these \nprovisions.\n  The Russians themselves feel the same way. At the May summit in \nMoscow, President Clinton and President Yeltsin signed a joint \nstatement that commits both nations to upholding the ABM Treaty, and to \ndeveloping and deploying theater missile defense systems in compliance \nwith the Treaty. It is reckless to think that the Russians will watch \nus violate this commitment without a response that will set back the \ncause of our mutual security.\n  At the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on June 29, Russian \nForeign Minister Alexander Kozyrev reaffirmed the commitment of the \nYeltsin government to ratify the START II Treaty, ``subject to strict \ncompliance with the ABM Treaty.''\n  It could not be any clearer. If we abrogate the ABM Treaty, we will \nnot have START II, much less START III. We will not have cooperative \nthreat reduction. And we may well not have a comprehensive test ban and \nother arms control agreements we need in the years ahead.\n  The third myth underlying the proposed abrogation of the ABM Treaty \nis that we face the threat of ballistic missile attack from renegade \nnations that will achieve this capability in the near future.\n  This myth squarely contradicts the conclusions of the U.S. \nintelligence community and the Pentagon leadership.\n  Lt. Gen. James Clapper, Jr., the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, testified before the Armed Services Committee in January that \n``we see no interest in or capability of any new country reaching the \ncontinental United States with a long range missile for at least the \nnext decade.'' Secretary Perry endorsed this judgment in testimony \nbefore the Armed Services Committee this year.\n  Concern about future ballistic missile threats to U.S. territory is \nthe basis for the Clinton administration's research and development \nprogram on national missile defenses. This reasonable level of spending \non anti-missile defenses will put the United States in a position to \nrapidly deploy such a defense if unforeseen threats arise in the near \nfuture. It makes sense to spend a modest amount on R It makes no \nsense to throw billions of dollars into deploying what may be an \nunnecessary system sooner.\n  Myth No. 4 is that a multi-site national missile defense can be \ndeployed over the next decade for a modest cost. This assertion is a \nfantasy. This year's bill plans to spend $671 million on national \nmissile defense, an increase of $300 million over the administration's \nrequest. But this increment is only the tip of a very large iceberg.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, deploying a single-site \nnational missile defense would cost $29 billion to complete and $16.5 \nbillion of the total would be spent over the next 5 years. This \nestimate does not include the cost of building additional sites, which \nthe pending bill calls for, and it does not include the cost of \noperating and maintaining the system once it is operational.\n  Other costs will be higher too. Abrogation of the ABM Treaty will \ndoom START II, and saddle us with a nuclear stalemate with the Russians \nat cold war levels. We will have to maintain our strategic nuclear \narsenal at its current size, not the greatly reduced level under START \nII. If we proceed with this bill, we will be spending tens of billions \nof tax dollars in a way that increases the nuclear threat to the United \nStates. The American taxpayer was taken for a long and expensive and \nunnecessary ride by star wars in the 1980s. It makes no sense to repeat \nthat experience in the post-cold war era.\n  Myth No. 5 is that we need to discard the ABM Treaty in order to \nbuild and deploy effective theater missile defenses to protect U.S. \nforces in the field. The fact is, the United States can do both. We can \ncomply with the ABM Treaty, and we can create effective theater missile \ndefense systems.\n  The ABM Treaty strictly limits development and deployment of \nstrategic missile defenses. But it expressly allows the signers to \ndeploy theater missile defenses. The United States is already \ndeveloping advanced theater missile defenses that may have significant \ncapability to defeat strategic offensive missiles.\n  As a result, the Clinton administration has entered into negotiations \nwith \n\n[[Page S 11267]]\nRussia to determine which systems will be permitted under the ABM \nTreaty. By so doing, the President is using one of the key features of \nthe treaty--its flexibility to update and revise the Treaty as \ndevelopments demand.\n  This bill, however, prevents the effective negotiation of any \nboundary between theater and strategic defenses. It would deny the \nPresident the power to negotiate this clarification of the treaty in a \nway that will best serve our national security.\n  By attempting to achieve by legislative mandate what the President \nshould negotiate, the bill will undercut the basic constitutional \nallocation of treaty-making powers between the President and Congress. \nIt is wrong to legislate an ideological negotiating position while \nrational negotiations are underway. This step sets an extremely \ndangerous precedent for the future, and could result in the collapse of \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  It is time to cut through the myths and misrepresentations. Our \nnational security is at stake. It makes no sense to sacrifice real and \nverifiable reductions in the Russian nuclear arsenal, in exchange for a \nmultibillion dollar national missile defense that will leave us less \nsecure. A decade ago, we should have left star wars in Hollywood where \nit belonged--and that is where this senseless sequel belongs too.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield whatever time remains back to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, the other side in this debate, Senator Levin and \nothers, assert that somehow this bill is going to violate the ABM \nTreaty or require us to violate the ABM Treaty. Those are the terms \nthat we have heard used--violate or require us to violate the treaty.\n  My friend, Senator Levin, is a very accomplished attorney, and I \nrespect his intellect very much, but this is just patently false. There \nis no requirement to violate any treaty in this legislation we have \nwritten. Nothing in this bill violates the treaty, nothing. If it did, \nif the language in here were to violate the treaty, why does the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, in comment after \ncomment talk about an anticipatory breach down the road?\n  If there is an anticipatory breach down the road, the way I read that \nis there is not any breach yet. There is not any violation of anything. \nWe are anticipating it. Well, you can anticipate anything you want, but \nthe facts speak for themselves. This does not violate the ABM Treaty, \nperiod. Nothing in this bill violates the ABM Treaty. It is simply \npatently false to say that it does.\n  Now, in 2003--that is the deployment date for ground-based multiple \nsites--in 2003, yes, we could do that, but it is not 2003. This is \nstill 1995 as I looked at the calendar, and I do not quite understand \nthe logic here of how it is that we are violating something that we \nhave not violated yet. We are anticipating a violation, but we are not \nviolating anything. So I am having trouble understanding the semantics, \nand I think that is probably the intent of the opposition here, to make \nsure that others have trouble understanding the semantics so that we \ncan confuse and obfuscate and hide the real truth, which is that we are \nnot violating any treaty at all in this language.\n  Now, article XIII, which the Senator from Michigan and others are \naware of, is very clear on this, about what our rights are under this \ntreaty. There is nothing hidden about it. I have a copy of the treaty \nright here in my hand, and it says:\n\n       To promote the objectives and implementation of the \n     provisions of this treaty, the parties shall establish \n     promptly a standing consultative commission within the \n     framework of which they will--\n\n  Among other things,\n\n     consider possible changes in the strategic situation which \n     have a bearing on the provisions of this treaty.\n\n  Surely, my colleagues will admit there have been strategic changes \nsince the fall of the Soviet Union. Second:\n\n       Consider as appropriate possible proposals for further \n     increasing the viability of this Treaty including proposals \n     for amendments.\n\n  We have a right to amend the treaty. And finally it says under \narticle XV, Mr. President, that:\n\n       Each party shall in exercising its national sovereignty \n     have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides \n     that extraordinary events relating to the subject matter of \n     this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests and it \n     shall give notice of its decision to the other party 6 months \n     prior to the withdrawal from the Treaty.\n\n  So we are not violating any treaty with this language. If someone is \nsaying we are anticipating the violation of the treaty, fine; we can \nanticipate anything we want to. But it is simply wrong to say that we \nare violating this treaty or that we do not have the right to change \nthis treaty or to withdraw from this treaty or whatever the parties \nwish to do. It is right there. It is written. It is clear. It is \nindisputable. It is fact.\n  I am kind of surprised to hear that we are going to automatically \nviolate this treaty if we decide that we, in the United States of \nAmerica, want to defend America against attack.\n  Well, you know what? We do not violate the treaty, but if we had to \ndefend America I would violate the treaty--that happens to be this \nSenator's personal opinion--because I do not think I am worshiping at \nthe altar of a treaty. I did not know that a treaty was forever and \nthat we could not change the provisions.\n  We have the right to change this treaty. It was written to change, \njust like the Constitution was written with a possibility to amend it. \nThis treaty was written to change it, to even withdraw from it if it is \nin the national security interests of a nation to do so.\n  Those are the facts. I suggest to my colleagues that the end of the \ncold war is just the kind of change the treaty is referring to. That is \nthe kind of strategic change that this treaty is referring to, the end \nof the cold war, the end of a bipolar world. We are now in a multipolar \nworld with threats that we do not really know how to calculate, with \nweapons that are different and in the hands of some who may be more \ninclined to use them than even the old Soviet Union. Our colleagues who \nsupport the Levin amendment, if we are to put this in perspective, are \nthe same people who day after day, day after day, year after year, \nargue the cold war is over and therefore we should adapt our defense \nprogram to the changed environment.\n  That is a good argument. The cold war is over. We must adapt. We are \nadapting. We have downsized our military. We are changing some of the \npriorities in our weapons systems. That is fine. But why are they \nfighting so hard, Mr. President, to preserve the most obvious relic of \nthe cold war, the ABM Treaty? The ABM Treaty, the AntiBallistic Missile \nTreaty, the relic of the cold war, deals with a bipolar world, deals \nwith a concept of mutual assured destruction, that if one side fires at \nthe other, the other will fire back; therefore, the first side will not \nfire. That is the whole logic here, but is not a bipolar world.\n  Does anybody believe that Saddam Hussein would be reasonable and \nrational, or perhaps Qadhafi in Libya? Are we dealing with rational \npeople in some of these fundamentalist and other nations around the \nworld today? I think not, and the American people know that.\n  Frankly, those who wrote this treaty knew that, that we were not \nalways going to have the same situation in the world. The treaty is \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. There is no Soviet \nUnion anymore. Even if we agree that Russia is the successor to the \nSoviet Union--which frankly is an open question--there are many other \nnations now, legitimate nations of the world that were part of that old \nSoviet Union. It is not just Russia. Russia is not the automatic \nsuccessor to the Soviet Union.\n  It is clear that this treaty does not include the nations that \nthreaten us the most. The nations that threaten us most: Libya, North \nKorea, Syria, Iran, Iraq, China, they did not sign the ABM Treaty. They \ndo not have anything to do with the ABM Treaty. So why are \n\n[[Page S 11268]]\nwe locked to an ABM Treaty? Why are we locked to an ABM Treaty that \ndoes not even deal with the countries that are threatening us?\n  The answer is very simple. We should not be. And the treaty founders, \nthose who authored that treaty, knew it. We are not standing on the \nbrink with Russia. In fact, Yeltsin says Russia is no longer targeting \nus with missiles. This is no longer bipolar. It is multipolar.\n  The Levin amendment would leave us perpetually locked into an \noutdated posture of confrontation with the former Soviet Union, the \npast, the cold war. Let us step into the 21st century. Let us look at \nthe threat today, not yesterday. We have an obligation here in this \nSenate to look ahead, to protect the future, and this language does it. \nThis language does it. It encourages a cooperative transition away, \naway from mutual assured destruction toward mutual assured security--\nnot destruction.\n  The Levin amendment would leave America completely vulnerable to \nballistic missile attack. It would strike this language, gut the \nessence of the bill, restrict our ability to make theater defenses as \ntechnologically capable as possible.\n  The SASC bill says all Americans deserve to be protected and ensures \nthat our national security and theater defense programs are targeted \ntoward the specific threats which confront us today, not yesterday.\n  The Levin amendment would perpetuate the policy again of mutual \nassured destruction, even though the cold war is over. Do not take my \nword for it. Henry Kissinger, who helped develop the doctrine, agrees \nthat mutual assured destruction is no longer relevant; not even \nappropriate, yet Senator Levin would continue a policy that I believe \nis absurd, that leaves our Nation defenseless while being locked into a \npolicy, a relic that belongs in the dustbin of history.\n It is time to move on, Mr. President. It is time to move into the 21st \ncentury.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-seven seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nI thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the Senator from Arkansas 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Maine a moment ago say that \nthere is not anything in this bill that abrogates the ABM Treaty \nbetween Russia and the United States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I cannot hear very well. Is the Senator \nusing his microphone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator using his microphone?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thought I was. I see it lying on the floor.\n  Most people say, ``I heard your speech awhile ago, and when I stuck \nmy head out the window I could really hear it.''\n  Is this better? I apologize.\n  As I was about to say, the Senator from Maine awhile ago said there \nwas not anything in this bill that would abrogate the ABM Treaty. I do \nnot know how more forcefully you can abrogate the treaty than to pass \nthis bill. Now, obviously, it is not going to be abrogated until the \nSoviet Union gets a stomach full of this kind of stuff and withdraws \nfrom the treaty, which they have a right to do on 6 months' notice. \nBut, first of all, I want you to look at the language of the treaty. As \nI said this morning, English is the mother tongue. That is what we \nspeak. That is what we write. And here is what the mother tongue says \nin article I of the 1976 Protocol of the ABM Treaty. ``Each party shall \nbe limited at any one time''--limited at any one time--``to a single \narea out of the two provided in article III of the treaty for \ndeployment. . .''\n  You see the word ``single''? That means one. ``Single'' and ``one'' \nare the same.\n  Here is what the bill says. Section 233, ``It is the policy of the \nUnited States to . . . deploy a multiple-site''--``multiple,'' \ncolleagues, is more than one. ``. . .United States to . . . deploy a \nmultiple-site national ballistic missile defense system.''\n  Section 235, two sections down, ``The Secretary of Defense shall \ndevelop . . . national missile defense system, which will attain \ninitial operational capability by the end of 2003.'' It shall include \n``Ground-based interceptors deployed at multiple sites''--not two; \nmaybe a half a dozen. And the treaty is very specific that we shall be \nlimited to one.\n  And people have the temerity to get up on this floor and, I assume, \ntry to deceive the American people into believing this is a perfectly \nharmless, innocent little bill. Oh, I wish I missed the cold war like \nsome of my colleagues do. There are colleagues in this place that \ncannot sleep at night since the cold war ended and will do anything to \nresurrect it. There are defense contractors who cannot stand the demise \nof the Soviet Union. I do not know why it bothers them. We certainly \nhave not cut defense spending any.\n  When the Senator from Maine mentioned the people of Israel, he was \ntalking about a theater missile defense system which virtually every \nperson in this body has strongly supported. We are not talking about \ntheater missiles. We are talking about headed toward an antiballistic \nmissile system in direct contravention of our word as a nation with our \nname on a treaty that either means something or it does not.\n  Oh, the arrogance in this bill drives me crazy. First, we will say \nwhere the demarcation line is between whether something is a theater \nmissile or an antiballistic missile system. We will decide. And if the \nRussians do not like it, as we used to say when I was a kid, they can \ntake it or lump it. We will deploy on multiple sites. And if the \nRussians think that violates the treaty, which it clearly does, they \ncan take it or lump it.\n  This bill says ``the Senate.'' Now, you think about the President of \nthe United States, who negotiates treaties and who is talking to the \nRussians right now about trying to resolve some of these ABM questions. \nWhat does this bill say? The Senate--not the President--the Senate will \nappoint a group of Senators to review ``continuing value and validity \nof the ABM Treaty.'' We will decide whether it has any value, whether \nit has any continuing validity. That would be insulting enough. What \nelse do they say? This committee will recommend policy guidance, and \nthe President--Mr. President, you will ``cease all efforts to modify, \nclarify or otherwise alter this treaty,'' et cetera, et cetera. The \narrogance of a bill that says to the President, ``Stop it. Quit trying \nto work something out. We will decide whether this treaty has value or \nnot.''\n  The arguments on the other side about how this bill does not abrogate \nthe treaty, all it does is set out a whole host of things which lead \nunalterably toward a flagrant violation of the treaty and abrogation of \nthe treaty. No self-respecting nation--and Russia is one--will sit idly \nby while we construe the treaty any way we want to. And they are \nexpected to sit idly by and say, ``Yes, yes, yes.''\n  I have never heard as much third-grade sophistry in my life as I \nheard when the Senator from Michigan offered his amendment. On June 21, \nPresident Yeltsin submitted the START II Treaty, not negotiated by Bill \nClinton, negotiated by George Bush--a good treaty. It should be \nratified by both sides immediately. George Bush should say he wants it \nput on his epitaph that he negotiated START II. So when President \nYeltsin appointed his Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozynev, and his Defense \nMinister, Pavel Grachev, then the President of the Russian party, to \nnegotiate with the Duma and ratify START II, a spokesman for the Duma \nsaid:\n\n       The ratification process would undoubtedly be influenced by \n     progress in the attainment of a Russian-American agreement on \n     the delineation of the strategic and tactical antimissile \n     defense system. The observance of the 1972 ABM Treaty depends \n     on this.\n       The role of this treaty remains unchanged in creating \n     conditions for cutting down strategic offensive weapons.\n\n  Can you blame Russia? Be fair-minded for about 10 seconds. That is \nunusual around here. But try it. Be fair-minded for about 10 seconds. \nIf the roles were \n\n[[Page S 11269]]\nreversed, if the Russians were passing laws to abrogate the ABM Treaty, \nwould we ratify START II? We would take it to the men's room, is what \nwe would do with it.\n  Well, Mr. President, both nations have saved billions of dollars by \nnot building antiballistic missile systems. We have a lot of Senators, \nI say, who just can hardly handle the end of the cold war. How many \ntimes have I stood at this desk trying to keep this Nation from \nspending $2 billion resurrecting a bunch of old rusty buckets called \nbattleships. Two billion dollars. Where are they? In mothballs right \nwhere everybody knew they were going. Two billion dollars already gone.\n  I stood here pleading with this body, ``Don't buy all these D-5 \nmissiles, you can't possibly use that many.'' And the Star Wars battle \nwhich I thought was over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All I heard was, ``The chiefs want it, the Secretary \nwants it,'' and now the chiefs do not want this. They did not even want \nthe $7 billion that was added in committee, and they certainly do not \nwant all this language in the bill. Chairman Shalikashvili does not \nwant it. Nobody wants it except the Armed Services Committee.\n  Our bombers are not on alert. Our cities are not targeted. For the \nfirst time in 40 years the American people can get a decent night's \nsleep. So what are we going to do? We are going to say, ``Wake up, \nremember the good old days when you couldn't sleep at night for fear of \na nuclear war? They are going to bring it back to you in spades.''\n  There are a lot of things wrong with this bill. I said this morning, \nand I say again, in my 21 years in the Senate, this is, by far, the \nworst defense bill that has ever been presented on this floor.\n  Oh, the arrogance of power. Every great nation that has indulged in \nthe arrogance of power, as this bill does, has lived to regret it. The \nSenator from New Hampshire said we have not violated the ABM Treaty \n``yet,'' ``we're just going to interpret it any way we want to and we \nare going to build a system and we will decide where the demarcation \nline is.'' Do you think the Russians are going to take something that \nthey feel is prejudicial to their security? The last guy to \nunderestimate Russia was Adolf Hitler. They are on their hunkers, but I \nwill tell you, they will starve their people before they will be \nhumiliated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have watched on Discovery Channel for the past 2 \nmonths and on PBS all these battles of World War II, a lot of them the \nRussians against the Germans. Twenty-two million Russians died. They \nstarved to death by the thousands at Leningrad and in Stalingrad.\n  I am not suggesting we be afraid of Russia. I am suggesting that the \nworld will be eminently better off if the two superpowers of this world \ncan agree. The American people really do not understand the details of \nthis. Do you know what the American people do? They elect you and me to \ndo responsible things. They elect us expecting that we will know \nsomething about it and that we will protect the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield to Senator Chafee 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned over this bill's \nprovision affecting the ABM Treaty, and I would like to discuss my \nsupport for the Levin amendment. Let me give a little bit of history.\n  The ABM Treaty was agreed to 20 years ago. What does it do? We hear a \nlot about the ABM Treaty, but what does it do? What is the key part of \nit? The thrust of it was to prevent the United States or the Soviet \nUnion from gaining the ability to unilaterally --that is one side \nalone--to launch a ballistic missile attack against the other without \nthe possibility of retribution. In other words, the whole purpose of \nthe treaty was to prevent either side from employing a defensive system \nto shoot down incoming missiles, because that would, in effect, \nencourage one side to launch an attack knowing that they would be \nprotected from any retaliation.\n  Since that time, the geopolitical situation in the world has changed. \nThe Soviet Union no longer exists and the Warsaw Pact has collapsed. \nThere has also been rapid technological advances that could not have \nbeen predicted at the time that the ABM Treaty was signed.\n  Given these dramatic changes, I certainly understand the interest to \ntake a look at this ABM Treaty. It has been 20 years. It is appropriate \nto have modifications and to look at it again. But, the point I want to \nmake is, the changes to this treaty, or any other treaty, for that \nmatter, must be negotiated by the President of the United States, in \nconsultation with his military and diplomatic advisers and, obviously, \nwith confirmation by the Senate.\n  Such changes should not be dictated by the legislature, either the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  Let us look at what S. 1026 does in regard to the ABM Treaty. This is \nwhat it says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple-\n     site national missile defense system.\n\n  The ABM Treaty says each nation can only have one ABM site, one site \nin each nation. This says ``No, no, we are changing that policy.''\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple-\n     site national missile defense system.\n\n  That policy is clearly in violation of the ABM Treaty. We are going \nto hear arguments back and forth, does that mandate that there be \nmultiple sites? It can be argued both ways, and it obviously is an \narguable point. But there is no question but we are declaring that it \nis the policy of the United States to have multiple sites.\n  Whether that is a mandate or not, I do not know, but certainly I do \nnot want any part of it. We have gotten along with the ABM Treaty for \n20 years. If we want changes, let us negotiate them. Let us not have \nthem emerge from this Senate dictating in a way or declaring it is a \npolicy to have these multiple sites.\n  What else does the bill we are debating today do? It prohibits ``any \nmissile defense or air defense system or system upgrade or system \ncomponent that has not been flight tested in a unilateral,'' and here \nwe go ahead and define what is an ABM qualifying flight test.\n  Next, it goes on--here is an important point, Mr. President--it \nstates the sense of Congress that:\n\n       . . . the President should cease all efforts to modify, \n     clarify, or otherwise alter U.S. obligations under the ABM \n     Treaty pending the outcome of a Senate review.\n\n  Look, who is in charge around here? Is it the Senate of the United \nStates, or is it the President under his constitutional powers? We say, \nno, he cannot do anything until we have a Senate review of the treaty. \nHow long is that going to last? It could last 3 years; it could last 10 \nyears. During all of that time, the President's hands would be tied. I \nreally do not think that is what we want.\n  The provisions of this bill constitute an unwarranted usurpation of \nPresidential authority to conduct foreign policy on the most sensitive \nof national security matters.\n  Mr. President, Congress simply should not be in the business of \ndictating to the President how to interpret, how to implement, or how \nto renegotiate a binding treaty of the United States. As a Republican \nSenator, I would never impose those kinds of conditions on a Republican \nPresident, and as a Republican Senator, I do not suggest that they \nshould be imposed on a Democratic President.\n  Secretary of Defense William Perry has warned that these provisions \nwould jeopardize Russian implementation of the Reagan and the Bush--who \nare they? Republican Presidents--Reagan-Bush negotiated START I and \nSTART II Treaties. These treaties involve the destruction of thousands \nof nuclear warheads.\n  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili has similarly cautioned \nthat the bill's ABM provisions should \n\n[[Page S 11270]]\nprobably impact our broadened security relationship with Russia. I do \nnot argue with the premise that the United States ought to pursue \nmissile defense technologies in order to deter potential aggressors who \nhave made substantial progress in this field. Yes, we ought to do some \nwork in that area.\n  I also do not oppose appropriate modifications of the 20-year-old ABM \nTreaty that are negotiated by the President. But this bill simply goes \ntoo far. Congress must not legislate such specific modifications to the \ntreaty.\n  So, Mr. President, I am in support of the Levin amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  So I want to thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment by the Senator from \nMichigan attempts to hold on to the cold war status quo that we have \ncome to know as mutual assured destruction. But is the cold war not \nover?\n  Mr. President, the United States should not be reluctant to reassess \nthe continuing value and validity of the ABM Treaty. The Defense \nauthorization bill does not advocate abrogation of the ABM Treaty, but \nit does firmly acknowledge that the strategic and political \ncircumstances that led to the ABM Treaty have changed.\n  The Levin amendment is a backward rather than a forward looking \namendment. We should be looking forward and attempting to foster a new \nform of strategic stability that is not based on mutual assured \ndestruction. Think about it--5 years after the end of the cold war, \nwith all the political changes that have occurred, the United States \nand Russia have not fundamentally altered the strategic posture that so \ncharacterized the cold war.\n  All Senators should agree that the ABM Treaty is technically and \ngeopolitically outdated. While the treaty requires the United States \nand Russia to remain vulnerable to each other's threats, it has the \neffect of requiring the United States to remain vulnerable to threats \nposed by other countries. Countries like North Korea are developing \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, while missile and nuclear \ntechnologies are practically available on the open market. Let me quote \nformer Deputy Secretary of Defense and current Director of Central \nIntelligence John Deutch:\n\n       The 1972 ABM Teaty does not conform with either the changed \n     geopolitical circumstances or the new technological \n     opportunities of today. We should not be reluctant to \n     negotiate treaty modifications that acknowledge the new \n     realities, provided we retain the essential stabilizing \n     purpose of the treaty.\n\n  It has also become clear that vulnerability to missile attack neither \nstabilizes nor enhances deterrence. The Persian Gulf war demonstrated \nthis clearly. Israel, a country with an extremely credible retaliatory \nthreat, came under repeated attack during the war. For a variety of \ncomplicated reasons Israel simply did not retaliate. Perhaps most \nironic, the reason that Saddam Hussein launched missiles at Israel was \nprecisely to provoke retaliation. Secretary of Defense Perry recognized \nthis point in a recent speech: ``The bad news is that in this era, \ndeterrence may not provide even the cold comfort it did during the cold \nwar. We may be facing terrorists or rogue regimes with ballistic \nmissiles and nuclear weapons at the same time in the future, and they \nmay not buy into our deterrence theory. Indeed, they may be madder than \nMAD.'' And yet, the amendment of the Senator from Michigan seems to \ndeny that things have changed.\n  On the subject of change, let me quote Secretary Perry again: ``We \nnow have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not on \nMAD, not on mutual assured destruction, but rather on another acronym, \nMAS, or mutual assured safety.'' This is precisely what the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995 calls for. Its language almost mirrors Secretary \nPerry's statement.\n  We must not allow a 20-year-old treaty to prevent the United States \nfrom responding to legitimate and growing security threats. Stated \nsimply, the ABM Treaty as it now stands prevents the United States from \ndeploying a national missile defense system that could protect all \nAmericans against even a limited ballistic missile attack. The \nauthorization bill says that it is time to begin changing this. There \nis a real and growing threat. It will take us 8 years to develop the \nsystem called for in the bill. By that time the United States could \nface a variety of new and unpredictable threats, including a North \nKorean ICBM.\n  I would also point out that the ABM Treaty was meant to be a living \ndocument. Article XIII recognizes the possibility that changed \ncircumstances would require the treaty to be modified. Articles XIV and \nXV provide the procedures for making such changes. The argument that \nthis bill violates the treaty is simply false. All the means for \nachieving the policies and goals in the Missile Defense Act of 1995 are \ncontained in the ABM Treaty itself.\n  We should also remember that the ABM Treaty was originally a \nmultiple-site treaty. For those who so resist any change to the treaty, \nI would remind them that the Senate voted to amend the treaty in 1974. \nIt did not upset the Russians then and it should not upset them today \nif we restore the treaty's multiple-site aspect.\n  In fact, the Russians have repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to \namend the treaty in ways that are fully compatible with the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995. Deployment of a multiple-site national missile \ndefense system should not be viewed by the Russians as threatening or \nin any way undermining their confidence in deterrence.\n  There is no substantive reason why a U.S. policy to develop such a \nsystem should undermine START II, as has been argued by the Senator \nfrom Michigan. START II has plenty of problems, but the ABM Treaty \nshould not be one of them. Allowing the Russians to use the ABM Treaty \nas a distraction from the real problems would be a major mistake. Among \nother things, it would lead Russia to believe that it has a veto over a \nwide range of United States national security policies. Remember that \nthey have linked START II ratification to things like U.S. NATO policy. \nIs the Senator from Michigan suggesting that we hold our NATO policy \nhostage to START II as well?\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that we should not try to \nreaffirm the cold war on the floor of the Senate 5 years after its \ndemise. We should welcome the opportunity to establish a more normal \nrelationship with Russia that is not a mutual hostage relationship. We \nshould pursue what Secretary Perry termed mutual assured safety and \nreject the Levin amendment with its embrace of mutual assured \ndestruction.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Rhode Island 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I strongly support the Senator from Michigan \nand my other colleagues in their effort to amend the missile defense \nsections of the defense authorization bill.\n  The amendment would strike from the bill language that mandates \naction that would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The \nABM Treaty, approved overwhelmingly by the Senate following extensive \nand thorough hearings by the Committee on Foreign Relations, has served \nin the intervening years as the centerpiece of modern arms control. The \ntreaty has served to guarantee that neither side could threaten to \nneutralize the offensive forces of the other, with the result that we \nhad years of strategic stability followed currently by major reductions \nin the strategic offensive arms of both sides. Various attacks have \nbeen made upon it over the years, largely by people who would prefer an \nunbridled strategic offensive arms race, but the treaty's benefits have \nbeen so clear that these assaults have been repelled.\n  The present favorable strategic arms environment has been achieved \nunder the umbrella of the ABM Treaty. It probably would have been \nimpossible to reach the present situation in which we are moving away \nfrom heavy dependence on strategic defensive arms were it not for the \nABM Treaty.\n  The amendment also corrects an additional problem with the bill in \nthat it \n\n[[Page S 11271]]\nunilaterally interprets the ABM Treaty's meaning for theater missile \ndefenses. The bill would arbitrarily impose a demarcation line between \ntheater and strategic missile defenses that would tie the President's \nhands as he is trying to negotiate this very matter with the Russians. \nIt is those negotiations that should determine the outcome, not some \narbitrary judgment in an authorization bill.\n  Secretary of Defense Perry noted to Senator Nunn his strong \nopposition to these provisions. He said, ``Unless these provisions are \neliminated or significantly modified they threaten to undermine \nfundamental national security interests of the United States.''\n  Secretary of State Christopher wrote me yesterday to point out that \nthe provisions under discussion here ``raise serious constitutional \nforeign policy and national security concerns.''\n  The Secretary continued:\n\n       Further, such actions would immediately call into question \n     the U.S. commitment to the ABM Treaty, and have a negative \n     impact on U.S.-Russian relations, Russian implementation of \n     the START I Treaty, and Russian ratification of the START II \n     Treaty. This would leave thousands of warheads in place that \n     otherwise would be removed from deployment under the two \n     Treaties, including all MIRVed ICBMs such as the Russian \n     heavy SS-18.\n       There is no need now to take actions that would lead us to \n     violate the Treaty and threaten the stabilizing reductions we \n     would otherwise achieve--and place strategic stability at \n     risk. We have established a treaty-compliant approach to \n     theater missile defense that will enable us to meet threats \n     we may face in the foreseeable future--and one that preserves \n     all the benefits of the ABM, START and START II Treaties.\n\n  Mr. President, the Missile Defense Act portion of the bill, sections \n233-235 simply does not warrant approval by the U.S. Senate. The policy \nit sets forth is neither realistic nor wise. It gives a sense of \nurgency that is not justified by any known facts.\n  There is no obvious danger from theater-range missiles that must be \ncountered. As we all know, the Patriot missile system proved to be both \nhighly effective and appropriate to the threat we faced in Desert \nStorm. An effort is now under way to upgrade the Patriot system over \ntime to meet the threat in future years.\n  It is quite easy to overstate the missile threat this country might \nconceivably face, but it is important to understand that the missile \ntechnology control regime [MTCR] has done much to reduce the potential \nthreat we will face from ballistic missiles. At present there are very \nfew nations who have even the potential to mount new missile threats \nagainst us that could not be handled by planned systems. The provision \nstates the policy that the United States should deploy a missile system \nthat is highly effective against ballistic missile attacks on the \nUnited States, to be augmented over time to provide a defense against \nlarger and more sophisticated ballistic missile threats. This proposal \nseems to me highly unrealistic.\n  Few Members of this body can seriously believe that any deployed \nmissile system could be highly effective against any limited missile \nattack, much less a larger attack. While it is true that, under certain \ncircumstances, ballistic missile defenses could shoot down incoming \nballistic missile warheads, I would not wish to place a wager that no \nwarheads would get through to bring on havoc and destruction nor would \nI want to risk my family or any other American lives on the supposition \nthat any reasonable level of spending for a multiple site national \nmissile defense system would do much of anything other than squander \nmajor parts of the national treasure.\n  The bill specifies that we should seek a cooperative transition to a \nregime that does not feature mutual assured destruction and the \noffense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability. \nThis provision of the bill gives the impression that we do not \nunderstand what mutual assured destruction meant for our security \nduring the cold war. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty essentially \nguarantees that neither side can develop the sort of ballistic missile \ndefenses that would prevent the other side from effectively attacking \nin a nuclear confrontation. The fact of assured destruction of a mutual \nnature kept both sides at bay.\n  Since the cold war has ended, the United States and Russia have \nembarked upon cooperative ventures that are moving us away from the \nconfrontations of the past. We are working with them to dismantle their \nweapons, to ensure the safe storage of nuclear weapons material, and to \nimplement such agreements as START I and, prospectively, START II. If, \nas envisioned in this bill, the United States were to violate or \nabrogate the ABM Treaty, the people on both sides rather than the \ntreaty structure itself would be victimized. Moreover, such action \ncould sabotage the current movement toward greater cooperation and \nthrow us back to an era of confrontation as it jeopardized prospects \nfor continued reductions in the START process and beyond.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, the Secretary of Defense is \ndirected to develop an affordable and operationally effective national \ndefense system with an initial operational capability by the end of \n2003. If all goes well, that time is just about when the major \nreduction of the American and former Soviet nuclear arsenals by two-\nthirds is to have been completed.\n  I doubt that any Member can contemplate a situation in which the \nUnited States would go at top speed toward deployment of a national \nmissile defense system and the Russian response would be passive \nacceptance. They might well match our system. They might well deploy a \nlarger, more capable system. They might well bring to an end the \nreductions that are so clearly in our own national interests. They \nmight well engage in other activities of a bellicose nature that we \nwould find hard to bear. And that would require reactions on our part. \nIt could well incite an action/reaction phase in our national defense \nactivities that would be ruinously expensive and that would, in the \nend, increase the dangers to us rather than permitting the present \ncontinuous reduction in the strategic nuclear threat.\n  To me it is important that we stop to think what it is we are doing \nif we follow this path. In response to an uncertain threat, a threat \nthat has not yet materialized, and a threat that might well be handled \nthrough diplomatic efforts, we would be preparing to obligate tens of \nbillions of dollars. We would do this in the mistaken belief that we \nwould somehow be better protected. Whereas the truth of the matter is \nthat, even if we were able to afford and to deploy an effective \nnational defense structure, our potential adversaries would still have \nthe option of sending nuclear weapons our way by air, by land, or by \nsea. At some point in the future if some despot were to contemplate \nattacking the United States with a nuclear weapon under the misbegotten \nnotion that he would teach us a lesson, it is hard to imagine that he \nwould be deterred if informed that we had a new national missile \ndefense.\n  Mr. President, this has been a rather difficult year in which many of \nus have tried to come to grips with the fact that our national deficits \nare alarming and must be curbed. We are required by the Constitution, \nto ``establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the \ncommon defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings \nof Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.'' If we lose sight of the \nseveral objectives that must be met, we risk the very well-being of our \ncountry. I remember well that a distinguished predecessor, Senator \nStuart Symington of Missouri, was fond of pointing out to the committee \nthat the key to a sound defense is a strong economy.\n  A key to a sound government is a demonstrated ability to keep various \nactivities in proper focus and proper order, so that the whole Nation, \nnot just the defense industry, would benefit.\n  It will not profit us if we sink further in educational quality, if \nwe deny more of our young people the opportunity of a good education at \nthe elementary and secondary levels and reduce the quality of our \ninstitutions of higher education, if we increase the misery of those \nwho have no homes and who are hungry all in the interest of saving \nmoney, only to turn around and waste it on unnecessary defenses. It \ndoes not seem a wise idea to this Senator.\n  It is easy to say that one is for strong defenses. All of us are \npledged to support strong defenses and we will do so. But the United \nStates will stand first among nations because it continues to be strong \nin all of its endeavors, keeps \n\n[[Page S 11272]]\nproper balances, and meets other standards of a great, modern nation.\n  Mr. President, the strategic arms competition between the United \nStates and the former Soviet Union has dwindled away. The ABM Treaty is \nserving as a very stabilizing force in this promising environment. \nFurther reductions should be achievable.\n  It would be extremely foolish to place all of this in jeopardy. It \nmakes no sense to give the Russians cause to back away from their START \ncommitments or to engage in a dangerous strategic defensive arms race. \nIt makes no sense--when so many human needs are so obvious throughout \nour Nation--to jeopardize what has been achieved in controlling and \nreducing strategic arms and to spend billions for dubious purposes when \nthere are so many other desperate calls upon our resources.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] for \nhis initiative. I am happy to be a cosponsor of his amendment. I hope \nthat the Senate will once again prove its wisdom with regard to the ABM \nissue and vote overwhelmingly in favor of this amendment.\n  In conclusion, I am reminded of the question as to how we will be \nremembered in history, as succeeding generations look back at us, just \nas we often have looked back on ancient history from the floor of the \nSenate. I hope that we can be like Athens and not like Sparta--meaning \nput more emphasis on the civilian side of our economy, the economic \nside and the education side, and less on the military side. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as may be required by the \ndistinguished and able Republican leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to commend the members of the Armed Services Committee \nwho, under the able leadership of the distinguished chairman, Senator \nThurmond, and the distinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], have \ndone a first rate job on the defense authorization bill. In particular, \nI would like to congratulate the Armed Service Committee for the \nforward-looking Missile Defense Act contained in this bill.\n  The Missile Defense Act is unique because it does not just authorize \nappropriations for individual programs, it also provides a strategic \nlogic--principles, premises, and policies--thereby integrating these \nprograms into a coherent and comprehensive approach.\n  In my view, the approach adopted in this bill is very compelling on \nfour important points.\n  First, this legislation firmly establishes the critical imperative of \ndefending the United States of America from ballistic missiles. \nMorally, rationally, and constitutionally this must be our top \npriority.\n  Why is this important now? Very simply because the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them is \ndramatically increasing. I would like to commend the distinguished \njunior Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] for highlighting this threat, as \nwell as the need to defend America against it, in his amendment.\n  The Missile Defense Act notes that weapons can be acquired by our \npotential adversaries far more quickly than they can produce them \nindigenously.\n  Mr. President, we cannot wait around for years until this threat is \nliterally on our doorstep. We must prepare now.\n  And so, I am very pleased with the national missile defense \narchitecture established in the Missile Defense Act. This architecture \nincludes ground-based interceptors, fixed ground-based radars and \nspace-based sensors. The bill establishes a deployment goal of 2003 and \nprovides an additional $300 million to support that goal. In my view, \nthat is a good start, but frankly for something as important as \ndefending our citizens, I would like to see an increase to ensure that \nwe will be able to meet the 2003 date.\n  Second, the Armed Services Committee's bill deals with the thorny ABM \nTreaty questions through an intelligent two-step approach:\n  Step 1: It addresses what missile defenses are covered by the ABM \nTreaty, namely by establishing the following standard: Those actually \ntested against a ballistic missile with a range of over 3,500 \nkilometers and a reentry velocity of over 5 kilometers per second. This \nis the standard proposed by both Presidents Bush and Clinton. The point \nis that we should not drag theater systems into a treaty which was \nnever intended to cover them.\n  Step 2: Contrary to wild administration accusations, the bill\n   reviews where we go next with regard to the ABM Treaty. I think we \nneed to set straight what this bill does and does not do.\n\n  It does not set us on a collision course with the ABM Treaty by \nmandating abrogation.\n  Indeed, it does not mandate any particular outcome.\n  It does recognize that an effective multiple site defense of the \nUnited States is inconsistent with the treaty as things stand today. \nThe key here is that an effective defense requires multiple sites.\n  It does call for a year of careful consideration of these matters \nbefore we decide how to proceed on the ABM Treaty. The bottom line is \nthat the bill recognizes what we all should be aware of--that mutual \nassured destruction, the doctrine underlying the ABM Treaty is not a \nsuitable basis for stability in a multipolar world, nor for an \nimproving relationship with Russia. Our goal should be, as outlined in \nthis legislation, to seek a cooperative--and I stress cooperative--\ntransition to a more suitable regime to this post-cold-war era.\n  The third aspect of this bill that is noteworthy is\n   that it establishes a cruise missile defense initiative. In view of \nthe fact that potential adversaries now have access, in varying \ndegrees, to the technologies necessary to build effective cruise \nmissiles, this measure is on the mark and reflects considerable \nforesight. It is my understanding that in addressing cruise missiles, \nthe committee has in no way detracted from the emphasis placed on \nballistic missiles which are a current and rapidly growing threat.\n\n  Finally, I would like to commend the establishment of a theater \nmissile defense core program. The rationale behind theater missile \ndefense is to deny a potential adversary the option of escalating by \nattacking or just threatening to attack U.S. Forces, coalition \npartners, or vital interests. The key elements of this core program are \nthree systems already being pursued by the Clinton administration--\nnamely Patriot-3, Navy lower tier, and THAAD--as well as one critical \naddition: Navy upper tier. The committee has wisely added $170 million \nto Navy upper tier.\n  Mr. President, just imagine trying to put together the Desert Storm \nCoalition if Saddam Hussein could have credibly threatened London, \nRome, Istanbul, or Cairo with ballistic missiles. We cannot allow our \npolitical and military flexibility to be hindered. Therefore, our \nobjective must be to prevent placing our forces, or those of our \nallies, needlessly in harm's way--with systems such as THAAD and Navy \nlower tier.\n  Furthermore, the United States must have the ability to project a \nregional ballistic missile defense capability where and when we need \nit. Navy upper tier give us that capability.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note that the bill does save some \nmoney by terminating the boost phase intercept program and adding a \nlesser amount to explore fulfilling the same mission with an unmanned \nair vehicle [UAV], in conjunction with Israel. Given Israel's expertise \nin UAV's and its keen interest in a boost phase interceptor, this makes \nsense to me.\n  In addition I would like\n   to emphasize that the programs and approach contained in the Missile \nDefense Act should be viewed as an integral part of our counter-\nproliferation strategy. If our adversaries know that their hard-gained \nmissiles will be of no use against America and its allies, they may \nwell be dissuaded from acquiring them in the first place.\n\n  Before I conclude, I would like to address the issue of how much all \nof this costs. It costs $3.4 billion. This is a substantial price tag, \nbut does not represent even 2 percent of the total Department of \nDefense budget. More importantly, however, in considering the costs \nassociated with missile defense, we need to keep in mind how the threat \nto our Nation's security and to our interests has changed.\n  For two centuries, oceans protected us. Now technology gives even \nrelatively weak adversaries the hope of attacking or blackmailing the \nUnited States. This bill takes concrete steps \n\n[[Page S 11273]]\n\n     to protect us and sends the clear message that we will defend \n     our homeland with our superior technology. Moreover, America \n     has, and will continue to have, vital interests around the \n     globe which must be protected, as well.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the measure \noffered by the Senator from Michigan--or any other amendment which \nwould weaken or threaten the Missile Defense Act.\n  Just let me indicate, having visited briefly with the chairman, that \nit is his hope, and it will happen, we will be here late tonight, and \nhopefully during this next vote we can line up serious amendments. Last \nnight sort of fizzled out. Nothing very serious happened after 8:30. So \ntonight we would hope to have amendments up until a late hour and then \nconclude action on this measure tomorrow.\n  This is a very big amendment. It has taken a long time. It is now \n5\\1/2\\ hours into this one amendment and I think that should be, with \n30 minutes to go, that should be enough time on this amendment. But \nthis is a very substantial amendment. It is one of the more important \namendments. It certainly deserves a lot of consideration.\n  But, again, I would just say to my colleagues in the nicest way I \ncan, that a lot of people want to have an August recess and they would \nlike to have it start in August. We are trying to work that out, and \nmuch will depend on the cooperation of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  First I ask unanimous consent Senator Nunn be added as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been said that this language in the \nbill is not inconsistent with the ABM Treaty. I just want to simply \nread the language. It speaks for itself. The ABM Treaty says that the \nparties undertake to deploy an ABM at no more than one site. The bill \nsays it is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple site \ndefense system.\n  It also has been said, quoting here Mr. Deutch, that we should be \nwilling to modify the ABM Treaty. And we surely should. Those \nnegotiations are taking place right now. I believe we should try to \nmodify the ABM Treaty. I would like to see a negotiated capability to \ndeploy defenses--a negotiated capability to deploy defenses. The \ncurrent Missile Defense Act provides that as something we should seek \nto obtain through negotiations.\n  But what does the bill say about negotiations and modifying the \ntreaty? The bill says it is the sense of the Senate that the President \nshould cease all efforts to modify the United States' obligations under \nthe ABM Treaty. So, on the one hand, people are saying we should be \nwilling to modify--indeed we should. We should be willing to negotiate \nto change it--indeed we should. And, on the other hand, there is a \nsense of the Senate that the President should cease until the Senate is \ndone with its study, which will happen sometime next year. And then \nthere is a prohibition on the spending of funds. Which, the way I think \nI read it, and any reasonable interpretation, is that the President may \nnot change the demarcation line that is set forth in this bill through \nnegotiations.\n  But the reading of this bill leaves, I think, only one conclusion, \nand that is that the treaty says multiple sites are not allowed. The \nbill says we will deploy--it is our policy to deploy multiple sites. I \ncannot think of a clearer conflict, and it should not be fudged or \npapered over, because I think it was the obvious intent of the sponsors \nof that language.\n  I yield the floor. I also ask unanimous consent that Senators Daschle \nand Kerry be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 5 minutes to the able Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nHeflin].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of providing a \nsystem to protect the citizens of the United States from ballistic \nmissile attack.\n  There are two parts to the Levin amendment. The first provision \nstrikes the goal of the Missile Defense Act of 1995--a multiple site \ndeployment designed to protect the United States. The second provision \nstrikes the demarcation provision for theater defenses.\n  My concern is with the first provision of this amendment. I support \ndeployment. I fully believe the goal of the Missile Defense Act must be \nto deploy defenses to protect the United States as soon as possible. As \nI stated many times before, I strongly believe we should act within the \nABM Treaty and deploy a single site defense immediately. I also believe \nit is important that the administration begin serious treaty \nnegotiations to allow the deployment of additional ABM sites. This \nmeans that the long-range goal of our negotiations with the Russians \nmust be a multiple site, ground-based deployment.\n  A statement of a national policy to deploy a multiple site defense \nsystem to protect the United States is far from violating the ABM \nTreaty. Many of my colleagues have called this language different \nthings, such as a statement to plan to breach or an anticipatory breach \nof the ABM Treaty.\n By anticipatory breach I assume they mean that something like \n``conspiracy to agree to commit a breach of the ABM Treaty.'' A breach \ndoes not ripen until it actually occurs.\n\n  The treaty clearly defines what constitutes a breach. Deploying \nmultiple missile defense sites today would be a breach. Stating a goal \nof deploying multiple sites would only be a breach if there is no legal \nway to perform such a deployment within the confines of the treaty. \nFortunately, there are two legal ways. The first is a new protocol to \nthe treaty. This may be possible to negotiate. You do not know until \nyou try. Remember, the original treaty allowed two sites. It was a \nsubsequent agreement that limited us to just one site. A second option \nis to actually withdraw from the treaty. It is our legal right to \nwithdraw with 60-days notice. In summary, Mr. President, while there \nare legal methods to deploy multiple sites within the framework of the \nABM Treaty, there can be no anticipatory breach.\n  I further support replacing the stated goal in the committee version \nof the bill with a new goal calling for the deployment of a treaty \ncompliance system coupled with immediate negotiation for additional \nsites. This was a goal of the bipartisan Missile Defense Act of 1991. \nUnfortunately, in striking out the goal of a multiple site deployment, \nSenator Levin's amendment also strikes out the only statement that the \ngoal of the United States is to protect our people from a nuclear \nmissile attack. To me, this is unacceptable.\n  As for demarcation provisions, I share many of Senator Levin's \nconcerns. I believe we should leave the President the flexibility to \nnegotiate modifications to the treaty as required with the guarantee of \na Senate ratification to safeguard against unacceptable provisions.\n  I regret that the two distinct separate provisions are in the same \namendment.\n  Mr. President, unless there can be some compromise--and I hope that \nthere can be some compromise--on the goal of the Missile Defense Act I \nwill have to vote against the Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if anyone else has an amendment, we \nwould like for them to come forth now. We are ready to go forward with \nthis bill.\n  I would like for both sides to notify their Members on the hotline \nthat we are ready to vote on this bill.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nnot be counted against the remaining time we have left in view of the \nfact we only have about 4 or 5 minutes at the most left. \n\n[[Page S 11274]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Nebraska has \nabout 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment to \neliminate numerous objectionable provisions on missile defense \ncontained in the pending authorization bill. There was no more \ncontentious issue in the Armed Services Committee markup of this bill \nthan the issue of missile defense. The committee was divided 11 to 10 \non numerous unsuccessful votes to amend the missile defense language. \nThere is a good reason for the controversy surrounding this section of \nthe bill. No single issue is more deserving of amendment than this one.\n  The committee bill is nothing short of a power grab on the part of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. The slim majority that approved \nthe missile defense provisions in the bill is not satisfied with simply \nmaking foreign policy; it wants to override the foreign policy position \nof the President of the United States, our Commander-in-Chief and the \nperson in which the Constitution vests the power to make foreign \npolicy.\n  The committee bill in its present form moves to end our Nation's 23-\nyear participation in the ABM Treaty and move aggressively to deploying \nmultiple missile defense sites throughout the United States. More \nspecifically, it defines our national missile defense policy in terms \nthat not only abrogate our Nation's treaty obligations but also sets in \nmotion a disastrous course of events that will profoundly threaten our \nnational security. That is right, Mr. President, contrary to how it is \nbeing advertised by the proponents, the national missile defense system \ncalled for in this bill will harm, not enhance, our national security.\n  By voting our intention to break out of the ABM Treaty, we will be \nfeeding the paranoid rhetoric of the militaristic, conservative wing of \nthe Russian Duma looking to place Russia back in an adversarial \nrelationship with the United States. Members of this body must not \nignore the sobering consequences of breaking out of the ABM Treaty and \nstrengthening the hand of Russian extremists. Not only will withdrawing \nfrom the ABM Treaty endanger our new alliance with Russia, it will \nlikely sink future ratification of the START II Treaty and further \nimplementation of the START I Treaty. The language in this bill is a \ndagger pointed at the heart of a whole array of arms control \nagreements, least of which is the ABM Treaty. It will imperil a whole \ngeneration of arms control agreements which will in turn have far-\nreaching consequences both domestically and internationally. It will \nhasten the return to a time of bigger Defense budgets, an arms race in \nspace, larger nuclear arsenals and a general erosion of global \nsecurity.\n  To best describe what type of national missile defense system is \nenvisioned by this bill, I will read directly from section 233 of the \nbill. It states:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy a multiple-\n     site national missile defense system that (a) is highly \n     effective against limited ballistic missile attacks on the \n     territory of the United States, and (b) will be augmented \n     over time to provide a layered defense against larger and \n     more sophisticated ballistic missile threats.\n\nThis is no different from the flawed star wars concept pushed by\n President Reagan during the height of the cold war. In their rush to \nrevive this concept of a shield against a Soviet missile attack, the \ncommittee majority is willing to trample the ABM Treaty along with \nSTART I and START II, and the START agreements that were contemplated \nto follow.\n\n  As a Nation, we have spent $35 billion in taxpayers' money on \nballistic missile defense since 1983. The costs of implementing the \ntype of system envisioned in the bill could easily reach or exceed that \namount. No one knows for sure. A CBO report in March of this year, \nprepared at my request, estimates that a single site--not a multiple \nsite, but a single site--system could cost $29 billion to complete. \nAdditional sites necessary to provide the protective umbrella called \nfor in the bill would cost an additional $19 billion, for a grand total \nof $48 billion. Is this the fiscal commitment we are ready to endorse? \nI think not. By voting for the missile defense provisions in the bill, \nthat is exactly the road the Senate will be supporting--$48 billion for \na Star Wars system all over again.\n  By the way, it may not work as advertised. After already spending $35 \nbillion, there is no high degree of confidence that we can \noperationally deploy the technology capable of intercepting a large and \nsophisticated strike against the United States by the year 2003. I call \nit ridiculous. The technology is far from proven and like the Maginot \nLine following World War I may be the wrong defense against the \nemerging threat, easily circumvented by a terrorist nuclear attack \nemploying a delivery means other than a ballistic missile.\n  While the superpower threat has disappeared and the cold war is over, \nthere seems to be a wave of nostalgia sweeping over some in the Senate \nto gain a renewed sense of mission and purpose by reconstituting the \nthreat facing the United States. The testimony provided to the Armed \nServices Committee by both military and intelligence witnesses are in \nagreement that an enemy ballistic missile threat against the United \nStates does not exist and will not emerge, if at all, well past the \n2003 deployment mandate in the bill. I am struck by the irony that in \ntrying to defend against a nonexistent threat we would by our rash \nactions be unwittingly fostering the very threat we profess to \noriginally be addressing. In other words, our actions would be a self-\nfulfilling prophesy.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin and others have already spoken to the \nnumerous flaws contained in this bill language. I simply ask each \nSenator to read the language in the bill closely before voting on the \namendment. The words speak for themselves. The only proper action is to \nsupport the Levin amendment and strike the objectionable sections of \nthis bill that have been outlined by many of us who have studied this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back any remaining time \nassigned to me by Senator Levin.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Nebraska, who, I might add, as a \nmember of this committee, has fought against what seems to be the most \nperverse development in our military budget and planning in the last 4 \nyears. The idea that now of all times in our history we need to \noverturn what was a centerpiece of two successive Republican Presidents \nseems to me to be a little bit bizarre. But, Mr. President, to state \nthe obvious, I rise in support of the amendment of the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  Mr. President, the so-called National Missile Defense Act of 1995 is \na hodgepodge of contradictory provisions that, if implemented, would \njeopardize our national security beyond anything that I have witnessed \nsince I have been in the U.S. Senate. The bill before us represents a \nfrontal assault on the ABM Treaty. I heard yesterday some sort of, how \ncan I phrase it, interesting questions posed by some of our Republican \nfriends--asking Senators, ``Are you for missile defense? Are you for \nmutual assured destruction?'' I would point out that the reason why we \nare where we are and we are dismantling missiles and we are diminishing \nthe prospect of nuclear confrontation by super or former superpowers is \nbecause the policy of mutual assured destruction has worked pretty darn \nwell. But I will get back to that in a minute.\n  This bill represents a flat, frontal assault on the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. First, it would force us to violate the ABM Treaty by \nmandating dangerous unilateral infractions of that treaty. Then, it \nwould jettison the \n\n[[Page S 11275]]\nentire treaty by requiring the development of a national missile \ndefense system by the year 2003. In a final strange and, I think, \nunexplainable twist, it goes on to call for a select committee to \nreview a treaty that is effectively being declared null and void by the \nvery same bill.\n  Now, either the folks who wrote this into the bill do not understand \nwhat our nuclear strategy has been thus far--and I know they do--or \nthis is incredibly poor draftsmanship or there is a perverse game being \nplayed here.\n  The first two parts of what is before us--not the amendment, but \nabsent the amendment--by definition, destroy the ABM Treaty. Then the \nthird part is to set up a select committee to review the treaty that we \nare legislatively destroying.\n  Now, I assume that may be because there is not enough work or enough \ncommittee assignments for Senators. They want to have other committees \nbecause maybe they get additional staff. I do not know. But, I mean, \nwhy in the devil do you need the third part if you are doing away with \nthe first two parts? But at any rate, taken together, these provisions \nwould simply eviscerate the ABM Treaty, which has provided the basis \nfor our strategic arms reductions over the past 20 years.\n  The most likely immediate consequence of gutting the ABM Treaty would \nbe that the Russian Duma, their Congress, would refuse to approve the \nSTART II Treaty, which is, quite frankly, a jewel in the crown of \nPresident Bush's, and prior to that President Reagan's, foreign policy \ninitiatives. With START II unratified, the hopes for further strategic \narms reduction would be dashed--which, I might add, I think is the real \npurpose of this initiative by the majority. They did not like START II \nto begin with. They did not like START I. They do not like the idea of \nour having to talk about further reductions in the amount of nuclear \nwarheads that exist in the world.\n  But make no mistake about it that if we pass this, why if you were \nsitting in the Russian Duma, why if you were a Russian or anyone else \nfor that matter, would you conclude that it is a good idea to follow \nthrough with the destruction of your existing nuclear arsenal? Why \nwould you do that? I think I understand. I think that is the underlying \npurpose of the legislation before us.\n  This singular achievement of the Bush administration, the START II \nTreaty, is the basis upon which we moved to even further reductions--\nand, along with it, the significant enhancement of the security of \nAmericans that we all hoped would be the byproduct of winning the cold \nwar. Now, I do not know what you all are going to tell your kids. I do \nnot know what you are going to tell your family and friends after you \ntell them how we won the cold war, but there is a greater need for \nnuclear weapons.\n  Now they say, well, this is not about nuclear weapons; this is about \nthe ability to prevent our being attacked by nuclear weapons. I will \nnot go into all the science which Senator Nunn and others have talked \nabout here, but the one thing for certain about how you deal with an \nABM system is you overwhelm it. You build more offensive systems. It is \na lot easier and a lot cheaper to build offensive systems than it is to \nbuild defensive systems. As an old bumper sticker from my generation \nused to say, ``One nuclear bomb that gets through could ruin your \nday.'' One hydrogen bomb dropping on Manhattan can ruin your day. So \nall you have to do, without even having the technology, is overwhelm \nthe system. And it is cheaper to do that.\n  Now, I know what my friends are thinking. They say, ``Boy, we have \ngot the Russians in a great spot. They are broke. Let's take advantage \nhere. They are not going to be able to do this.''\n  Well, at a minimum, folks, I do not know why they are going to go \nahead and destroy what they have, if, in fact, we are going to adopt \nthis policy. The most likely immediate consequence of cutting the ABM \nTreaty, as I said, will be the elimination of the START regime.\n  Mr. President, what troubles me most about the provisions on the ABM \nTreaty is their reckless unilateralism. Article VI-A of the ABM Treaty \ncontains two provisions that have been in place for years. First, it \nbans both parties from giving ABM systems the capacity to counter \nstrategic ballistic missiles; and, second, it bans testing of such \nsystems in an ABM mode.\n  The bill before us would effectively collapse these two provisions \ninto one by asserting than an ABM system is actually not an ABM system, \nunless it has been field tested as a system. In other words, it must \nhave a demonstrated capacity--a demonstrated capacity--of being an ABM \nsystem.\n  Now, there is a reason why when we did the ABM Treaty we insisted \nthat you violate the treaty first, if you demonstrate a capacity to set \nup a system, or second, if such a system could be deployed in such a \ncapacity even if it has not been tested.\n  Now, it might be useful at this juncture to cite the case of \nKrasnoyarsk radar, which we debated for months and months on the floor \nof the Senate not too many years ago. Some of the same people here were \non the floor then pointing out how the Russians were violating the ABM \nTreaty and we could not do business with them and could not trust them. \nNow some of the same people are here saying we should do what we told \nthe Russians they could not do.\n  A gentleman who is gone, a very bright fellow whom we all respected, \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Wallop, was on the floor day in and day out \nwarning us about the Krasnoyarsk radar. The Soviet Union built this \ngiant radar in Siberia in the 1980's. Although the radar was never \nturned on, that is, its capacities were never demonstrated as would be \nrequired now, we argued that it had the inherent capability of an ABM \nsystem and constituted a violation of the ABM Treaty. The Soviets \nasserted that since the system had never been tested, it was permitted \nunder the ABM Treaty.\n  Eventually, through the good offices of my conservative friends and \nsome of us who joined them, the Russians tore down the radar. If, in \nfact, the Armed Services Committee provisions that are contained in the \nbill prevail, absent being amended by the Senator from Michigan, they \nwould be able to keep the radar.\n  It would not be a violation of the ABM Treaty. I wonder how many of \nmy friends over there would be saying, ``You know, no problem, we \nunderstand. We think there should only be one test.''\n  I wonder what my friend Senator Thurmond would be saying then. I \nwonder what my friends over on the right would be saying. They would be \napoplectic, because although it had not been turned on and \ndemonstrated, it clearly had the inherent capability and, therefore, \nwas in violation of the ABM Treaty.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues that there is no legal \nbasis for a unilateral amendment to the ABM Treaty. It seems like I \nhave been fighting this, along with Senator Nunn, Senator Levin, and \nothers, for the last decade. The Reagan administration tried a frontal \nattack on this in the early eighties saying, ``We are going to \nreinterpret the ABM Treaty.'' If you do not like what it says, \nreinterpret it. Well, we won that fight, and little did I think we \nwould be back here having this fight.\n  It would be better to come out here and just declare the treaty null \nand void and have a Senate vote saying it contravenes our national \ninterest to be part of the ABM Treaty any longer. At least we would be \nhonest with the people here. At least we would be telling the truth. \nBut this is a charade.\n  I point out to my colleagues, again, that there is no legal basis for \nthe unilateral amendment of the ABM Treaty, or any other treaty, for \nthat matter. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties serves as a \nsource of customary international law and provides guidance in this \nmatter. According to its provision, a treaty is to be interpreted in \naccordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms.\n  The two prongs of section 6(A) of the ABM Treaty are clear: One is \naimed at constraining demonstrated capabilities, and the other is aimed \nat constraining inherent capabilities. In other words, this provision \nwas intended to prevent testing against strategic missiles and \ndevelopment of systems that have the ability to counter such missiles.\n  To say that only the testing, or demonstrated capacity, standard is \nrelevant would represent a clear departure from the obligation set \nforth in the treaty. \n\n[[Page S 11276]]\n\n  A second area in which the provisions of this bill would mandate \nunilateral action with regard to the ABM Treaty is defining the \ndemarcation line between strategic and theater missiles. The bill \nbefore us would arbitrarily set that mark at a peak reentry velocity of \n5 kilometers per second and an effective range of 3,500 kilometers. The \nso-called 5/3,500 threshold may, in fact, be a legitimate demarcation \nline.\n  Guess what? The treaty says you negotiate those things. You negotiate \nthem. That is what the existing treaty demands.\n  Mr. President, these amendments to the ABM Treaty affirm that we will \ndefine unilaterally the line between a strategic missile system and a \ntheater missile; and we will declare unilaterally our ballistic missile \ndefenses are in compliance with the ABM Treaty. Forget the fact that \nthe very issues are now being negotiated with the Russians. We are \ngoing to do what we want.\n  As my young 14-year-old daughter's friends often say, ``Why don't we \nget real here?'' Let us just declare the treaty null and void and stop \nthis. At least that would have the integrity of allowing others to \ntrust making a treaty with us again. At least it is straightforward, \nand almost every treaty including the ABM Treaty says if this is not in \nour national interest, the President can declare it so and we are out.\n  So let us not wreck the ABM Treaty. Do not wreck this President's or \nfuture Presidents' ability to negotiate treaties of consequence with \npeople when we can come along and just redefine them midstream, when we \neither think the other party is extremely vulnerable or we want to do \nsomething that the treaty does not suggest.\n  I want to ask the rhetorical question: If we did not need an \nantiballistic missile system when the Soviet Union had over 12,000 \nnuclear warheads all aimed at the United States or things of vital \ninterest to us, why in the devil do we need it so badly now?\n  As Senator Nunn explained, such a system is not the thing that is \ngoing to prevent a Qadhafi or some Third World screwball from \ndetonating a nuclear weapon in the United States. They will bring it in \nby ship, smuggle it in, reassemble it in the basement of the World \nTrade Tower, and blow us up. They are not going to wait until they have \nan intercontinental ballistic capability to do it.\n  This is nuts, with all due respect. If there is any lingering doubt \nabout whether the provisions I have referenced are meant to scuttle the \nABM Treaty, I hope we disabuse ourselves of that.\n  The ABM Treaty is based on a very simple, yet powerful premise that \nhas been tested and proven to be valid--and that is that the \ndevelopment of defenses against strategic ballistic missiles is \ninherently destabilizing. Were the Russians to develop a shield against \nstrategic ballistic missiles, what would be our reaction? We would do \nthe same thing they are likely to do if this provision becomes law--\nthat is, maintain the means to overwhelm those defenses.\n  Or would we say, ``You know, it's good for everybody, that they are \nnow impervious to attack as long as we keep our missiles at the same \nnumber. We do not have that capability, but we are going to trust them; \nwe have no problem.'' We know we would rush to do that.\n  Or would we sit here and say, ``My Lord, the only thing we know for \nsure we can do, and do it more cheaply, is build more intercontinental \nballistic missiles and theater ballistic missiles, for that matter, so \nthat no matter how many of these brilliant pebbles or whatever else is \nin the sky, we can just send enough in so that a few will get \nthrough.''\n  But we are going to expect the Russians to say, ``Don't worry, we \nknow those good old Americans would never, ever do anything like this \nto us; therefore, we don't have to worry. We'll continue to dismantle \nour missiles, and we won't attempt to do the same thing and all will be \nwell.''\n  One of the first assignments I was sent on abroad was in 1978 on the \nso-called SALT Treaty. I was asked to take a group of new Members of \nthe Senate to meet with Mr. Brezhnev, then the leader of the Soviet \nUnion. We sat down and negotiated what were referred to as conditions, \nSenate understandings that we had attached to the SALT Treaty.\n  In the middle of the conversation, as I was pointing out how we would \nnever do anything bad, Brezhnev looked at me and said through an \ninterpreter: Let me make sure I understand this.\n  He said, ``I would like to remind you that as bad as you think we \nare, we never dropped a nuclear bomb on anybody. As bad as you think we \nare, you are not as good as you think you are. You expect us to say we \nknow you would never attack us with nuclear weapons when, in fact''--I \nam not judging whether it was right or wrong--``you have already \ndemonstrated when your national interests are at stake, you will use \natomic weapons.'' That is kind of a compelling point.\n  If we are going to take such a brazen step as trashing a treaty that \nhas helped to lessen the prospect of nuclear Armageddon for over two \ndecades, you would think that there is a good reason behind it. Well, \nthere is none that I can discern.\n  Instead, we are asked to accept the dubious justifications contained \nin a couple of paragraphs of this year's Defense authorization bill.\n  One justification is that mutual assured destruction and its \ncorollary--deterrence--is no longer relevant after the cold war. That \nis right, folks, traditional deterrence is dead because the bill before \nus has declared it passe.\n  Mr. President, you cannot delegislate deterrence. That concept is \ngrounded in the fundamental interaction among States.\n  In a continued elaboration of flawed logic, the bill goes on to \nassert that with traditional deterrence dead, both the United States \nand Russia will be encouraged to reduce their offensive strategic \narsenals.\n  This bizarre line of reasoning reveals a failure to grasp the \nfundamental counter-intuitive interaction between offense and defense \nthat gave rise to the ABM Treaty in the first place.\n  As long as we have a potentially adversarial relationship with \nRussia--in other words, as long as we are not dealing with a Canada, or \na France, or a Britain--our sense of security will depend on the \nconfidence we have in our retaliatory capability.\n  Anything that undermines confidence in retaliatory capability--which \nis what strategic missile defenses do--will increase the reluctance of \none side or the other to reduce offensive strategic forces.\n  One implicit aspect of the bill's analysis is correct--the Russians \ndo not have the economic means to develop an ABM system on a par with \nwhat we are capable of developing with the expenditure of a large \nportion of our treasure. But they do have a stockpile of surplus \nwarheads which they could deploy to respond to our national missile \ndefense system.\n  With our planned deployment of a national missile defense system, the \nRussians, now feeling less certain of their retaliatory capability, \nwill opt for the next best alternative--they will ignore their \nremaining commitments under Start I and they will refuse to ratify \nStart II.\n  It will not end there--they are likely to begin expanding their \nstrategic forces to overcome missile defenses. We will respond by \nexpanding our forces and by developing even more robust missile \ndefenses, and so on. In short, we will restart the spiral of escalating \nnuclear deployments that marked the worst days of East-West \nconfrontation.\n  What a cruel irony that would be--after the cold war, when we could \nhave achieved significant reductions in strategic arms--we will instead \nhave created the kind of bankrupting, paranoia-driven arms race that \nthe ABM Treaty sought to prevent, and, indeed, did prevent during the \ncold war.\n  Another justification for scuttling the treaty could be called the \nBarbarians are at the gates argument. According to this line of \nreasoning, there are numerous rogue States on the verge of acquiring \nadvanced tactical and strategic ballistic missiles. And we urgently \nneed to develop the means to counter this imminent threat to our \nnational security.\n  This is a crucial matter, and one which deserves more careful \nanalysis than has been employed to date. I know about the estimates \nthat say that some countries are only a decade away from having long \nrange ballistic missile delivery capability. But I question the \nvalidity of those analyses. \n\n[[Page S 11277]]\n\n  Many other reputable studies by experts in the field indicate that \nthe nations causing the greatest worry to the Defense Department will \nnot acquire long range delivery systems for the next 20 to 30 years, if \never. Even Defense Department data reveal that 97 percent of the Third \nWorld missile threat comes from theater ballistic missiles with a range \nof 1,000 kilometers or less.\n  The delivery system of choice of rogue states targeting the United \nStates with weapons of mass destruction will not be ballistic missiles. \nThere are plenty of ways to circumvent defenses without even using \nmissiles. These are the threats on which we should focus our ever-\nscarcer resources, not on the alarmist scenarios that are being touted \nby the proponents of national missile defense.\n  If a national missile defense can be rendered ineffective by an \noverwhelming Russian attack, and if such a system is many times more \ncapable than what is required to contend with the Third World theater \nballistic missile threat, then we are left to ask a basic question--\nwhat are we spending tens of billions of dollars to defend ourselves \nfrom?\n  I think that the only logical conclusion is one that is not \nexplicitly stated, but begins to emerge if you read carefully between \nthe lines. The real reason for going on a crash program to develop a \nnational missile defense system is that there are some who don't care \nthat the ABM Treaty will be jettisoned because, in their view, arms \nreduction per se is not in our national security interest.\n  If our deployment of a national missile defense causes the Russians \nto abandon START II, that fits right in with their strategy. Such a \nmove by the Russians will provide the excuse they need to argue for \nmaintaining and perhaps even expanding a large United States strategic \narsenal.\n  I realize that there are others who might vote for a national missile \ndefense system because, upon first glance, it seems to be a way to \nrender strategic ballistic missiles obsolete. I know that not everyone \nwho supports a missile defense wants an arms buildup. Some may honestly \nbelieve that a national missile defense is a path to future arms \nreduction.\n  But I would hope that those who do want arms reduction will realize \nthe essential paradox of defense and offense where strategic ballistic \nmissiles are concerned. The more you try to defend, the more the other \nside will buildup. This has been borne out by experience. In this \nmanner, a well-meaning attempt to reduce the effectiveness of strategic \nweapons by building a robust defense could have the perverse impact of \nleading to a new and costly arms race.\n  In closing, I would just like to remind my colleagues who remain \nskeptical about the usefulness of the ABM Treaty, that the START \ntreaties--in which both sides have agreed to cut their strategic \narsenals by a total of two-thirds--were concluded without the United \nStates having deployed a single strategic defensive system.\n  The ABM Treaty has served the purpose of arms reduction remarkably \nwell. We should seek to build upon its successes, not scuttle it for an \nill-defined and perilous course.\n  Finally, let me say that if Senators are going to stand on the floor \nand say they are going to vote against the Levin amendment but they \nsupport START I and START II, then I respectfully suggest that they go \nread this legislation. I do not know how you can say that.\n  If a Senator is going to say, ``I support the ABM Treaty but I am \nagainst the Levin amendment,'' I suggest he or she go read the \nlegislation before us. If a Senator comes to the floor and says, ``By \nthe way, I not only do not like the doctrine of mutual assured \ndestruction, I do not support START I, START II, or the ABM Treaty,'' \nthen I say vote against this amendment, because then you will be \nintellectually honest. It is a legitimate position to take. But let us \nnot kid the American people and the world and say we support reducing \nthe number of nuclear weapons, we support START I, we support START II, \nwe are even for a START III, which we are contemplating, and we are for \nthe ABM Treaty but, by the way, we are going to vote for this \nlegislation. You cannot do both and be intellectually honest about it.\n  So, as they say, pick a team, pick a side, pick a position, but do \nnot pretend you are on both sides because you cannot be against Levin \nand for the ABM Treaty. You cannot be against Levin and for the START \nII agreement. You cannot be against Levin and for further reduction in \nthe nuclear arsenals of the major powers in the world.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Levin-\nExon-Bingaman-Glenn amendment, to the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 1996, to strike provisions of the bill which would \ndirectly lead to our violation of the ABM treaty. This treaty is vital \nto American national security.\n  The Missile Defense Act would lead to violations of the ABM Treaty in \ntwo crucial ways.\n  First, it would establish a deployment plan for a national missile \ndefense. If a national ballistic missile defense were deployed, it \nwould blatantly violate the treaty.\n  Second, before any national missile defense system can be deployed, \nit must be tested. Fully testing this type of system would violate the \nABM Treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty is the diplomatic foundation of our intercontinental \nballistic missile reduction strategy. It was possible to negotiate and \nratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or START, which is currently \nbeing implemented, and negotiate START II, which awaits ratification by \nthis Senate and the Russian Duma because of the strategic groundwork \nlaid in the ABM Treaty. Abandoning or violating the ABM Treaty would \nthreaten the strategic ballistic missile reductions under these two \ntreaties which, when implemented, would verifiably eliminate the \nintercontinental ballistic missiles carrying two-thirds of Russia's \nnuclear warheads.\n  Further, abandoning our treaty obligations jeopardizes our future \nrelationship with Russia. The Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations \nhave worked hard to not only strengthen the strategic relationship \nbetween our nations, but economic, cultural, and diplomatic \nrelationships as well. We have achieved measurable strategic reductions \nbecause of the foundation of trust the ABM Treaty provides. To \njeopardize this trust, especially while START II waits precariously for \nratification, is simply unwise. If the ABM Treaty is abandoned, the \ncasualty may very well be the future of nuclear arms reductions with \nRussia.\n  While it is true that the ABM Treaty was ratified at the height of \nthe cold war and that its outlook is bipolar in nature, the fact \nremains that the greatest ballistic missile threat to the United States \nis still located in Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union. \nThe ABM Treaty gives a sense of security to the Russian government \nwhich allows them to move forward toward reducing their stockpiles of \nnuclear weapons under both START and START II.\n  Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, has felt it necessary to declare that United States \nabandonment of the ABM Treaty could harm both the prospects for START \nII ratification by the Duma and our broader security relationship with \nRussia. In addition, abandonment of the treaty could threaten the \ncontinued dismantlement of nuclear weapons under START. Again, if we \nabandon our commitments under the ABM Treaty, we stand to lose the \nverified elimination of thousands of nuclear missiles currently aimed \nat the U.S. Our national security priority should be to greatly reduce \nthis ICBM threat.\n  My support of the ABM Treaty does not negate my willingness to see a \nnational ballistic missile defense system studied. We should continue \nour research and development programs for a national ballistic missile \ndefense system and should always look toward our future defense needs.\n  Turning to the issue of theater missile defense, I also believe \ndeeply that we must develop and deploy this type of system which does \nnot violate the ABM Treaty. Development and deployment of this type of \nsystem is technologically feasible and is permissible under the ABM \nTreaty. Most of the \n\n[[Page S 11278]]\ntheater ballistic missile defense systems currently in development and \nbeing tested are ABM Treaty compliant. In fact, the joint summit \nstatement from the May Clinton/Yeltsin Summit delineates a set of \nprinciples that provides that both sides can deploy effective theater \nballistic missile defense systems within the framework of the ABM \nTreaty.\n  Because theater ballistic missile defense is entirely possible under \nthe ABM Treaty, is it not the better path to both maintain the ABM \nTreaty thus protecting the elimination of thousands of intercontinental \nballistic missiles under START and START II and to develop and deploy a \ntheater ballistic missile defense system that could both protect future \ntheater ballistic missile threats to American shores and current \ntheater ballistic missile threats to American and Allied troops \noverseas?\n  Let us continue our research and development programs for a national \nballistic missile defense, let us continue to develop and work to \ndeploy a theater ballistic missile defense, but let us oppose \nabandoning the ABM Treaty and thus lose our opportunity to eliminate \nthousands of Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  It is in our national security interest to continue to support the \nABM Treaty until the great threat of Russian ICBMs aimed at the United \nStates is substantially reduced under START and START II. Until this \nimportant process is completed, let us work to deploy a theater missile \ndefense system and continue our research towards the development of \nnational ballistic missile defense system.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I received a letter from the \nHonorable Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State. I will take a few \nseconds to read a short paragraph:\n\n       I commend the Committee's decision to set a course for \n     deployment of a National Missile Defense system to protect \n     all Americans. Development of such a system is long overdue. \n     I believe that such a deployment will actually enhance \n     deterrence. . . The ABM Treaty is unable to help the United \n     States deal with one of the most significant post-Cold War \n     security threats: the proliferation of long-range ballistic \n     missiles. In fact, the ABM Treaty now stands in the way of \n     our ability to respond in an effective manner.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nrecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: I am writing to congratulate you on \n     your recent markup of the Defense Authorization Bill, \n     especially the provisions in the bill dealing with ballistic \n     missile defense and the ABM Treaty. With the bill soon to be \n     debated on the Senate floor, I wanted to present my views on \n     a number of related issues.\n       The time has clearly come for the United States to consider \n     either amending the ABM Treaty or finding some other basis \n     for regulating U.S.-Russian strategic relations. The ABM \n     Treaty was born of a different era, characterized by a \n     different set of strategic and political circumstances. As I \n     said in my testimony before your committee earlier this year, \n     when things have changed so much, we must not fear changes in \n     our Cold War treaty arrangements if such changes are in our \n     best interest.\n       I commend the Committee's decision to set a course for \n     deployment of a National Missile Defense system to protect \n     all Americans. Development of such a system is long overdue. \n     I believe that such a deployment will actually enhance \n     deterrence and provide the basis for deeper offensive \n     reductions. Our experience with the ABM Treaty has shown that \n     a lack of defense neither promotes offensive reductions nor \n     otherwise enhances stability. More important, the ABM Treaty \n     is unable to help the United States deal with one of the most \n     significant post-Cold War security threats: the proliferation \n     of long-range ballistic missiles. In fact the ABM Treaty now \n     stands in the way of our ability to respond in an effective \n     manner.\n       I am also pleased to see that the Committee has passed the \n     legislation introduced by Senator Warner, which establishes a \n     clear demarcation between permitted Theater Missile Defense \n     systems, and strategic defenses limited by the ABM Treaty. It \n     is essential that the ABM Treaty not be extended to cover \n     systems that were never intended to be limited, such as \n     Theater Missile Defense systems. Such systems are too \n     important to be held hostage to arbitrary and unnecessary \n     negotiations. I find it hard to believe that the Clinton \n     Administration objects to having its own demarcation standard \n     codified into law. Such a move seems entirely appropriate and \n     consistent with U.S. obligations under the ABM Treaty.\n       I believe that the Missile Defense Act of 1995 is an \n     important step in the right direction. It is a measured and \n     well-focused response to a dramatic threat to United States \n     national interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Henry A. Kissinger.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is the leader ready to proceed?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will withhold. I understand the Senator from Texas may \nhave some remarks, if the Senator would like to wait, or would he like \nto proceed?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am prepared to speak, but if the Senator has been on \nthe floor, I am happy to defer to her.\n  Mr. THURMOND. How much time does the Senator from Texas want?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Two or three minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think there is a fundamental issue \nhere, and that is, as the world changes, is the U.S. Senate and the \nU.S. Congress going to continue to meet the challenges of the new world \nthat we face today?\n  The world has changed since the ABM Treaty. No longer are we a \nbipolar world. We now know--and it has been published often in \nnewspapers--that there are numerous countries that have nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons. Do they have the ability to attack \nthe United States with these weapons? We believe that some might.\n  So the question is: Are we going to unilaterally disarm our ability \nto defend our shores from a potential attack? That is the issue. We \ncannot, in any way, limit our capability to meet the challenges of the \npost cold war, multipolar world that we are living in today.\n  So I hope that we will not do anything that will lessen our ability \nto defend our shores. We must have a theater ballistic missile defense. \nWe must continue to go forward to make sure we have the technology to \ndefend ourselves against any incoming missiles, or to defend our armed \nservices in any theater in which they may be fighting. That is the core \nissue today.\n  So I hope that our colleagues understand the significance of this \nargument. This is not, in any way, partisan; it ought not be in any way \na matter for discussion, really; it is a matter of priorities and what \nour leadership role is. I hope that we will put aside partisan views on \nthis issue and look at our responsibility to defend our shores and our \nfuture generations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Michigan for the time.\n  Mr. President, I want to also thank him for offering this amendment, \nand I commend Senators Exon, Bingaman and Glenn for cosponsoring it. I \nbelieve that the vote on this amendment may be one of the most critical \nvotes that we cast this year. There are many provisions in this bill \nthat I, along with many of the people on this side of the aisle--and I \nsuspect beyond the beltway--strongly oppose. However, perhaps the most \nobjectionable provisions in this bill--and potentially the most \ndamaging to the long-term security interests of the United States--are \nthose calling for the United States to deploy multiple-site national \nmissile defenses by the year 2003.\n  As Senator Levin and others have already pointed out, committing this \ncountry to deploying a multisite national missile defense system at \nthis time would have very damaging consequences for our national \nsecurity. The Levin amendment would retain the strategic policies that \nhave kept this country safe now for a half century.\n  I strongly support the Levin amendment for several reasons.\n  First, I am concerned that any effort by the United States to deploy \ntheater missile defenses could jeopardize several important treaties \nnegotiated under both the Clinton and Bush administrations. For \ninstance, the provisions could hold up implementation of \n\n[[Page S 11279]]\nthe START Treaty; imperil Russian ratification of the START II Treaty, \nwhich requires Russia and the United States, as everyone here knows, to \nreduce their long-range nuclear weapons from 8,500 to 3,500; and \npossibly impact the conventional forces in Europe Treaty, which calls \nfor the reduction of heavy weapons, such as tanks and combat aircraft \nthroughout NATO and the former Warsaw Pact.\n  Second, I am concerned that deployment of national missile defenses \nin the United States could undermine U.S. nonproliferation efforts. For \ninstance, China could withhold support for the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty if the United States violates or renegotiates the ABM Treaty.\n  Needless to say, Chinese resistance to the CTB could induce other \nregional powers to follow suit, thus eroding support for the \nNonproliferation Treaty. Moreover, deployment of theater missile \ndefenses would make other nuclear countries, like China, Britain, and \nFrance, less willing to enter into future nuclear reduction treaties.\n  Third, as has been pointed out several times during this debate, \nnothing in the treaty precludes the Department of Defense and the \nBallistic Missile Defense Office from conducting the program as \ncurrently planned for at least the next year or two. Let me repeat \nthat. The ABM Treaty will not constrain our ballistic missile defense \nefforts for at least the next year or two.\n  Therefore, we have ample time to weigh the threats this Nation faces \nand debate the appropriate response. We need not march off \nprecipitously on a path that leads us to unilateral abrogation of one \ntreaty, and the probable breaking of several others.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear, I am not saying that we should \nnever consider making changes to the ABM Treaty or any other treaty. \nCircumstances change and security requirements must be modified \naccordingly.\n  Even the Constitution, the greatest document drafted by this country, \nhas been modified 26 times. What I am saying is that this is neither \nthe time nor the manner to modify the treaty.\n  For all these reasons, I strongly support the Levin amendment and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield such time as I have remaining to the author of the amendment, \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire about the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and eighteen seconds for the \nSenator from South Carolina, and 6 minutes for the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LOTT. Due to the fact that we only have 1 minute and 18 seconds, \nwe will reserve our time to see if the Senator from Michigan would like \nto use the balance of his 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand the Chair is saying there is 6 minutes \nremaining. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the language in the bill which this amendment would \ncorrect does three things.\n  First, the language sets forth a head-on clash with the ABM Treaty. \nWords have clear meaning by the way they have consequences, too, which \nwe will get to in a moment.\n  Section 233 says it is the policy of the United States to deploy \nmultiple site national defense missiles. The ABM Treaty prohibits such \ndefenses. You cannot get much clearer than that without a formal \nabrogation document. What this bill says is the policy to do it is not \nallowed by the ABM Treaty.\n  In addition, section 235 of the bill says that to implement the \npolicy established in that earlier section, the Secretary of Defense \nshall develop an affordable and operationally effective national \nmissile defense system, which will attain initial operational \ncapability by a specified year.\n  ``Shall'' and ``will;'' these are very clear and very strong words.\n  Second, the bill says that the line between short-range and long-\nrange missile defenses is a specific line. We are doing it by U.S. law.\n  Now, it is the same demarcation which is being negotiated between \nRussia and us. What we are doing is usurping the negotiations and \ntransferring them from wherever they are being negotiated to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. If the Duma did that, we would not stand for it for \none moment--any of us--I hope. So there is a unilateral interpretation \nof the ABM Treaty in this bill which would be stricken by this \namendment.\n  Third, the bill says it is a sense of the Senate that the President \nshall not negotiate--these are the words--sense of the Senate the \nPresident should cease all efforts to clarify U.S. obligations under \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  We have heard a lot about the need to modify. By the way, I think \nmost would agree that the ABM Treaty should be modified. At least many \nof us, including myself.\n  Here it is said in section 237, that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the President should cease all efforts to modify, clarify, U.S. \nobligation. Both words are used--modify and clarify.\n  On the floor, we hear a lot about we ought to try to modify this \ntreaty, and we should. Section 237 says the President shall cease all \nefforts to modify or clarify our obligations under the treaty. That \nsection would also be stricken.\n  Mr. President, this language in this bill which the amendment would \nstrike will dash the hopes of our generation for a new relationship \nwith Russia, following the end of the cold war. That is what Secretary \nPerry tells us. That is what General Shalikashvili tell us.\n  This is why Secretary Perry has written us the following:\n\n       Certain provisions [in this bill] related to the ABM Treaty \n     would be very damaging to U.S. security interests. By \n     mandating actions that would lead us to violate or disregard \n     U.S. treaty obligations--such as establishing a deployment \n     date of a multiple-site NMD system--the bill would jeopardize \n     Russian implementation of the START I and START II Treaties, \n     which involve the elimination of many thousands of strategic \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  We cannot get much more serious than this. It has never been more \nimportant to read words in a bill than it is now because what our \nSecretary of Defense is telling us; that the elimination of offensive \nweapons aimed at us is jeopardized if we unilaterally move to trash the \nABM Treaty or interpret the ABM Treaty the way this bill does.\n  That is why this debate is worth 5 hours--indeed, maybe 5 days. That \nis the seriousness of the language that is in this bill.\n  Then the Secretary of Defense goes on to say that, ``The bill's \nunwarranted imposition through funding restrictions, of a unilateral . \n. . demarcation interpretation would similarly jeopardize these \nreductions . . .''\n  Now, we have a treaty. Treaties should mean things. They should have \nsignificance. When the Russians violated it, we tried to hold them \naccountable. So, I believe, the Duma will point to our action in saying \nthat this gives them an excuse to, instead of reducing nuclear weapons, \nto stop those reductions, to keep the numbers where they are, and, \nindeed, increase them, in order to now deal with these new defenses \nwhich this bill commits us to build.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. We do have at least one more speaker. Could I ask unanimous \nconsent we have 10 additional minutes, 5 on each side?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, does that then supersede whatever time we \nhave left?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would begin now, when all existing time expires, which \nis within about 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. We have talked about this now \nfor 3\\1/2\\ hours, and we have got a little bit longer to go.\n  I think it has been said every argument has been made on both sides \nby this time. When the Senator from Texas stood up and talked about \nthis being a different world, I have to emphasize that this is a \ndifferent world than it was back in 1972.\n  In 1972, we had two superpowers. We had the USSR and the United \nStates, and we had a treaty that took place back then that was \ncontroversial at that time, the ABM Treaty between two parties. One of \nthose parties does not even exist anymore. The world is totally \ndifferent. The threat is not there from the Soviet Union because the \nSoviet Union is not there anymore.\n  If we stop and look at the comparison that we have today, we are \nliving under \n\n[[Page S 11280]]\na treaty that says that we can defend ourselves overseas, we can defend \nourselves in a theater missile environment, but we cannot defend our \nown country.\n  Now, I think we have to look at it and say, is the environment we are \nin today a more dangerous environment than it was in 1972? I think \nthere is some argument, very persuasive argument, that there is. We \nhave heard quoted several times on this floor a statement by Jim \nWoolsey, who is the Security Adviser to President Clinton, said that we \nknow of between 20 and 25 nations that have developed or are developing \nweapons of mass destruction--either nuclear, chemical, or biological--\nand they are working on the missile method to deliver those weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I think that a case can be made that the environment we are in today \nis far more serious, far more dangerous, to our Nation's security than \nit was when we could identify who the enemy was.\n At that time, of course, the enemy was the U.S.S.R.\n\n  I will share with you a conversation I had with Dr. Henry Kissinger. \nWe all know he was the architect, back in 1972, of this controversial \nantiballistic missile treaty. He said at that time he felt it was the \nright thing to do.\n  At that time the mutual destruction mentality that we had seemed to \nmake sense. ``We only have two countries in the world who are capable \nof developing and delivering any form of destruction of that nature, so \nlet us just both make ourselves so we are vulnerable to the other \none.'' Maybe it made sense then. I am not sure that it did.\n  But the other day, in a private conversation with me--and he said it \nis fine to quote him--he said: For us to be living under that treaty \ntoday is insane. And he said, and this is a direct quote, ``It's nuts \nto make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''\n  I do not know whether that is in the letter that the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina submitted for the Record. I suggest words \nto that effect are there, but it is a lengthy, two-page letter. In that \nletter he describes it.\n  This is the person who was the architect of the ABM Treaty. So all I \nam saying, Mr. President, is today it is a different world. Today it is \na world not with two superpowers but with a superpower, the United \nStates--if we want to call ourselves that--and many other semi-\nsuperpowers or quasi-superpowers, any of which, if they have the \ntechnology, can deliver weapons of mass destruction to the United \nStates.\n  I agree with Henry Kissinger; it is nuts to make a virtue out of our \nvulnerability, which is exactly what we have been doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Michigan. I think this is awfully important. I know it \nhas taken an awful lot of time on the Senate floor today, but I think \nit is worth the amount of time it has taken. This is an enormously \nimportant amendment. This amendment strikes the language in the bill \nthat is brought to the floor by the Armed Services Committee that will \nabrogate the ABM Treaty. In my judgment, it is reckless to do what is \ndone in this bill in a manner that will abrogate that treaty.\n  We had a long debate this morning on the subject of funding, $300 \nmillion added to the bill for a national missile defense system. That \namendment that I brought to the floor to strip the $300 million out \nlost by a vote of 51 to 48. I hope we will revisit that issue in an \nappropriate way and we will achieve a different result. That was \nimportant.\n  But this is even more important. I hope the Senate, on this \namendment, will understand the dimensions of this amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Michigan. The ABM Treaty is the foundation of the arms \nagreements which we have reached with the Soviet Union and Russia and \nothers. I think it is critically important that we agree to this \namendment this afternoon and strike the language in the bill brought to \nthe floor, that I think jeopardizes, literally jeopardizes, our \nsecurity by weakening the arms control agreements that are now in \nplace.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Michigan for a long, hard fight. I \nhope when the votes are counted we will find, in this circumstance, he \nprevails--he prevails for the good of this country and for the future \nof our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire on the remainder of time on \nboth sides of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute and 33 seconds left on the \nmajority side and 3 minutes and 50 seconds left on Senator Levin's \nside.\n  Mr. LOTT. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the cold war is over. But there are some \nremnants that remain, including about 8,000 nuclear warheads on Russian \nsoil. Those warheads are being dismantled. They are being dismantled as \npart of the START I agreement and START II agreement. The dismantling \nof those warheads is critical to our security.\n  The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs says that the continuing \ndismantlement of Russian warheads that threaten us is jeopardized if we \nundermine the ABM Treaty. Because instead of dismantling warheads, the \nRussians will now be faced with the threat of defenses, which means \nthey would be tending to increase the warheads in order to overcome \nthose defenses.\n  So there are a number of treaties which are at issue. There is the \nABM Treaty, but there is also a START I Treaty and a START II Treaty.\n  When General Shalikashvili tells us, as he has in writing, that we \nmust assume that unilateral United States legislation could harm \nprospects for START II ratification by the Duma, and probably impact \nour broader security relationship with Russia as well, we should \nlisten.\n  And when the Secretary of Defense says that the study which is \nreferred to in this bill should be completed before we decide to deploy \nsites in violation of the ABM Treaty instead of vice versa--we should \nnot be now committing to deploy multisites when they violate a treaty \nwhich we are then going to study--so what the Secretary of Defense last \nsaid is these serious consequences argue for conducting the proposed \nSenate review of the ABM Treaty before--underlined--before considering \nsuch drastic and far-reaching measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 1 minute, 31 seconds on \nyour side, approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds on the side of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have the authority of the majority leader \nto use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I understand correctly what the Senator \nfrom Michigan said a minute ago--did I hear him say the ``threat of \ndefense''? The ``threat of defense,'' did the Senator say that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. Our having defenses to the Soviets \nmeans that instead of getting rid of their offensive weapons, they will \nneed more. That is not what I am saying, though. That is what General \nShalikashvili and Secretary Perry are saying, far more important than \nwhat this Senator was saying.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator, but I just want the American people to \nthink about that terminology. The threat of defense. Maybe that should \nbe the description of what the Levin amendment is all about. Defense--\nwho does it scare in America? Our defense scares the Russians? The MAD \nera is over, thank God. Let us admit it. Let us let it go. Times have \nchanged. The threat of defense, to me, is not a scary idea.\n  We are not saying, do it now. We are saying, let us move forward with \ndevelopment, let us have some plans, let us begin some specificity, let \nus have enough money to really do the job. Let us not have enough money \nto waste. Let us have enough money to do the job. Let us have enough \nmoney to deploy. \n\n[[Page S 11281]]\n\n  Yes, we should be reasonable. We should think it through. But does \nany Senator here, or any American, think that the Senator from Maine is \ngoing to support language that is going to be dangerous and \nirresponsible? That is ridiculous. The Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, who has worked on this for years and years and years and was \none of the coauthors, with the Senator from Georgia, of the missile \ndefense language of 1991, these are not irresponsible people.\n  Can we continue to work together to try to move into this new era to \nmove beyond ABM? Yes. Let us do it rationally and reasonably. But let \nus do it. What is this absolute infatuation, this clinging to ABM? It \nis time to move on.\n  We have a letter from Dr. Kissinger that has been referred to. But I \nknow a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle have a lot of respect \nfor Dr. Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger's letter is very telling. I am going \nto read every word of it because it really sums up where we are today. \nIt is addressed to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond. It is dated August 3. He also testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee very clearly and very succinctly \nabout what we should do and how we should move into the present and \nforget the past. This language is about the future, how do we get there \nand plan to get there. By clinging to ABM, are we trying to, as a \nmatter of fact, stop a movement toward defense and start the movement \ntoward the next generation? I fear that is what is involved.\n  Here is what Henry Kissinger had to say:\n                                                   August 3, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: I am writing to congratulate you on \n     your recent markup of the Defense Authorization Bill, \n     especially the provisions in the bill dealing with ballistic \n     missile defense and the ABM Treaty. With the bill soon to be \n     debated on the Senate floor, I wanted to present my views on \n     a number of related issues.\n       The time has clearly come for the United States to consider \n     either amending the ABM Treaty or finding some other basis \n     for regulating U.S.-Russian strategic relations. The ABM \n     Treaty was born of a different era, characterized by a \n     different set of strategic and political circumstances. As I \n     said in my testimony before your committee earlier this year, \n     when things have changed so much, we must not fear changes in \n     our Cold War treaty arrangements if such changes are in our \n     best interest.\n       I commend the Committee's decision to set a course for \n     deployment of a National Missile Defense system to protect \n     all Americans. Development of such a system is long overdue. \n     I believe that such a deployment will actually enhance \n     deterrence and provide the basis for deeper offensive \n     reductions. Our experience with the ABM Treaty has shown that \n     a lack of defense neither promotes offensive reductions nor \n     otherwise enhances stability. More important, the ABM Treaty \n     is unable to help the United States deal with one of the most \n     significant post-Cold War security threats: the proliferation \n     of long-range ballistic missiles. In fact the ABM Treaty now \n     stands in the way of our ability to respond in an effective \n     manner.\n       I am also pleased to see that the Committee has passed the \n     legislation introduced by Senator Warner, which establishes a \n     clear demarcation between permitted Theater Missile Defense \n     systems, and strategic defenses limited by the ABM Treaty. It \n     is essential that the ABM Treaty not be extended to cover \n     systems that were never intended to be limited, such as \n     Theater Missile Defense systems. Such systems are too \n     important to be held hostage to arbitrary and unnecessary \n     negotiations. I find it hard to believe that the Clinton \n     Administration objects to having its own demarcation standard \n     codified into law. Such a move seems entirely appropriate and \n     consistent with U.S. obligations under the ABM Treaty.\n       I believe that the Missile Defense Act of 1995 is an \n     important step in the right direction. It is a measured and \n     well-focused response to a dramatic threat to United States \n     national interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Henry A. Kissinger.\n\n  eThis is a name, this is a voice, although sometime not \nunderstandable, one that we all recognize, that has influenced so much \nof what has happened in this area over the past 30 years, I guess. Yet, \nhe takes such a strong stand. Why are we so afraid of this?\n  So I think that we should defeat the Levin amendment. I know there \nare negotiations between the Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen, and \nSenator Nunn, and perhaps some others for some improvements. I am \nalways willing to look at that. I think we can do that. But first we \nmust defeat the Levin amendment. We must move into the era of reality.\n  The argument has been made that the Missile Defense Act of 1995 will \nundermine START II ratification, and perhaps even damage broader United \nStates-Russian relations. This argument is fundamentally rooted in a \ncold war view of the world. It assumes an adversarial, bipolar \nrelationship between the United States and Russia. Essentially, it \nprojects the United States-Soviet rivalry into the present day by \nsuggesting that missile defenses, even limited defenses, are \ndestablizing.\n  I do not believe that. Times have changed. Yes, there is some \nopposition to this, and there are those in the Soviet Union that will \nargue that the START II Treaty may be in trouble. But if it is, there \nis plenty of evidence that it is for other reasons: money. We have \nquotes from the Russians saying they just do not have the money to \nimplement it or for them to be able to tie START II and ABM. We cannot \nallow that.\n  They have even tried to link other things to ratification of START II \nsuch as expansion of NATO, which they oppose. It is clear that Russia \nis willing to play the START II card on a number of issues. We must \nreject this linkage lest we encourage Russia to believe that they \npossess a veto over U.S. foreign and national security policy.\n  Of course, we should cooperate with Russia and not disregard their \nlegitimate security concerns. But this is what START II ratification is \nall about. This agreement is manifestly in both countries interest and \nshould not be held hostage to other issues.\n  Before we conclude that a U.S. national missile defense program will \nundermine START II, we should examine what impact such a system would \nactually have. In reality, the NMD system envisioned by the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995 would in no way undermine Russian confidence in the \neffectiveness of their strategic deterrent. Even a multiple-site \ndeployment will not significantly alter Russia's ability to threaten \nthe United States.\n  Given this, I believe there is no basic rationality to these \nconnections. Even President Yeltsin himself recommended a global \ndefense system shortly after he assumed office. During the Bush \nadministration, there was tentative agreement between the \nUnited States and Russia on amending the ABM Treaty to allow \nfor up to five sites and unlimited deployments of sensors, including \nspace-based sensors. Since then, many Russian officials have \nreconfirmed that a limited NMD deployment would not in any way \nundermine their deterrent posture.\n  We must also recall that the ABM Treaty has already been amended \nonce, and that the original treaty did allow for the deployment of more \nthan one site. In fact, I think multiple sites was in the original \ntreaty. During the negotiations that led up to the signing of that \ntreaty in 1972, the Russians were even willing to agree to as many as 5 \nsites with 100 ABM interceptors each.\n  So there is a long history here of an understanding really of what \nABM means and the recognition that we need or may need and should move \ntoward multiple sites.\n  But let me begin to conclude with these two points. Why is this \nlegislation needed? The proliferation of ballistic missiles of all \nranges, along with weapons of mass destruction, poses an ever-\nincreasing threat to the United States and its interests. I think there \nis a lot of evidence that shows that, even from administration \nofficials. We must get started now if the United States is to counter \nthese threats in time. Ten years? Is that a rush? There is an orderly \nplan here.\n  The administration has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to \nextend the ABM Treaty to theater missile defense systems which have not \nand have never been covered, as I understand it, by treaty.\n  What the legislation does not do is it does not signal a return to \nstar wars. It advocates a modest and affordable program that is \ntechnically low risk. It does not violate, as I understand it, or \nadvocate violation of the ABM Treaty. The means to implement the \npolicies and the goals outlined in the Missile Defense Act of 1995 are \ncontained in the ABM Treaty itself.\n  So I urge that we take this step. Is it a step? Yes. Is it different \nfrom last year or 2 years or 3 years ago? Absolutely. Times are \ndifferent. In order to \n\n[[Page S 11282]]\nmake that step, though, we must first defeat the Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and twenty seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just last May our President and the Russian \nPresident issued a joint statement following a summit. One of those \nstatements was that the United States and Russia are each committed to \nthe ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability.\n  That is how important the ABM Treaty is to the Russians.\n  Should they be afraid of our defenses? Should they be threatened by \nour defenses? Gosh, we do not think so because we are good guys.\n  The truth of the matter is they are. What is the proof of that? \nGeneral Shalikashvili's statement and Secretary Perry's statement, \nwhich says flatout that if we act in this way to undermine the ABM \nTreaty, we jeopardize the reduction in START I and START II. So we are \nnot afraid of defenses. We should be afraid of 8,000 Russian warheads \nwhich probably now will not be dismantled if we jeopardize a treaty \nwhich has provided some strategic stability. That is the threat to us, \nthe 8,000 warheads which are currently being dismantled, reduced under \nSTART I and II, which now will probably not be dismantled according to \ntwo pretty important folks, Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili. \nThat is current evidence of what the stakes are here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina controls 1 minute 26 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nyielded all time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, he has.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to proceed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we are willing to yield back any time \nremaining if they are and we will proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2089\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on missile defense of the \n                             United States)\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], for himself and Mr. \n     Nunn, proposes an amendment numbered 2089.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles of all ranges is a global problem that is \n     becoming increasingly threatening to the United States, its \n     troops and citizens abroad, and its allies.\n       (2) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this Treaty''.\n       (3) Articles XIII and XIV of the ABM Treaty establish means \n     for the Parties to amend the Treaty, and the Parties have \n     employed these means to amend the Treaty.\n       (4) Article XV of the ABM Treaty establishes means for a \n     Party to withdraw from the Treaty, upon 6 months notice, ``if \n     it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject \n     matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Given the fundamental \n     responsibility of the Government of the United States to \n     protect the security of the United States, the increasingly \n     serious threat posed to the United States, the increasingly \n     serious threat posed to the United States by the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic \n     missile technology,and the effect this threat could have in \n     constraining the options of the United States to act in time \n     of crisis, it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the supreme interest of the United States to \n     defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile \n     attack, whatever its source;\n       (2) the deployment of a multiple site ground-based national \n     missile defense system to protect against limited ballistic \n     missile attack can strengthen strategic stability and \n     deterrence;\n       (3) the policies, programs, and requirements of subtitle C \n     of title II of this Act can be accomplished through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty;\n       (4) the President is urged to initiate negotiations with \n     the Russian Federation to amend the ABM Treaty as necessary \n     to provide for the national missile defense systems specified \n     in section 335 to protect the United States from limited \n     ballistic missile attack; and\n       (5) if these negotiations fail, the President is urged to \n     consult with the Senate about the option of withdrawing the \n     United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor. The \nSenate will come to order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the minority leader \nin just a moment. I just want to indicate that during the course of the \ndebate on the Levin amendment, I indicated that I would be sending an \namendment to the desk for consideration that would, I think, clarify \nthe intent of the Armed Services Committee, as far as the ABM Treaty is \nconcerned.\n  My understanding is that the minority leader wishes to proceed at \nthis point and introduce another measure dealing with welfare. I am \nprepared to yield to him if that is his desire, or we can continue to \ndebate the amendment that I have now offered. But I am prepared to \nyield the floor for as much time as the minority leader needs, and then \nI will come back to my amendment following his statement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Maine for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I seek the floor using my leader time to make a \nstatement unrelated to the bill. If I can do that and then return to \nthe bill just as soon as we complete the statements, I prefer to do \nthat. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S 11283]]\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Senator Nunn is a principal cosponsor of the amendment I \njust sent to the desk.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will we be able to get a time agreement on \nthis amendment? Is it going to be accepted? We just spent 7 hours on \nthe last amendment. If this bill is not finished by tomorrow night, I \nthink it is gone. I hope we can get a time agreement, if it is \nnecessary to have it.\n  Mr. COHEN. If the leader will yield, I think we can have a fairly \nshort time agreement. I think Senator Nunn and I are working through \nreally modifying this amendment to make sure we have broad bipartisan \nsupport for it. It should not take very long. If the leader wants to \npropose a time agreement----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the leader withhold offering a time agreement until \nwe can see the amendment?\n  Mr. NUNN. I will say to the majority leader, if he will yield, I \nwould like to have a time agreement on this amendment no longer than an \nhour equally divided. I believe we would be better to put that \nunanimous-consent request after the minority leader makes his \nstatement.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the majority leader will yield, I wonder if it is \npossible to sequence the amendments so the Members will have some idea \nas to the sequence. I am not pleading for mercy, but I have to go to a \nfuneral in my State this weekend, with absolutely no reservation. I \nhave to leave here tomorrow night. I have a couple of amendments, and I \nwould like to offer them before I leave. I think it would be \nexpeditious for the Senate if we can get some lined up and some \nsequence and time agreements, maybe 30 minutes or an hour. I think we \ngot the tough ones out of the way. The rest should not take that much \ntime.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think that is an excellent idea. Senator Daschle and I \nmay be starting to put it together, to rotate back and forth on the \nsequence of amendments. I think the Senator from Arizona wants to do \nthe same thing. Maybe we can do the Senator's this evening if he has to \nbe gone tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to say that we have spent a \nlong time now just on a few amendments. I hope we can get reasonable \ntime agreements and finish up this bill. I am saying that we can finish \nthis bill in a reasonable time tomorrow, if we stay here tonight and \nwork a reasonable time and do not take too much time on any one \namendment. Most of the people know how they are going to vote; it is \njust a matter of voting. I hope we are all together.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, given that, I will use my leader time, \nand Senator Dole and I will have an opportunity to go off the floor and \ntalk.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Maryland, and following that, the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, for remarks regarding the Work \nFirst welfare reform plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski and Mr. Breaux pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1117 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment 2089 offered \nby the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] and the Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nNunn].\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that language is still being \nworked out by Senator Cohen and Senator Nunn, and I believe that \nlanguage will be resolved very quickly and with a commensurate time \nagreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2089, \noffered by the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside in order to allow Senator McCain to proceed with \nhis amendment, and that there be a time limitation of 2 hours equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They are not ready for the time agreement.\n  Mr. COHEN. I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending \namendment to allow Senator McCain to proceed with offering his \namendment dealing with Seawolf. And, during the course of that time for \ndebate, if we, Senator Nunn and I, come to the floor with our \namendment, we then go off the McCain amendment and return to the Cohen-\nNunn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I may repeat, my understanding of the \nparliamentary situation is that we temporarily set aside the Cohen \namendment while negotiations continue on that amendment in order to \ntake up the Seawolf amendment. It is also my understanding that a time \nagreement on the Seawolf is being negotiated. On the McCain amendment, \nthere are negotiations going on, and I ask that the clerk keep time so \nthat it will apply once the unanimous-consent agreement is reached for \nthe purposes of moving forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct with respect to the \nparliamentary situation. The clerk will keep time on the McCain \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2090\n\n    (Purpose: To delete funding for procurement of a third Seawolf \n submarine, and to prohibit expenditures of fiscal year 1996 funds and \n       prior fiscal year funds for procurement of such submarine)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), for himself and Mr. \n     Roth, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2090.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, after the matter following line 24, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 125. SSN-23 SEAWOLF CLASS ATTACK SUBMARINE.\n\n       (a) Deletion of Funding.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the total amount of the funds \n     authorized under section 102(a)(3) for the Navy for fiscal \n     year 1996 for shipbuilding and conversion is reduced by \n     $1,507,477,000.\n       (b) Prohibition.--(1) Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this Act, funds available for the Department of Defense \n     for fiscal year 1996 and, except as provided in paragraph \n     (2)(B), funds available for the Department of Defense for any \n     preceding fiscal year may not be obligated or expended for \n     procurement of a third SSN-21 Seawolf class attack submarine \n     or for advance procurement for such submarine.\n       (2)(A) Funds available for the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 1996 may not be used for paying costs incurred \n     for termination of any contract for procurement of a third \n     SSN-21 Seawolf class attack submarine, including any contract \n     for advance procurement of such submarine.\n       (B) Only the funds available for the Department of Defense \n     for fiscal years before fiscal year 1996 for procurement of \n     an SSN-23 Seawolf attack submarine may, to the extent \n     provided in appropriations Act, be used for paying costs \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues who I \nknow are interested in this amendment, especially my friends from \nConnecticut, the pending unanimous-concept agreement is 1 hour equally \ndivided on each side, which would mean that, unless the Cohen amendment \nintervenes, there would be a vote approximately 2 hours from now since \nI anticipate that there would be a time agreement agreed to very \nshortly, which I would like to propound as soon as it is agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to terminate the \nSeawolf submarine program and delete $1.6 billion included in the \nfiscal year 1996 national defense authorization bill for attack \nsubmarine programs.\n  Mr. President, before I get into details, I want to talk about why it \nis \n\n[[Page S 11284]]\nthat I oppose the Seawolf submarine. Mr. President, if this were the \ncold war, I would be standing here as a staunch advocate of the Seawolf \nsubmarine. It is a technological marvel. It is a state-of-the-art \nweapons system, and it is perhaps one of the finest weapons of war that \nhas been produced by the enormously capable industrial base of this \ncountry.\n  But, Mr. President, I oppose the Seawolf submarine simply on the \ngrounds that we are experiencing a justified decline in the defense \nbudget. We are having to make very, very difficult decisions. This year \nwe are authorizing the appropriations of funds for a very small number \nof ships, submarines, airplanes and tanks. And we simply cannot afford \na submarine that costs almost $5 billion per submarine for the first \ntwo, and around $4 billion per submarine for the third.\n  Mr. President, you are going to hear the argument propounded on the \nfloor that the Russians are ahead of the United States, that they are \ndevoting every waking hour to developing a fast, quiet submarine, and \nthat, unless we build the Seawolf submarine, the Russians will pass us \nand pose some grave threat to our national security.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that the Russian Defense Minister, General \nGrachev, is having a meeting with his top military advisers, and he is \nsaying to them: ``Guys, we have a little problem in Chechnya. We have \ntaken a few thousand casualties. We have spent a few billion rubles. \nAlthough there is a tenuous cease-fire, it is by no means clear that we \nare going to be through in Chechnya for many years. We have a few \nbattalions down there in Georgia to take care of that situation. We \nhave Russian troops everywhere around what we now call the `near \nabroad' that used to be the Soviet Union practically, and certainly to \nthe south and to the west. We have our military officers who have come \nback from Eastern Europe living in boxcars with their families because \nwe cannot afford to build houses for them, some of them living in \ntents. Recent conscriptions show that less than half of those \nconscripted are even showing up, much less being actually inducted into \nthe military. Our fleets at Sevastopol and Vladivostok are rusting at \nthe pier. Recent Western visitors have attested to that. We cannot even \nafford the oil required to allow them to go out on exercises. But \nforget all of that, guys. Our primary concern is fast, quiet \nsubmarines.''\n  Mr. President, give me a break. Fast, quiet submarines are not the \npriority of the Russian military today. And I might say that up in room \n407, the secret room to which only a privileged few are allowed, is the \nCIA document that I would urge my colleagues to read that I have not \nread--that I have not read--but I know the content of, that raises into \nserious question the assumptions that the Russian priority is fast, \nquiet submarines. In fact, you do not have to go to room 407 to figure \nthat out. All you have to do is read the newspaper to discover that the \nSoviet Union has enormous challenges as far as where they spend their \ndefense dollars which are, as we all know, dramatically declining.\n  So for us to base our continued support on the Seawolf submarine on a \nperceived threat to our national security, frankly flies in the face of \nthe facts at hand.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is straightforward. It prohibits \nexpenditure of any defense funds for a third Seawolf submarine. It \neliminates the noncompetitive language in the Senate bill. Section 121 \ndirects the allocation of the first new submarine contract to the \nElectric Boat shipyard and the second contract to the Newport News \nshipyard. In short, the amendment seeks to terminate the Seawolf \nprogram without making a judgment on a follow-on attack submarine \nprogram.\n  In total, the amendment would delete $1.6 billion from the \ncommittee's recommendation for shipbuilding. The fact is that, like the \nB-2 bomber and many other cold war weapons systems, the Seawolf \nsubmarine has little or no place in the military force of the future. \nIt is a costly relic of the longstanding tensions between the United \nStates and the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the reasoning which \nled the committee to reject additional funding for the B-2 bomber \nprogram did not extend to the committee's action on attack submarine \nprograms. The committee chose to authorize funding for a third Seawolf \nsubmarine and to delay cost-saving competition for the follow-on new \nattack submarine until sometime in the next century.\n  Mr. President, it is noted--it should be noted with interest--that we \nentered into the deliberations of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nbent on competition as to where the next submarine would be built. That \nwas between the two remaining and major shipbuilding corporations, and \nnow we came out with no competition until sometime in the next century \ndesignating one submarine for one shipyard and designating one for \nanother, and just to make sure there was proper support, of course, we \nthrew in an amphibious ship.\n  After all, the Seawolf program has already cost nearly $11 billion, \nor more than $5 billion per submarine. Since the contracts for the \nfirst two Seawolf submarines were originally signed, their procurement \ncosts have increased by $1.4 billion. The third Seawolf submarine is \nestimated to cost more than $2.4 billion, slightly more than last \nyear's estimate.\n  Because of these increasing costs, the Congress included in last \nyear's defense authorization legislation a cost cap procurement of the \nfirst two Seawolf submarines. As a result of the legislative cost cap, \nthe Navy instituted a new program management team, which has been \nsuccessful so far in containing the costs of these two submarines. \nHopefully, no further taxpayer dollars will be required to finish them.\n  However, the cost cap would not apply to a third submarine, if one is \nauthorized, which could therefore cost much more than the $2.4 billion \ncurrently estimated by the Navy.\n  As we know, in the past 10 years, defense budgets have declined. \nSince 1985, it has declined in real terms by 35 percent, and we will \nprobably experience another 10-percent reduction by the turn of the \ncentury.\n  These significant reductions have meant that the Pentagon has \ncanceled or delayed nearly all of its force modernization programs for \nthe future. And it has meant that marines deployed on the U.S.S. Inchon \noff the coast of Somalia returned home to spend time with their \nfamilies and friends for 10 days before being sent off to the coast of \nHaiti.\n  Even with the increased resources, the committee was unable to begin \nto redress all of the recognized deficiencies in current and future \nforce structure. At the same time, the committee approved funding for \nthe third Seawolf submarine, $1.5 billion, that I would rather see \nallocated to programs with a mission in the likely potential conflicts \nof the future.\n  Those who continue to support the program argue that procuring a \nthird submarine is necessary to counter an enduring submarine threat. I \ndo not find that argument to be persuasive.\n  As we all know, the Navy earlier this year published and widely \ndistributed a very slick booklet advertising proliferation of \nconventional submarines in Third World countries and emphasizing the \ngrowing number and technological sophistication of Russia's attack \nsubmarine force. Their conclusion? Buy the Seawolf submarine to meet \nthis growing threat.\n  Mr. President, I already discussed earlier the problems that the \nRussians face and the disarray of their economy, the disarray of their \nsociety, the problems in Chechnya, et cetera.\n  At a hearing this year before the Seapower Subcommittee, the General \nAccounting Office witness testified that the intelligence analysis upon \nwhich the Navy based its claim of a growing Russian submarine threat \nwas incomplete and in some cases disputed within the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  At the same hearing, the Congressional Research Service witness \ntestified that a third Seawolf submarine is not necessary to fulfill \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff requirement for 10 to 12 stealthy attack \nsubmarines by the year 2012.\n  Thus, military requirements do not support authorization of an \nadditional submarine. The Armed Services Committee report flatly states \nthat the Navy's argument of an operational requirement for the SSN-23 \nwas not compelling as a reason to build another Seawolf submarine.\n  Another argument on behalf of the Seawolf program is the requirement \nto \n\n[[Page S 11285]]\nmaintain a two-shipyard submarine industrial base.\n  I am fully aware of the portion of the submarine industrial base that \nis in my State of Arizona, thanks to the efficiency of General Dynamics \nand Electric Boat. There are $62 million worth of contracts in the \nState of Arizona. I suspect that most Members of Congress have been \nadvised in detail about the financial advantages to their constituents \nof continued nuclear submarine production at Electric Boat shipyard.\n  Mr. President, if we continue to base our support for weapons systems \non whether there are defense contracts in our State or congressional \ndistricts, we will be doing an enormous disservice to the American \ntaxpayer. We no longer have that luxury, if we ever did.\n  I believe the committee's authorization of $1.5 billion to complete \nthe third Seawolf submarine amounts to a capitulation to the \nadministration's submarine industrial base arguments. It is clear from \nthe committee's explanation of its recommendations to authorize the \nthird Seawolf submarine that cost considerations took second place to \nindustrial base arguments. No other reasoning could explain the \ncommittee's action.\n  The Navy's stated policy is to maintain the two nuclear-capable \nshipyards currently in operation in the United States, Newport News in \nVirginia and Electric Boat in Connecticut. Under this policy, Newport \nNews would build only carriers, although it is capable of building \nsubmarines, and Electric Boat would build only submarines. It is not \ncapable of building carriers.\n  However, separate analyses by the Navy and by Newport News \nShipbuilding Co. demonstrate that maintaining one nuclear-capable \nshipyard is cheaper than maintaining two yards. I am not sure how deep \nan analysis that might have required. For the period of fiscal year \n1996 to 2012, the Navy estimates savings of $1.9 billion while Newport \nNews estimates a savings of $5.8 billion if we had one shipyard instead \nof two.\n  Yet, the committee chose to endorse at least through the end of this \ncentury that part of the administration's industrial base policy which \nrequires maintaining two nuclear-capable shipyards.\n  The committee explicitly directed that the first new attack submarine \nbe built at Electric Boat, but in a departure from the administration's \npolicy then directed that the second would be built at Newport News. \nWhat a surprise.\n  The committee appeared to support the concept of competition for the \nsubmarine's procurement but then chose to delay implementing cost-\nsaving competition between the two shipyards until sometime in the next \ncentury--I might add, having the beneficial effect of pleasing everyone \ninvolved.\n  Under the committee's recommendation, however, future competition for \nthe third and later submarines will not necessarily result in a winner-\ntake-all contract award which could mean that both shipyards would stay \nin business indefinitely.\n  Essentially, the committee kicked the can down the road, granting one \nsubmarine contract to each shipyard without addressing future \ncompetition. The result is that the taxpayers will see no savings from \ncompetition until sometime in the next century, if at all.\n  Because of this arbitrary delay in imposing competition for submarine \nprocurement, the committee found it necessary to accept the Navy's \ncontention that building the third Seawolf submarine at Electric Boat \nwas required to maintain Electric Boat shipyard as a viable competitor \nin the future. Thus, the committee authorized $1.5 billion for the SSN-\n23, an overly expensive submarine for which the threat will not \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.\n  A more than adequate alternative to procuring a third Seawolf \nsubmarine and beginning the new attack submarine program in fiscal year \n1998 as planned is extending the service life of the existing attack \nsubmarine force.\n  Currently, as of May 1, 1995, the U.S. attack submarine force \nconsists of 83 SSN's. The Bottom-Up Review stated a long-term \nrequirement for a force of only 45 to 55 attack submarines. In order to \nreduce the current force to the required levels, the Navy plans to \nretire rather than refuel a substantial portion of the SSN-688 class \nsubmarines. The Navy plan would mean scrapping submarines with an \naverage of 18 years of service life remaining.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that those ships were built with an \naverage service life of 30 years.\n  The cost of buying replacement submarines far exceeds the cost of \nrefueling existing submarines as well as the estimated savings from \ndecommissioning existing submarines.\n  For example, $1.5 to $2 billion is the estimated cost of a new attack \nsubmarine while the estimated savings from early decommissioning is \nonly $600 to $700 million. Clearly, if the newest of the Navy's SSN-688 \nclass submarines were retained in inventory throughout the remaining \nservice life, the Bottom-Up Review requirement for 45 to 55 attack \nsubmarines could be met well into the next century at a cost much less \nthan the cost of buying the SSN-23 and buying new attack submarines on \nan noncompetitive basis.\n  Terminating the Seawolf program and deferring a decision on a follow-\non attack submarine program would provide needed time to reassess the \nneed for and the design of a follow-on program. Such a decision, \nhowever, requires that we clearly face the stark reality of declining \ndefense budgets and the future budgets which require tough decisions \nabout sustaining duplicative infrastructure at a cost of billions of \ndollars.\n  The fact is that there are currently two nuclear-capable shipyards in \nthe United States, Electric Boat and Newport News. How much of our \nscarce defense dollars are we willing to spend to maintain two \nshipyards capable of producing nuclear-powered submarines at $4 to $5 \nbillion a copy? The price is very steep.\n  Mr. President, I yield at this time to the distinguished chairman, \nwho I think is ready to propound a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a total of 2 hours of debate prior to a motion to table on an \namendment to be offered by Senators McCain, Roth, Feingold, and Grams \nregarding the Seawolf submarine, with the time equally divided between \nSenators McCain and Cohen; I further ask that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to a vote on a motion to table, and that \nupon expiration or yielding back of time the Senate proceed to a vote \non or in relation to the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. President, could we also indicate that the time that has been \nconsumed to this point also be included in that 2-hour period?\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct, Mr. President, the statement made by \nthe able Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the \nfirst McCain amendment, Senator McCain be recognized to offer an \namendment regarding Seawolf cost cap and immediately after the clerk \nreports that amendment Senator Dodd be recognized to offer a relevant \nsecond-degree amendment and that there be a total of 10 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form on both amendments. I further \nask unanimous consent that upon the expiration or yielding back of the \ntime on the second amendment, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in \nrelation to the Dodd amendment, followed immediately by a vote on or in \nrelation to the McCain amendment, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-two minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President in their ongoing efforts to convince the \nCongress to spend another $1.5 billion on a militarily unnecessary \nprogram Seawolf proponents argue that so much \n\n[[Page S 11286]]\nmoney has already been spent on the third Seawolf that it would be \nfoolish to terminate the program now. They argue that terminating the \nthird submarine would save only $315 to $615 million.\n  Mr. President, never once in the 12 years that I have been in \nCongress have the proponents of a program that was up for cancellation \nnot argue that it was more expensive to cancel a program that it was to \nkeep it alive. I guess going back to that old Vietnam philosophy we had \nto destroy it in order to save it.\n  Mr. President, even if the savings are only $615 million, that is \nstill a lot of money to most Americans. However, I must point out that \na careful look at the facts shows that these claims are, at best, \nmisleading.\n  CBO estimates that savings from terminating the Seawolf submarine \ncould amount to between $1.1 and $1.3 billion. In a May 15, 1995 letter \nreport, CBO concluded that: ``Canceling the third Seawolf would save \nabout $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1996, minus $500 million in potential \nexpenses over the next 5 years.''\n  In an updated July 28 letter report, CBO refined their estimate of \nthe potential expenses to be in the range of $300 to $500 million.\n  CBO concluded that ``the net savings from canceling the SSN-23 could \namount to between $1.1 and $1.3 billion * * * . ''\n  Now, I am sure those that run the shipyards would strongly contest \nthose figures. I would rather rely on the Congressional Budget Office, \nan organization that clearly has much less at stake than the respective \nshipyards.\n  Obviously, in claiming that terminating the third Seawolf would \nresult in little or no savings, the submarine's supporters use inflated \nfigures. Let me explain some of the fallacies of their statements.\n  A document being circulated on Capitol Hill asserts that termination \ncosts allegedly using a Navy estimate are $500 million to $800 million. \nThe facts do not support this assertion.\n  In a June 8 response to my questions about the Seawolf program, the \nNavy stated: ``If work were to be stopped today on SSN 23 the total \nadditional liability beyond the $438 million expended would be $215 to \n$290 million.'' That is $285 to $510 million less than the contractor \nclaims. It is also a significant amount of termination liability for \nless than $900 million in existing contracts. And the Navy admits that \nthe amount of termination liability is entirely negotiable.\n  In addition, $484.6 million of prior year appropriations for the \nSeawolf submarine remained unexpended as of June 8, according to the \nNavy. Termination costs could be paid out of these unspent funds, \nsaving even more money for the taxpayers.\n  The Navy estimates the impact of terminating the Seawolf would have a \ncost impact on existing and future contracts at Electric Boat shipyard, \ntotaling $700 million to $1 billion. These estimates include some very \nquestionable assumptions.\n  CBO notes a significant area of difference in their estimates and the \nNavy's, since the Navy included $130 million to $340 million for \nanticipated increased overhead on future contracts at Electric Boat. \nCBO did not include these costs in their estimate because their amounts \nand even whether they will be incurred at all depend on future \ndecisions of the administration and the Congress.\n  Nor did CBO include the Navy's claims to other potential costs in the \nhundreds of millions of dollars for unspecified future claims. In their \nown estimates, the Navy has been unable to attach any estimated dollar \namount to these potential claims for such things as environmental \ncleanup, severance pay, and depreciation.\n  The total estimated cost of the third Seawolf submarine is $2.4 \nbillion, including more than $900 million already appropriated. The \nquestion we need to ask is, what are the sunk costs in that submarine \ntoday?\n  $438 million of prior year appropriations have already been spent and \ncannot be recovered.\n  Using the Navy's own estimates, an additional $420 to $650 million \nwould have to be spent to pay contract termination costs and increased \noverhead expenses on other existing contracts at Electric Boat.\n  Adding these two amounts together results in approximately $850 \nmillion to $1.1 billion in total funding required if the third Seawolf \nwere terminated today. That's $1.3 to $1.6 billion less than the \nestimated cost of the submarine. Or, in other words, that's $1.3 to \n$1.6 billion in savings for the American taxpayer.\n  In my view and in the view of our highest ranking military officers, \nthe priorities for U.S. defense spending are near-term readiness, \nquality of life for our military personnel and their families, and \nfuture force modernization to meet the likely challenges of the future. \nIn my discussions with these officers, they say emphatically that \nstrategic lift, tactical air forces, amphibious forces, and advanced \nconventional munitions procurement are the types of programs most \nurgently required to adequately equip our forces. The Seawolf submarine \nis not mentioned.\n  There is no question that the Seawolf submarine is a technological \nmarvel. Everyone associated with its development, design, and \nconstruction should be rightfully proud of this stellar example of \nAmerican skill and ingenuity. The Seawolf program must be reviewed in \nthe context of funding high-priority military requirements with a \nseriously inadequate defense budget.\n  The debate over the Seawolf program is not about the merits of a \nweapons system, rather, it is about priorities. All of us want to \nensure that our military forces have the best equipment and are the \nbest prepared to deal with the potential threats of the future. For all \nthe reasons discussed above, particularly the declining defense budget, \nwe simply cannot afford to buy another Seawolf submarine.\n  I cannot support spending another $1.5 billion on a militarily \nunnecessary jobs program. I cannot support procurement of a \nnoncompetitive follow-on submarine when our existing submarine force \nremains capable and can be maintained into the next century.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to strike \nfunding for the third Seawolf submarine.\n  Mr. President, I have several letters here. Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste says:\n\n       The Seawolf program is a Cold War relic designed to meet a \n     threat that no longer exists. Russia can not afford to \n     maintain its submarine fleet and at our current naval level, \n     the U.S. is well defended on the seas against any potential \n     threat of the future. Adding a third Seawolf adds little to \n     defense--\n\n  The only convincing argument: It is a great jobs program--\n\n       while taking much-needed resources from other necessary \n     defense programs. . .. We applaud you for introducing this \n     amendment and encourage your colleagues to support this \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, the National Taxpayers Union says:\n\n       If members of Congress are truly serious about balancing \n     the budget, they must refrain from setting costly precedents \n     by continuing to fund unnecessary and outdated programs. . .. \n     Today, our nation faces a far more destructive threat--a \n     national debt racing toward $5 trillion. Winning this war \n     requires a different kind of weapon--fiscal discipline.\n       Congress should consider scrapping the Seawolf entirely.\n\n  That is from the National Taxpayers Union.\n  And from the Citizens for a Sound Economy:\n\n       On behalf of Citizens for a Sound Economy and our 250,000 \n     members nationwide. . .. At a time when all Federal spending \n     is undergoing increased congressional scrutiny, the \n     Department of Defense like other federal agencies, must find \n     ways to get spending under control. . ..\n       Congress should not approve the Navy's request for $1.5 \n     billion to start building a third Seawolf submarine. That's \n     $1.5 billion that could be put to better use by taxpayers \n     themselves.\n\n  And, finally, Mr. President, from the Council for a Livable World.\n\n       . . .. we believe it to be unconscionable to spend $1.5 \n     billion for white elephants that would have no other mission \n     than to serve as floating museum pieces.\n\n  I am not sure I agree with that last comment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several documents related \nto this subject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 11287]]\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Council for Citizens Against \n     Government Waste (CCAGW) supports your amendment to the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization canceling the third \n     Seawolf submarine (SSN-23), saving taxpayers nearly $1.5 \n     billion over the next five years.\n       The Seawolf program is a Cold War relic designed to meet a \n     threat that no longer exists. Russia can not afford to \n     maintain its submarine fleet and at our current naval level, \n     the U.S. is well defended on the seas against any potential \n     threat of the future. Adding a third Seawolf adds little to \n     defense, while taking much-needed resources from other \n     necessary defense programs.\n       When the next phase in the submarine program, the New \n     Attack Submarine, begins construction in 1998, there will be \n     a shipyard fully prepared to begin construction, most likely \n     at a cheaper cost. Why add the unnecessary burden of building \n     an archaic third submarine as we are preparing to move into a \n     new phase of naval defense? Advocates of the third Seawold \n     muster only one convincing argument: It's a great jobs \n     program.\n       This Congress' mission must be to reevaluate how all \n     taxpayer money is spent. When looking at the changes the Navy \n     is making in its submarine defenses, we cannot continue to \n     fund outdated programs like Seawolf, leaving other programs \n     more vulnerable to the budget ax! We applaud you for \n     introducing this amendment and encourage your colleagues to \n     support this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Schatz,\n       President.\n     Joe Winkelmann,\n       Chief Lobbyist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1995.\n     Attn: Defense LA\n       Dear Senator: The 300,000-member National Taxpayers Union \n     is pleased to support Senator McCain's amendment to the FY 96 \n     Defense Authorization bill which would eliminate $1.5 billion \n     to procure a third Seawolf submarine.\n       Seawolf continues to be plagued by numerous problems: it is \n     behind schedule and has incurred cost overruns. Already, $1.4 \n     billion more has been spent over the original estimate, \n     costing taxpayers a total of nearly $11 billion, or more than \n     $5 billion per submarine. The third Seawolf estimate to cost \n     more than $2.4 billion, slightly more than last year's \n     estimate. A third submarine, however, would be exempt from \n     the cost cap that applied to the first two, which could \n     drastically increase its price tag. If members of Congress \n     are truly serious about balancing the budget, they must \n     refrain from setting costly precedents by continuing to fund \n     unnecessary and outdated programs.\n       In the very year when Congress has pledged to make progress \n     towards balancing the budget, some lawmakers would pull this \n     policy in the wrong direction. The Cold War has ended, and \n     with it the submarine threat that endangered the Seawolf \n     program. Today, our nation faces a far more destructive \n     threat--a national debt racing towards $5 trillion. Winning \n     this war requires a different kind of weapon--fiscal \n     discipline.\n       Congress should considers scrapping Seawolf entirely. At \n     the very least, however, members should reject any additional \n     subsidies for this relic of a bygone era. They can reaffirm \n     their commitment by voting YES on the McCain Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jill Lancelot,\n     Director, Congressional Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 1995.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of Citizens for a Sound \n     Economy and our 250,000 members nationwide, I would like to \n     extend support for your proposed deletion of $1.5 billion in \n     funding for the Navy's third Seawolf submarine. At a time \n     when all federal spending is undergoing increased \n     congressional scrutiny, the Department of Defense, like other \n     federal agencies, must find ways to get spending under \n     control.\n       The United States' Seawolf submarine program was a Cold War \n     undertaking to make the best submarine force in the world \n     even better. However, given the fall of the Soviet Union, and \n     the weakened Russian economy, a third Seawolf submarine (and \n     its $4 billion plus price tag) no longer can be justified. \n     Recognizing the need to prioritize tight defense dollars, \n     President Bush tried unsuccessfully in 1992 to stop the \n     Seawolf program after the completion of one submarine. In \n     today's fiscal climate, the case against a third submarine is \n     even more compelling.\n       Moreover, in terms of time and cost, the Seawolf program is \n     indicative of too many major defense programs--it has been \n     marked by schedule delays and cost overruns. In fact, by the \n     time Congress capped the spending level on the first Seawolf \n     submarines at $4.759 billion just last year, the program \n     already had cost $2 billion more than originally anticipated.\n       Congress should not approve the Navy's request for $1.5 \n     billion to start building a third Seawolf submarine. That's \n     $1.5 billion that could be put to better use by taxpayers \n     themselves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1995.\n\n               Support Amendment To Cancel Third Seawolf\n\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to support the amendment by \n     Senator McCain to prohibit funding for the third Seawolf \n     submarine.\n       The Congress is working hard to fulfill its commitment to \n     reduce government waste. The Seawolf submarine, conceived \n     over a decade ago to counter a specific Soviet threat, lacks \n     a mission and should be cut.\n       The program has been plagued by repeated cost increases and \n     scheduled delays. Last year Congress voted to cap the cost of \n     the first two submarines at $4.759 billion. However, \n     finishing the third Seawolf will require at least an \n     additional $1.5 billion and will push the current estimate \n     for the total program cost to over $12.9 billion, or $4.3 \n     billion each.\n       It is widely acknowledged that the case for building the \n     third Seawolf is founded entirely on ``industrial base'' \n     arguments. However, many of the skills associated with \n     submarine production would be maintained in other industries \n     and submarine-unique skills would be maintained through \n     ongoing submarine maintenance and repair activities.\n       It is our judgment that Congress should resist pressure to \n     continue this funding simply to preserve jobs. We understand \n     the concerns and fears of the people of Connecticut and Rhode \n     Island. We strongly support assisting the people and the \n     communities affected by the program termination in their \n     adjustment to a difficult situation. However, at the same \n     time, we believe it to be unconscionable to spend $1.5 \n     billion for white elephants that would have no other mission \n     than to serve as floating museum pieces. There are too many \n     other desperate needs in this society--to say nothing of a \n     federal budget deficit of $250 billion--to build this cold \n     war relic.\n       Funding a missionless Seawolf is a waste of national \n     resources. We urge you to support the McCain amendment to end \n     this program.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Matlack, American Friends Service Committee; Darryl \n           Fagin, Americans for Democratic Action; Timothy \n           McElwee, Church of the Brethren, Washington Office; \n           John Parachini, Committee for National Security; John \n           Isaacs, Council for a Livable World; Joe Volk, Friends \n           Committee on National Legislation; Maurice Paprin, Fund \n           for New Priorities in America; Kay van der Horst, \n           International Center for Technology Assessment; J. \n           Daryl Byler, Mennonite Central Committee, Washington \n           Office; Howard Hallman, Methodists United for Peace \n           with Justice; Christopher Paine, Natural Resources \n           Defense Council; Kathy Thornton, NETWORK: A National \n           Catholic Social Justice Lobby;\n         Monica Green, Peace Action; Bob Musil, Physicians for \n           Social Responsibility; Caleb Rossiter, Project on \n           Demilitarization and Democracy; Robin Caiola, 20/20 \n           Vision, National Project; Jennifer Weeks, Union of \n           Concerned Scientists; Robert Alpern, Unitarian \n           Universalist Association; George Crossman, United \n           Church of Christ, Office for Church in Society; Jerry \n           Genesio, Veterans for Peace; Edith Villastrigo, Women \n           Strike for Peace; Susan Shaer, Women's Action for New \n           Directions; Tim Barner, World Federalist Association.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 30, 1995]\n\n                 Quietness Argument for Sub Won't Wash\n\n       To the Editor: I have a lot of respect for Secretary of the \n     Navy John Dalton; I hate to see him fall prey to the sharks \n     who are trying to justify the spending of $1.5 billion for \n     the third Seawolf submarine (letter, July 24).\n       Although I disagree with almost everything in his letter, I \n     would like to focus on his assertion that ``the quietest \n     submarines in the world today are operated by the Russians.''\n       This allegation is like the ``missile gap'' or the ``bomber \n     gap'' or the ``readiness gap.'' When these were scrutinized, \n     it was found they did not exist. Their sole purpose was to \n     justify unwarranted defense spending. Does this ``quietness \n     gap'' exist?\n       There are two aspects to quieting a submarine. The first \n     takes place when the submarine is built. To say that our \n     submarines are not built as well as Russian submarines \n     condemns the very shipyard we are trying to keep operating.\n       The second aspect of quieting is in the operation of the \n     ship. Is Secretary Dalton telling us that the crews of our \n     submarines are not as well trained or as competent as the \n     Russians?\n       I never met a submarine officer who did not think our \n     submarines were the best in the world--by far. I am sorry to \n     see this proud group stoop to chicanery to justify an \n     unnecessary weapon.\n                                                 John J. Shanahan.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 11288]]\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Rhode \nIsland wish to have?\n  Mr. PELL. Five minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Fiscal Year 1992 Defense Authorization Act authorized a third \nSeawolf submarine, commonly referred to as SSN-23. In 1992, Public Law \n102-298 appropriated $540.2 million for advance procurement of critical \nlong-lead items for SSN-23. Subsequent to this action, roughly another \n$400 million has been appropriated and spent on SSN-23 thus far, for a \ntotal of $920 million.\n  This amendment, which would deauthorize funding required for the \ncompletion of SSN-23, is opposed by the administration, is inconsistent \nwith previous congressional action, and contradicts the findings of the \nBottum-Up Review, the elaborate defense posture plan prepared by the \nDepartment of Defense as the blueprint for future weapon acquisition. \nIn the Bottom-Up Review, the administration concluded that construction \nfor the third Seawolf is the best, most cost-effective way to preserve \nthe submarine industrial base. After much sober thought, numerous \nelaborate studies, and several thorough debates in this Chamber, the \nDepartment of Defense has concluded that completion of the third \nsubmarine would bridge the gap until we begin construction of the new \nattack submarine in fiscal year 1998.\n  Sustained, low-rate production is the most effective way to preserve \nthe technology, design, and unique skills necessary to maintain our \nsubmarine industrial base. If a production gap occurs, the Navy has \ndetermined, and many observers concur, that the highly specialized \nsubmarine vendor base, consisting of over 1,000 firms in more than 40 \nStates, will be jeopardized.\n  Mr. President, in addition to preserving unique skills and \ntechnology, completing the SSN-23 makes economic sense. In a recent \nletter to Chairman Thurmond, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, state:\n\n       Completing SSN-23 is right for the taxpayer and right for \n     our defense needs. The cost to complete SSN-23 is $1.5 \n     billion. If SSN-23 were canceled, between $700 million to $1 \n     billion in direct costs will still be incurred to existing \n     contracts and to the New Attack Submarine program without \n     acquiring a submarine. Thus, the net cost of building SSN-23 \n     at this point in the program is approximately $500 million to \n     $800 million.\n\n  Moreover, completing the SSN-23 also makes sense from a security \nviewpoint. In the same letter mentioned above, Secretary Perry and \nGeneral Shalikashvili state that ``cancellation would deprive our Armed \nForces of a needed military capability to counter the growing number of \ndeployed improved Akula class submarines which are quieter than our \nimproved 688 attack submarines.''\n  Mr. President, SSN-23 is a necessary bridge for the entire submarine \nindustry to be able to produce the more affordable and technologically \nadvanced new attack submarine. The DOD's plan, as approved by the Armed \nServices Committee, is the only plan which will preserve this critical \nindustrial base as well as permit long-term competition in the \nsubmarine industry. Furthermore, this plan will assist in our national \nstrategy to maintain our margin of undersea superiority, a truly \ncritical area.\n  The Senate has, on several occasions, thoroughly debated and voted on \nthis matter. And each year, the Senate decided to continue this program \nfor the reasons I stated above.\n  It would seem to me irrational and imprudent to cancel a program \nwhich would cost less to complete than to eliminate. It does not make \nsense from either a fiscal or national security viewpoint. The \nadministration and the DOD strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge \nmy colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I mentioned \nabove be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The submarine funding decisions now \n     before Congress are pivotal to maintaining our margin of \n     undersea superiority and capability to design and produce \n     nuclear submarines efficiently. The Department's plan \n     maintains both these national objectives by building a final \n     SEAWOLF in FY 1996 and a lead New Attack Submarine in FY \n     1998. This approach is the lowest cost plan to counter real \n     world threats while shifting to a more affordable and capable \n     submarine.\n       Completing SSN-23 is right for the taxpayer and right for \n     our defense needs. The cost to complete SSN-23 is $1.5 \n     billion. If SSN-23 is canceled, between $700 to $1,000 \n     million in direct costs will still be incurred to existing \n     contracts and to the New Attack Submarine program without \n     acquiring a submarine. Thus, the net cost of building SSN-23 \n     at this point in the program is approximately $500 to $800 \n     million. Cancellation would deprive our Armed Forces of a \n     needed military capability to counter the growing number of \n     deployed improved Akula class submarines which are quieter \n     than our improved 688 attack submarines.\n       The House National Security Committee in its bill supported \n     submarine modernization by endorsing the national commitment \n     to preserve two nuclear capable shipbuilders and by providing \n     full funding for the continued development and advance \n     procurement for a FY 1998 attack submarine. The Department \n     appreciates HNSC's support in this aspect.\n       On the other hand, we take exception to the proposed HNSC \n     alternative industrial bridge plan. This plan spends nearly \n     $1 billion to avoid building SSN-23 and to build a technology \n     demonstrator submarine in place of a needed operational New \n     Attack Submarine. The House plan poses execution problems in \n     that it is under-funded and creates significant future \n     financial liability. Moreover, it causes SSN-21 and SSN-22 to \n     be one-of-a-kind submarines which would drive up \n     construction, operating, and support costs.\n       We believe the Department's plan merits the full support of \n     Congress. It is the most straightforward and lowest cost \n     approach to sustaining attack submarine force level \n     requirements, while preserving two nuclear capable \n     shipbuilders to provide the option for competition.\n       We ask your support for this very important program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                                 William J. Perry,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nEdward Foster, a legis fellow in my office, be given the privilege of \nthe floor for the duration of the debate on S. 1026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it has been used on many occasions \nbefore, but in the famous words of Yogi Berra, ``It is deja vu all over \nagain,'' with regard to the Seawolf. I rise in opposition to the \namendment of my friend from Arizona which would terminate the SSN-23, \nthe third and final Seawolf nuclear attack submarine.\n  I am going to make three points in opposition to the amendment. The \nfirst is that in finishing the Seawolf submarine, we are not just \ninvolved in a make-work project. It will produce a submarine that will \nbe of military value immediately and, in fact, will be the best nuclear \nattack submarine in the world and will help us close what I will call a \nsubmarine gap that has opened up between Russia and the United States \nin favor of Russia.\n  Second, I will argue that the construction or the finishing of the \nthird Seawolf is part of a carefully designed plan by the Pentagon to \nlead us to the construction of the new attack submarine, a smaller \nversion of the Seawolf, smaller and less expensive.\n  Mr. President, no one seems to disagree with the contention that we \nneed to build more submarines for our national security in the future \nas the older attack submarines live out their lifespan. What we are \nseeing in opposition to this amendment is that the best way to get to \nthe next stage, which we all seem to agree on, is to complete the \nSeawolf submarine, the SSN-23, and to preserve the military-industrial \nbase that is necessary to get to the new attack submarine and to create \ncompetition in building that submarine. \n\n[[Page S 11289]]\n\n  And finally, just as a matter of business common sense, we have spent \nalmost a billion dollars on the third Seawolf already. It does not make \nsense not to complete it.\n  Mr. President, let me go to the first argument. We are not debating \nproduction of a weapon which has no use or which no one wants. On the \ncontrary. Everyone, and I stress everyone, involved in the national \nsecurity of our Government has spoken out loudly and clearly that they \nwant this submarine to be produced and that the Navy needs it for its \nmilitary value, not just because it enables us to produce the next \ngeneration of attack submarines at a lower price into the next century.\n  So let us not be confused as to what is fat and what is muscle in the \ndefense budget that we are debating today. The President asked Congress \nto authorize this submarine, it is part of his budget and part of the \nplan which the Department of the Navy has laid out for shipbuilding \ninto the next century.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, has \ntold us why we need this submarine. He has said:\n\n       Cancellation would deprive our Armed Forces of a needed \n     military capability to counter the growing number of deployed \n     improved Akula-class submarines--Russian subs--which are \n     quieter than our improved 688 attack submarine.\n\n  And the quietness of a submarine is critical to its effectiveness.\n  Mr. President, I will speak more about that in a moment.\n  The Secretary of Defense, continuing our national security \nadministration, has urged us to stay with the Navy plan and to \nauthorize the SSN-23. Secretary Perry has said:\n\n       We believe the Department's plan merits the full support of \n     Congress. It is the most straightforward and lowest-cost \n     approach to sustaining attack submarine force level \n     requirements.\n\n  Secretary of the Navy Dalton and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral \nBoorda have spent numerous hours testifying before congressional \ncommittees and meeting with individual Members of Congress to explain \nwhy they are convinced that the Seawolf is essential to our future \nsecurity.\n  Secretary Dalton has said:\n\n       The builders of this submarine * * * are a national \n     treasure in knowledge and skills * * *. We are gambling with \n     a national treasure if we do not take steps to preserve it.\n\n  And Admiral Boorda, the top warfighter in the Navy today, says:\n\n       The Seawolf class submarine will ensure continued undersea \n     superiority, a position the United States cannot give up.\n\n  Mr. President, I note also that as you listen to the best thinkers \nwhen they talk about the future of warfare and security citing \nparticularly the technological revolution that is occurring in warfare, \nthe submarine will play an increasingly central role because of its \nstealth, which is to say obviously that it is hard to detect at its \nbest.\n It is under water, and because of the enormous range of capacities it \nhas, not only to perform the traditional attack submarine function of \nhitting targets in the water or under the water, but being able to fire \ncruise missiles from standoff positions unseen at targets on the land, \nas was done in the gulf war, being able to perform intelligence \nmissions, being able to drop special forces into difficult situations, \nbeing able to move in shallow water and, in fact, being able to perform \nintelligence functions with very sophisticated technical equipment from \na standoff, safe position.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many times on military authorizations when \nthe Congress substitutes its judgment for that of the administration \nwhich is in power. I believe, however, that this is one time when we \nought to listen carefully to the military experts and give them, as we \nalways should, the benefit of the doubt.\n  The Armed Services Committee of this Senate spent many hours in \nhearings earlier this year seeking the views of those experts, and we \nall listened with care. And it is with some satisfaction that I note \nthe strong support which the completion of the third Seawolf, after \nhearing all that testimony, received from members of the committee. The \nSSN-23 is necessary and essential because it has military value and \nmeets valid military requirements.\n  Some have said that this submarine will serve no purpose, that there \nis no need or threat. I respectfully say that these allegations are \nwrong. We know that Russia, no matter what else has happened to its \nmilitary apparatus, has continued to produce nuclear attack submarines \nafter the end of the cold war. We know, as well, that these submarines \nare quieter than their predecessors--some because of better designs in \ntheir production and others because of backfitting of newer and \nquieting technologies. These submarines which Russia is putting to sea \ntoday are quieter than most of our existing fleet of attack submarines. \nFor the first time in the history of undersea warfare, the United \nStates does not have a qualitative edge over its potential adversaries \nin the stealth of the submarines which are taking our young sailors to \nsea to protect our national security. That is a fact, I would guess, \nthat most persons are not aware of, but it is one that each of us must \nbe unsettled by.\n  Mr. President, I know it is counterintuitive because the general \nimpression is that the Russian military is falling apart. But they have \nmade a conscious decision, no matter what else is happening in their \nmilitary, to invest in attack submarines. I think we should take a look \nat their reasoning and think about it as we plan our national security \nin the future.\n  Listen to the words of the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel \nGrachev, who said a couple of years ago, June 8, 1993:\n\n       A nuclear submarine fleet is the future of the armed \n     forces. The number of tanks and guns will be reduced, as well \n     as the infantry, but a modern navy is a totally different \n     thing.\n\n  The underlying reality today is that the Russian political and \nmilitary leadership has decided that they want to keep Russia a global \nmilitary power. To do so, they have scaled down much of their military \ncapacity and programming, but there are several key components critical \nto remaining a global military power, and at the top of that list--\nparticularly when it comes to strategic weapons but also the attack \nsubmarine function--is submarines.\n  Much is made of the fact that the Russian surface ships are seen \nsitting in piers rusting, with no crews, undertrained crews, or \nrebellious and dissatisfied crews. But nobody has made those assertions \nabout the Russian submarine forces because they are just not true. We \nknow that Russia has in the water today about six submarines with \nfourth generation quieting technology. These improved Akula-class subs \nwhich are in the water today are quieter at tactical operating speeds \nthat the best American submarines currently in our inventory cannot \nmatch.\n  Further, we know that the Russian Navy has under construction and \nwill launch in the next year or so the lead ship of a new class of \nsubmarines which will be even quieter than the Akula, better armed and \nwith improved sensors. The lead ship has\n been named the Severodvinsk, the first true multimission submarine in \nthe Russian inventory. These are all facts that are generally agreed \nupon by the entire U.S. intelligence community.\n\n  There is also no disagreement within the intelligence community that \nthe Russian Navy is returning to submarine operating patterns last seen \nin the mid-1990's. We are observing once again deployments of a \nsubmarine force capable of worldwide operations--and this includes \nrenewed operations in the Western Atlantic.\n  Thus, my view--and I believe the view of the senior military \nleadership in this country--is that there is a real threat which must \nbe addressed and this Seawolf addresses it quite well. In short, there \nis a valid military requirement for SSN-23.\n  The Joint Staff examined submarine force level requirements necessary \nto support the Bottom-Up Review and concluded that the U.S. Navy needs \n10 to 12 Seawolf-quiet submarines by the year 2012. Since the Russian \nNavy has 6 fourth-generation-quiet submarines in the water today which \nare quieter than our 688I submarines with more under construction, the \nUnited States military needs to establish a stable low rate of \nproduction of submarines with Seawolf-level quieting. The Navy view is \nthat completion of the SSN-23 is the \n\n[[Page S 11290]]\nmost critical and timely contribution to achieving this essential \nwarfighting capability.\n  The bottom line then in my view, after having questioned every \nwitness who came before the Army Services Committee on this subject \nthis year, is NOT that SSN-23 would be militarily helpful as one \nanalyst asserted, but that it is essential to meeting valid military \nrequirements.\n  Fourth, completing the third Seawolf is part of a plan which has been \ncarefully developed by the Navy to ensure that this country can regain \nthe tactical superiority it needs in undersea warfare and that we can \nmaintain a national treasure, to use Admiral Boorda's description--the \nsubmarine industrial base in its broadest sense, in its entirety--which \nwe will need in the future. And we should note, that future is not very \nfar off as I have already demonstrated.\n  Some critics try to argue that the Navy's plan--building SSN-23 and \nthen a new attack submarine which will be more affordable and more \nfocused on the threats of the 21st century--is not well thought-out or \nbased on analysis. These charges are flat wrong. In the past 3 years, \nthere have been some 14 different studies which have examined the \nsubmarine industrial base. The consensus of these studies has been that \nthe most cost-effective approach to sustaining our ability to design \nand build nuclear submarines is through low-rate production of \nsubmarines. One does not learn or create the skills necessary to build \nthese highly sophisticated ships and their many unique components in a \nshort period of time. If this industrial base is shut down, as we will \nrisk if SSN-23 is not authorized, the costs of regenerating these \nessential skills will be prhibitive--if in fact they can be \nregenerated.\n  Let me turn then to a point which is often made when considering this \nsubject and which does a disservice to this debate and to this body. \nSome people try to describe the third Seawolf as a jobs program--an \nattempt to keep people working in spite of the fact that there is no \nsense to the program\n anymore. Obviously, each of us in our own way wants to preserve jobs \nin our own State, and I, no less than any of our colleagues. But the \nfact is that even if this third Seawolf is built--as I believe it \nshould and will be--the level of employment at Electric Boat in \nConnecticut and Rhode Island will go from a high of some 23,000 5 years \nago to less than 14,000 by the end of this year and some 6,000 by the \nyear 2000. That means some 17,000 workers at Electric Boat have or are \ngoing to lose their jobs as part of the effort to maintain our ability \nto build submarines into the next century.\n\n  The managers at Electric Boat do not have any allusions that the cold \nwar still exists. They have been actively reengineering and downsizing \nfor a number of years to ensure that their company--a company with a \nlong and proud history of submarine construction, a company made up of \nskilled and dedicated workers who don't get rich doing the work they \ndo, but do take great pride in producing the world's finest submarines \nto protect our way of life--can continue to make submarines in the next \ncentury.\n  Those who might claim that the Seawolf is just a jobs program for two \nnortheastern States--or that the Navy plan is submarines for everyone--\nare wrong and their observations are a disservice to the broader issues \ninvolved here, and an offense to the people whose jobs are going to be \nlost, even with the building of the third Seawolf.\n  Mr. President, we have been here before on this issue. But, I believe \nthe issues I have raised today are more relevant and more important \nthan ever before. The cold war is over--no one who supports the Seawolf \nbelieves otherwise. But that does not mean that this incredible \nsubmarine--the first of which has already been christened and is in the \nwater at Groton today--is not militarily necessary and vital to our \nnational security.\n  This has not been a perfect program. What weapons system ever is? For \nthat matter, when was the last time an automobile was designed and \nproduced without some problems? But the program is on a sound footing \ntoday. It will produce a submarine which has been requested by the \nPresident and the Department of Defense and will meet a valid military \nrequirement. This issue has been studied at length by the Armed \nServices Committee under the leadership of Senator Thurmond and, in \nparticular, in the Seapower Subcommittee under the probing and \nthoughtful leadership of its chairman, Senator Cohen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Armed Services Committee position \non this issue and to vote to authorize and complete construction of the \nthird Seawolf. I will vote against the amendment by my colleague from \nArizona and urge all Senators to do the same.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, shortly, I believe there will be an \nagreement on the Nunn-Cohen amendment which was set aside for the \npurpose of this amendment, and we will return to it.\n  I would like to inform my colleagues that the distinguished chairman \nof the committee is ready to propound a unanimous-consent agreement of \nall remaining amendments. We have been on this bill since 9 o'clock \nyesterday morning. We intend to stay very late tonight, at least until \nwe have a complete list of amendments with time agreements associated \nwith them. Right now it is being hotlined to all the offices to get a \nlist of the amendments.\n  The chairman is going to propound a unanimous-consent agreement \nwithin a very short period of time. We have had sufficient time to \ndetermine what amendments we have to this bill, and the only way we are \ngoing to move forward and get done by tomorrow evening, which is the \nexpressed desire of the majority leader, is to get the amendments in \nand then we will begin to propound a unanimous consent on that and the \nensuing time agreements.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, despite the end of the cold war and \ncollapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, I think we can all \nagree that the United States still needs capable and effective military \nforces, and indeed that is why we are voting right now, very shortly, \non a $264 billion appropriation, or authorization, for the U.S. \nmilitary services. I do not think anybody in this body will argue that \nthe United States will always be a maritime nation. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, 95 percent of our export/import tonnage is carried by ship. \nThat is an astonishing figure to me. Yes, 5 percent is carried over \nland to Canada and Mexico, or by air; but 95 percent is carried by \nship.\n  During the time I spent in the Navy Department, I learned that \nsubmarines are a relatively inexpensive way for a potential adversary \nto disrupt international commerce.\n  Far too often, the press reports that the Navy does not really need \nthe Seawolf. We are told that it is a ship solely designed to confront \nthe Soviet Navy on the open ocean. This allegation is simply not true. \nI would like to refute it. The fact of the matter is that the third \nSeawolf has a valid military mission and will be instrumental in \nenabling the Navy to fulfill its national security obligations around \nthe world.\n  Now, yes, the Soviet Union is gone, and its military forces inherited \nby Russia are undergoing substantial downsizing. There is no question \nabout that. It is also very clear that the Russian Navy--in particular, \nits submarine force--has not been scaled back in the manner other \ncomponents of the Russian military service have been. For example, it \nis estimated that by the year 2000, which is only 5 years from now, \nRussia will have about 122 submarines in its fleet, more than half of \nwhich will be advanced third-generation vessels. Already today, Russia \nhas several operational submarines that are quieter than the quietest \nUnited States submarine at sea. Russia's latest submarine will be \noperational by the year 2000--the one under design now--and is expected \nto rival the capabilities of our best attack submarines.\n  To illustrate these advances, I would like to insert in the Record a \nFebruary 12 article from Defense News documenting recent Russian \nundersea efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 11291]]\n\n\n                [From the Defense News, Feb. 6-12, 1995]\n\n  Russia Pours Resources Into Submarine Improvement--Better Weapons, \n                  Sensors Will Pose Challenge to West\n\n                           (By Robert Holzer)\n\n       Washington.--Despite enormous economic difficulties, the \n     Russian government continues to invest in submarines and is \n     expected to field a more advanced sub force by 2000, \n     according to U.S. Navy intelligence estimates.\n       While the total number of submarines in the Russian Navy's \n     inventory will decline from today's level of 181 to 122 by \n     2000, the overall quality of that force will increase \n     markedly, with more than half the fleet composed of more \n     advanced third-generation submarines, according to the Navy's \n     analysis.\n       ``They are getting more out of their programs now in terms \n     of research and development,'' Norman Polmar, a Washington-\n     based submarine design consultant and an expert on the \n     Russian Navy, said Feb. 1. ``They are putting a lot of \n     resources into submarines.''\n       Moreover, the Russians have started developing a new \n     submarine class, called the Severodvinsk, that will be \n     operational by 2000 and is expected to rival the capabilities \n     of the best U.S. Navy attack submarines.\n       ``Designed to emphasize improvements in quieting, sensor \n     performance and weapons delivery, Severodvinsk is projected \n     to outperform today's most advanced Western submarines in \n     many respects,'' according to the January 1995 report \n     ``Worldwide Submarine Proliferation in the Coming Decade,'' \n     prepared by Navy intelligence.\n       The Russian Navy also is improving its mix of sea-based \n     weapons, according to the Navy's report, and has two \n     significant new weapon programs under development.\n       One is described as an extremely fast rocket-powered \n     torpedo that has no equivalent in the U.S. or other Western \n     navies. The other is a new type of antiship cruise missile \n     that would be launched from the torpedo tubes of future \n     submarines and the Oscar II cruise missile-carrying \n     submarine.\n       To achieve marked improvements in its submarine fleet, the \n     Russian military is making sacrifices in strategic bomber and \n     rocket forces, surface ships, and tank, artillery and \n     infantry capabilities, the report said.\n       Third-generation submarines will climb to 51 percent of the \n     Russian submarine fleet by 2000, compared with only 28 \n     percent today, according to the Navy's report.\n       The percentage of less advanced, second-generation subs \n     remaining in the inventory will decline to 46 percent from \n     today's level of 68 percent, according to the report.\n       The performance difference between second- and third-\n     generation submarines is fairly dramatic, Navy sources said, \n     noting that third-generation Russian submarines incorporate \n     advances in quieting and improved propulsion systems, \n     enhancing the submarine's undersea stealth.\n       Improved Russian submarine performance could greatly impact \n     U.S. and Western views of antisubmarine warfare and lead to a \n     reassessment of needed capabilities to counter this potential \n     threat, Navy sources and military experts said.\n       ``With the improved Akula submarine, they have already \n     achieved acoustic parity with the [U.S. Navy's Los Angeles-\n     class] SSN-688s, and that is frightening,'' retired Vice Adm. \n     Bernard Kauderer, president of the Annandale, VA-based Naval \n     Submarine League, said Feb. 1.\n       Akula is an attack submarine that incorporates many of the \n     advances the Russians have made in reducing the radiated \n     noise of their submarines.\n       ``We need to continue our research and development programs \n     and produce new submarines,'' Kauderer said.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thankfully, today Russia is not a major adversary, and I \nam hopeful that this administration and future ones will indeed \nstrengthen U.S.-Russian relations. We are all for that.\n  However, in these uncertain times, unforeseen political instability \nor a rise in anti-West nationalism could result in Russia becoming a \ngenuine undersea threat in the future. That is a big nation.\n  Perhaps more importantly to the United States in the near term is \nRussia's sale of its very capable submarines to potential United States \nadversaries abroad, a move that poses a very serious challenge to our \nNavy.\n  There are many nations that recognize the cost effectiveness of \nsubmarines, even relatively unsophisticated ones: diesel power, for \nexample.\n  Listen to this statistic, Mr. President. According to the Office of \nNaval Intelligence, more than 600 submarines are operational in the \nnavies of 44 countries. That is an astonishing statistic. Mr. \nPresident, 44 nations have submarines. I must say, I have difficulty \nadding up what the 44 are.\n  Iran recently purchased two Kilo-class submarines from Russia. These \nvessels are operational today. Who would ever have thought Iran would \nhave submarines? A third Kilo submarine is scheduled for delivery from \nRussia to Iran this year.\n  In addition, China--that great inland land-based power--intends to \nbuy as many as 22 diesel-powered submarines from Russia over the next 5 \nyears in its quest to enhance its military capability in the South \nChina Sea.\n  What about North Korea? Who ever thought of North Korea as a great \nmilitary power? Who would have thought it is an undersea threat? Yet it \npossesses, if you can believe it, the world's fourth largest submarine \nforce and could use these submarines in a variety of belligerent \ncoastal missions.\n  Yes, the cold war is over and we are grateful for that. However, I \nthink we ought to recognize that the world is still a dangerous place. \nThat is why we have this massive defense bill before us.\n  Undersea threats remain a fact of life that we ask our military \nforces to address. I am convinced that completion of the Seawolf \nprogram with its third Seawolf will give the United States the ability \nto respond to these still potent undersea threats.\n  Contrary to what we sometimes hear in the press, the Seawolf's \ncapabilities are more than the ability to engage the former Soviet \nUnion in open ocean conflict. The Seawolf would be used to strike both \nland and sea targets with its cruise missiles, making it a versatile \nplatform against any potential adversary. It will allow the Navy to \ncovertly and quickly exert special operation forces.\n  The Seawolf will be given a wide variety of missions in our Navy of \nthe future. As the director of submarine plans, Adm. Dennis Jones, said \nrecently, ``We must fundamentally change the way we will fight in the \nfuture.'' Included among the undersea missions is a demonstration over \nthe next year to assess how a submerged submarine can control an \nunmanned aerial vehicle. This new mission and others are described in a \nJune 12 article from the Defense News that I ask be printed in the \nRecord, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Defense News, June 12, 1995]\n\nU.S. Subs Gear For Broader Mission--Force Explores UAVs, Communication \n                                 Links\n\n                           (By Robert Holzer)\n\n       Washington.--Shedding decades of self-imposed isolation \n     patrolling the open ocean, U.S. Navy submariners may soon \n     control unmanned vehicles and stealthily communicate with \n     each other in operations close to enemy shores.\n       Long accustomed to operating independently and focused \n     almost exclusively on countering the Soviet submarine threat, \n     the U.S. submarine force seeks added capabilities in \n     communications, sensors and weapons to perform shallow-water \n     missions.\n       ``One constant is that things are changing, not only for \n     us, but for our enemies,'' Rear Adm. Dennis Jones, director \n     of submarine plans, said in a June 6 briefing to the Naval \n     Submarine League's annual symposium in Alexandria, Va. ``We \n     must fundamentally change the way we will fight in the \n     future.''\n       To accomplish this, the submarine force will conduct a \n     demonstration effort over the next year to assess how a \n     submerged submarine can control an unmanned aerial vehicle \n     (UAV), Jones said.\n       Pentagon officials say the Navy will test the Predator UAV \n     in this role. Built by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems \n     Inc., San Diego, the Predator emerged over the last year as a \n     priority system in U.S. military plans.\n       The Predator is a high-altitude endurance UAV that can \n     loiter aloft for more than 60 hours without refueling. It can \n     fly as high as 12,100 meters and carry a 180-kilogram \n     payload. The payload can include sensor packages that provide \n     instant imagery, even at night and in bad weather, to \n     tactical commanders.\n       The Pentagon is dispatching several Predators now to \n     monitor the situation in Bosnia, military sources said.\n       Because submarines usually are the first weapon systems \n     deployed off a potential enemy's coastline, often conducting \n     clandestine reconnaissance and surveillance days or weeks \n     before a crisis erupts, linking those operations with UAVs \n     makes good tactical sense, military experts said.\n       ``There is a lot of flexibility with that concept,'' Norman \n     Polmar, a naval expert here, said June 7, noting that a \n     submarine could simply leave the UAV operating over an area \n     for an extended period and then come near the surface to tap \n     into the data the system collected during its reconnaissance.\n       Submarines may even launch UAVs and retrieve them later at \n     sea, Polmar said.\n       Although the submarine force has augmented its \n     communication capabilities over the last several years, \n     conveying information and data between submerged submarines \n     is a new area of emphasis, Rear \n\n[[Page S 11292]]\n     Adm. Richard Buchanan, commander of Submarine Group 2 with the Atlantic \n     Fleet, said June 7.\n       The service already has conducted several tests of \n     underwater communications, which even included the \n     transmission of imagery, Jones said.\n       ``This is a revolution unto itself,'' Jones said. ``If \n     information doesn't go easily from submarines to joint task \n     force commanders, then we will be bypassed as seeming too \n     difficult.''\n       To prevent this, the submarine force will field a number of \n     communication improvements over the next few years that will \n     yield tremendous increases in capability, Navy officials \n     said.\n       These include the capability by 1998 to transmit video to \n     other subs or ships nearly instantaneously, and by 2000, \n     Super High Frequency satellite links that will vastly \n     increase the amount of data that submerged vessels can \n     transmit and receive.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I hope I have helped to dispel the myth that the \nsubmarine is a relic of the cold war and we no longer need submarines. \nTo the contrary, the Seawolf is a very relevant military platform to \nface the threat of the post-Soviet world. For these reasons, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing the McCain amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Maine. I will try and see if I \ncannot shave off some of those moments to move this along. I want to \nunderscore and support the comments of the Senator from Arizona, trying \nto move this process along.\n  I am tempted to repeat what I have repeated on other occasions in \nthis body or elsewhere the words of the famous Congressman from \nArizona. Having listened to an extensive debate and been the fourth or \nfifth speaker, he announced to the audience that everything had been \nsaid on the subject but not everyone had said it. So I will take a few \nmoments to share some thoughts about the pending matter.\n  Let me begin by commending my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, who serves on the committee, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Cohen of Maine, and of course my colleagues from \nRhode Island as well.\n  My colleagues will be pleased to note that if we can successfully \ndefeat this amendment, this may be the last debate on the Seawolf \nprogram, because this is the last Seawolf. That in itself may cause \nsignificant support to move in our direction, having heard for the last \nnumber of years on numerous occasions from colleagues across the \ncountry of their desire that this issue be resolved once and for all.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain amendment and once and \nfor all put the Seawolf issue to bed, having completed the third \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I will underscore many things that have been said by \nmy colleagues from Connecticut and Rhode Island about the importance \nhere--and it needs to be emphasized, it would be another matter indeed \nif we were talking about a world in which this technology had lost its \nappeal. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending upon your perspective, \nthat is not the case.\n  In fact, there are, as the junior Senator from Rhode Island pointed \nout, 44 nations that possess this technology. In fact, it seems to be \ngrowing in its appeal.\n  Again, I emphasize what has been said about Russia. All of us are \ndeeply pleased with what has occurred in the collapse of the Berlin \nWall, the end of the cold war. Again, I think we all appreciate the \nlack of clarity as to which direction Russia is going in. We all hope \nthat it is going to continue to move in the direction of a democratic \nState which does not pose a threat to its neighbors or to others.\n  I do not think anyone would be prepared to stand on this floor today \nand say with absolute certainty that they were convinced that was going \nto be the ultimate result. If we cannot state that with absolute \ncertainty, or the degree of certainty that seems to be the prudent \ncourse, to be mindful of the kind of technology that is being expanded \nand developed, and it is significant.\n  In fact, we are told by those who watch these efforts far more \nclosely than most of us, that today Russia is developing a technology \nin submarine arenas that will approximate the quietness that we have \nbeen able to achieve with our technology, and as my colleagues know, in \nsubmarine technology the quietness of a submarine is one of the most \ncritical elements of all.\n  So, the first point is, of course, that we still see a global threat, \nthat there are nations that never before possessed this technology that \nare acquiring it.\n  Second, Mr. President, the industrial base argument which was made in \nthe past but I think needs to be made here as well, there are no less \nthan 10 unique submarine technologies that will perish if this \namendment is adopted. I am not talking about large corporations with \nthousands of workers. I am talking about facilities with literally the \nlast of the craftsmen--men and women--with knowledge and skill to \ncreate and build unique components of our Nation's submarine fleet.\n  Likewise, if this amendment should pass, the final legion of \ndedicated and professional workers who build the final product will \ndisappear, and that is not an exaggeration.\n  Let me tell my colleague something about those workers. Some of them \nhave been building submarines literally for decades. Most are members \nof entire families that have passed that knowledge on between \ngenerations. These are craftsmen, I say to my colleagues. They are the \nfinal artists of a very unique industry that America must not abandon.\n  Let me give an example of what I am talking about. It can take up to \n7 years to replace a fully qualified Navy nuclear welder capable of \nwelding the 3-inch steel hulls of the Seawolf class submarine. Mr. \nPresident, 7 years to acquire that technology. That is the \napprenticeship, yard time, evaluations, and, finally, qualification to \nperform the delicate welds in and around the nuclear reactor area of \nthis submarine. Seven years to acquire that skill level.\n  I suggest to my colleagues, and I think they would agree, we should \nnot abandon that capability.\n  As for cost, I agree with the Navy plan to go to a smaller, less \nexpensive submarine program. But to get there, we have to finish what \nwe have started. We have to complete this final boat of the Seawolf \nclass.\n  Remember, there were 23 of these boats we talked about. We are now \ndown to three. I say to my colleagues that to complete the program \nhere, to stop the program when it is 45 percent complete, I think, is \npenny wise and pound foolish.\n  So, Mr. President, again I underscore the terrific work done by my \ncolleague from Connecticut on the Armed Services Committee in making \nthis case. I appreciate immensely the support of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Maine, and others who have stood with us \non this program over the years. It is obviously important to us in \nConnecticut.\n  But my colleague from Connecticut, my colleagues from Rhode Island, \ncould not in good conscience stand here and ask our colleagues from \nacross this country to support a program that did not contribute \nsignificantly to the long-term security needs of our Nation. No matter \nhow important it is to us on a parochial level, that is not a \njustification to ever support one of these programs. As important as \nthat is to us, the importance of this program is its contribution to \nthe long-term national security needs of our Nation.\n  For those reasons, and with all due respect and affection for the \nauthor of this amendment, I urge the rejection of the proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee for yielding this time. I want to start out by \ncongratulating the Senators from Connecticut for their fine work on \nthis project, particularly Senator Lieberman, my colleague in the Armed \nServices Committee, for his outstanding work on this program.\n  I come here as someone who in the past has been an opponent of the \nSeawolf. In fact, I introduced a bill back in 1991 which called for \neliminating the 29 Seawolf submarines that were on the boards because I \nthought it was too costly, that it was a cold war \n\n[[Page S 11293]]\nrelic, that 29 of these submarines was far too many, the threat was not \nout there for that kind of expenditure of, really, tens of billions of \ndollars.\n  Having watched what has happened since 1991, and since I introduced \nthat resolution, I have seen the number of Seawolf submarines go from \n29 to 3, and I have seen the Russian Navy still be the focal point, as \nwas said earlier. What I have seen in response, in the past 4 years \nsince the fall of the Soviet Union, is the Russians keeping their eye \non the ball of maintaining their capacity, their submarine capacity as \nreally their focal point as to how they are going to be a world threat, \nmilitarily. That is where they have invested their money.\n  So, while I would not stand up here and support another 27 Seawolf \nsubmarines, I will say that, given the threat that is out there, given \nthe legitimacy of the dollars invested and the capability of the \nRussian fleet, nuclear submarine fleet and attack submarine fleet, that \nthis is a wise investment for us.\n  I repeat what the junior Senator from Connecticut said. We have a \nsituation right now--and I agree with him, I do not think the American \npublic realizes this--where the Russians are in fact ahead of us in a \nvery important military capability and that is submarines. They are \nahead of us. They have quieter ships than we do.\n  That is stealth. You hear so much about stealth technology when it \ncomes to the Air Force. That means you cannot see it on the radar and \nyou can go in there and do things before anybody sees you. Stealth in a \nsubmarine is how quiet it is. If you cannot hear them you cannot find \nthem. That is the situation we are in right now. We are sending our \nsubmariners out there, into the oceans of this world, in a sense \nblind--deaf to the threats that the former Soviet Union, the Russians \nare now putting forward. This is our response and it is an appropriate \none. It is an appropriate place to invest those dollars.\n  We do so recognizing if we pull the plug on the third Seawolf we will \nwaste a whole lot of money. Already, as has been said many times, $900 \nmillion is already appropriated for this submarine. We have over a \nthird of the costs already in the submarine. To close it down would \ncost even more.\n  There are disputes. The Senator from Arizona, whom I greatly \nrespect--I admire his ability to go into this defense budget and try to \nfind areas where he believes there is waste. I respect that. There are \nsome substantial disagreements as to the CBO calculations for the cost \nsavings of the Seawolf submarine, discontinuing the Seawolf submarine. \nThe Navy, in a document that was transmitted to me, says that they \nunderestimate a lot of the costs, that they do not recognize that by \nshutting off this third Seawolf we will likely end production of any \nkind of ships at Electric Boat, in Connecticut. They do not count for \nthe shutdown of that facility or the costs that would be incurred in \nfuture shipbuilding as a result of having just one shipyard. I think it \nis a substantial one, not just for our industrial base--which I happen \nto believe is important--but for the competitiveness that is necessary \nto get high-quality, low-cost ships in this country.\n  I want to mention just one final thing. I want to talk about the \nindustrial base, not from a State that has a huge submarine industrial \nbase, although we have some. I will say one of the other reasons I \nsupport this third Seawolf is because I do believe we do need an \nindustrial base of skilled technicians and companies that can produce \nthis kind of very high-quality, demanding, and very specific high-\nquality work. If we do not continue this bridge, which the third \nSeawolf turns out to be, into the new attack submarine, we will not \nonly have that new attack submarine cost more as a result, but I think \nwe may not end up with as good a product.\n  So I come here as a reformed Seawolf opponent who understands this is \na project, an investment that is worthwhile to combat a serious threat \nto preserve an industrial base that is essential to the military \ncapability, production capability of our country. I support it \nwholeheartedly and oppose the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the GAO report was before the Armed Services Committee \non May 16, 1995 as follows: On page 6:\n\n       . . . there is disagreement about a number of issues \n     including Russia's defense spending priorities, Russia's \n     ability to maintain its operating tempo and readiness and \n     maintenance levels, and the future Russian force structure \n     levels and production programs.\n\n  The GAO report goes on to say:\n\n       The ONI report [Office of Navy Intelligence report] does \n     not address other factors that should be considered in \n     determining the overall superiority of United States and \n     Russian submarines, such as sensor processing, weapons, \n     platform design, tactics, doctrine and crew training.\n\n  Public reports, news accounts and, more importantly, other DOD \npublications, including the Annual Director of Naval Intelligence \nPosture Statement, present other information on some of the factors \nthat affect submarine superiority. For example, these reports note:\n\n       . . . a decline in the operating tempo of Russian \n     submarines, order of battle, and construction programs.\n\n  They also note:\n\n       Morale and discipline have deteriorated, personnel \n     shortages are serious, and the frequency and scope of naval \n     operations, training, readiness and maintenance have \n     declined.\n\n  Somebody said earlier, one of the Senators from Connecticut, I \nbelieve, we ought to use common sense here. Let us use common sense. \nCommon sense shows us the condition of Russia today, the state of their \nmilitary. This military could not even defeat the Chechnyans. To \nbelieve, somehow, they come from some kind of superior shipyard with \nsuperior workmanship and with superior quality of personnel flies in \nthe face of common sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  I will quote the New York Times, Sunday, July 30, 1995:\n\n       To The Editor:\n       I have a lot of respect for Secretary of the Navy John \n     Dalton. I hate to see him fall prey to the sharks who are \n     trying to justify the spending of $1.5 billion for the third \n     Seawolf submarine.\n       * * * * *\n       The allegation is like the ``missile gap'' or the ``bomber \n     gap'' or the ``readiness gap.'' . . . Does this ``quietness \n     gap'' exist?\n       There are two aspects to quieting a submarine. The first \n     takes place when the submarine is built. To say our \n     submarines are not built as well as Russian submarines \n     condemns the very shipyard we are trying to keep operating.\n       The second aspect of quieting is in the operation of the \n     ship. Is Secretary Dalton telling us that the crews of our \n     submarines are not as well trained or as competent as the \n     Russians?\n       I never met a submarine officer who did not think our \n     submarines were the best in the world--by far. I am sorry to \n     see this proud group stoop to chicanery to justify an \n     unnecessary weapon.\n       --John J. Shanahan, Vice Admiral, retired.\n\n  Let us use some common sense when we evaluate whether we need to \nspend another couple of billion dollars on a weapons system for which \nthere is no compelling requirement.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter \nof the amendment by Senator McCain to terminate the third Seawolf \nsubmarine.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership on this \nissue and for his constant and tireless efforts to scour the defense \nbudget--and, indeed, the entire Federal budget--for wasteful and \nunnecessary spending.\n  Like the Senator from Arizona, I believe we must build a strong \nmilitary that can respond to the rapidly changing threats America faces \nin the post-cold war world.\n  The Seawolf submarine, which was developed to counter a specific \nSoviet threat during the cold war, is simply outdated and irrelevant in \nthis new era.\n  Mr. President, if we're going to buy military equipment that's behind \nthe times, the least we could hope for is to get it at a cut-rate \nprice. But this is not the case. The third Seawolf will cost $2.4 \nbillion bringing the grand total for this program to more than $7 \nbillion for just three submarines.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to terminate the \nSeawolf and save the taxpayers a minimum of $1.3 billion. Moreover, \nthese savings could increase in future years as we determine the most \nefficient way to construct the next generation of nuclear submarines.\n\n[[Page S 11294]]\n\n  As the Senator from Arizona has repeatedly pointed out, this funding \nis needed for higher priority defense programs that will truly enhance \nour military readiness.\n  The McCain amendment has been strongly endorsed by a number of \nGovernment watchdog organizations, including the National Taxpayers \nUnion, Citizens Against Government Waste, and Citizens for a Sound \nEconomy.\n  Mr. President, let's stand with these groups and show the American \ntaxpayers that the Congress supports responsible spending that will \nyield a strong and strategically sound national defense.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes and thirty-two seconds.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Senator from Arizona, who \nis a good friend and someone I have worked with since I came to the \nSenate and long before that time. He was advising me on military \nmatters when he was with the Navy.\n  Bismark once observed that there are two things that do not change in \nthis life: One is history and the other is geography.\n  Going back historically, we can look at the period of time during \nWorld War II. At that time we had over 5,000 ships in our inventory. We \nare now looking at downsizing to in the neighborhood of 340 or 348 \nships.\n  So we have come from having such an armada of 5,000 ships capable of \nfighting during World War II down to about 340 to 350 ships. Obviously, \nthey are much more capable today than they were in the past. But as the \nnumbers have come down, we have insisted that the capability increase. \nAnd that is because the oceans have not diminished in size and \ngeography has not changed. The oceans are still roughly the same size. \nOur commitments have not diminished in any significant degree. We still \nare an island nation.\n  As my colleague from Rhode Island has said, we are likely to remain a \nnaval power for the foreseeable future, hopefully for the indefinite \nfuture. Our commitment is to maintain the sealanes of communication. \nThat is our lifeblood, and no nation should ever have the capability of \nbeing able to interrupt that, to cut off that flow, to cut off the \nblood supply, the oxygen supply. We depend upon having access to the \nopen ocean and having that access unchallenged.\n  So looking at history and looking at geography, we can say, well, we \nhave downsized. The reality is the cold war is over. It does not mean \nthere are no dangers left in this world. They are of a different \nmagnitude and a different type. But they are dangers nonetheless.\n  As most of my colleagues who have spoken in opposition to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the one thing we keep reminding ourselves is that the \nRussians, notwithstanding the state of their economy, continue to \nproduce submarines. Now, they may not be operating at the same tempo \nthat our submarines are operating, the morale of their sailors may be \nat a much lower level than the morale of our sailors, but that, too, \ncan change.\n  What has not changed is the number. They are still producing roughly \nthe same numbers of submarines that they were at the height of the cold \nwar. Some of that is no doubt due to fact that it is just inertia and \nit is a jobs program for the Russians. They have to do something. They \nmight as well do something that they have been working on. They have to \nbuild more ships.\n  But the numbers ought to be of concern to all of us because at some \npoint in time the tides might change. Our relationship with the \nRussians might change. It might get better. It might get worse. We do \nnot know. We have no way of predicting the future. And we should never \nstructure our forces or our industrial base predicated upon the \nunknown; that since we cannot foresee the future, we should simply \nconform our industrial base to what exists currently. That would be a \nprescription for future disaster.\n  So we have to plan for the future taking into account the unknown, \ntaking into account history, taking into account geography, and try to \nplan as best we can given the resources that are available.\n  That, I believe, is what the Navy has done. The Navy has said we \nwould like to have two nuclear-capable shipyards. We are not prepared \nat this point in time to say there should be only one yard in America \nproducing nuclear-capable ships--one yard--namely, Newport News. That \nmay be the situation sometime in the future. We may not be able to \nafford more than one yard.\n  But the Navy is unwilling, given the unforeseeability of the future, \ngiven the sort of chaotic situation which exists in the world today, to \ntake that chance at this point in time. They are saying, ``We are not \nwilling to put all of our eggs in one basket. We do not know whether \nthere will be a surreptitious attack upon that location. We do not know \nwhether it will be a bolt out of the blue. We did not know whether it \nwill be a natural catastrophe. We are unwilling to take the risk to put \nall of our shipbuilding into one yard.''\n  We would like to see Electric Boat continue. And make no mistake \nabout it, you cancel the third Seawolf and EB is out of business. They \nwill shut down. Their 7,000 or 8,000 or 9,000 workers--whatever that \nfigure is now--will be out of work. That may please the National \nTaxpayers Union and it may please the various groups that have come out \nin favor of this amendment saying it will save money. I do not think it \nwill save money. It will put people on the welfare rolls. It will put \nthem out of work. It will increase the deficit, no doubt, because we \nwill simply have to pay for those welfare recipients and not have any \nincome or revenues coming in from the taxpayers themselves.\n  So I am not sure it would be an appropriate tradeoff. If we were only \nengaged in one public works program, if we were simply talking about \npublic works or dead-end jobs, sweeping streets, cleaning up garbage, \nthat would be one thing. But we are talking about here highly skilled \nindividuals, people who work for years to develop the capability of \ndesigning and then constructing the most complicated ships in the \nworld--nuclear submarines.\n  It takes, as the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, indicated, 7 \nyears to build a ship.\n  Ironically, I was just at a launching of the U.S.S. Maine in \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. That ship, a Trident \nsubmarine, was launched. It was built by Electric Boat and commissioned \nat Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The president of the EB yard was there \nand pointed out that in World War II Electric Boat was cranking out \nabout two ships a month, or about one every other week. We are now down \nto producing one a year, or one and a half a year.\n  So times have changed, and we have to change accordingly. But it does \nnot mean that we should sever the ability of this country to maintain \nan industrial capacity of skilled working people who are contributing \nsubstantially to our national security.\n  I can agree with much of what my colleague from Arizona has said. We \ncome to a different conclusion on this. We are trying to keep Electric \nBoat in competition with Newport News for a little longer, at least \nbecause the Navy is unsure at this point whether or not we will ever \nhave to build more than one ship a year, whether we will be able to \nsupport two yards. I think they are not prepared to say we can only \nafford one yard.\n  I believe Admiral Boorda, or read the writings of Admiral Shanahan \nand others. But I would put that up against Admiral Boorda. I do not \nthink Mike Boorda would come to the Congress or to the U.S. Senate and \nmisrepresent the facts. I do not think that he would suggest that this \nis something that is really necessary when it is not, that it is simply \na jobs program for the Navy or for EB. I think that he is persuaded \nthat the Navy does in fact need this ship in order to get us to the \nfollow-on.\n  If you terminate the Seawolf right now, EB is not going to be in \ncompetition. That is very clear. We might as well say that Newport News \nwill be the only yard that will then build the follow-on to the \nSeawolf, the Centurion, or whatever it is going to be called.\n  That is a policy decision that we will be making here on the floor of \nthe Senate, and some are prepared to make it. I do not for 1 minute \nquestion my friend from Arizona. He is someone who is expert in the \nfield. He is someone who has dedicated himself to the \n\n[[Page S 11295]]\nNavy. We just come out on a different end of the judgment on this one.\n  But I do not for a moment want to put us in the position of making \nthe policy judgment that we only need one yard in this country to \nproduce aircraft carriers and submarines. That is what it ends up \nbeing. Newport News will be the only shipyard in the country producing \nall of our nuclear-capable ships into the future.\n  I think that is a risk that the Navy is not willing to bear at this \npoint in time. I think it is a risk that we as Senators should not be \nwilling to bear at this time. And I think in view of the fact that we \nhave spent the $900 million on the third Seawolf, in view of the fact \nwe have come down from 23 to 3, in view of the fact that we would have \ntermination liabilities, we at least ought to get a ship out of it \nwhich allows EB to be in a competitive position to compete head to head \nwith Newport News on the follow-on ships.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I hope that we defeat the amendment \nof my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I always respect and appreciate, and even enjoy, the \ncomments of my old and dear friend from Maine. Usually he and I are on \nthe same side on most issues. On this side, I pay careful attention to \nhis words since they are always well thought out and extremely \nedifying.\n  Again, we find, as he mentioned, ourselves on opposite sides of this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, if we had a defense budget that we had all during the \n1980's, I would still have some questions about this weapons system, \nprimarily because I still believe that our money could be spent much \nmore wisely in other areas. But we really do not have the kinds of \nfunds that I believe would allow us to afford this ship.\n  I received a letter on July 28 from the Congressional Budget Office, \nso I can illuminate my friends as to what kind of money we are talking \nabout.\n\n       After briefly reviewing those savings, the accompanying \n     attachment focuses on the implications of consolidating \n     construction of all nuclear powered ships at a single \n     shipyard.\n       CBO's analysis suggests that such a consolidation could \n     result in savings of between $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion \n     (in 1996 dollars) over the life of the new attack submarine \n     program, which is currently slated to acquire some 30 ships \n     between 1998 and 2020. That amount is less than one \n     contractor claims could be saved through consolidation, but \n     more than the Navy's own estimate. Consolidation could also \n     lead to a somewhat smaller shipbuilding work force: CBO \n     estimates that at most 3,300 shipyards jobs are at issue, and \n     the reduction resulting from consolidation might be \n     substantially less. Essential skills for producing nuclear-\n     powered ships--many of which reside in the suppliers and \n     subcontractors to the shipyards--would be retained whether or \n     not production was consolidated.\n\n  Signed by June O'Neill, who, as we all know, is the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make one additional comment. That is that I \nthink we ought to look at history also, and the history of Russia is \nthat they have primarily been a land empire. They have concentrated \ntheir focus on expansion of their empire to adjacent areas. It was not \nuntil well into the cold war that the Soviet Union began to build a \nfleet and when they built that fleet, it was primarily for strategic \npurposes and for the delivery of strategic weaponry. I do not believe \nthat the Russians contemplate a strategic confrontation with the United \nStates any time soon. Again, it is common sense, as has been said on \nthis floor on many occasions.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, a $1\\1/2\\ billion vote deserves serious \nconsideration by this body in this time of fiscal crisis. Throughout \nthe defense budget debates in the 6 years since the cold war ended, I \nhave been routinely amazed--and disappointed--that the Senate cannot \nbring itself to terminate one of the most expensive, outdated, poorly \nmanaged, cold war programs in the entire budget--namely, the Seawolf \nsubmarine program.\n  Mr. President, there are several reasons to support the amendment \nthat Senator McCain and I are offering. First, the Seawolf is a cold \nwar weapon with no modern mission. It was originally conceived as the \nultimate United States weapon against Soviet ballistic missile \nsubmarines. It would operate 1,000 feet beneath the seas, quieter than \nthe seas themselves. Its special sensors and computer systems would \ndetect Soviet nuclear submarines well before the Seawolf could be \nobserved.\n  If this Nation were still in the grip of the cold war, we would \nprobably be justified in procuring further Seawolf submarines. But, the \ncold war is over, and the system has no mission in the post-cold war \nworld. Consequently, it should be terminated immediately.\n  Second, this program is poorly managed and the problems are such that \nI have little faith in the Navy's estimate of how much money the \ntaxpayers will be required to spend. The General Accounting Office now \nsays that average cost of the first two subs will be well over $5 \nbillion. Moreover, there are significant cost overruns in virtually \nevery aspect of this program. According to the GAO, the design contract \nwas overrun by 131 percent, the production contract on the first sub is \noverrun by about 80 percent, and the average unit cost is overrun by \nabout 250 percent.\n  Giving this hog more feed is not going to make it any leaner. The \ndesign for the first submarine is currently in its fifth revision and \nis more than half a million hours behind schedule, even though \nproduction began several years ago. With the proposed design changes in \nthe SSN-23, additional delays and cost overruns are inevitable.\n  A third reason to terminate the Seawolf program is to restore \naccountability for the Navy's poor acquisition management. There is no \nincentive for industry to perform efficiently as long as funding is \nguaranteed. The guise of the submarine industrial base should not \nremove the Navy's accountability for the Seawolf's 250 percent cost \noverrun. This program is a dud, and we ought to let it fizzle out.\n  A fourth reason to kill the Seawolf program is that funding a third \nSeawolf submarine takes money away from more important needs. It is \nuntenable to require service men and women to live off food stamps so \nthat $100,000 a year defense contractors can remain employed in an \nendeavor that does not add to our national security. We have all heard \nstories of shortfalls in military readiness, due to lack of funds.\n  A fifth reason not to fund a third Seawolf submarine is that there \nare more cost-effective means of protecting the industrial base. One \nalternative approach to maintaining the submarine industrial base is \nallowing it to work on commercial projects, which Electric Boat is \ncurrently pursuing and should do so more aggressively in the future. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the costs of other \nalternatives, such as overhauls and modernization efforts, are much \nless than building and maintaining a third Seawolf.\n  We must also keep in mind that engineering expertise is being \nprotected by work on the new attack submarine and design changes on the \nfirst two Seawolves. Furthermore, the submarine deactivation workload \nwill ensure an industrial base well into the future. Finally, the Navy \nannounced its intent to increase its reliance on commercial \ntechnologies in building the new attack submarine, and reduce its \nreliance on the submarine industrial base.\n  Several years ago, when Senator McCain and I have moved to stop \nfunding for the Seawolf, we garnered very few votes. Then, 2 days \nlater, President Bush terminated the program in recognition that the \ncold war was over. Time and again, the program has been kept alive for \npolitical, rather than military, purposes. We can no longer afford to \nspend $1.5 billion for such reasons. I encourage my colleagues to vote \nto support our amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, due to the exigencies of the hour and the \nefficiency of my friend from Connecticut, and, as my other friend, \nSenator Lieberman, said, much of this debate has been covered in years \npast, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if my \ncolleagues are so prepared. Senator Cohen is prepared to yield it back.\n  Mr. COHEN. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? \n\n[[Page S 11296]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would move to table the----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, if we do, we will bring up the \namendment again and again until we get an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion be \na tabling motion, as in keeping with the previous unanimous-consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can make a motion to table.\n  Mr. COHEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been asked to announce that the \nvote on this amendment--I ask unanimous consent that it be an up-or-\ndown vote----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN [continuing]. Will occur at 8:10. In the meantime, Mr. \nPresident, I would like to announce that on this side we have all of \nthe amendments. We would appreciate it if those on the other side would \ncomplete their list of the amendments so that the distinguished \nchairman can move forward with the unanimous consent, at least so that \nwe can finalize the list of amendments. We hope to be able to do that \nbetween now and 8:10, when the vote will take place. Also, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 8:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend from Maine if he is ready to move \nforward?\n  Mr. COHEN. No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that my \nleader time be extended by an additional 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle pertaining to the introduction of S. 1117 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2090\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the McCain amendment No. 2090.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 30, nays 70, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 356 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--70\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the amendment (No. 2090) was rejected.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if I could have the attention of \nall Members here so I can tell them where we are.\n  It is my understanding we might be able to line up three votes here--\nor three amendments, which will be debated tonight and voted on first \nthing in the morning if votes are necessary.\n  I think the first will be an amendment by the Senator from Arizona, \nwhich will be second-degreed by the Senator from Connecticut. I am not \nsure that will require a vote. It may or may not require a vote.\n  Then there is a DOE matter which will take, I understand, about 2 \nhours of debate.\n  Then Senator Bumpers, we want to accommodate him because he has a \npersonal problem tomorrow. We would like to take at least one of his, \ndebate one of his amendments tonight and the other the first thing in \nthe morning.\n  Will that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That will be satisfactory.\n  Mr. DOLE. So if that took that much time, it would be about 11:30.\n  It would seem to me, those who are involved can stay here and debate \nthose and then have those two votes first thing tomorrow morning, if \nthat is all right with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That will be all right if we can get through the \ndebate--all but the voting. We have a lot of amendments tonight to act \non.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the majority leader will yield for a question, I have \none amendment I would like to offer tonight. I am willing to settle for \na 30-minute time agreement. I would like very much to go in front of \nthe DOE amendment, which will take 2 hours, if that will be all right. \nIt will be very helpful to me.\n  Mr. COHEN. Which one is it?\n  Mr. DOLE. Can you give us some indication of what the amendment was?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There is a provision in the bill that sets up a new \nmethod--directs the Department of Defense to set up a new method for \nfinancing arms sales. My amendment will strike that provision. It is a \nvery simple amendment. Everybody will understand it.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I can get consent, Senator Bumpers offers his amendment \nregarding export loan guarantees. There will be 30 minutes for debate \ndivided in the usual form, with no second-degree amendments to be in \norder, and following the conclusion or yielding back of the time the \nSenate lay aside the amendment. That will follow the amendments by \nSenator McCain and----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the leader will yield, I think the majority leader's \nunanimous consent is excellent. But I would point out we still do not \nhave the list of amendments from the other side. I hope we could, at \nleast by the close of business, get a complete list of amendments which \nwould then be propounded as a unanimous-consent agreement before we \nleave tonight. So at least it will narrow down the total number of \namendments if we are to have any prospect whatsoever of finishing \ntomorrow night.\n  Mr. NUNN. If the leader will yield, we are working on that list. We \nwill have a copy of it in another hour or so.\n  Mr. DOLE. Hopefully you are working it down.\n\n[[Page S 11297]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. We are doing our best to work it down.\n  Mr. DOLE. Because let me indicate again, on Saturday we start off \nwith the Treasury-Post Office appropriations bill, and I am not certain \nwhen this bill will be back again. So, hopefully, if we can accommodate \nthe manager, who has been working very hard--he lost 5 hours yesterday. \nWe had 7 hours today on one amendment. They are trying to catch up \nhere. So if we can keep our amendments to a minimum, I am certain it \nwill help the managers, who have done a good job.\n  We do want to accommodate the Senator from Arkansas. He has a funeral \nto attend tomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me correct that. I am sorry, I misled \nthe leader. I am leaving here tomorrow night.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is fine. We still want to accommodate the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Is there any objection to the request on his amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. He goes first under the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is the Thurmond amendment \ngoing to come before the Bumpers amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. The amendment by Senator McCain will be next. That will be \nsecond-degreed by Senator Dodd. Following disposition of that, it will \nbe Senator Bumpers' amendment, 30 minutes. Following that will be the \nDOE amendment which will take about 2 hours.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And amendments to the DOE bill will be in order?\n  Mr. DOLE. Amendments to the DOE bill will be in order but we would \nlike to have the votes on those tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving right to object, I have no objection to the \nunanimous-consent request as far as it relates to the amendment of \nSenator McCain or the amendment of Senator Bumpers. But I do not \nconsent to anything relating to the Thurmond amendment, the DOE.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let us get this part and then I will make the next request. \nIs there objection to this?\n  Mr. GORTON. Reserving the right to object, I say to the majority \nleader, on the DOE amendment I have some severe reservations.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have not made that request yet. That is going to be next. \nAll right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Now, if I can have the DOE.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand we are not going to be able to \nget an agreement. I will propose the consent agreement. So it may be we \nwill have to have additional votes this evening. But I am going to ask \nconsent, when Senator Thurmond offers an amendment regarding title 31 \nof the bill, and immediately after reading of the amendment, Senator \nExon be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to the Thurmond \namendment, and there be 45 minutes of debate under the control of \nSenator Thurmond and 90 minutes under the control of Senator Exon.\n  Further, following the expiration or yielding of time, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Senator Reid, be recognized to offer an amendment in the \nsecond degree regarding tritium, on which we will have 60 minutes, 40 \nminutes to Senator Reid, 20 minutes to Senator Thurmond,\n and that the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Exon \namendment and on or in relation to the Reid amendment followed \nimmediately by a vote on the Thurmond amendment, as amended, if \namended.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. We cannot get an agreement.\n  Does anybody else have any amendments that we can get agreements on?\n  Why do we not go ahead? Let us go ahead and have the debate on this \namendment and go ahead and have a vote on the first Bumpers amendment. \nThen we will try to determine what we can figure out in the next 30 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2091\n\n (Purpose: To limit the total amount that may be obligated or expended \n    for procurement of the SSN-21, SSN-22, and SSN-23 Seawolf class \n                              submarines)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2091.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, after the matter following line 24, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 125. SEAWOLF SUBMARINE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Limitation of Costs.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (b), the total amount obligated or expended for procurement \n     of the SSN-21, SSN-22, and SSN-23 Seawolf class submarines \n     may not exceed $7,187,800,000.\n       (b) Automatic Increase of Limitation Amount.--The amount of \n     the limitation set forth in subsection (a) is increased after \n     fiscal year 1995 by the following amounts:\n       (1) The amounts of outfitting costs and post-delivery costs \n     incurred for the submarines referred to in such subsection.\n       (2) The amounts of increases in costs attributable to \n     economic inflation after fiscal year 1995.\n       (3) The amounts of increases in costs attributable to \n     compliance with changes in Federal, State, or local laws \n     enacted after fiscal year 1995.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I make a point that the Senate is not in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2092 to Amendment No. 2091\n\n (Purpose: To propose an alternative limitation on the amount that may \n     be obligated for procurement of the Seawolf class submarines.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2092 to amendment No. 2091.\n       On page 1, line 7, strike out ``$7,187,800,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$7,223,659,000''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Senate is \nnot in order. I know the Chair has a problem. But these are important \namendments, and I hope the Chair will keep order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I know what my amendment is about. I would \nbe prepared to ask my friend from Connecticut what his is. But I would \nlike to briefly explain mine.\n  Last year the Congress adopted an amendment to the DOD bill which \ncaps the procurement cost for the first two Seawolf submarines at $4.75 \nbillion, the total amount identified by the Department of Defense as \nnecessary to complete construction of these two systems.\n  The amendment was necessary to control escalating costs of the \nprogram. Therefore, I offer an amendment to expand the existing cost \ncaps to include the third Seawolf submarine, the provision establishing \na procurement cost cap of $7.2 billion on the three Seawolf submarines.\n  The provision allows for the same automatic increases for inflation \nand labor law changes as the existing cap. It also exempts the future \ncosts of outfitting in postdelivery for the submarines.\n  These are costs which will undergo congressional review and require \nauthorizations and appropriations in the future.\n  For reasons which are not clear to me, the other body this year is \nrecommending a repeal of the cost cap on \n\n[[Page S 11298]]\nSSN-21 and SSN-22. I do not believe we can allow a return to the \nuncontrollable cost escalations we have seen on the first two \nsubmarines. I believe that imposing the same strict cost controls on \nthe third Seawolf would be to the advantage of the American taxpayer.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Let me make this very brief. I happen to agree with my colleague from \nArizona on this amendment. We disagreed obviously on the previous \namendment. But the Senator from Arizona is absolutely correct in what \nhe is trying to do here.\n  We have a second-degree amendment that absolutely modifies the \namendment being offered by the Senator from Arizona--modifies it up by \n$30 million, which I think we can reach agreement on here.\n  This is a mature program. I think a case can be made about cost \ncontainment provisions on defense procurement. In the early stages you \nought to be somewhat careful about it when you are dealing with a \nmature program. That is what this is. This is a mature program. I think \ninjecting some fiscal discipline into these programs can be helpful.\n  I am confident that this amendment will offer no problems at all. We \nhave talked to the contractors and to the Navy. We ought to be able to \ncomplete the program with caps that are suggested by these two \namendments.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that there will be no need for a rollcall \nvote on this. We think it does the job.\n  Again, I support what our colleague from Arizona is doing. It is the \nproper and appropriate approach that should be taken on matters such as \nthis.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, we disagree with our \nfriend from Arizona whether or not to finish the third Seawolf. We do \nnot disagree on the question of whether or not there should be a cost \ncap. There should be. I hope we will agree to the second-degree \namendment. We disagree on the question of whether we should complete \nthe third Seawolf. The Senate has spoken now on that question.\n  On the question that the Senator from Arizona now raises as to \nwhether there should be a cost cap, there is no disagreement. Senator \nDodd and I and all the others who support the Seawolf feel probably \neven more strongly that there should be a cost cap.\n  So I hope we can agree on a number and leave it at that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before we voice vote this, because it has \nbeen accepted on both sides, I would like to extend my congratulations \nto the two Senators from Connecticut and to the Senator from Maine on a \nsignificant victory in maintaining the Seawolf submarine. I obviously \nstrongly disagree. But their arguments and the work they did indicated \nthat a clear majority of the Senate chooses to maintain the procurement \nof this weapons system. And I congratulate them on their success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back the remaining time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend from \nArizona for his gracious statement and say to him that, given a choice, \nI would much rather have him on my side than against me, having real \nstrength and conviction, and this is one of those cases where I end up \nafter a fight respecting somebody more than I did before.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof my colleague from Connecticut.\n  My friend from Arizona and I have been with each other over these \nmany years. And there is no better fighter, no more honest Member of \nour body, no person who brings more integrity to a debate, and I \nappreciate how fairly he raised this issue and gave us an opportunity \nto address it.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to commend our respective staffs, my \ncolleague from Connecticut for his staff, and mine, Bob Gillcash, who \nhas done a tremendous job over the years on these issues, this one \nparticularly and many others as well.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question \nis on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut in the \nsecond degree.\n  The amendment (No. 2092) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 2091, \nas amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2091), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           Amendment No. 2094\n\n(Purpose: To strike the bill's provision concerning Defense Export Loan \n                              Guarantees)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Simon, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2094.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike line 1 on page 353 through line 16 on page 357.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we have a 30-minute agreement on this, \nbut perhaps because it is a very straightforward, simple amendment, we \nmay be able to do it in less time than that, and I hope we can.\n  Right now, the United States totally dominates the foreign arms \nmarket. We sell 53 percent of all the arms in international trade. We \nalso have four separate methods of financing these sales which help \nmaintain our position of dominance.\n  First of all, the Arms Export Control Act allows the President to \ncommit the U.S. Government to a loan guarantee or a grant.\n  Second the Export-Import Bank can finance any sale of technology as \nlong as it is nonlethal. So we sell a lot of military hardware to \ncountries that are financed by the Export-Import Bank.\n  Third we have foreign military financing which is a part of the \nforeign aid bill. We pick out the countries and give them grants to buy \nour weapons. We say here is $1 billion for you and $1 billion for you. \nCome and buy whatever weapons you want until you use up that $1 \nbillion. We can also subsidize loans with this program.\n  Fourth we have foreign military sales. Under this program the U.S. \nGovernment or a U.S. company sells arms to a foreign government.\n  The bill we are debating says four methods of financing arms are not \nenough. We have to have another one. And it directs with virtually no \nguidance the Defense Department to set up a program exactly like OPIC. \nSenators know what OPIC is. You pay a little fee and you get your loan \nguarantee.\n  That is all there is to this amendment. I say four is enough. Let me \nread you though just for entertainment purposes a list of the countries \nthat arms sales merchants in this country will be selling arms to by \nsimply paying a small fee to this new organization that the Defense \nDepartment is ordered under the bill to set up.\n  You are not looking at another S scandal, but you are looking at \nsomething that has the potential for a mini-S We just got through \nwriting off $7.1 billion to Egypt and $300 million to Jordan.\n  I do not want to refight those battles, but how do you feel about \nBurundi? Do you want to give loan guarantees to them? They already buy \nweapons from us.\n  Here is a list of roughly 100 countries that the contractors, the \narms merchants of this already country sell arms to.\n  Now, the arms merchants are hot for this, and I do not blame them. \nHow would you like to be able to sell $100 million worth of weapons to \nsome Third World nation where 50 percent of the people are starving to \ndeath for a \n\n[[Page S 11299]]\nlittle simple fee you pay on the front end?\n  Incidentally, there is not even a prohibition in this against \nfinancing the fee. Let us assume you have a $10 million sale. Let us \nassume the fee is $500,000. Just add that on. Make it a $10.5 million \nloan. Finance the whole thing. There is no prohibition against it.\n  But here is Burundi, Chad, Djibouti, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Namibia, \nSenegal, Zambia, Zimbabwe--100 of them. And someday in the future they \nwill pay a little fee, and we will sell arms to them on credit. And the \nAmerican taxpayer will assume the risk.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have a moral compunction about this. I make no \nbones about it. I have some moral reservation about how many arms we \nsell abroad. We keep forgetting that our weapons last longer than our \nfriendships.\n  Do you know where the contras down in Nicaragua got most of their \narms? They were the arms we left in Vietnam. The Vietnamese inherited a \ncache of weapons that would choke a mule, and a lot of them went to the \ncontras in Nicaragua. What happened to all the Stingers we sent to \nAfghanistan? Why, our good friends the Iranians have about 30 of them.\n  As I said, we sell 53 percent of all the arms sold in the world, and \nthe Pentagon estimates by the year 2004 we will be selling 59 percent. \nThat is 59 percent of all the arms sales, and somebody will say, \n``Well, if we don't do it, somebody else will.'' I heard that argument \nthe first year I was in the Senate, and I still hear it. I say let \nsomeone else then.\n  This may influence some of you--The White House strongly supports \nthis amendment. The administration does not want another method of \nfinancing weapons. And the Pentagon says this can only marginally \naffect the number of weapons that we are going to be selling abroad.\n  Mr. President, in 1993-1995, that time period, we sold $53 billion \nworth of weapons. Let me ask you this: Who here believes that this \nNation is safer and stronger because we are selling anywhere from $10- \nto $20 billion worth of weapons abroad each year?\n  Now, Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues this is not the \nbiggest item in this bill, but it is just another provision in which we \nought not to get involved. I promise you we are going to be financing \nweapons to countries, and we are going to be forgiving the debts. We \nare going to be picking up all these bad loans. It is a very generous \nmethod. And there are a lot of Third World countries that will jump on \nthis thing like a chicken after a June bug, and obviously the arms \nmerchants will be tickled to death to sell the weapons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the Bumpers amendment proposes to strike the language \nin the bill creating a self-financing defense export loan guarantee \nprogram at the Department of Defense. I underscore the fact that it is \nself-financing. All of the Members who support this measure also have a \nmoral compass. The program provides financing to a very select list of \ncountries for defense sales that meet all, all of the existing export \ncontrols and nonproliferation policies of the United States.\n  It is also important to note that this authority is not limited \nstrictly to arms. In many cases American companies lose bids to \nmaintain or upgrade previously sold U.S. military equipment because \nthey cannot offer financing. The program in the defense authorization \nbill will allow U.S. companies and American workers to compete on a \nlevel playing field with our international competitors.\n  Today, almost every major arms exporter provides financing to support \nthe export of their domestic products and services. Indeed, some \npurchasers now make financing a requirement before a company can bid on \na proposed purchase. The program is financed by fees paid by the buyer \nor the seller.\n  The list of eligible countries--and it was interesting Senator \nBumpers went down a list of a number of countries, but the list of \neligible countries is limited to our NATO allies, nonmajor allies, \nCentral European countries moving toward democracy, and selected \nmembers of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Group. Of the 185 \nmembers of United Nations, we only allow 37 countries to be eligible \nfor these loan guarantees.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the list of these 37 countries be \nprinted in the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       List of Eligible Countries\n\n       1. Albania.\n       2. Australia.\n       3. Belgium.\n       4. Brunei.\n       5. Bulgaria.\n       6. Canada.\n       7. Czech.\n       8. Denmark.\n       9. Egypt.\n       10. France.\n       11. Germany.\n       12. Greece.\n       13. Hong Kong.\n       14. Hungary.\n       15. Iceland.\n       16. Indonesia.\n       17. Israel.\n       18. Italy.\n       19. Japan.\n       20. Luxembourg.\n       21. Malaysia.\n       22. Netherlands.\n       23. New Zealand.\n       24. Norway.\n       25. Philippines.\n       26. Poland.\n       27. Portugal.\n       28. Romania.\n       29. Singapore.\n       30. Slovakia.\n       31. Slovenia.\n       32. South Korea.\n       33. Spain.\n       34. Taiwan.\n       35. Thailand.\n       36. Turkey.\n       37. U.K.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. When similar legislation was proposed 2 years ago, \nthe Commerce Department and the Department of Defense expressed support \nfor the export loan guarantee program. The American companies continue \nto lay off thousands of defense workers each month. This program will \nhelp us avoid paying unemployment to defense workers and help us \npreserve the U.S. defense industrial base.\n  That is a winning combination. At a time when U.S. procurement of \nmilitary equipment has reached all-time lows and we are all familiar \nwith that in basics such as ships, planes, and trucks, it makes sense \nto sell these systems to our friends and our allies assuming those \ncountries qualify for the equipment under our existing export controls.\n  Now, the House-passed defense authorization bill includes similar \nlanguage, and in a strong bipartisan vote the House voted 276-152 to \nkeep the language in the bill. So, I urge my colleagues to reject the \nBumpers amendment and allow us to have this sort of bridge for our \ndefense contractors and American workers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. THURMOND. How much time do you want?\n  Mr. DODD. Three minutes, 4 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Connecticut 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that section 1053--defense export \nloan guarantees--should be deleted or amended in any way.\n  I believe the language in the bill strikes the right balance. It \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish a program to issue \nexport guarantees for financing of sales or long term leases of defense \narticles or services to certain countries.\n  Under the provision contained in the bill, U.S. companies would be \neligible to seek export financing guarantees to countries that are \nmembers of NATO, to countries designated as major non-NATO allies, to \ncountries in Central \n\n[[Page S 11300]]\nEurope, provided the Secretary of State has first designated such \ncountry as having a democratic government, and to certain non-communist \nmember countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] \norganization.\n  This financing won't be free. Companies will be required to pay \nappropriate fees and interest charges comparable to those that non-\ndefense exporters are charged by the U.S. Export/Import Bank.\n  During a period of reduced funding for purchases of weapons systems \nand other defense equipment, I believe that defense exports can make a \nsignificant difference with respect to whether our domestic industrial \nbase will be sustained at levels sufficient to protect our national \nsecurity.\n  I would remind my colleagues that we are not going to be the first \ncountry to offer such a program. We are way behind our allies and major \ntrading partners on that score. Many of them make no distinction \nbetween defense and non-defense exports in their export assistance \nprograms.\n  The international defense market is incredibly competitive. Despite \nthe fact that the U.S. defense industry produces some of the best \nequipment in the world, competitive financing can make or break the \nsale.\n  Since 1989, I have been trying to convince my colleagues that we have \ngot to equip our defense exporters so that they can compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  In 1989, I was successful in getting a much narrower defense export \nfinancing program operational for 1 year--fiscal year 1990. During the \nbrief life of that program, a United States company--Sikorsky won a \nhighly competitive contract to sell Black Hawk helicopters to Turkey.\n  That sale totalled $1 billion and enabled some people in my State to \nremain employed who might otherwise have lost their jobs--that is not \nto say that significant numbers of Connecticut workers haven't been \nseverely impacted by defense spending cut backs.\n  The time has come to stop treating Americans employed in the defense \nindustry like second class citizens. They deserve comparable support \nfrom their Government as they struggle to feed their families and pay \ntheir bills.\n  The provision that the Arms Services Committee included in the \npending bill has been carefully crafted so as not to impinge on U.S. \nExport/Import Bank financing. It will be a program operated in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Nor should my colleagues be concerned that somehow we will be fueling \nthe arms race with this program. No sale under this program will go \nforward until it has been fully vetted by all appropriate agencies to \nensure that the sale is in the national interest.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is long past time for such a program \nto exist and I strongly oppose the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers \nto prevent that from happening.\n  To sum up, for my colleagues, this is an area where the Senator from \nIdaho and I are in full agreement. In fact, before he arrived in the \nSenate this was an issue of great interest to me. As I mentioned \nearlier, in 1989, I was successful in having a very modest, 1 year, \ndefense export financing provision included in the fiscal year 1990 \nForeign Operations Appropriations Act. In the 1 year that this \nprovision was in effect it made a significant difference.\n  I believe we have to be pragmatic about these matters. If every other \ncountry would back away from this kind of financing, then there would \nbe no reason for us to be establishing such a program. But that isn't \nlikely to happen anytime soon. I can personally tell my colleagues that \nother nations engage in very supportive financing schemes to assist \ntheir defense industries.\n  As to the assertion that this provision will permit the sales of arms \nall around the world, I would say to my colleagues that is not \naccurate. I personally would not support a blanket authorization to \nfinance the sale of defense equipment to every country around the \nglobe.\n  The provision in the bill does not propose that approach. As I said \nearlier, the provision limits access to such financing to a select \nnumber of countries, including NATO allies, major non-NATO allies, \ncertain non-communist members of APEC, and several democratic countries \nin Central Europe, provided they remain on the democratic track.\n  Moreover, I would say to my colleagues, at a time when we are \nreducing defense expenditures for obvious reasons, an intelligent, \nwell-thought-out financing scheme makes sense. It allows us to market \ndefense equipment to nations with strong democratic institutions, who \nare our allies. It is a way of maintaining an industrial base without \nhaving to go the taxpayers in this country to support it.\n  The Senator from Idaho has been involved in this for some time. My \ncolleague from Connecticut and I have met with numerous people over the \nyears on this issue. I will tell you, in 1989, had this body not \nsupported the particular effort we made, we would have lost a $1 \nbillion contract to the French or the Germans. I am telling you from \npersonal experience, that a program such as the one proposed in this \nbill can make a difference.\n  So with all due respect to my colleague from Arkansas, these are not \nThird World countries and not a wholesale financing scheme to any \ncorporation that comes along. Nor is it meant to be in competition with \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  If we fail to approve this program, we put in possible jeopardy the \nindustrial base of our country. So for those reasons, I respectfully \nurge the rejection of the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby my distinguished colleague, Senator Bumpers, of Arkansas. It would \nremove a very important program from the bill we have discussed in our \ncommittee and on the floor for the last several years.\n  According to studies conducted by the Office of Technology Assessment \nand others, the defense industry is laying off 20,000 workers every \nmonth and will continue to do so every month throughout the decade. One \nway to preserve these jobs is to help our industries export more \ndefense products to our friends and allies. Export loan guarantees is \nthe one way to put U.S. defense contractors on a level playing field \nwith our foreign competitors.\n  Other countries such as France and Great Britain provide such finance \nguarantees to their industries, and we should do likewise. The loan \nguarantee program establishing section 1053 is a no-cost program for \nU.S. taxpayers. The eligible countries are restricted to 37 of our \nallies and friends, and the controls on the sales of sensitive \ntechnologies are in no way relaxed.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Carolina \nyield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. How long?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Can you go with less than that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will try my best.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is a tough negotiator. I thank the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  As my colleagues before me have said, I thank the Senator from Idaho \nfor his leadership on this.\n  I oppose the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers. The point is that \nthis is an attempt to help the defense industry of our country and our \ndefense workers whose jobs are endangered for a reason that we are \nhappy about, the end of the cold war. But they are not happy about it. \nAnd we ought to try the keep that base alive by helping them sell \nabroad.\n  The fact is that there is no source of export financing for arms \nexports available to American firms except at high commercial rates. \nThe fact is that other countries are helping their firms dramatically \nwith financing. I can give you one example. In Connecticut, where a \nConnecticut company actually moved over 70 good jobs from Connecticut \nto Canada in order to qualify for the export financing that the \nCanadian Government offers.\n  Mr. President, this program is not only self-financing but it is \nlimited. Let me come back to the references that my friend from \nArkansas made to Burundi and Chad and Senegal and Zambia, et cetera, et \ncetera. High-risk countries are ruled out of participation in this \nprogram under this law. I refer my friend from Arkansas to section \n\n[[Page S 11301]]\n\n2540 of the bill. You have to be a member of NATO. You have to be a \ncountry designated as a major non-NATO ally. I think we are thinking \nhere of countries like Israel. You have to be a country in Central \nEurope that has changed its form of government, and you have to be a \nnon-communist country that was a member nation of the Asian Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation group, which includes countries like Korea, \nSingapore, et cetera. This is a good program: self-financing; protect \njobs; protect the military industrial base.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. I would ask if everyone would withhold while I ask for the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Larry Ferderber a congressional fellow \nassigned to my office be allowed floor privileges during the pendency \nof the action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in just a moment I will yield to my good \nfriend from Maryland, but I just want to make a couple of points.\n  You know, the Senator from Connecticut just talked about jobs. I have \nto tell you this is one place where I consider that the worst of all \narguments is to create jobs so we can sell weapons abroad.\n  As I said, those weapons always have a tendency to get into terrorist \nhands. They get into all kinds of hands. They wind up half the time \nbeing used against us. And in addition to that, an awful lot of the \narms sales in this country are quid pro quo. We will sell you so many \nweapons, but we will also create so many jobs in your country that \nwould otherwise be in the United States. It is a trade-off.\n  And when it comes to who is creditworthy, you have Mexico. We are \nbailing them out right now. They are eligible to buy weapons under \nthis. Chile, they are eligible. All of the Pacific rim, 37 nations on \nhere. I promise you even some of those nations in Central Europe are \nlousy credit risks. They are fine and we wish them well, but they are a \nlousy credit risk. We have no business setting up yet a fifth way to \nsell weapons in addition to the four we already have.\n  Finally, let me just read this White House position for whatever this \nis worth to my colleagues.\n\n       ``The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to \n     establish a program to issue loan guarantees and surety \n     against losses arising from the financing of defense exports \n     to certain countries. The administration opposes this program \n     because the administration has not found it necessary given \n     the availability of existing authority for transactions of \n     this type and the substantial American presence in \n     international markets for military equipment.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my distinguished friend from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nBumpers amendment. I hear all these assertions by the opponents of this \namendment that it is necessary in order to make the United States \ncompetitive in the arms market. The fact of the matter is, the United \nStates absolutely dominates the international arms market right now--\nright now--and the U.S. percentage of the world's arms market has \nincreased markedly over the last few years, ever since the implosion of \nthe Soviet Union and other developments that have taken place.\n  So I say to my colleagues, first of all, the assertion that you need \nthis program in order to be able to sell the arms does not square with \nthe facts. The reality is we dominate the international arms market.\n  Second, I hear it asserted in some way as though there is no risk \nhere. I think the term ``self-financing'' was used as though this thing \nis absolutely certain to pay its way. Clearly, that is not the case. \nWhy are they seeking a Government guarantee? They are seeking a \nGovernment guarantee in order to insure against the risk which they \notherwise would encounter in the private market. So, obviously, there \nis some risk connected with these arms sales; in some instances, \npotentially very heavy and substantial risks.\n  As my colleague from Arkansas has pointed out, there are a series of \nprograms right now to encourage these arms sales. Others say what these \nother countries do. None of these other countries have anything like a \nforeign military loan program and a foreign military gift program the \nway the United States does. So we are already making very substantial \nprovision for arms sales. Of course, those programs are very tightly \ncontrolled and circumscribed to ensure that the national interests of \nthe United States are provided for.\n  The administration has not sought this. It is my understanding that \nthe Pentagon--in fact, I will ask my colleague from Arkansas, is it, in \nfact, correct that the Department of Defense is resistant to this \nproposal?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely. The Defense Department says it is not \nneeded, and the administration says it is not needed. As the Senator \nsaid, we have 53 percent of the arms market now, headed for 59. It is \nnot as though we are not competitive.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the worldwide market. If you isolate some of \nthe areas, including some of the areas that are covered in this bill, \nthe U.S. percentage rises substantially over that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Exponentially.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A lot of the places that it does not, a lot of the NATO \nproducers make their own arms. You standardize their products and you \ndirect that to meet their standardization purposely.\n  Some of the countries provided for here are high-risk countries--a \ncountry in Central Europe that recently changed its form of national \ngovernment. Financially, those are high-risk countries. Some of the \nAsian countries carry risks with them.\n  I am not quite clear where this comes from. The administration does \nnot want it. They are not proposing it. They are resistant to it. We \ndominate the arms market. I can understand the makers of arms want as \nmany underwrites as they can possibly find. I think that is a given, \nand Members will recognize that. But whether it is wise to use money \nthis way and to incur these kinds of risks by these guarantees, \nobviously there is a risk connected, and the provision recognizes that. \nTo get up and assert somehow that this is a freebie, in every respect \ndefies the basic rationale of the provision that is in the bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Bumpers amendment. We ought \nnot to start down this path. We have dealt with this issue before.\n  Let me simply say this. The last time we had such a provision in the \nlaw, it was extended out to cover other countries as well. When it \nfirst comes before you, it gives you a short list. Then the next year \nthat list gets added to. Then the year after that, it gets added to. \nAnd pretty soon they say, ``Well, we have to make this comprehensive \nnow. We have covered so many countries that there is an insult \nconnected with leaving a country out from this program.'' So then you \nmake it comprehensive.\n  That is exactly what will happen--I am prepared to predict that on \nthe floor tonight--if this provision stays in the legislation. I hope \nmy colleagues will support the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] that would eliminate \nthe defense export loan guarantee provision in this bill.\n  I believe that the loan guarantee provision will help maintain and \nmay help to create jobs as our Nation reduces defense spending here at \nhome. By aiding the sale of ``made in the USA'' military items to our \nclose allies, we can lessen the pain of defense downsizing for hundreds \nof thousands of defense and aerospace workers across the country.\n  The entire Nation and, in particular, my home State of California, \nhas been hard hit by defense downsizing, not to mention the recent base \nrealignment and closure list. Hundreds of thousands of defense related \njobs have been lost in California in the last 2 years, and this number \nis sadly expected to rise.\n  Continued exports of defense goods is vital to maintaining \nCalifornia's industrial resources. We can help to ease the transition \nfor defense and aerospace \n\n[[Page S 11302]]\nworkers by providing these loan guarantees, by establishing defense \nconversion programs, and through other initiatives. It is our duty to \nhelp in any way we can to provide good, high-quality jobs for the \nhundreds of thousands of dedicated workers who have contributed to U.S. \nnational security.\n  The defense export loan guarantee provision in this bill does not, in \nany way, eliminate the many existing safeguards that protect against \nrisky proliferation. Loan guarantees would be limited to friendly \ncountries specified in the bill--including our NATO allies, major non-\nNATO allies, the democratic states of Eastern Europe, and the member \nnations of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APFC]. Further, \ncongressional oversight of these foreign military sales would not be \nlessened. All foreign military sales would still have to be reviewed by \nCongress as required by the Arms Export Control Act.\n  This defense export loan guarantee program offers an opportunity to \nassist our defense workers and improve our economy. I strongly believe \nthat this provision is vital to our defense and aerospace industry and \nis essential to the preservation of hundreds of thousands of high-\nquality, good paying jobs in California and throughout the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this provision and oppose the Bumpers \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee for his courtesy.\n  We continually hear references to a variety of countries. I just want \nto drive the point home. The list of the 37 countries that are eligible \nfor these loan guarantees are allies and friends--allies and friends. \nYou can keep reading all the countries all night long, but there are \nonly 37 that are eligible, and also those 37 countries come under the \nentire export control and nonproliferation policy of the United States.\n  This language simply grants the authority to the administration to \nallow the loan guarantees. It does not require the administration to do \nso. It is an authority to do so.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment because the language is here that is going to finally \naccomplish what we have been setting out to do for a number of years.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the remaining 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I must say that I do not understand the opposition to this program \nthat the Senator from Idaho and I and the Senator from Colorado have \nsponsored. We have the model for this in the private sector. It is the \nEximbank, and it works very well to put American companies on a level \nplaying field and protect American jobs.\n  Look, if somehow we were on the verge of achieving disarmament \nworldwide, I would say we should not be the only country out there \nselling weapons. The fact is, there is an active arms market worldwide. \nWhy tie one hand behind our manufacturers when they go out to compete \nwith other countries' manufacturers for contracts?\n  The fact is that we have a lot on the line. We have some defense \ncompanies that could close up and make our country less secure in the \nfuture, undercut our industrial base. The fact is, we could lose \nthousands of jobs without this kind of support. So I do not apologize. \nI think this is just giving the Department of Defense an asset to \nprotect defense companies and the people who work for them and put us \non an even playing field with other manufacturers around the world.\n  My friend from Idaho is absolutely right. Everything done here must \nbe licensed under the Export Administration. There is no danger of \nproliferation in that sense. And I come back and say, Mexico was \nmentioned by the Senator from Arkansas, Chile was mentioned. They \nsimply would not qualify. Of those 37 countries, the program mechanics \nare structured so that defaults are very, very unlikely.\n  I think this bill is good for America's national security and good \nfor those who work in America and will not at all increase the \nproliferation of weapons throughout the world.\n  I thank the Chair. I hope my colleagues will vote against the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Since time has expired on both sides, I ask for the \nyeas and nays on this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I heard some ingenuous arguments, but the \nSenator from Connecticut saying we need to level the playing field when \nwe already have 53 percent of the market headed for 60 percent is \ningenuous. I do not know how much more you can level this field.\n  But I would like to ask, on my time, the Senator from Idaho to tell \nme one country that we are going to finance under this provision that \ncannot buy weapons right now and to which you would want to provide \nloan guarantees.\n Name one.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, Greece and Turkey are two \ncountries.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Why can they not buy weapons now?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. They need to finance it, and they are allies.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. They cannot afford the weapons so we are going to sell \nthem with loan guarantees under this new program?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, both of those countries \nreceive financing under the foreign military loan program, with all of \nthe conditions and restraints of that program. Both of those countries \nreceive financing under that currently.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And military financing. We have given both of those \ncountries billions of dollars of weapons over the years under the \nforeign aid bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to conclude, Greece and Turkey are \nallies, and I am proud to stand with the American workers that would \nprovide necessary materials to our allies.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The whole reason this provision should be struck from \nthe bill is because the only countries that need it are those whose \ncredit is so bad that they cannot get weapons under the four existing \nprograms for selling military equipment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bumpers amendment No. 2094.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote.\n  The result was announced--yeas 41, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 357 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     \n[[Page S 11303]]\n\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Dorgan\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 2094) was rejected.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we debate the fiscal year 1996 National \nDefense authorization bill, I want to join with my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished junior Senator from Idaho, in commending \nthe Navy for its successful utilization of the Small Business \nInnovation Research Program in its development of the multipurpose \nprocessor. The multipurpose processor will be used to reduce risk and \nprovide affordable technology for the new nuclear submarine, which will \nbe developed within the next few years, as well as for the current U.S. \nsubmarine fleet.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia. The American people demand \nthat we continually look for the most cost effective solutions to our \nproblems. That fact is particularly true with regard to Defense \nspending. The multipurpose processor is truly a cost effective and \nworthwhile program. It will provide our submarine fleet with a common \nopen system processor which allows rapid insertion of advancing \ntechnologies while also protecting our previous investments in complex \nsoftware. I therefore join with Senator Warner in commending the Navy \nfor its initiative and leadership in this area.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, with whom I have the distinct pleasure of serving on both the \nArmed Services and the Small Business Committees. It is indeed \nnoteworthy that the two of us are engaging in this colloquy because the \nmultipurpose processor program combines the best interests of our \nNation's defense with those of American small business. Many innovative \nproducts developed by small business have contributed significantly to \nthe strength of our Armed Forces over the years and I trust, with \ncontinued congressional support for the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program, they will continue to do so well into the future.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague on that \npoint as well. The continued success of American small business is \nvitally important to the economic health of our Nation. The \nmultipurpose processor program is an important example of how a small \nbusiness, Digital System Resources, Inc., has made an important \ncontribution to the Nation's defense. Appropriately, American small \nbusiness should be given every opportunity to continue to make \ncontributions to the national defense as well as to the other sectors \nof our economy.\n                  medicare--eligible military retirees\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Defense authorization bill now before \nthe Senate contains the following provision:\n  ``(1) * * * the Secretary of Defense should develop a program to \nensure that covered beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare * * * \nand who reside in a region in which the TRICARE program has been \nimplemented have adequate access to health care services after the \nimplementation of the TRICARE program in that region; and\n  ``(2) to support strongly, as a means of ensuring such access, the \nreimbursement of the Department of Defense by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services for health care services provided such beneficiaries \nat the medical treatment facilities of the Department of Defense.''\n  Our military retirees are entitled to the medical benefits which they \nhave been promised. When the TRICARE system is fully implemented, \nMedicare-eligible military retirees can receive care in military \nhospitals only on a space available basis. Consequently, these retirees \nare being put at the back of the line and in some cases must change \nhealth care providers after years of care in military treatment \nfacilities. I am very concerned about this.\n  There must be an alternative to the current situation. Medicare funds \nshould be transferred from the Department of Health and Human Services \nto the Department of Defense, so Medicare-eligible retirees will be \nable to use military health care facilities, with the costs covered by \ntheir Medicare benefits. I urge the approval of this legislation.\n                civilian manpower and airlift operations\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished majority leader and the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if my friend from Connecticut would yield. I \nam aware of the issue the Senator seeks to discuss and would be happy \nto enter into a colloquy on this matter.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for his time. It is my understanding \nthat the committee staff has reviewed the measure and has approved it. \nSpecifically, this amendment seeks to restore funding to the Air Force \nReserve operations and maintenance account for restoration of funds for \ncivilian manpower and airlift operations support.\n  The U.S. Air Force Reserve has historically provided service-wide \ncritical airlift and logistics support to our national defense. A \nperfect example of this effort is the medical airlift capability for \nour forces. With over 70 percent of our national medical aircrew \nmanpower coming from the active Air Force Reserves, reductions in \noperation and maintenance at this point seems unreasonable.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have to agree with my colleague. I think Members would be \ninterested to know that almost 45 percent of all heavy lift performed \nby the Air Force is provided by Air Force Reserves crewmembers. Another \n25 percent occupy tactical airlift cockpits. There is no question where \nour Nation turns in time or need for airlift support.\n  Mr. DODD. I could not agree more. The Air Force Reserve is the very \nbackbone of our national airlift and I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in this amendment to restore the necessary and requested funds to \nmaintain this vital program.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for raising this \nimportant issue. I had previously directed the respective committee \nstaff to review this matter and have included a funding adjustment in \nthe manager's amendment. This adjustment would add $10 million to the \nAir Force Reserve account and reduce the Department of Defense wide \nactivities by $10 million.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and good friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I join my friend from Connecticut in \nthanking the distinguished Senator and chairman of the committee for \nhis cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention?\n  If I can just suggest the absence after quorum for 1 minute, we are \nabout to type out the consent agreement. If we can reach an agreement \nthere will be no more votes this evening. If not, we will just have to \nwork through it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues that there \nwill probably be additional votes tonight. There will be an amendment \nby Senator Cohen, 30 minutes equally divided--15 equally divided.\n  Mr. FORD. On what?\n  Mr. COHEN. This is on the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. NUNN. I did not hear the request.\n  Mr. DOLE. Fifteen minutes equally divided on a Cohen amendment.\n  Is there any objection to that?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would suggest 30 minutes because most people on this side \nhave not read the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Thirty minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. No second-degree amendments. That would be followed by an \namendment by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn. As I understand, \nthere is not any time agreement on \n\n[[Page S 11304]]\nthat so we do not know when that vote will come. So that we will do \nthose two tonight at least.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  This is the time agreement we wanted to obtain earlier. We could not \ndo that. So I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow morning, after \nconsultation with the managers--they can determine when to bring it \nup--Senator Thurmond be recognized to offer an amendment regarding \ntitle XXXI of the bill; that immediately after the reading of the \namendment, Senator Exon be recognized to offer a second-degree \namendment to the Thurmond amendment, and that there be 45 minutes of \ndebate under the control of Senator Thurmond and 90 minutes of debate \nunder the control of Senator Exon; further, that following the \nexpiration or yielding of time, the Exon amendment be laid aside and \nSenator Reid be recognized to offer his amendment on tritium on which \nthere be 60 minutes, to be divided 40 minutes under the control of \nSenator Reid and 20 minutes under the control of Senator Thurmond; and \nfollowing that debate, the amendment be laid aside and Senator McCain \nbe recognized to offer an amendment on competition, on which there be \n10 minutes for debate, to be equally divided in the usual form; to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Exon amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Reid amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the McCain amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the Thurmond amendment, as amended, if amended.\n  So we are talking about four amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, everything is \nright except in the transcription, 45 should be 70 under the control of \nSenator Thurmond-- 90 and 70.\n  Mr. DOLE. I said 90--\n  Mr. BRYAN. Seventy, Mr. Leader, under the control of Senator \nThurmond.\n  Mr. DOLE. Did I short him? Good. I gave him 45 minutes.\n  He wants 70.\n  Mr. REID. We talked about that all night.\n  Mr. DOLE. Make that 70 instead of 45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Hopefully, when this happens tomorrow sometime, we will not \ntake all this time, but we may. That would be 3 hours plus four votes. \nYou are talking about a big, big time.\n  I would also ask consent--to accommodate Senator Bumpers --that \nfollowing the disposition of this agreement, whenever it occurs, the \nprevious unanimous consent, Senator Bumpers offer his amendment on \ndefense firewalls, 1 hour of debate to be equally divided in the usual \nform, no second-degree amendment be in order, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on or in relation \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Now, I might say to my colleagues, I know there are dozens \nof amendments out there. We are trying to accommodate those who have \nthe shortest times. If we have 20 minutes equally divided or 30 \nminutes, we will try to rotate back and forth. It seems to me, if we \nare going to finish the bill, if everybody gets 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 \nhours, it is going to be 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon before we take up \n2 or 3 amendments here, and we cannot be on this bill Saturday.\n  I am not certain when we will get back on the bill. Senator Thurmond \nneeds to leave tomorrow for an important family matter on Saturday. We \nwill have votes on Saturday. We will be on at least one or two \nappropriations bills. If we should, by some miracle, finish this bill \nearly tomorrow, we could go to Treasury-Postal tomorrow evening. If \nnot, that will begin hopefully about 9 o'clock on Saturday morning. And \nthere are two amendments there that may require some debate. Beyond \nthat, it should not take very long, according to the managers.\n  Following that, it would be our intention either to move to welfare \nor to the Work Opportunity Act, or the Interior Appropriations bill.\n  So somebody asked me, what about Saturday. We have been saying for \nthe last 2 weeks there will be votes on this Saturday and tomorrow. The \nday after tomorrow is Saturday, and there will be votes on Saturday, \nAugust 5.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk which \noriginally was designated as being cosponsored by Senator Nunn. That \nwas in error. Senator Nunn is not a cosponsor of the amendment that I \nsent to the desk, and so I would ask unanimous consent that his name be \nwithdrawn as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have requested that the entire amendment \nnot be read, but let me just point to the basic purpose behind the \namendment and some of the pertinent language.\n  Mr. President, we had extended debate during the course of the \nmorning and afternoon dealing with the ABM Treaty. Senator Levin spent, \nI believe, roughly 6 or 7 hours debating this issue. And I think it has \nbeen resolved on a close vote but nonetheless resolved.\n  I had intended and now do offer this amendment for the purpose of at \nleast clarifying what my intent was in supporting the legislation as it \nwas developed by the Armed Services Committee in the DOD authorization \nbill.\n  Basically, I believe it should be our policy to develop a defensive \ncapability against a limited or accidental launch of a nuclear weapon \nagainst the United States. I believe we have an absolute obligation to \nthe American people to say that in the event that anyone were so mad as \nto launch an ICBM toward the United States or one should be launched \naccidentally, we ought to have some minimum capability of destroying \nthat missile before it arrives on U.S. soil.\n  I find it really quite astonishing to think that we would represent \nto the American people that a missile somehow has been fired, whether \nby accident or by miscalculation or madness, it is on its way to New \nYork City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, you name the city or town, and \nwe have absolutely no way of stopping it. The best we can do is tell \nyou that we will try to minimize the casualties; we will try to \nevacuate as quickly as possible after catastrophic damage has been \ndone.\n  I think that is unacceptable to the American people given the fact \nthat we are now witnessing the proliferation of missile technology on a \nfairly pervasive basis. And so what this amendment does is to express \nthe sense of Congress on this matter.\n\n       Given the fundamental responsibility of the Government of \n     the United States to protect the security of the U.S., the \n     increasingly serious threat posed to the United States by the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ballistic \n     missile technology, and the effect this threat could have in \n     constraining the options of the United States to act in time \n     of crisis, it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the supreme interest of the United States to \n     defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile \n     attack, whatever its source;\n       (2) the deployment of a multiple-site ground-based national \n     missile defense system to protect against limited ballistic \n     missile attack can strengthen strategic stability and \n     deterrence;\n       (3) the policies, programs and requirements of subtitle C \n     of title II of this Act can be accomplished through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, what I am saying in this amendment is that whatever we \ndo, we can do it consistent with the treaty. I want to stay within the \nlimits of the treaty. The treaty allows us to seek to negotiate \nchanges.\n  Originally we had a multiple-site ABM Treaty, two sites. We \nrenegotiated it down to one site. With the changes of circumstances \nthroughout the world, what we are asking is that we encourage the \nPresident to go to the Russians to seek to renegotiate the ABM Treaty \nfor the purpose of allowing the Russians and the United States to have \na effective capability against limited ballistic missile threats.\n  And so in this amendment the President is urged ``to initiate \nnegotiations with the Russian Federation to amend the ABM Treaty as \nnecessary to provide for the national missile defense system as \nspecified in section 235'' to protect us from a limited ballistic \nattack.\n  And ``(5)''--and here is another key point--\n\n\n[[Page S 11305]]\n\n       If the negotiations fail, the President is urged to consult \n     with the Senate about the option of withdrawing the United \n     States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with provisions of \n     article XV of the treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, basically what this amendment says is, there is a \npotential threat that we ought to be facing and that we should seek to \nnegotiate amendments to the ABM Treaty. That is contemplated by the \ntreaty itself. So I am urging the President to seek to negotiate with \nthe Russians, and in the event he is unsuccessful in those negotiations \nto gain amendments allowing the deployment by each party of a limited \nsystem, that he then come back to the Senate and consult with the \nSenate about whether we should stay in the ABM Treaty as it originally \nstands now or whether we ought to opt out as the treaty allows us to \ndo.\n  So this is a sense of the Senate that we ought to proceed with this \nsystem, that we ought to encourage the President and urge him to go and \nmeet with the Russians and their negotiators to renegotiate the ABM \nTreaty to allow the deployment of a land-based system with multiple \nsites that would protect us against accidental launch or \nmiscalculation, certainly not against an all-out attack by the \nRussians, but a limited type attack, so we can have the capability to \ndefend ourselves.\n  We urge the President to do this, seek this. In the event he is \nunsuccessful, we ask that he turn to the Senate and at least consult \nwith us as to whether we should stay in the treaty or get out of the \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is a fair expression of the sentiment \nthat was expressed during the debates within the Armed Services \nCommittee. I believe it is a fair expression of the sentiment on this \nside of the aisle. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge all Members on both sides of the \naisle to read this, of course, because some people may disagree with \nit, parts of it, particularly on my side of the aisle.\n  I do not disagree with anything in the Cohen resolution. I think it \nis helpful in the sense that it points in the right direction for the \nPresident to negotiate changes rather than simply assert changes. And \nthat is clear in paragraph 4. I think also that it is the correct \nprocedure for the negotiations. If the negotiations fail with the \nRussians, the President is urged to consult with the Senate about the \noption of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty under provision of article XV \nof the treaty.\n  I agree with some of the findings. Some of the people on this side of \nthe aisle may not agree with the findings. I do. This is very close to \nwhat we had in the Missile Defense Act that Senator Warner and I \nsponsored 2 or 3 years ago in the Missile Defense Act.\n  What is the problem with it? There is no problem with it that would \nkeep me from voting for it, but it does not correct any of the things \nthat we pointed out as being what we considered --most of us on this \nside and a few on that side of the aisle--to be fatal flaws with the \nbill itself. What it does not do because it is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, it does not change any of the operative provisions in the \nunderlying bill. And the operative provisions have the force of law. So \nwe have got sense-of-the-Senate legislation that cannot by its very \nnature change the force of law.\n  So anyone who thinks there are problems in the underlying bill would \nnot be comforted by this. This does not cure the problem. That is the \nreason I have not cosponsored it, not because I am not going to vote \nfor it, not because it is not in the right direction, because it is. \nBut it does not change the operative provisions of the bill which \nestablish a number of legal restrictions on the President. This is, I \nbelieve, the first time I have seen provisions that restrict the \nPresident as to what he can negotiate. The underlying bill restricts \nthe President of the United States in terms of his ability to \nnegotiate.\n  Now, I believe that will be challenged by many as unconstitutional. I \ndo not try to make a judgment on it. But I imagine that those in the \nexecutive branch would assert it is unconstitutional on its face. \nWhether that is the case or not, in my view it is bad policy, because \nif the President of the United States cannot negotiate, who can? We do \nnot have a negotiating team from the U.S. Senate that I know of. We \nhave an arms control observer group, but we make it clear we never \nnegotiate; we simply discuss. So if the President cannot negotiate \nthese changes, even if they are changes that the majority wants, how do \nwe get changes in the treaty?\n  The Cohen amendment deals with one set of changes. And I think it \nappropriately says the President should negotiate the amendments to the \nABM Treaty as necessary to provide for the national missile defense \nsystem specified in section 235. So the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ndoes urge him to move in that direction.\n  The restrictions on negotiations of the President, however, do not \nrelate to that section; they relate to the section that we talked about \nat length earlier in the debate which gets to the demarcation point \nbetween theater ballistic missiles and strategic ballistic missiles. \nAnd the defense against strategic ballistic missiles is that restricted \nby the ABM Treaty. The provision on theater ballistic missiles is not. \nAnd that demarcation point is defined in the underlying bill as a \nmatter of law, and the President in the underlying bill is told that he \ncannot negotiate on that point. He cannot do anything on that point. \nAnd, therefore, I do not see how the Russians would ever accept that.\n  Now, maybe no one cares whether they accept it or not. But as I said \nearlier today, I do not think they have the option to go to defenses at \nthis stage because of their economic condition. What they do have the \noption to do, and what they have said repeatedly they will do. So \nunless you believe they will not do what they said they are going to \ndo, there is nothing in this amendment that changes the problem of the \nbill. And that is, it encourages, in fact it makes it clear to the \nRussians that we are going to move forward notwithstanding any concerns \nthey may have on the ABM Treaty and that we will not comply with ABM \nTreaty in certain respects. And if they want to take action, then they \nwill take action.\n  What action will they take? In my opinion they will simply not ratify \nSTART II. They will not, in my view, continue to draw down their \nmissile forces under START I.\n  So, inadvertently, in the name of defending the United States and the \npeople in the United States, the underlying bill, in my view, almost, \nnot quite, because you cannot ever predict with certainty a foreign \ncountry's behavior, but it almost assures that the United States will \nend up with thousands of more missiles pointed at this country than we \nwould otherwise have. I do not see how that improves our defense.\n  We are basically saying we want to move forward in 10 years to defend \nagainst threats that may be here in 10 years, that are not here now. \nBut the threat that is here now, that is, the SS-18's the SS-24's that \nare pointed at us now that we want to take down, and the two Republican \npresidents have negotiated successfully to get the Russians to take \ndown, we do not worry about that threat. It is now being dismantled. We \nput provisions in here that are likely to require or at least to \nencourage the Russians to keep those missiles pointed at us. I do not \nsee how I can go home and tell my people that I voted for an underlying \nprovision in a bill that is likely to keep thousands of missiles that \nwe have described as the foremost threat that is aimed at the United \nStates that we spent 15 to 20 years trying to figure out how to either \nnegate through a deterrence policy, through a policy of negotiations, \none way or the other, either through defenses or negotiation that we \nfinally had two Republican Presidents, President Reagan and President \nBush, successfully concluded the negotiations--one of them is now being \nimplemented, START I, the other is pending in the Russian Duma and in \nthe Senate.\n  So we are going to put a provision in here that says to the Russians, \n``We are going to go ahead anyway. And we are going to disregard the \nABM Treaty. But you do what you choose.'' I think what they are going \nto choose to do is keep those missiles pointed at us. Now maybe 10 \nyears from now we will be able to defend against them. 2003 is the \ndate. But understand, we are only talking about a thin defense, a thin \ndefense against a few missiles and a Third \n\n[[Page S 11306]]\nWorld country\n or an unauthorized launch or terrorist group that gets ahold of a \nballistic missile or cruise missile. I want a defense against those. I \nam in favor of defense. I am in favor of amending the ABM Treaty, but I \nthink we ought to do it through the procedure of international law and \nthe procedure of American law, because a treaty is American law, and we \nare the ones who signed up for the ABM Treaty. It is our law now. It is \nthe law of the land.\n\n  A treaty is the law of the land. We are saying disregard it in the \nunderlying bill. I do not understand the logic, Mr. President. I cannot \nunderstand the logic of taking a step in the name of defending the \npeople of America that is likely to end up having thousands of warheads \npointed toward us while we spend 10 years and billions of dollars to \nfigure out how to defend against a threat that is not yet here. I do \nnot understand that logic.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the Cohen amendment. It does not cure \nthe underlying defects in the bill. I will have another amendment, in \nall likelihood. It depends on whether I have a chance to get it \nadopted. If I do not, then I will simply leave the bill as it is now \nand people can make their choice. But if I do have a chance to have it \nadopted, I will have an amendment that sets forth very clearly what our \npolicy is. Succinctly what that would be is a policy, first of all, of \ncoming forth with a defensive system in this country that protects \nagainst unauthorized launches, that protects against accidental \nlaunches, that protects against a third country defense, but that does \nso in compliance with the ABM Treaty.\n  Second, we ask the President to try to amend the ABM Treaty with \namendments that would allow us to deploy that kind of system.\n  Third, if he fails to be able to amend it with the Russians--that is, \nif the Russians refuse--that we then consider our option of terminating \nour ABM obligations in accordance with article XV of the treaty itself, \nwhich says we can give 6 months' notice and terminate those \nobligations.\n  Mr. President, to me, that is a sensible policy. In the meantime, we \nshould not tie the hands of the President of the United States to \nnegotiate. We ought to insist that anything that has the nature of a \ntreaty come before us for approval. We should not let treaties be \namended by the executive branch, but we should not prevent the \nPresident from negotiating. We should not prevent him from negotiating \na demarcation point.\n  I happen to agree with the demarcation point in the bill. I think it \nis perfectly reasonable. I do not mind putting it as a matter of \nfindings. I do not mind saying this is the policy of the demarcation \npoint. But I do not want the President to be prevented from saying to \nthe Russians, ``This is what the Congress thinks and I would like for \nyou to sign up to this.'' We preclude him from even doing that. He \ncannot negotiate anything.\n  I do not believe that provision will stand, because I do not think it \nwill become law. But if it does become law, I think it probably will be \nchallenged on constitutional grounds. Nevertheless, that is where we \nare.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree with the findings in the Cohen \namendment, to vote for it, because I think the provisions make sense. I \nthink they are a step in the right direction, but it does not cure what \nI consider to be fatal flaws of the underlying provisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Cohen has 12 minutes; Senator Thurmond \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in addition to the fact this amendment \nhighlights the flaws in the underlying legislation because of what it \ndoes not address, it still leaves the President's hands tied. He cannot \nnegotiate. It still commits us to deploy a system which is in violation \nof the ABM Treaty. That all remains. But in addition to actually \nhighlighting the flaws of the underlying bill and not curing it, this \nresolution raises two questions, in my mind.\n  First, it says that the President is urged to initiate negotiations \nwith the Russian Federation to amend the ABM Treaty. The underlying \nbill also has sense-of-the-Senate language which is exactly the \nopposite, which says the President should cease all efforts to modify \nU.S. obligations under the ABM Treaty.\n  The Cohen language says initiate it, presumably as soon as you can. \nIn section 4, the President is urged to initiate negotiations to amend \nthe treaty. The bill, which is left untouched, has sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage which says cease all efforts until the Senate has completed \nits review process. It is just totally inconsistent with the underlying \nlanguage. That is No. 1. But No. 2 is a question to my good friend from \nMaine.\n  When the resolution says that it is in the supreme interest of the \nUnited States to defend itself from the threat, if one votes for this \nresolution, does one thereby commit himself or herself to withdrawing \nfrom the ABM Treaty under the supreme interest provision in the ABM \nTreaty? In other words, would this vote be looked back at as a \nstatement on the part of people voting for your resolution that, in \nfact, we should withdraw from the ABM Treaty because of a supreme \nnational interest?\n  Mr. COHEN. The answer to my friend is no. What the language of my \namendment says is the President should, in fact, initiate negotiations. \nI believe we should seek to negotiate a provision to the ABM Treaty to \nallow for the construction and deployment of a multisite limited \nsystem. And you will see the second part of that is, if the President \nis unsuccessful, he is to return and consult with the Senate to see \nwhether we should stay in the treaty or get out of the treaty under \narticle XV.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The language urging the President to negotiate in one part \nin your resolution, and the underlying bill says cease and desist all \nnegotiations as to modify the treaty, do you view those as \ninconsistent?\n  Mr. COHEN. I believe there is an appearance of an inconsistency that \ncame about as a result of an attempt by the majority to prevent the \nPresident negotiating to apply the ABM Treaty to the theater missile \ndefense system. That is where that confusion came about.\n  I believe it is in our interest to urge negotiation on the part of \nthe President to seek to revise the ABM Treaty in order to allow for \ndeployment of a multiple site system here in this country and in \nRussia.\n  I might point out that I disagree with the statement of my friend \nfrom Georgia----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Levin's time has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield myself 1 minute. That with respect to section 238, \nI do not believe you can point to that language as preventing the \nPresident from negotiating. It simply says that the appropriated funds \nmay not be obligated or expended by any official of the Federal \nGovernment for the purpose of prescribing, enforcing, or implementing. \nIt does not prevent him from negotiating, but he could not implement \nany changes that would apply the ABM Treaty to theater missile \ndefenses. The difference, he could not negotiate, he could not \nimplement under the language of section 238.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield, because there is a \nsubsection (B) that says take any other action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COHEN. At the direction of the majority leader, I yield back my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think after this vote, I talked to the \nmanagers and what they would like to do, and I say this to all my \ncolleagues, is to stay here. There are probably 25, 35 amendments that \ncan be accepted, some on each side of the aisle. They are willing to \nstay here, and that will take a big amount of the amendments that are \npending.\n  We now changed our list and, hopefully, before we go out tonight or \ntomorrow morning, we will have an agreement these will be the only \namendments in order. That will at least give us a finite list. It is \npretty long. We have 190-some amendments and everybody wants 2 hours. \nSo I do not think we can make that by tomorrow night, the way I look at \nit. But you have to be optimistic around here. I \n\n[[Page S 11307]]\nknow Senator Thurmond is, he is going to finish it by 6 tomorrow night, \nor earlier, more or less.\n  This will be the last vote tonight, but I say to my colleagues on \nboth sides, the managers are here, the staffs are here. A lot of the \namendments have great merit and are going to be accepted. This is an \nopportunity to have your amendment accepted. Then the managers will \ndetermine what time we start tomorrow morning and whether we start on \nthe agreement we have or some other amendment. That will be up to the \nmanagers.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Cohen has 8 minutes, and Senator Nunn \nhas 1 minute.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen].\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond, together with the ranking member, were anxious to accept a \nnumber of amendments which have been cleared on both sides. I \nanticipate we will undertake to do that in just a matter of a minute or \ntwo.\n  Mr. President, if I could draw the attention of my distinguished \ncolleague to an amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] \nwhich I believe has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator from Virginia is correct. That amendment has \nbeen cleared. If you will give us just one minute, we want to make sure \nwe have the right amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2095\n\n    (Purpose: To improve the section establishing uniform national \ndischarge standards for the control of water pollution from vessels of \n                           the Armed Forces)\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nThurmond, I send to the desk an amendment which is submitted by the \nSenator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Chafee, for \n     himself, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 2095.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the clerk note that I am acting on \nbehalf of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond, \nand all amendments will be sent to the desk in Mr. Thurmond's name.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this bill includes an amendment to the \nClean Water Act based on a 5-year effort by the Navy to develop \nenvironmental standards that would apply to the non-sewage discharges \nfrom its ships. The Navy has a goal of building and operating \nenvironmentally sound ships and this amendment to the Clean Water Act \nwill help them reach that goal.\n  The Clean Water Act amendment in his bill was developed by the Navy \nand sent to the Senate by the administration in early June. In addition \nto consideration by the Armed Services Committee, this proposal was \nalso reviewed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works which \nhas jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act. As chairman of that \ncommittee, I sought comment on this administration proposal from \nmembers of the committee, the coastal States, the Coast Guard, EPA and \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and from other \norganizations with an interest in coastal pollution problems.\n  There was general support for this approach. It is seen as a net \nenvironmental improvement, because it provides for treatment of \ndischarges from vessels that are not controlled today.\n  Some concerns were expressed by the States. They wanted to be \nconsulted before the rules are issued. They wanted to be sure that \ntreatment systems used to control these discharges are the most \neffective, consistent with the mission of the Navy. And they wanted \nassurance that current environmental requirements like section 311 \ndealing with oil spills would not be overridden.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee developed a set of \namendments to the administration proposal to address those concerns. \nThe committee then reported an original bill, S. 1033, on July 13. The \namendment that Senator Warner and I are offering to the DOD \nauthorization bill today is the text of the bill reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The committee also filed a \nreport on S. 1033 which explains the provisions of our amendment and is \nto be looked to for legislative history on this amendment.\n  We have agreed to move this amendment to the Clean Water Act on the \nDOD authorization bill to facilitate the Navy's efforts to develop \nenvironmentally sound ships. The Navy has taken the lead in this area \nand they should be rewarded for their initiative with speedy enactment \nof this proposal.\n  With that said, let me address the substance of this amendment for a \nmoment.\n  Even though vessels are considered point sources of pollution under \nthe Clean Water Act, EPA regulations have exempted many discharges from \nthe permit requirements of the act. Currently, sewage discharges are \nregulated under section 312 of the Clean Water Act. It requires that \neach vessel be equipped with a marine sanitation device to treat sewage \nbefore it is discharged.\n  But many of the other wastewaters like graywater from showers and \nsinks, bilge water from the hold of the ship, wastewater from the \nboiler or water from cleaning the deck or equipment are not regulated \nunder the Clean Water Act. Some coastal States have taken an interest \nin these discharges, but there is no comprehensive Federal program.\n  The amendment we are offering requires the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Administrator of EPA to act jointly to \n\n[[Page S 11308]]\nidentify the non-sewage discharges from ships that need attention.\n  For each discharge that has a significant adverse impact, EPA and DOD \nwould identify an appropriation pollution control technology or \nmanagement practice to reduce the pollution.\n  These standards would only apply to ships of the Armed Forces and the \nCoast Guard.\n  Once the Federal regulations are in place, the States would be \npreempted. A State could not impose its own, inconsistent, regulations. \nBut if a State identified a particularly sensitive coastal or marine \narea, it could establish a so-called ``no-discharge zone'' where all \ndischarges of a particular type would be banned.\n  Mr. President, the Navy is to be congratulated for this effort. It \nwill improve water quality in our estuaries and ocean waters. I am \npleased that the Senate has moved this legislation quickly to assist \nthe Navy in its efforts.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on this side \nof the aisle. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate now to call for \nthe vote.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2095) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to table is \nagreed to.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2096\n\n (Purpose: To make funds available for the Troops to Teachers program \n                    and the Troops to Cops program)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I inquire of my friend from Virginia. We \nhave two amendments I would like to present. I believe they have been \ncleared, but I want to check with my friend before I send them to the \ndesk, by Senator Pryor and Senator Feinstein.\n  The two amendments coupled together are the ``Troops to Teachers'' \nand the ``Troops to Cops'' program. The amendments provide $42 million \nfor the ``Troops to Teachers'' program, offset from excess military \npersonnel funds, and provides $10 million for the ``Troops to Cops'' \nprogram, offset from the same source. Mr. President, ``Troops to \nTeachers'' was created by the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1993 as part of the Transition Assistance Program, designed \nto help service members affected by downsizing.\n  Troops to Cops was added to the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1994. Individuals can receive a $5,000 stipend to \nassist in obtaining the necessary training and certification.\n  In addition, if a service member is part of an early 15-year \nretirement, the individual will receive time or credit for up to 5 \nyears if he or she completes 5 years of teaching or law enforcement \nassignment.\n  That was an amendment that I proposed that became law, and I think it \nis working very well.\n  The school systems or law enforcement agencies that hire a \nparticipant receives funds to assist in paying the salary ranging from \nup to $25,000 for an individual's first year down to $2,500 for an \nindividual's fifth year.\n  There is a win-win program benefiting separating service members, \nhelping them get employment, and helping our Nation. Frankly, we will \nnever have this reservoir of talented people coming out into the job \nmarket from the military in this number of people in any period in the \nfuture that I can envision at this point because this is part of the \ndrawdown in our military. We have literally tens of thousands of people \nin the military that are extremely well qualified in math and science \nand languages, and encouraging them and facilitating them going into \nteaching and going into law enforcement at the local level and helping \nthe States and local governments, to me, is not only helping the State \nand local government but helping the military and strengthening our \nNation.\n  So these amendments provide for prudent steps.\n  Troops to Teachers receives $65 million in fiscal year 1995. This \namendment calls for $42 million, which is a reduced program. The \ndrawdown is being reduced.\n  These will not be permanent programs. After you get through the \ndrawdown and you level off the military personnel, then you would not, \nin all likelihood, have these programs.\n  The Troops to Cops program receives $15 million in fiscal year 1995. \nThis amendment calls for $10 million, which is a substantial reduction.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Pryor for \n     himself, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2096.\n       On page 137, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 389. FUNDING FOR TROOPS TO TEACHERS PROGRAM AND TROOPS \n                   TO COPS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Funding.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under section 431--\n       (1) $42,000,000 shall be available for the Troops-to-\n     Teachers program; and\n       (2) $10,000,000 shall be available for the Troop-to-Cops \n     program.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Troops-to-Cops program'' means the program \n     of assistance to separated members and former members of the \n     Armed Forces to obtain employment with law enforcement \n     agencies established, or carried out, under section 1152 of \n     title 10, United States Code.\n       (2) The term ``Troops-to-Teachers program'' means the \n     program of assistance to separated members of the Armed \n     Forces to obtain certification and employment as teachers or \n     employment as teachers' aides established under section 1151 \n     of such title.\n\n\n                           troops to teachers\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \ncontinue funding for the Troops to Teachers Program in the Department \nof Defense.\n  Troops to Teachers is a Department of Defense Transition Program \ndesigned to assist separated military service members and other former \nDOD employees to become certified and obtain employment as teachers or \nteacher's aides. Congress established this program in 1992, and it has \nalways enjoyed strong bipartisan support.\n  Troops to Teachers provides up to $5,000 stipends to selected \nparticipants to help them become certified to teach, and grants of up \nto $50,000, paid over 5 years, to local education agencies for each \nformer military service member they agree to hire.\n  Troops to Teachers is helping former service members find productive, \nmeaningful employment after leaving the military. By tapping the skills \nand experience these individuals possess, Troops to Teachers is \nimproving the quality of our public school education nationwide. And by \nplacing special emphasis on schools with a high concentration of \nstudents from low income families, this program provides teachers in \nareas where educators are in short supply.\n  In the Department of Defense, the response to this program has been \noutstanding. Over 500 Troops to Teachers have recently been hired by \nschool districts in 39 States. In addition, over 1,000 individuals \nscattered across 46 States are using this program to become certified \nto teach. Most importantly, there are over 9,000 applicants currently \npreparing to enter this program.\n  These 9,000 former DOD personnel awaiting acceptance to this program \nare counting on these funds to begin a new life after the military. \nThey are counting on our support.\n  I mentioned earlier that Troops to Teachers has always enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. In 1992, I was asked by former Senate majority \nleader George Mitchell to chair a task force on defense transition. The \ncenterpiece of our task force report was a recommendation for Congress \nto help former military personnel get training, certification, and job \nplacement required for employment in critical public service jobs, such \nas education, law enforcement, and medical services. The legislation \nthat resulted from this recommendation created the Troops to Teachers \nand Troops to Cops Programs.\n  That same year, a Republican task force convened and made an \nidentical recommendation supporting the creation of Troops to Teachers. \nThe 1992 report of the Senate Republican task force on adjusting the \ndefense base stated,\n\n\n[[Page S 11309]]\n\n       The Task Force recommends that Congress adopt legislation \n     to\n      encourage states to adopt alternative teacher certification \n     programs for separated and retiring servicemen. Not only \n     will this enable some former military personnel to put \n     their talents to productive use in public service, it will \n     help address the teacher shortage found in some \n     particularly urban, areas.\n\n  This report goes on to say, ``The Task Force supports an expansion of \nthe DOD program to pay for coursework of departing servicemen which \nmeets reasonable state certification requirements.'' Finally, the \nRepublican task force report concludes, ``The  cost  of  programs  \ndirectly responding  to  problems  resulting from \nthe declining defense budget . . . should be paid for out of the \ndefense budget.''\n  Mr. President, the Troops to Teachers program was designed by \nCongress, in a bipartisan fashion, in response to the needs of \nseparating military personnel. But the primary responsibility of Troops \nto Teachers is taking care of the men and women who are leaving the \nmilitary after years of dedicated service to our country. These \nindividuals should not be penalized because they desire to work in a \nclassroom instead of in a shipyard building submarines.\n  Perhaps the best reason for continuing funding for this program is \nthat it is a tremendous success. Just listen to what a few of its \nparticipants have said about their experiences.\n  Take Ed Coet for example. Ed is 45 years old. He recently retired \nfrom the Army after last serving as a military intelligence officer in \nthe gulf war. Now Ed teaches a class of 10 emotionally disturbed \nfourth-grade boys at Brookhaven Intermediate School in Killeen, TX. Ed \nrecently said, ``My work as a teacher is every bit as challenging and \nimportant as anything I did in the Army. In the past, it was what I was \ndoing for my country. Now all my kids are an extension of me. If they \nsucceed, I succeed.''\n  And then there is Arthur Moore, a retired Army staff sergeant from \nBaltimore, MD. Arthur is currently teaching fifth grade at Samuel \nColeridge-Taylor Elementary School. About his experience Arthur said, \n``Every day I have to prove to them I really care, not just about \nteaching but about them.''\n  And listen to what the school districts across America are saying \nabout Troops to Teachers.\n  The Jackson County Public School System in North Carolina said, ``Our \nteachers have exceeded all expectations. We are very pleased.''\n  Beaufort County School District in South Carolina says, ``An \noutstanding program--all of our participants are excellent.''\n  Isaac School District No. 5 in Arizona says, ``we are very fortunate \nto have an experienced, dedicated Troops to Teachers participant who \nbilingual.\n  The military training and experience have assisted this individual in \nmaking the transition to teaching.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what this program is all about--\nhelping military personnel make the transition into a productive life \nin public service. These individuals are the centerpiece of the \nprogram.\n  Eliminating funding for Troops to Teachers would mean turning our \nbacks on the military service members who served their country on the \nbattlefield, and who now want to continue their service in the \nclassroom. This program truly deserves our full support.\n                             troops to cops\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas which provides $10 \nmillion for the Troops-to-Cops Program and $42 million for the Troops-\nto-Teachers Program. I am happy to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant amendment.\n  Senator Pryor has discussed the Troops-to-Teachers Program, and I \nwould like to focus on the Troops-to-Cops Program.\n  The program--administered by the Justice Department in coordination \nwith the Department of Defense--provides $5,000 per officer for \ntraining to local police and sheriffs departments to hire former \nmilitary personnel as law enforcement officers. This funding can be \nused to support the following: tuition at a police training academy; \ncosts of local ``compliance'' training if the veteran attended an out-\nof-state police academy; the costs of specialized training in community \npolicing.\n  Local law enforcement agencies can use Troops to Cops funds to pay \nfor training of eligible recently separated military personnel.\n  Troops to Cops was initially authorized in the 1994 DOD authorization \nbill. Last year, the Appropriations Committee provided $15 million for \nthis program. The fiscal year 1995 funding will provide training \nassistance for 3,000 former military personnel who elect to become law \nenforcement officers. I am proposing to provide $10 million more in \nfiscal year 1996 to provide training for 2,000 more.\n  For an investment of $25 million over 2 years, Congress has an \nopportunity to help provide good jobs for our former military personnel \nand make our streets safer. In my view, few Government programs offer \nsuch a win-win scenario as this program does. Troops to Cops fills two \nimportant needs: It helps our communities recruit quality law \nenforcement officers; At the same time it utilizes the tremendous \nwealth of skilled military personnel who are transitioning to new jobs \nas a result of defense downsizing.\n  Troops to Cops is a transitional benefit for troops affected by \ndownsizing. In fiscal year 1994 alone, 291,000 troops were separated \nfrom the armed forces.\n  The Department of Justice is in the process of administering this \nprogram as a part of the overall COPS Program. Applications for the \nfunds are due on August 15, 1995, and the COPS office anticipates \nmaking its awards by the end of September. The delay in implementation \nof this program is due to the emphasis on actually getting the crime \nbill's funding for officers to the police and sheriff's departments. \nTroops to Cops is follow-on funding to help make the program work.\n  The Department of Justice is expecting applications for htis program \nto far exceed the ability they have to provide funding. And, the \nDepartment of Defense expects the demand among military personnel to \nfar exceed the funding that is currently available for Troops to Cops.\n  According to the Defense Department's Office of Transition Support \nand Services, one of the most asked about post-military careers at DOD \njob fairs is law enforcement. Many veterans want to work in law \nenforcment, and police and sheriffs departments are often eager to hire \nthem.\n  The $52 million authorized by this amendment en toto is fully offset. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, section 431 of the bill \ncontains $52 million more than is needed to implement the military \npersonnel programs of the Department of Defense. So, this amendment \ndoes not increase spending over the original Armed Services Committee \nproposal.\n  The Troops-to-Cops Program is supported by a variety of cities, \npolice departments and veterans organizations, including: National \nSheriffs' Association; city of Long Beach, CA; Los Angeles County \nProfessional Peace Officers Association; city of Virginia Beach, VA; \ncity of Los Angeles; city and county of Denver, CO; city of Miami, FL; \nNon-Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S.; Los Angeles Police \nProtective League; and The American Legion.\n  Troops to Cops is a win-win program for defense conversion and law \nenforcement. We can give something back to our military personnel who \nserved their country, as well as to our communities across the country \nto make their streets safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which would authorized \n$10 million to continue the work of the Troops-to-Cops program.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this amendment to \nsupport authorizing the Troops-to-Teachers Program. This program is a \nvital transition benefit for service members leaving the military \nbecause of downsizing. In 1993, the Congress authorized this innovative \nprogram which benefits both departing service members and school \nsystems across our country which are having difficulty attracting \nquality teachers.\n  Troops-to-Teachers has two parts. First, it provides financial \nassistance to service members to help them get the certification \nnecessary to work as a teacher or teacher's aide. Second, it provides \nfunds over a 5-year time frame to school systems that hire program \ngraduates to defray the individual's \n\n[[Page S 11310]]\nsalary costs in decreasing increments. This allows the school system \nthe time to find the means of paying for that teacher's salary.\n  The statistics back up the value of the Troops-to-Teachers Program. \nOver 8,000 individuals have applied to the program; Over 800 \nindividuals are currently undergoing certification training in 45 \nstates; Over 300 individuals have been hired so far in 35 States; 150 \nschool districts nationwide are employing participants in this program.\n  Clearly this program is a winner for all involved, both the men and \nwomen who have served their country and our children who are going to \nbenefit from not just their teaching abilities, but their service as \nrole models. I strongly support efforts to make sure that this program \ncontinues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment. \nIt is acceptable.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pryor is the prime author of the ``Troops to \nTeachers'' amendment, and Senator Feinstein is the prime author of the \n``Troops to Cops'' part of this amendment.\n  They have both worked diligently in this entire area, and in the \ntransition of our military personnel, which has been a very large \nsuccess.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The amendment (No. 2096) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2097\n\n(Purpose: To ensure the preservation of the ammunition industrial base \n                         of the United States)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished majority \nleader, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Dole, I offer an amendment which \npertains to ammunition procurement and management. I send the amendment \nto the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), for Mr. Dole, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2097.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 314, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 823. PRESERVATION OF AMMUNITION INDUSTRIAL BASE.\n\n       (A) Review of Ammunition Procurement and Management \n     Programs.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     commence a review of the ammunition procurement and \n     management programs of the Department of Defense, including \n     the planning for, budgeting for, administration, and carrying \n     out of such programs.\n       (2) The review under paragraph (1) shall include an \n     assessment of the following matters:\n       (A) The practicability and desirability of using \n     centralized procurement practices to procure all ammunition \n     required by the Armed Forces.\n       (B) The capability of the ammunition production facilities \n     of the United States to meet the ammunition requirements of \n     the Armed Forces.\n       (C) The practicability and desirability of privatizing such \n     ammunition production facilities.\n       (D) The practicability and desirability of using integrated \n     budget planning among the Armed Forces for the procurement of \n     ammunition.\n       (E) The practicability and desirability of establishing an \n     advocate within the Department of Defense for ammunition \n     industrial base matters who shall be responsible for--\n       (i) establishing the quantity and price of ammunition \n     procured by the Armed Forces; and\n       (ii) establishing and implementing policy to ensure the \n     continuing viability of the ammunition industrial base in the \n     United States.\n                       munitions industrial base\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the amendment I propose today requires the \nSecretary of Defense to initiate a review of the ammunition procurement \nand management programs of the Department of Defense.\n  The munitions industrial base has undergone dramatic reductions in \nthe years following the Vietnam war. Built principally during World War \nII, the base consisted of a large number of expansive, government-owned \nmanufacturing plants combined with hundreds of private sector major \ncomponent and end-item manufacturing plants, and thousands of second \nand third tier subcontractor facilities, all designed to produce large \nvolumes of munitions to fight another worldwide conflict. The end of \nthe cold war triggered a comprehensive reassessment and restructuring \nof the national security strategy. Concurrently, the ammunition \nrequirements of the Armed Forces were precipitously reduced and the \nproduction of ammunition declined to the lowest level since before the \nVietnam war. This reduced business for the industrial base has \ndecimated what was once a versatile, robust, and energetic industry. Of \nthe 286 major munitions companies which existed in 1978 only 52 are \nprojected to be in business by the end of 1995, an 82 percent \nreduction. At the same time the Government production base has shrunk \nby over 40 percent from 32 to 19 facilities. Only 9 of those remaining \n19 plants are being actively workloaded with production.\n  In light of these enormous changes, it is appropriate to review how \nthe Department of Defense plans, budgets, conducts, and manages \nammunition procurement and production. My amendment directs the \nSecretary to initiate such a review, aimed at restructuring the entire \nmunitions infrastructure with three objectives in mind: Elimination of \nmanagement/review layering in the planning, budgeting, and execution of \nammunition programs; fixing the accountability for decisions; and \nreduction or elimination of Government ownership of production \nequipment and facilities, while preserving a robust and responsive \nammunition production industrial base.\n  Summed up, the overall objective of the study is to recommend those \nchanges which will reduce the cost to the U.S. Government of providing \nmunitions to our Armed Forces both in peace and during war while making \nthe industrial base more responsive to our war fighters' needs.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on this \nside. I urge the Senate to approve the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Kansas.\n  The amendment (No. 2097) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2098\n\n (Purpose: To modify the authority to transfer funds regarding foreign \n     currency fluctuations so that the authority does not apply to \n        appropriations for fiscal years before fiscal year 1996)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, I offer an amendment to modify \nsection 1006, which is transfer authority regarding funds available for \nforeign currency fluctuations and eliminate the direct spending costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2098.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 328, line 19, strike out ``1994'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``1995''.\n       On page 329, line 18, strike out ``1993'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``1995''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment modifies section 1106, \ntransfer authority regarding funds available for foreign currency \nfluctuations to eliminate the direct spending costs. When the committee \nadopted this provision during our markup, we \n\n[[Page S 11311]]\ndid so based on a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office \nwhich made this provision affordable. Later, after the bill was \napproved by the committee, CBO revised the cost estimate upward. The \nrevised estimate is that this provision will cost $30 million in direct \nspending in fiscal year 1996.\n  The amendment modifies the provision to make the authority effective \nin fiscal year 1996, eliminating the ability to use prior year funds.\n  I understand this amendment is agreed to on both sides.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Virginia if he would go \nto the next amendment and set this one aside very briefly.\n  We need to do a little more checking on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that the minority is willing \nto return to the Thurmond amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the Chair to ask the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \n2098.\n  The amendment (No. 2098) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2099\n\n(Purpose: To provide a substitute for section 543, relating to military \n intelligence personnel prevented by secrecy from being considered for \n                         decorations and award)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have an amendment by Senator Akaka. I send \nthe amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Akaka, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2099.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 204, strike out line 8 and all that \n     follows through page 206, line 4, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 543. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL PREVENTED BY \n                   SECRECY FROM BEING CONSIDERED FOR DECORATIONS \n                   AND AWARDS.\n\n       (a) Waiver on Restrictions of Awards.--(1) Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the President, the Secretary of \n     Defense, or the Secretary of the military department \n     concerned may award a decoration to any person for an act, \n     achievement, or service that the person performed in carrying \n     out military intelligence duties during the period January 1, \n     1940, through December 31, 1990.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) applies to any decoration (including any \n     device in lieu of a decoration) that, during or after the \n     period described in paragraph (1) and before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, was authorized by law or under the \n     regulations of the Department of Defense or the military \n     department concerned to be awarded to a person for an act, \n     achievement, or service performed by that person while \n     serving on active duty.\n       (b) Review of Award Recommendations.--(1) The Secretary of \n     each military department shall review all recommendations for \n     awards of decorations for acts, achievements, or service \n     described in subsection (a)(1) that have been received by the \n     Secretary during the period of the review.\n       (2) The Secretary shall begin the review within 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall \n     complete the review within one year after such date.\n       (3) The Secretary may use the same process for carrying out \n     the review as the Secretary uses for reviewing other \n     recommendations for awarding decorations to members of the \n     armed force or armed forces under the Secretary's \n     jurisdiction for acts, achievements, or service.\n       (4) The Secretary may reject a recommendation if the \n     Secretary determines that there is a justifiable basis for \n     concluding that the recommendation is specious.\n       (5) The Secretary shall take reasonable actions to \n     publicize widely the opportunity to recommend awards of \n     decorations under this section.\n       (6)(A) Upon completing the review, the Secretary shall \n     submit a report on the review to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (B) The report shall contain the following information on \n     each recommendation for an award reviewed:\n       (i) A summary of the recommendation.\n       (ii) The findings resulting from the review.\n       (iii) The final action taken on the recommendation.\n       (iv) Administrative or legislative recommendations to \n     improve award procedures with respect to military \n     intelligence personnel.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``active duty'' \n     has the meaning given such term in section 101(d)(1) of title \n     10, United States Code.\n                 military intelligence personnel awards\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that would \nimprove section 543 of the pending measure, which concerns awards and \ndecorations for military intelligence personnel.\n  As my colleagues are aware, recommendations for the Medal of Honor, \nDistinguished Service Cross, and other awards must be submitted and \nacted upon within a certain time frame. For example, for the Army and \nAir Force, the Medal of Honor must be recommended within 2 years of an \nact, and awarded within 3; for the Navy, the applicable dates are 3 \nyears and 5 years, respectively. These limits were imposed by Congress \nto ensure that an award, and particularly the Medal of Honor, would be \nbased on the most contemporaneous, and thus accurate, documentation.\n  While these time limits may be appropriate in the vast majority of \ncases, they are not always appropriate in the case of military \nintelligence personnel who, because of the secrecy of their missions, \ncould not be considered for the Medal of Honor or other awards within \nthe 3 or 5 year statutory period. The U.S. Army Intelligence Center, \nwhich administers the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame, cites a \nnumber of individuals who are members of the Hall who are in precisely \nthis situation.\n  One example is the legendary COL Car Eifler, who performed \nextraordinary service during World War II, notably as the leader of the \nfamous Detachment 101 of the Office of Strategic Services in Burma. \nUnder his command, the secret commando unit operated behind enemy \nlines, harassing Japanese troops and organizing and training Burmese \nnatives in espionage and sabotage.\n  During the course of the war, Detachment 101 cleared the enemy from a \n10,000 square mile area, sabotaged the Japanese railway system, and \ngathered important intelligence about enemy activities and \ncapabilities. COL Eifler displayed extraordinary personal courage on \nnumerous occasions, including one instance in which he commanded a \nsmall, unarmed vessel through 450 miles of Japanese controlled waters \nto rescue 10 crewmembers of a downed B-24 bomber in the Bay of Bengal.\n  While COL Eifler received several citations, the covert conditions \nunder which he operated prevented his being nominated for the \nCongressional Medal of Honor or the Distinguished Service Cross, either \nof which he clearly merits.\n  Another example is LTC Richard Sakakida, who served as an Army \nundercover agent in the Philippines during the Second World War. LTC \nSakakida was captured by the Japanese shortly after the fall of \nCorregidor and subjected to excruciating torture; incredibly, he \nsteadfastly refused to divulge his mission as an American intelligence \nagent. Later, after gaining the confidence of his captors, he \nestablished a spy network within Japanese Army headquarters and was \nable to send important combat intelligence to the Allies through \nFilipino guerrillas whom he had recruited as couriers. Some of this \ninformation may have led to the destruction of a major Japanese naval \ntask force preparing to invade Australia.\n  During this period, he also engineered the escape of hundreds of \nFilipino guerrillas from prison, yet he himself remained behind in \norder to continue his intelligence activities. Today, because his \nmission was undertaken in complete secrecy,\n and because his direct superiors died or were killed during the war, \nhe was never considered for an award for valor. Yet, now that his full \nstory has become known, he is ineligible for awards such as the Medal \nof Honor or DSC because of the statutory deadlines that apply to such \nawards.\n\n  Mr. President, these are but two examples of military intelligence \noperatives whose courageous deeds have never been fully acknowledged. \nThe U.S. Army Intelligence Center has \n\n[[Page S 11312]]\nidentified other deserving individuals who were overlooked because of \nsecrecy. Undoubtedly there are others, less well known, who have never \nbeen recognized for their intelligence-related accomplishments.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. President, I had the pleasure of working with \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee on an initiative to assist \ndeserving individuals such as COL Eifler and LTC Sakakida. Due largely \nto the efforts of my friend and colleague, Senator Coats, the chairman \nof the Personnel Subcommittee, the committee approved a provision in \nthe pending measure, section 543, that attempts to address this issue.\n  In brief, section 543 expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nmilitary services should conduct a 1-year review of the records of \nmilitary intelligence personnel to determine if they were prevented by \nthe secrecy of their missions from being appropriately considered for \nthe Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, and other awards. \nBased on the review, section 543 authorizes the services to approve \nawards for deserving individuals notwithstanding the statutory time \nlimitations governing such awards.\n  However, since the provision was reported from committee, a number of \ntechnical shortcomings have been pointed out to me by the military \nservices as well as by military intelligence veterans organizations. I \nhave assembled their suggestions for improving section 543 in the \npending amendment. My amendment does several things:\n  First, it would require, rather than urge, the services to undertake \nthe proposed review. Making the review mandatory is important because \nmany of the affected individuals are veterans of World War II or Korea \nwho are in their 60's, 70's, and 80's and not in the best of health. \nMandating that the review be undertaken and completed by a date certain \nrather than leaving it to the military's discretion, would ensure that \nthe cases of these older veterans will be considered before age takes \nits toll.\n  Second, rather than requiring the military services to review the \nrecords of all military intelligence personnel, which would involve \nexamining potentially millions of documents and files--a monumental, \nperhaps impossible task--my amendment would simply require the services \nto review only the records of those individuals for whom \nrecommendations have been received by the services during the 1-year \nperiod. That is to say, the onus would be on the individual, or his or \nher supporters, to apply for consideration during the review period. \nThis would considerably ease the administrative burden, and cost, that \nsection 543 as currently drafted would impose on the military.\n  Third, my amendment would allow the service Secretaries to reject an \napplication or recommendation if there is a justifiable basis for \nconcluding that the application is specious. Again, the purpose of this \nparticular provision is to make the services' task easier by giving \nthem the authority to reject at the outset any recommendation for an \naward that is, on its face, without\n merit.\n\n  Fourth, it would require the services to take reasonable steps to \npublicize the opportunity to apply for awards during the 1-year review \nperiod. It would be a sad state of affairs, Mr. President, if certain \ndeserving individuals were not to take advantage of the review \nopportunity through lack of notification. The services have an \nobligation to ensure that potential awardees are informed of the \nopportunity to apply for an award or decoration.\n  Fifth, my amendment would require the services, upon completion of \nthe review, to make any legislative or administrative recommendations \nto improve award procedures with respect to military intelligence \npersonnel. These recommendations will be important in helping Congress \nand the services develop policies that will obviate problems of the \nkind which makes this legislation necessary.\n  Finally, I should note that my amendment is almost identical in form \nand substance to another provision in the committee bill, section 542, \nwhich concerns awards for service during the Vietnam era. Thus, I \nbelieve there is ample justification and precedent for the amendment I \nam offering. Certainly if Vietnam veterans deserve a chance to be \nreviewed for acts of heroism, military intelligence officers from other \nwars whose heroism has been long-overlooked should be accorded a \nsimilar opportunity.\n  Mr. President, we will soon be commemorating the 50th anniversary of \nV-J Day and the end of World War II. I can think of no better way to \nhonor the courage and sacrifice of the men and women who served our \ncountry as military intelligence officers during that conflict and in \nsubsequent wars than to enact this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Coats and Senator \nByrd, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the full Committee, \nSenator Thurmond and Senator Nunn, for their understanding and \nassistance on this matter. I would also like to recognize the efforts \nof their staff, including Andy Effron, P.T. Henry, and especially \nCharlie Abell, for the tremendous support they provided my staff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters in support of this \ninitiative from the commander of the U.S. Army Intelligence Command and \nthe presidents of the Veterans of the Office of Strategic Services and \nthe Association of Former Intelligence Officers, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Chief, Military Intelligence Corps.,\n\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                                Fort Huachuca, AZ.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I appreciate your continued support \n     concerning the Medal of Honor situation faced by Lieutenant \n     Colonel Richard Sakakida, and several other of our \n     unrecognized members of the Military Intelligence Corps from \n     World War II.\n       I wholeheartedly concur that Lieutenant Colonel Richard \n     Sakakida should be awarded the Medal of Honor for his \n     valorous actions in covert operations during World War II. \n     Unfortunately, Lieutenant Colonel Sakakida is not alone in \n     his unrecognized heroism. Due to the sensitivity and \n     classified nature of their missions, several other members \n     and nominees of the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame \n     would certainly benefit from your legislation. These \n     individuals include Master Sergeant Lorenzo Alverado, \n     Specialist Harry Akune, Sergeant Peter de Pasqua, and Colonel \n     Carl Eifler. I support your efforts for legislation S. 566 \n     that requires review of all World War II Military \n     Intelligence personnel.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: As President of the Veterans of the \n     Office of Strategic Services (VSS), which represents the men \n     and women who carried out the majority of US secret \n     intelligence and special operations activities during WW II \n     that were outside the traditional military structure, I am \n     writing to express our organization's strong support for your \n     efforts to secure appropriate recognition for certain former \n     military intelligence personnel who deserve same.\n       As you know, there are many deserving individuals who \n     served in intelligence capacities during wartime who, because \n     of the classified nature of their missions, were never \n     appropriately considered for the Congressional Medal of \n     Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, or other awards prior to \n     the statutory deadline for official consideration for these \n     medals.\n       Among others of our group who were unfairly precluded from \n     receiving appropriate consideration include from Col. Carl \n     Eifler, (who could not be put in for a Medal of Honor) to \n     Camille Lelong, known then as Lt. Jacques P. Pavel, a Jed \n     teammate of William Colby (who he put in for a Legion of \n     Merit, but was never awarded) and nisei Kay Sugahara (who \n     after internment, joined the OSS's Moral Operations Branch \n     and did extraordinary work in the Pacific before and \n     immediately after VJ Day, is now buried in Arlington, but \n     never received any recognition whatsoever).\n       VSS wholeheartedly supports legislation that would waive \n     the time limits pertaining to the CMH and other medals for \n     those individuals who, because of the secrecy of their \n     operations, could and/or were not otherwise considered for \n     these awards within the prescribed normal military \n     limitation.\n       With all best wishes,\n           Yours truly,\n                                              Geoffrey M.T. Jones,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S 11313]]\n\n                                             Association of Former\n\n\n                                        Intelligence Officers,\n\n                                        McLean, VA, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: As Executive Director of the \n     Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO), I endorse \n     your efforts to secure recognition for military intelligence \n     veterans.\n       I wholeheartedly encourage proposed legislation that would \n     require the military services to review the records of \n     military intelligence personnel who, because of the secrecy \n     of their work, were never appropriately considered for the \n     Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, or other award.\n       The military should be required to review the records only \n     of those individuals who apply to be reviewed or whose \n     applications are submitted on their behalf. These individuals \n     could then be considered on a case-by-case basis. To ensure \n     that the military reviews the applications in a timely \n     manner, a statutory delimiting deadline for making a final \n     determination should be imposed, perhaps one year from the \n     date an application is received.\n       Thank you again for your work on behalf of military \n     intelligence veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David D. Whipple,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment establishes congressional \nfindings concerning the potential for overlooking meritorious acts by \nthose whose activities necessarily require secrecy.\n  This establishes a 1-year period for review of recommendations and \nrequests for awards for the period from 1940 to 1990. While the bill \nrecognizes that persons deserving of awards may have been overlooked \nbecause their intelligence activities were necessarily secretive, it \ncontains no provisions for review of existing procedures which are time \nconsuming and not oriented toward cases which contain a presumption \nagainst reviewing cases more than 3 years old.\n  The provision establishes a limited time of 1 year and limits review \nto those requesting or recommended for such a review.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment is satisfactory.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The amendment (No. 2099) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2100\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Army to review the records \n   relating to the award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Asian-\nAmericans and Native American Pacific Islanders for service in the Army \n during World War II to determine whether the award should be upgraded \n                         to the Medal of Honor)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have another amendment by the Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka. This amendment would require a review of awards \nto Asian-Americans and native American Pacific Islanders during World \nWar II. It requires the review of awards to African-Americans to \ndetermine whether they should be upgraded.\n  The Army has undertaken a review of World War II awards of the \nDistinguished Service Cross to determine whether any should be upgraded \nto the Medal of Honor. The review is requested based on a concern that \nsome awards may have been downgraded due to prejudice.\n  The amendment requests a similar review of awards to native American \nPacific Islanders in view of the possible prejudice at that time \nagainst these groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Akaka, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2100.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 206, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 544. REVIEW REGARDING AWARDS OF DISTINGUISHED-SERVICE \n                   CROSS TO ASIAN-AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS \n                   FOR CERTAIN WORLD WAR II SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Review Required.--The Secretary of the Army shall--\n       (1) review the records relating to the award of the \n     Distinguished-Service Cross to Asian-Americans and Native \n     American Pacific Islanders for service as members of the Army \n     during World War II in order to determine whether the award \n     should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor; and\n       (2) submit to the President a recommendation that the \n     President award a Medal of Honor to each such person for whom \n     the Secretary determines an upgrade to be appropriate.\n       (b) Waiver of Time Limitations.--The President is \n     authorized to award a Medal of Honor to any person referred \n     to in subsection (a) in accordance with a recommendation of \n     the Secretary of the Army submitted under that subsection. \n     The following restrictions do not apply in the case of any \n     such person:\n       (1) Sections 3744 and 8744 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (2) Any regulation or other administrative restriction on--\n       (A) the time for awarding a Medal of Honor; or\n       (B) the awarding of a Medal of Honor for service for which \n     a Distinguished-Service Cross has been awarded.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Native American Pacific Islander'' means a \n     Native Hawaiian and any other Native American Pacific \n     Islander within the meaning of the Native American Programs \n     Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 2291 et seq.).\n       (2) The term ``World War II'' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 101(8) of title 38, United States Code.\n  requiring the review of distinguished service cross awards to asian \n  americans and native american pacific islanders during world war ii\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 1026, \nthe fiscal year 1996 Department of Defense authorization bill. The \namendment directs the Secretary of the Army to review the service \nrecords of Asian-Americans and Native American Pacific Islanders who \nreceived the Distinguished Service Cross to determine whether the award \nshould be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.\n  Under the direction of then-Acting Secretary John Shannon, the Army \nis reviewing all Distinguished Service Cross [DSC] awards given to \nAfrican-American soldiers during World War II to determine whether any \nof these cases merited an upgrade to the Congressional Medal of Honor \n[CMH].\n  Mr. President, I offer my amendment to ensure that the Army conducts \na similar study for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders who served \nduring World War II. I am deeply concerned that this group of Americans \nmay have also been discriminated against in the awarding of the CMH. \nThe internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II is a clear \nindication of the bias that existed at the time. This hostile climate \nmay have impacted the decision to award the military's highest honor to \nAsians, particularly Japanese-Americans.\n  The famed 100th Infantry Battalion/442 Regimental Combat Team, which \nperformed extraordinary deeds in Europe, still has the unique \ndistinction of being the most highly decorated unit of its size in \nAmerican history. In fact, 47 individuals of the 442d Regimental Combat \nTeam received the DSC. However, only one Japanese-American who served \nduring World War II received the CMH; this award was given posthumously \nafter the war only when concerns were raised that not one American of \nJapanese descent who served in World War II had received the medal.\n  Mr. President, my amendment only serves to ensure fairness for Asian-\nAmericans and Pacific Islanders who so gallantly served their country \nduring World War II. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the \nAllied victory over the Axis powers, I think it is timely and \nappropriate that we undertake such a initiative. I hope that my \ncolleagues will support this important amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we find the amendment satisfactory and \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Hawaii, No. 2100\n  The amendment (No. 2100) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S 11314]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2101\n\n   (Purpose: To revise section 723, relating to the applicability of \n CHAMPUS payment rules to health care provided by CHAMPUS providers to \n members of the uniformed services enrolled in a health care plan of a \n                 Uniformed Services Treatment Facility)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Coats, I offer an \namendment which modifies section 723 by striking the current section \nand replacing it with a new section which accomplishes the intended \nresult of protecting Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities from being \ncharged more than the CHAMPUS allowable costs for services provided by \nCHAMPUS providers to USTF enrollees who are treated when they are \noutside the USTF catchment area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, Mr. President, on behalf of the Senators from \nOklahoma, Mr. Nickles and Mr. Inhofe, I offer an amendment which will \nrequire the General Accounting Office to review the Department of \nDefense depot maintenance policy required in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, that is correct. I have a brief statement I \nwould like to make on behalf of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now ask the clerk to read the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Nickles, \n     for himself and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2103.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n     On page 76, insert the following after line 4:\n       ``(f) Review by the General Accounting Office.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall make available to the Comptroller General of \n     the United States all information used by the Department in \n     developing the policy under subsections (a) through (d) of \n     this section.\n       (2) Not later than 45 days after the Secretary submits to \n     Congress the report required by subsection (a), the \n     Comptroller General shall transmit to Congress a report \n     containing a detailed analysis of the Secretary's proposed \n     policy as reported under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee members and staff for working closely with me and my staff on \nthis amendment. I also want to thank my friend and colleague Senator \nInhofe and his staff who played a key role in getting this amendment \nadopted.\n  This amendment adds the requirement that once the Department of \nDefense submits its report to Congress regarding depot maintenance as \nrequired in this bill, the GAO be given 45 days to review the \ninformation and the conclusions from the Pentagon's recommended depot \npolicy and submit that analysis to Congress.\n  In my view this is an appropriate and non-controversial amendment. By \nproviding the Congress with an analysis of the Pentagon's proposal for \ndepot maintenance the Congress will have an independent viewpoint on \nthe recommended changes.\n  This analysis will be critical as the Congress decides whether to \nadopt the \n\n[[Page S 11315]]\nrecommendations of the Pentagon or stay with the existing depot policy.\n  Once again, I wish to thank the members and staff of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and Senator Inhofe for their cooperation and \nassistance in having this amendment included in this bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I support the Nickles amendment, which will \nstrengthen the bill's provisions on depot maintenance workload.\n  Section 311 of the bill requires the Secretary of defense to submit \nto Congress a comprehensive policy on the performance of depot-level \nmaintenance and repair not later than March 31, 1996.\n  The policy must: First, define purpose of public depots; second, \nprovide for performance of core capabilities at public depots; third, \nprovide sufficient personnel, equipment, and facilities at public \ndepots; fourth, address environmental liability; fifth provide for \npublic private competition when there is sufficient potential for \nrealizing cost savings based on adequate private sector competition and \ntechnical capabilities; sixth require merit-based selection when \nworkload of a depot is changed; seventh provide transition provisions \nfor persons in DOD depots; and eighth address related issues on \nexchange of technical data, efficiency, and effects on the Federal \nworkforce.\n  The bill makes it clear that no changes may be made in the statutes \nrequiring that at least 60 percent of the workload be preformed in \npublic depots, and the requirements to for public/private competition \nfor any change in workload requirements unless Congress enacts separate \nlegislation approving or modifying the DOD policy.\n  The Nickles amendment would require a detailed analysis by the \nGeneral Accounting Office of DOD's proposed depot maintenance policy.\n  GAO oversight is necessary to assess the validity of DOD data and \nstudies.\n  The importance of GAO report has been demonstrated in the base \nclosure process, where their data provided important perspective to the \nBRAC Commission.\n  While there may well be opportunities for increased contractor \nparticipation, these should be developed on the basis of careful \nanalysis, not theoretical beliefs. Depot-level maintenance and repair \nactivities are essential to wartime readiness and sustainability. The \ncurrent system has proved to be highly effective in meeting national \nsecurity needs, and should not be subjected to significant changes \nwithout a clear understanding of the consequences of a new policy.\n  At the confirmation hearing for Deputy Secretary of Defense John \nWhite, he was closely questioned about the recommendations of the Roles \nand Missions Commission concerning privatization of depot workload.\n  He acknowledged that the Commission did not conduct a comprehensive \nanalysis of specific DOD functions to determine which should be \nprivatized; that the recommendation reflected a general philosophical \napproach; that Commission did not develop a specific definition of the \ninherently governmental functions that should not be privatized; that \nthe Commission had not developed a specific concept of what core \ncapabilities should be retained; that there had been no analysis of the \nefficiency and effectiveness of current depots; and that the Commission \ndid not have a specific plan for transitioning from public to private \nentities.\n  He also agreed that it was very important to ensure that any workload \nassigned to the private sector be subject to adequate private sector \ncompetition.\n  GAO review is needed to ensure that any changes in policy are \ndeveloped on the basis of sound analysis rather than abstract \nphilosophy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to express my thanks to Senator \nThurmond and the staff of the Armed Services Committee for their \ndiligence in working with Senator Nickles and me and our staffs on this \namendment.\n  This amendment requires the General Accounting Office to review the \nDOD report on depot maintenance required in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 1995 (S. 1026.), and report their findings to \nCongress within 45 days of the date of the report.\n  This is a common sense, noncontroversial amendment. It simply \nprovides a second opinion for members of Congress when the time comes \nto review the Department of Defense's recommended changes. This \nadditional review will help Members sort through this complicated \nsubject.\n  Again, I thank the members and staff of the Armed Services Committee \nfor their assistance in having this amendment included in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The amendment (No. 2103) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2104\n\n(Purpose: To make various amendments to the provisions relating to the \n                       Naval Petroleum Reserves)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senators McCain and \nBingaman and Campbell, I send an amendment to the desk. This amendment \nfurther strengthens the safeguards established to ensure minimum \nvalue--excuse me, that would be maximum value, to ensure maximum value, \nMr. President, to the taxpayers as a consequence of the sale of the \nNaval Petroleum Reserve. It is my understanding this amendment has been \ncleared on the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is cleared as long as that word is \n``maximum'' value.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, I wanted to commend the Senator from New \nMexico for his diligent work regarding this amendment. It takes another \nimportant step toward ensuring that the taxpayer receives a fair value \nfor the reserve.\n  The debate regarding the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve is not a \nnew one. As my colleagues know, the sale of the reserve was proposed by \nthe Reagan, Bush, and now Clinton administration. President Clinton's \nbudget reads ``Producing and selling this oil and natural gas is a \ncommercial, not a governmental activity, which is more appropriately \nperformed by the private sector.'' The sale of the reserve is advocated \nby groups like the National Taxpayers Union, the CATO institute and the \nHeritage Foundation. Furthermore, this year's Budget Act directs the \nsale of the reserve in fiscal year 1996.\n  I want to make it clear that my goal, Senator Bingaman's goal and the \ngoal of the committee has always been to sell this asset in a manner \nthat protects the taxpayer and disposes the asset in a completely fair \nand open process that gives advantage to no one. To achieve this, the \nbill includes several provisions to ensure the Federal Government \nreceives the maximum value for the field.\n  Specifically, the bill directs the Secretary of Energy to hire five \nindependent assessors to establish a value for the reserve. The \nSecretary, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, \nmust use these assessments when establishing a minimum bid. The \nSecretary is not permitted to accept an offer below the minimum bid \nprice.\n  The independent assessors are required to include in the value of the \nfield factors such as the equipment and facilities to be included in \nthe sale, the estimated quantity of petroleum and natural gas in the \nreserve, and the anticipated revenue stream that the Treasury would \nreceive from the reserve if it were not sold, as well as all other \nconsiderations affecting the value of the reserve.\n  The legislation also requires consultation with several other \nagencies with expertise in these matters. It directs the Secretary to \nconsult with the General Services Administration to ensure that the \nbidding process is open. In identifying the highest offer, the \nSecretary is required to consult with the Secretary of the Treasury and \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The Senate bill also includes a provision to address compliance with \ndeadlines. In the event the Secretary is unable to comply with the \ntimeliness identified in the bill, the Secretary in consultation with \nthe Office of Management and Budget [OMB] is required to notify both \nthe House National Security and Senate Armed Services Committees and \nsubmit a revised plan to complete the sale.\n  It has been suggested that the sale of reserves in pieces may yield a \nbetter return to the Federal Government. The committee language allows \nfor the Secretary to sell the reserve in pieces or as one unit, \nwhichever returns the best value to the taxpayers.\n  Finally, the legislation requires a 31-day delay before the Secretary \ncan finalize an agreement to accept the highest responsible offer. This \ndelay allows the Congress to stop the sale if it is deemed not to be in \nthe best interest of the taxpayer and the Federal Government. In the \nevent there is only a single bidder, a joint resolution of Congress \nwould be required before approval of the sale.\n  It has always been the committee's intention to do everything \npossible to ensure that the legislation results in the highest return \nfor the Federal Government and dispenses of this property in the \nfairest manner possible. The committee reported legislation, contains \nmany safeguards to help ensure that the interests of the taxpayer and \nthe Nation are protected in the disposition of this asset.\n  The amendment which I have crafted with Senator Bingaman goes even \nfurther. The amendment provides increased oversight of the sale by \ndirecting the General Accounting Office to monitor all aspects of the \nsale and report to the Armed Services Committee and the House National \nSecurity Committee.\n  We have also clarified the process for establishing the minimum bid. \nThe value established by the five independent assessors is based on the \nnet present value of the reserve adjusted for any anticipated increases \nin tax revenues that would result if the reserve were sold. The \nSecretary is restricted from selecting a minimum bid price less than \nthat value. This will ensure that the value received for the Elk Hills \nsite is fair to the Federal Government.\n  It also directs the Secretary of Energy in conjunction with the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget to notify the House \nNational Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee if \nthe sale is not proceeding in manner that will yield the maximum value \nfor the Federal Government or if they determine that another course of \naction will receive a better value for the Federal Government.\n  Once that notification has been made, the sale could not be completed \nunless the Congress approves a joint resolution in support of the bill. \nThis would allow the administration the opportunity throughout this \nprocess to suggest an alternative way to deal with the reserve.\n  Mr. President, the overriding concern of the committee was to ensure \nthat \n\n[[Page S 11317]]\nthe taxpayers receive the maximum value for the reserve. We have taken \nseveral steps to accomplish this goal. The sale of this asset involves \nfive Federal agencies in the sale of the reserve. It allows Congress to \nreview the sale of the reserve for a month before it is finalized. In \nthe event of a single bidder it requires our approval. Finally, it \ndirects the Secretary and the Director of OMB to notify us if the sale \nis proceeding properly or if they have a better way of dealing with the \nreserve.\n  As I said earlier, the debate regarding the Naval Petroleum Reserve \nhas been going on for a long time. The passage of the Defense \nAuthorization Act will not end this debate. We still have to work this \nbill out in conference with the House. In addition, we will have to \naddress this issue during the budget reconciliation debate because this \nprovision still falls short of the budget instructions. During the \ncourse of debate I look forward to the suggestions of my colleagues on \nhow to further improve this bill. I hope my colleagues will join \nSenator Bingaman and me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the senior Senator from \nArizona for his willingness to work with me on this amendment. This \namendment basically puts every safeguard the Armed Services Committee \nstaff or Senator McCain's staff or Senator Campbell's staff or my staff \nhas come up with on the Elk Hills sale into the bill while remaining \nresponsive to the mandate in the fiscal year 1996 concurrent budget \nresolution to sell the Elk Hills oil reserve in fiscal year 1996.\n  As many of our colleagues know, the sale of the Nation's naval \npetroleum reserves was not initiated by the Armed Services Committee. \nThe sale was initially recommended by the administration to take place \nover the next 2 years. The budget committees noted this and \nnevertheless decided to score the administration's proposal in such a \nway that the sale will have to take place during the coming fiscal year \ninstead of over the next 2 years.\n  Many of us on the Armed Services Committee have serious reservations \nabout the pace of this sale. The National Academy of Public \nAdministration has testified to serious concerns about selling the \nreserve in 1 year and about whether the taxpayers will get their \nmoney's worth if this sale is rushed. R. Scott Fosler, president of the \nNational Academy of Public Administration, wrote Senator Thurmond on \nJuly 20 with his comments on the provision in the current bill. Let me \ncite the key paragraph in that letter:\n\n       Every study of the management or privatization of Elk Hills \n     has documented the complexity of the process of divestment. \n     There are stubborn issues involving equity finalization, \n     California claims, and the establishment of true values which \n     are not likely to be disposed of in time to effect an \n     advantageous sale in one year. We, therefore, believe that \n     the most prudent and efficacious course would be (1) \n     establish the corporation as a management structure, (2) \n     direct the corporation to develop a plan to sell Elk Hills \n     (and possibly other reserves) within two or three years after \n     the activation of the operation. This approach would permit \n     an orderly, well-managed divestment process and would help \n     assure that the government received full value for the assets \n     sold.\n\n  Mr. President, this option or any other option which would not result \nin the sale of Elk Hills and other reserves in fiscal year 1996 is not \navailable to the Armed Services Committee under the budget resolution. \nI regret that. We only can sell these assets once. We should do it the \nright way. The Budget Committee should not be making the choices as to \nboth the policy on selling the asset and the timing of that sale.\n  So I support this amendment. It is the best we can do under current \nreconciliation instructions. Indeed it probably goes to the limit of \nthose instructions and I commend the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Colorado for doing that. But I will continue to question \nthose instructions and urge that the Armed Services Committee seek the\n flexibility from the Budget Committee that would allow the Secretary \nof Energy to dispose of these fields in the way that will bring maximum \nbenefit to the taxpayers, the current owners of these assets. When the \nArmed Services Committee discusses reconciliation next month, perhaps \nwe can offer two options to the Budget Committee, the provision we are \nadopting today which meets their mandate to sell the reserve in 1 year \nand a second provision that would allow the Secretary to sell it over a \nmore extended time period.\n\n  Mr. President, this sale involves the 10th largest oil field in the \nNation. Each year this oil field provides approximately $400 million \ninto the public treasury. This is a very significant sale.\n  Mr. President, I have been told that there are many uncertainties \nabout this sale that would make a potential bidder very cautious. The \nexact share of the field which the Government owns and which Chevron \nowns is in question. The amount of oil in the field is in question. The \nState of California has a suit in the courts regarding that State's \ninterest in the field.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, Senator McCain and I and \nothers placed a number of safeguards into this legislation that protect \nthe interests of the taxpayers when it was before the Armed Services \nCommittee. This amendment, which is sponsored by Senators McCain, \nCampbell, and myself adds even further safeguards to ensure that we get \na fair price in any sales that may take place of Elk Hills or its \ncomponents if the Secretary chooses to sell the field in parcels.\n  This amendment gives the Secretary of Energy the authority to stop \nthe sale and report to the Congress if the sale is turning out to be a \nbad deal. It gives the Secretary the authority to recommend \nalternatives to the sale if the sale is turning out to be a giveaway. \nThe amendment also sets up similar procedures for the sale of the oil \nshale reserves. Finally, Mr. President, this amendment contains several \nprovisions to streamline the sale which have been requested by the \nDepartment of Energy to allow the sale to proceed as closely as \npossible to the schedule mandated by the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I wish to commend Senator McCain again \nfor his effort to make the best of this situation. Decisions were made \nfor his Readiness Subcommittee by the Budget Committee. He now has to \nimplement those decisions and the provision in our bill as reported and \nthe improvements being made today by this amendment represent his and \nthe committee as a whole's best effort to do that given the information \nwe had available in late June and now in early August.\n  The Armed Services Committee does not normally deal with selling \nGovernment assets and certainly we are not experts in oil field \ntransactions. We have produced a provision that I believe is a \nsignificant improvement on the provision in the House version of this \nbill. And perhaps with the help of the budget committees, we will be \nable to improve it further in conference on this bill or in the \nreconciliation bill where this matter will also be dealt with.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the committee chairman, \nSenator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Nunn, for working \nwith me and with the senior Senator from Colorado to craft an amendment \nto the bill concerning the Naval Oil Shale Reserves.\n  Section 3302 of the bill before us today would direct the Secretary \nof Energy to study the Naval Oil Shale Reserves and the Naval Petroleum \nReserves, with the exception of the NPR 1 at Elk Hills, for the purpose \nof determining how the Federal Government, and the U.S. taxpayer, would \nbest be served in the management and disposition of these reserves.\n  I support that goal. Last year the Energy Committee, of which I am a \nmember, passed my bill which would have directly transferred \njurisdiction over the Naval Oil Shale Reserves from the Department of \nEnergy to the Department of the Interior. Since that time the Armed \nServices Committee has raised a concern that we may not have the \nappropriate scale of information to determine how we best maximize the \nFederal interest in these resources. These are federally owned \nresources; in these days of tough, difficult decisions on how we reduce \nthe federal deficit, it is critical to me that the Federal interest be \nprotected.\n  I commend the committee for addressing this issue. However I believe \nthat this bill should take the next step. The amendment that I have \nworked out with the chairman and ranking \n\n[[Page S 11318]]\nmember of the Armed Services Committee simply provides the Secretary of \nEnergy with the authority to take that next step and implement whatever \ncourse of action is recommended by the study. Indeed, the Department of \nEnergy asked, and I strongly agreed, that the time for endless study of \nthe oil shale reserves must end and we should move expeditiously to \ndevelop these resources.\n  I have worked very carefully with the Department of Energy, whose \nstaff requested nearly a dozen changes in the amendment, virtually all \nof which I made.\n  Under my amendment, three options for disposition of these resources \ncould be considered. The reserves could be competitively leased by the \nDepartment of the Interior just the same as the other millions of acres \nof federally owned, energy resource lands in America. They could be \nleased by the Department of Energy. And they could be sold by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Some background may be appropriate. Two executive orders, in 1916 and \n1924, withdrew public lands for the purpose of establishing three Naval \nOil Shale Reserves. The purpose of the reserves was to ensure the \nmilitary sufficient oil from the oil shale in the event of a cutoff of \nstrategic oil supplies during a war.\n  Naval Oil Shale Reserve 1 (40,760 acres) and 3 (14,130 acres) are \nlocated in northwest Colorado near Rifle, and Naval Oil Shale Reserve 2 \n(90,400 acres) is in eastern Utah. Ironically, the critical resource \nwithin these properties is not oil shale, but natural gas. Profitable \ndevelopment of shale oil currently is considered to be decades away.\n  Management of the reserves was transferred from the Department of the \nNavy to the Department of Energy by the Department of Energy \nOrganization Act in 1977. The Department of Energy has a cooperative \nagreement with the Bureau of Land Management to manage the surface \nresources of the reserves.\n  The reserves located in Colorado are situated on portions of three \nlarge natural gas producing fields, the Parachute, Rulison, and Grand \nValley, and are estimated to contain substantial natural gas \nhydrocarbons. There has been significant private natural gas drilling \nand extraction activity on the southern border of the third reserve \nsince 1978. Since 1980, 277 private wells have been drilled contiguous \nto the boundaries of Reserve 1 and 2; and through fiscal year 1992, 89 \ncommercial producing gas wells were drilled by private industry within \none mile of the boundary of the reserves.\n  The Department of Energy determined in 1983 that the potential \nexisted for drainage of natural gas from the reserves due to the \nprivate development outside of the reserves. To prevent drainage of \npublic resources, the Department of Energy began a protection program, \ndrilling 35 offset and communitization wells. According to the \nDepartment of Energy's Annual Report of Operations for fiscal year \n1992, natural gas production between fiscal years 1977 and 1992 \ntotalled 5.4 billion cubic feet. Revenues from the reserves totalled $5 \nmillion between fiscal years 1977 and 1992; expenditures for the same \nperiod totalled $24.8 million.\n  Clearly, this is a giant money loser under Department of Energy \nstewardship. These reserves should be revenue raisers, not simply a \nblack hole for Energy Department spending and bureaucracy.\n  Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, the \nSecretary of Energy has discretionary authority to undertake certain \nactivities, such as oil and gas development in the reserves, but only \nas necessary to protect, conserve, maintain or test the reserves. \nProduction for other purposes may take place only with the approval of \nthe President and Congress. That production--for commercial purposes--\nis the business we are doing today.\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with the Department of Energy \nthese past months. The DOE leadership wants very badly to be able to \nend the study phase and get on with the development phase.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nfor working with me on an amendment which will move us forward toward \nthe actual development of these important natural resources in my \nState.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  The amendment (No. 2104) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 275, strike out line 19 and all that \n     follows through page 277, line 18, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       (a) Study Required.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     conduct a study to determine the quantitative results \n     (described in subsection (b)) of enactment and exercise of \n     authority for the Secretary of the military department \n     concerned to pay an annuity to the qualified surviving spouse \n     of each member of the Armed Forces who--\n       (A) died before March 21, 1974, and was entitled to retired \n     or retainer pay on the date of death; or\n       (B) was a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces \n     during the period beginning on September 21, 1972, and ending \n     on October 1, 1978, and at the time of his death would have \n     been entitled to retired pay under chapter 67 of title 10, \n     United States Code (as in effect before December 1, 1994), \n     but for the fact that he was under 60 years of age.\n       (2) A qualified surviving spouse for purposes of paragraph \n     (1) is a surviving spouse who has not remarried and who is \n     not eligible for an annuity under section 4 of Public Law 92-\n     425 (10 U.S.C. 1448 note).\n       (b) Required Determinations.--By means of the study \n     required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine \n     the following matters:\n\n[[Page S 11319]]\n\n       (1) The number of unremarried surviving spouses of deceased \n     members and deceased former members of the Armed Forces \n     referred to in subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1) who \n     would be eligible for an annuity under authority described in \n     such subsection.\n       (2) The number of unremarried surviving spouses of deceased \n     members and deceased former members of reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces referred to in subparagraph (B) of \n     subsection (a)(1) who would be eligible for an annuity under \n     authority described in such subsection.\n       (3) The number of persons in each group of unremarried \n     former spouses described in paragraphs (1) and (2) who are \n     receiving a widow's insurance benefit or a widower's \n     insurance benefit under title II of the Social Security Act \n     on the basis of employment of a deceased member or deceased \n     former member referred to in subsection (a)(1).\n       (c) Report.--(1) Not later than March 1, 1996, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives a report on the results of \n     the study.\n       (2) The Secretary shall include in the report a \n     recommendation on the amount of the annuity that should be \n     authorized to be paid under any authority described in \n     subsection (a)(1) together with a recommendation on whether \n     the annuity should be adjusted annually to offset increases \n     in the cost of living.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor immediate consideration.\n  This amendment modifies section 648, annuities for certain military \nsurviving spouses to eliminate the direct spending costs. When the \ncommittee adopted this provision during our markup, we did so based on \na cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office which made this \nprovision affordable. Later, after the bill was approved by the \ncommittee, CBO revised the cost estimate upward. The revised estimate \nis that this provision will cost $40 million in direct spending in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The Budget Committee is forcing us to take this action under threat \nof placing a point of order against our bill. I have looked at every \nsolution available to me to find a way to keep these annuities. I am \ndisappointed that I am unable to retain the provision this year.\n  The amendment modifies the provision to require the Secretary of \nDefense to conduct a study to determine how many forgotten widows would \nqualify for an annuity and to recommend the amount of such an annuity. \nThe required study is to be delivered to the Armed Services Committee \nnot later than March 1, 1996. This will give us time to consider the \ninformation in the report and develop legislation next year which will \nfinally authorize providing this group of surviving military spouses \nthe compensation they deserve. Once the committee has this study, we \nwill be able to provide the Budget Committee and the Congressional \nBudget Office the data necessary to preclude the technical budgetese we \nfaced this year from deterring us next year.\n  I understand this amendment is agreed to on both sides.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe this amendment is acceptable on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, we have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 2106) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n(Purpose: To require a review and report on United States policy on the \n          security of the national information infrastructure)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kyl and Robb, I \noffer an amendment which requires the President to submit an assessment \nof the policy and plans for protecting the national information \ninfrastructure and assessment of the national communications system.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 403, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1095. REVIEW OF NATIONAL POLICY ON PROTECTING THE \n                   NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST \n                   STRATEGIC ATTACKS.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report \n     setting forth the following:\n       (1) The national policy and architecture governing the \n     plans for establishing procedures, capabilities, systems, and \n     processes necessary to perform indications, warning, and \n     assessment functions regarding strategic attacks by foreign \n     nations, groups, or individuals, or any other entity against \n     the national information infrastructure.\n       (2) The future of the National Communications System (NCS), \n     which has performed the central role in ensuring national \n     security and emergency preparedness communications for \n     essential United States Government and private sector users, \n     including, specifically, a discussion of--\n       (A) whether there is a federal interest in expanding or \n     modernizing the National Communications System in light of \n     the changing strategic national security environment and the \n     revolution in information technologies; and\n       (B) the best use of the National Communications System and \n     the assets and experience it represents as an integral part \n     of a larger national strategy to protect the United States \n     against a strategic attack on the national information \n     infrastructure.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to propose an amendment to S. 1026, \nthe Defense Authorization Act. I am pleased to introduce this amendment \nwhich will require the President to analyze all issues in developing a \nprogressive, cohesive national policy toward protecting our ability to \ncommunicate, our defense structure, and our information.\n  There is currently no defense against attacks on our Nation's \ninformation systems, which include our defense, telephone, public \nutility, and banking systems. Military officials have no ability to \nprotect our country from cyberspace attacks, and no legal or political \nauthority to protect our information systems against another country's \noffensive. Current CIA Director John Deutch said, at his Senate \nconfirmation hearing, ``this is a very important subject * * * which we \nreally don't have a crisp answer to.''\n  We need to start looking for that answer now, since the problem is \nlooming. A June 14 Wall Street Journal article reported that security \nexperts were used to ``hack'' into 12,000 Defense Department computer \nsystems connected to the Internet. The experts ``hacked'' their way \ninto 88 percent of the systems, and 96 percent of the attacks were \nundetected. According to a June 1995 Federal Computer Week article, \ncomputer hackers are breaking into Defense systems by using highly \nautomated tools. The article reported that the DOD's Center for \nInformation Systems Security is receiving two computer attacks a day--\ntwice the rate of last year's intrusions. In 1994, the DOD recorded 255 \nsuccessful attacks.\n  The threat is imminent. According to a 1994 report prepared by the \nNational Communications System [NCS], no fewer than 30 countries are \nworking on information warfare techniques. The administration must \ndevelop a comprehensive national policy that coordinates national \nsecurity defense for both U.S. Government and private sector users of \nour National Information Infrastructure [NII]. My amendment seeks to \nanalyze all critical issues involved in protecting our Nation's \ninformation infrastructure. These answers will provide a framework, I \nbelieve, toward developing our Nation's policy for defending against \nstrategic attacks against the NII.\n  As technology changes, we cannot allow ourselves to become vulnerable \nto attack on the nerve centers of our society and defense structure. We \nneed to modernize our laws to protect against this very real threat. \nVice Adm. Arthur Cebrowski, director of C4 systems at the Pentagon, \nstates that, ``a critical policy implication of the revolution in \nsecurity affairs is the need to treat information and access to \ninformation as a vital national interest,'' and ``information warfare \nmust become an important instrument of national security policy.''\n\n[[Page S 11320]]\n\n  Now is the time for Congress to be active. This amendment is intended \nto place an emphasis on an issue that must be addressed before our \ncountry's communications system is attacked. We must begin now to \nelevate our efforts to protect the national security interest of this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2107) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2108\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators McCain and \nLieberman, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2108.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . IRAN AND IRAQ ARMS NONPROLIFERATION.\n\n       (a) Sanctions Against Transfers of Persons.--Section \n     1604(a) of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 \n     (title XVI of Public Law 102-484; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is \n     amended by inserting ``to acquire chemical, biological, or \n     nuclear weapons or'' before ``to acquire''.\n       (b) Sanctions Against Transfers of Foreign Countries.--\n     Section 1605(a) of such Act is amended by inserting ``to \n     acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons or'' before \n     ``to acquire''.\n       (c) Clarification of United States Assistance.--\n     Subparagraph (A) of section 1608(7) of such Act is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(A) any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), other than urgent humanitarian \n     assistance or medicine;''.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization bill to assist the President in his efforts to \ndeal with the growing threat to American interests from Iran. President \nClinton clearly sought to address this threat with his May 6 Executive \norder establishing a full United States embargo of Iran. It is my hope \nthat short of successfully encouraging other nations from trading with \nIran, an extremely challenging task, the President will be able to use \nthe authority in this amendment to encourage other countries to at \nleast refrain from contributing to Iranian weapons capability.\n  The 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, which I cosponsored \nwith then-Senator Gore, established sanctions against third parties \nwhich assist Iran and Iraq in their efforts to rebuild their weapons \ncapabilities. It was a start, but it did not go far enough. Efforts by \nSenator Lieberman and me last year to expand the legislation were \nunsuccessful.\n  The 1992 bill was intended to target not only the acquisition of \nconventional weapons, but weapons of mass destruction as well. In the \nprocess of amending the bill to the 1993 Defense Act, however, the \nexplicit references to weapons of mass destruction were dropped.\n  The amendment I am offering today attempts to make these applications \nabsolutely clear. It also removes from the proposed sanctions \nexceptions for assistance under the Freedom Support Act, thereby \nremoving the benefit of the doubt Congress gave Russia in 1992. I am \nafraid Russia has used this exception to the detriment of United States \npolicy in the Persian Gulf.\n  The threat from Iraq is not an immediate concern. The most important \naspect of our policy with regard to Iraq must be to remain firm on the \nU.N. embargo. But given the history of the Iraqi military build-up \nbefore the Gulf war, the sanctions included in the Iran-Iraq Act may at \na later date be as important with regard to Iraq as they are currently \nin the case of Iran.\n  The threat from Iran is more immediate. The Iranian build-up in the \nPersian Gulf is common knowledge. Its importation of hundreds of North \nKorean SCUD-C missiles, its intention to acquire the Nodong North \nKorean missiles currently under development, and its efforts to develop \nnuclear weapons are well-established--as is its conventional weapons \nbuild-up.\n  Successive CIA directors, and Secretaries Perry and Christopher have \nall testified to the effect that Iran is engaged in an extensive effort \nto acquire nuclear weapons. In February, Russia signed an agreement to \nprovide Iran with a 1000 megawatt light water nuclear reactor. The \nRussians indicate that they may soon agree to build as many as three \nmore reactors--another 1000 megawatt reactor, and two 440 megawatt \nreactors.\n  I have raised my concerns regarding this sale with the administration \non a number of occasions. Under the amendment I am offering today, the \nPresident will be required to either invoke sanctions against Russia as \na result of its nuclear deal with Iran or formally waive the \nrequirement out of concern for the national interest. Let me be clear. \nMy intention is not to gut United States assistance to Russia. It is to \nprevent Russia from providing Iran dangerous technology. If the \nPresident determines that invoking sanctions against Russia is a \ngreater potential danger to the national interest than the potential \ndanger of a nuclear armed Iran, then he has the authority under this \namendment to waive the sanctions.\n  We sent our Armed Forces to war in the Persian Gulf once in this \ndecade. They endured hardship to themselves and their families. Some \nwill live with the injuries they suffered in service to our Nation for \nthe rest of their lives. And, as is the case with every war, some never \nreturned. With the cooperation of our friends in Europe, whose own \nsacrifices to the effort to free Kuwait should not be forgotten, we \nmust see that the service of these brave men and women was not in vain.\n  Stability and security in the Persian Gulf is vital to the world \neconomy and to our own national interests. Aggressors in the region \nshould know that if we must, we will return to the Persian Gulf with \nthe full force of Operation Desert Storm. At the same time, our friends \nand adversaries elsewhere in the world should understand that the \nUnited States will do everything in its power to preclude that \nnecessity. It is my sincere hope that his legislation will serve as an \nindication of just how serious we are.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe this is acceptable on the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2108) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 468, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2825. FINAL FUNDING FOR DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE AND \n                   REALIGNMENT COMMISSION.\n\n       Section 2902(k) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \n     Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 \n     U.S.C. 2687 note) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following;\n       ``(3)(A) The Secretary may transfer from the account \n     referred to in subparagraph (B) \n\n[[Page S 11321]]\n     such unobligated funds in that account as may be necessary for the \n     Commission to carry out its duties under this part during \n     October, November, and December 1995.

Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor an amendment \nthat would authorize the Department of Defense to fund the Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission for the remainder of calendar year 1995.\n  The law establishing the Base Closure Commission authorized the \nDepartment of Defense to fund the operations of the Commission using \nfiscal year 1991 authorization. Unfortunately, the Department's 1990 \nestimate of the Commission's operating expenses fell short of actual \nrequirement. This shortfall is due to the extensive travel required of \nthe Commission to visit each base on the Secretary of Defense's closure \nlist and attend the numerous hearings required to make the process as \nfair and open as possible. Additionally, the Commission had to purchase \na new computer system to support its operation.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment the Base Closure Commission has \nprovided a valuable service to the Nation. The funding, which is \nestimated to be less than $300,000 is necessary for the Commission to \narchive at files and prepare the appropriate closeout reports. I am \nadvised that the Department of Defense is prepared to provide the \nnecessary funds from existing authority, but needs this legislation \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, this is an appropriate use of the Defense Department \nfunds and I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this relates to the Base Closure \nCommission for the remainder of the calendar year for 1995. It is my \nunderstanding it has been accepted on the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, we have cleared this amendment. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2109) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as far as I know, this concludes the \nmatters relating to the pending measure. On behalf of the distinguished \nmajority leader, I am prepared to address some wrapup items for the \nevening.\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, with a sense of pride and honor I rise \ntoday to pay special tribute to Floyd Gulbrandson, Al Rickel, Charles \nSkorpik, Willie Wieland, and the rest of the crew of the U.S.S. South \nDakota, one of the most decorated battleships during World War II. \nCommissioned on March 20, 1942, the U.S.S. South Dakota quickly became \nthe flagship of Admiral Nimitz's 3rd Fleet, and originally was intended \nto host the Japanese surrender which ultimately was held on the U.S.S. \nMissouri.\n  Stretching more than 600 feet and displacing more than 43,000 tons of \nwater, the U.S.S. South Dakota defended our Nation in World War II by \ntraveling across 276,000 miles of ocean with massive firepower which \nincluded nine 16-inch guns, sixteen 5-inch guns, sixty-eight 40-\nmillimeter guns, and seventy-six 20-millimeter guns. During her years \nof active service, more than 7,000 brave individuals would serve aboard \nthe South Dakota. Collectively, the crew of the U.S.S. South Dakota \nendured her many battles and earned several distinguished awards, \nincluding the Navy Unit Commendation, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign \nMedal with 13 battles stars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the \nNavy Occupation Service Medal.\n  Mr. President, I want to highlight some of many moments of naval \ncombat from the many successful battles experienced by the crew of the \nU.S.S. South Dakota. On October 26, 1942, the U.S.S. South Dakota \nentered its first battle with a freshman crew on deck and was attacked \nby 180 enemy bombers in what is now know as the Battle of Santa Cruz \nIsland. Defending both the Enterprise and Hornet aircraft carriers, the \nU.S.S. South Dakota offered a bold retaliation of gunfire that shot \ndown an unprecedented 30 enemy aircraft and helped render two enemy \naircraft carriers inoperative. For their valiant action during the \nrepeated attacks and heavy fire, Captain Gatch was decorated with the \nNavy Cross, the crew was presented with the Navy Unit Commendation and \nthe U.S.S. South Dakota received its first of 13 battle stars. That was \nan extraordinary beginning to an extraordinary vessel that symbolized \ngallantry, honor, and service at sea.\n  Mr. President, on October 25, 1962, the first and only U.S.S. South \nDakota, one of the greatest battleships ever to sail during World War \nII, was sold for scrap metal. Although gone, the U.S.S. South Dakota \ncontinues in the memory of those who served on her decks. I am proud of \nthe heritage of the U.S.S. South Dakota. She was instrumental during \nWorld War II in fighting successfully for the freedoms we now enjoy. I \ncommend the brave crew of the U.S.S. South Dakota for their courage and \ncommitment to duty. In honor of the crew, their dedicated service, and \nthe memory of this great battleship, I have asked the Secretary of the \nNavy to name one of the new attack submarines the U.S.S. South Dakota. \nThat would be a fitting tribute--to have one of the next generation's \ngreat submarines carry the same name of one of America's truly great \nbattleships.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11321-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11321-S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REPUBLICAN MEDICARE CUTS AND THE SO-CALLED COALITION TO SAVE MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Republican disinformation \ncampaign on Medicare went into high gear. The leaders of the Republican \nParty have entered into an unholy alliance with the insurance industry \nto raid Medicare by raising costs for senior citizens and turning \nMedicare over to private insurance companies.\n  The overall Republican goal is to cut Medicare by $270 billion in \norder to pay for their $245 billion dollar tax cut for the wealthy. To \nachieve those harsh cuts in Medicare, senior citizens will be forced to \npay more--far more--for the Medicare benefits they now receive. To line \nup the insurance industry on their side, the Republicans are offering \nthe industry the chance to get its hands on Medicare and earn vast \nadditional profits at the expense of senior citizens.\n  The phony Republican coalition to save Medicare is now clear for all \nto see. It includes representatives of wealthy individuals and \nbusinesses who care about tax cuts, not senior citizens. It includes \nprivate insurance companies who want the elderly to be forced to give \nup Medicare and buy their policies.\n  Republicans pretend they want to save Medicare. What they really want \nto save is their tax cut for the wealthy.\n  Republicans pretend they want to restore the solvency of Medicare and \nsave the trust fund. But I say, you cannot trust Republicans who talk \nabout the trust fund. The Republican cuts in Medicare are deeper--far \ndeeper--than any cuts needed to keep Medicare solvent.\n  The fundamental issue is not keeping Medicare solvent--it is keeping \nRepublicans away from Medicare.\n  Democrats know how to keep Medicare solvent, and we will do it. We \nwill do it without raising costs for senior citizens, without forcing \nsenior citizens into HMO's without forcing them to give up their own \ndoctors and without turning Medicare over to the tender loving hands of \nthe private insurance industry.\n\n[[Page S 11322]]\n\n  The real question is trust. Do the American people trust Democrats to \nsave Medicare--or do they trust Republicans? I believe the answer is \nclear. Democrats have earned the trust of America on Medicare, and we \nintend to honor that trust.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11321-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

The Report provides a framework for empowering \nAmerica's disadvantaged citizens and poor communities to build a \nbrighter future for themselves, for their families and neighbors, and \nfor America. The Report is organized around four principles:\n  First, it links families to work. It brings tax, education and \ntraining, housing, welfare, public safety, transportation, and capital \naccess policies together to help families make the transition to self-\nsufficiency and independence. This linkage is critical to the \ntransformation of our communities.\n  Second, it leverages private investment in our urban communities. It \nworks with the market and the private sector to build upon the natural \nassets and competitive advantages of urban communities.\n  Third, it is locally driven. The days of made in Washington \nsolutions, dictated by a distant Government, are gone. Instead, \nsolutions must be locally crafted, and implemented by entrepreneurial \npublic entities, private sectors, and a growing network of community-\nbased firms and organizations.\n  Fourth, it relies on traditional values--hard work, family, \nresponsibility. The problems of so many inner-city neighborhoods--\nfamily break-up, teen pregnancy, abandonment, crime, drug use--will be \nsolved only if individuals, families, and communities determine to help \nthemselves.\n  These principles reflect an emerging consensus in the decades-long \ndebate over urban policy. These principles are neither Democratic nor \nRepublican: they are American. They will enable local communities, \nindividuals and families, businesses, churches, community-based \norganizations, and civic groups to join together to seize the \nopportunities and to solve the problems in their own lives. They will \nput the private sector back to work for all families in all \ncommunities. I therefore invite the Congress to work with us on a \nbipartisan basis to implement an empowerment agenda for America's \ncommunities and families.\n  In a sense, poor communities represent an untapped economic \nopportunity for our whole country. While we work together to open \nforeign markets abroad to American-made goods and services, we also \nneed to work together to open the economic frontiers of poor \ncommunities here at home. By enabling people and communities in genuine \nneed to take greater responsibility for working harder and smarter \ntogether, we can unleash the greatest underused source of growth and \nrenewal in each of the local regions that make up our national economy \nand civic life. This will be good for cities and suburbs, towns and \nvillages, and rural and urban America. This will be good for families. \nThis will be good for the country.\n  We have undertaken initiatives that seek to achieve these goals. Some \nseek to empower local communities to help themselves, including \nEmpowerment Zones, Community Development banks, the Community \nOpportunity Fund, community policing, and enabling local schools and \ncommunities to best meet world-class standards. And some seek to \nempower individuals and families to help themselves, including our \nexpansion of the earned-income tax cut for low- and moderate-income \nworking families, and our proposals for injecting choice and \ncompetition into public and assisted housing and for a new G.I. Bill \nfor America's Workers.\n  I am determined to end Federal budget deficits, and my balanced \nbudget proposal shows that we can balance the budget without abandoning \nthe investments that are vital to the security and prosperity of the \ncountry, now and in the future. I am confident that, working together, \nwe can build common ground on an empowerment agenda while putting our \nfiscal house in order. I will do everything in my power to make sure \nthis happens.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit an award of costs, including attorney's \nfees, or injunctive relief, against a judicial officer for action taken \nin a judicial capacity; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 THE JUDICIAL IMMUNITY RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nHeflin, Hatch, Grassley, and D'Amato, to introduce the Judicial \nImmunity Restoration Act of 1995 to protect judges from lawsuits filed \nagainst them for acts taken in their judicial capacity. This bill is \nnearly identical to legislation considered in the 100th Congress, the \n101st Congress, and most recently in the 102d Congress.\n  This legislation is needed to restore the doctrine of judicial \nimmunity by correcting the decision of the United States Supreme Court \nin Pulliam v. Allen, 456 U.S. 522 (1984). In a 5 to 4 decision, the \nSupreme Court held that judicial immunity does not bar injunctive \nrelief or an award of attorneys' fees against State court judges acting \nin their judicial capacity. The Court recognized the possible chilling \neffects its decision might have on a judge's ability to exercise \nindependent judgment. But the Supreme Court held that the Congress \nshould determine the extent of judicial immunity.\n  It is important for the Congress to clarify the extent of judicial \nimmunity to ensure that judges are free to make appropriate decisions \nin their judicial capacity without fear of reprisal. This legislation \nprohibits the award of costs or attorneys' fees against judges, both \nState and Federal, for performing the judicial functions for which they \nwere elected or appointed. In addition, this legislation removes the \nthreat of injunctions against judges for acts performed in their \njudicial capacities, except in rare circumstances when a judge refuses \nto respect a declaratory judgment.\n  Few doctrines are more important or more firmly rooted in our \njurisprudence than the notion of an independent judiciary. Judicial \nimmunity has been a fundamental tenet of our common law since \ndistinguished jurist Lord Coke held in the case of Floyd and Barker, 77 \nEng. Rep. 1305 (1607), that a judge who presided over a murder trial \nwas immune from subsequent conspiracy charges brought against him by \nthe murder defendant. Judicial independence is no less critical today, \nand remains essential to ensure justice.\n  It is time to restore the judicial immunity protections that were \nweakened by the Court's decision in Pulliam. In the 10 years since \nPulliam, thousands of Federal cases have been filed against judges and \nmagistrates. The overwhelming majority of these cases are without merit \nand are ultimately dismissed. The record from our previous hearings on \nthis issue is replete with examples of judges having to defend \nthemselves against cases that should never have been brought. The very \nprocess of defending against those actions constitutes harassment, and \nsubjects judges to undue expense. More importantly, the very real risk \nto our judges of burdensome litigation creates a chilling effect that \nmay impair the judiciary's day-to-day decisions in close and \ncontroversial cases.\n  Mr. President, an independent judiciary is a vital component in any \ndemocracy, and cannot be compromised. This bill will restore the \nindependence of all justices, judges, and judicial officers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION AGAINST AWARDS OF COSTS, INCLUDING \n                   ATTORNEY'S FEES, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST \n                   A JUDICIAL OFFICER.\n\n       (a) Nonliability for Costs.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no judicial officer shall be held liable \n     for any costs, including attorney's fees, in any action \n     brought against such officer for an act or omission taken in \n     such officer's judicial capacity, unless such action was \n     clearly in excess of such officer's jurisdiction.\n       (b) Proceedings in Vindication of Civil Rights.--Section \n     722(b) of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended \n     by inserting before the period at the end thereof ``, except \n     that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an \n     act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity \n     such officer shall not be held liable for any costs, \n     including attorney's fees, unless such action was clearly in \n     excess of such officer's jurisdiction''.\n       (c) Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights.--Section 1979 \n     of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) is amended by \n     inserting before the period at the end of the first sentence: \n     ``, except that in any action brought against a judicial \n     officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's \n     judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted \n     unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory \n     relief was unavailable''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 1116. A bill entitled ``The Broadcast and Cable Voluntary \nStandards and Practice Act''; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n      the broadcast and cable voluntary standards and practice act\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, a license to use the public airwaves to \nbroadcast or use the public rights-of-way to provide cable service is a \ntremendous privilege. To many, it is almost a license to print money. \nThe recent purchases of television networks reveal the extraordinary \nvalue of this privilege.\n  With a broadcast or cable license a company gains a key to every \nhousehold its signal can reach and access to the most intimate and \nmemorable moments of people's lives.\n  Broadcast television and radio as well as cable programming are key \nelements of our Nation's culture.\n  With this privilege should come responsibility. Some of that \nresponsibility is statutory or regulatory, for example, the \nrequirements that broadcasters and cable operators refrain from \ntransmitting obscenity; that broadcasters restrict indecency to hours \nwhen children are unlikely to be awake; and that broadcasters serve the \npublic interest.\n  Some of that responsibility comes from the marketplace, broadcasters \nand cable companies which offend American families lose their audience. \nGrassroots efforts have both saved programs from cancellation and \nquickened the demise of others.\n  Some of that responsibility comes from the ethics of broadcasters and \ncable companies as leading corporate citizens of this country. Some of \nthese corporate entities have been more responsible than others. Long \nbefore Presidential candidates have tried to shame the media, the \nSenate Commerce Committee on which I serve has attempted to focus \nattention on the destructiveness of certain trends in the popular \nculture.\n  Some of those who have not been responsible about what they put into \nAmerican homes blame the marketplace. They claim that in spite of their \ndesires to be more family friendly, the competitive environment forces \nthem to test the limits of taste and decency in the quest for viewers \nand listeners.\n  To be effective, the law, the market, and individual ethics must work \ntogether. There are some examples of success such as Senator Simon's \nlegislation which encouraged and allowed joint efforts to reduce the \namount of violent programming. But more remains to be done on all \nfronts.\n  Few can deny that there is a crisis in America. Parents, churches, \nschools are having more and more difficulty conveying values to their \nchildren. The electronic emperors of the modern age are increasingly \nreplacing parents and families as the primary source of values.\n  This is a crisis which goes deeper than violence on television it is \nalso about sex and family values in popular culture.\n  Today, sex sells everything from soft drinks to blue jeans. Daytime \ncommercial television talk shows have become \n\n[[Page S 11325]]\na virtual freak show of abuse, addiction, and alternative lifestyles. \nAnd prime time television regularly tests the limits of taste and \npropriety.\n  Year after year the situation seems to get worse. Parents try to \nteach the values of ``Mayberry'' and are overruled by the values of \n``Beverly Hills 90210.''\n  The entire premise of commercial television is that a 30- or 60-\nsecond advertisement will affect a substantial portion of an audience \nto do things which they would not otherwise do--that is, to buy a \nparticular product or service. It should be no mystery that 30- and 60-\nminute programs on television or radio have a profound effect on the \nviews and values of audiences, especially young audiences.\n  The three areas of entertainment industry responsibility--legal, \nmarket, and ethical--are ripe for careful review and discussion.\n  The legislation I introduce today attempts to empower the industry to \nbolster its ethical commitments and to take responsible self-initiated \nsteps to improve the contemporary entertainment industry. It picks up \nwhere Senator Simon's TV violence initiative left off.\n  During the so-called golden age of television, broadcasters had a \nvoluntary, but well followed, code of ``standards and practices'' known \nas the Television Code. Many of America's most memorable television \nseries from the black and white era of the fifties and sixties proudly \ndisplayed the Television Code Seal at the conclusion of each show. It \nis ironic that those moments recognized as some of television's finest \nare devoid of the coarseness, vulgarity and unpleasantness of today's \nprogramming.\n  Antitrust prosecutions in the late 1970's related to the advertising \nprovisions of the television code led to its eventual total demise in \nthe early 1980s.\n  The legislation I introduce today would allow the television and \ncable industry to revise a voluntary code of standards and practices. \nSuch private sector empowerment may be useful in reducing the crudity \nand coarseness in the modern entertainment industry.\n  While the Congress reviews ways to strengthen the legal \nresponsibility of television and cable industry through legislation to \nlimit violent programming and to strengthen the market forces through \nthe public disclosure of violence report cards, I ask my colleagues to \ngive serious consideration to the legislation I introduce today. The \nBroadcast and Cable Voluntary Standards and Practices Act will at least \nempower the entertainment industry to strengthen its ethical commitment \nto the American family.\n  I urge my colleagues to review and support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Ford, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 1117. A bill to repeal AFDC and establish the Work First plan, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the work first welfare reform plan\n   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with my \ncolleagues Senator Breaux and Senator Mikulski, the Work First plan. We \nare joined today by Senators Rockefeller, Reid, Bob Kerrey, Ford, \nDorgan, Dodd, and John Kerry, our entire Democratic leadership, as well \nas Senators Lieberman, Conrad, Bingaman, and Bryan.\n   We are gratified to have the broad bipartisan support of State and \nlocal leaders across the country. The bipartisan U.S. Conference of \nMayors unanimously endorsed the Work First plan last month. The bill \nalso has the support of the National Council of Elected County \nExecutives, the Democratic Governors' Association, and many State \nlegislators. The President has also endorsed our plan.\n   Our bill has four fundamental goals. First, we emphasize work. Our \nbill is designed to move welfare recipients from welfare to work. To \nput work first in priority. Second, our bill protects children. We do \nnot punish children to pay for the mistakes or circumstances of their \nparents. Third, we do all we can to break the cycle of dependency. \nFourth, we want to give States maximum flexibility.\n   The welfare system cannot be fundamentally changed without \nfundamentally changing the welfare culture.\n   Under the Work First plan, welfare offices are turned into \nemployment offices. Welfare staff are retrained to focus on employment \nfirst. Gone are the micromanaging rules of today. We encourage states \nto consolidate and streamline their efforts to simplify administration \nand to restore common sense to a system that has become too \nbureaucratic.\n   Under the Work First plan, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \n[AFDC] is eliminated. We do not modify it or revamp it. We do not ship \nit off to the States. We terminate it outright.\n   In its place, we create a conditional entitlement of limited \nduration. Referred to as ``Temporary Employment Assistance,'' this new \nprogram is a dramatic change from AFDC.\n   There must be no more unconditional assistance. Everyone must \ncontribute to the effort to change the welfare culture.\n   Toward that end, all recipients of Temporary Employment Assistance \nmust sign a contract. This contract, called a Parent Empowerment \nContract, is based on the Iowa model. Essentially it is a blueprint for \nemployment. It spells out what each welfare recipient is expected to do \nto become employed and to be a responsible parent.\n   To obtain assistance, applicants must sign the contract. Those who \ndo not sign, who are unwilling to accept personal responsibility for \nimproving their situation--will not get assistance. The contract is a \ncommitment, and those who do not abide by the contract will have their \nbenefits reduced and ultimately terminated.\n   All able-bodied recipients are required to work. Even those who are \nnot able-bodied, those who might be disabled or caring for a disabled \nchild, must do something in return for assistance. States will decide \nwhat they will be required to do. It could be volunteering at their \nchild's school, or ensuring that their children are properly immunized, \nor some other task or responsibility the State determines is fair and \nreasonable.\n   Again, there must be no more unconditional assistance.\n  Temporary Employment Assistance is temporary. There is a 5 year \nlifetime limit for Temporary Employment Assistance that may be waived \nonly to protect children, disabled individuals, or other special cases. \nApplicants will know from day one that help will be available for a \nfinite period.\n   Temporary Employment Assistance is flexible. States set their own \nrules for eligibility. States set their own maximum benefit levels. \nStates set their own resource limits, asset limits, and income \ndisregard policies.\n   All we require is that if a family meets those eligibility criteria \nset by the State, that family must receive assistance. That is one of \nthe basic differences between our plan and the Republican plans. We all \nprovide flexibility. We all let States set their own benefits. But, we \nsay that families of similar income, or lack of income, ought to \nreceive assistance based on their degree of poverty, not their place in \nline, or the time of year they applied.\n   A block grant, like the one approved by the Senate Finance \nCommittee, is a first-come, first-served policy. What matters most is \nyour place in line--not your level of need. We believe that is wrong.\n   As part of the effort to change the welfare culture and put welfare \nrecipients to work, the Work First plan terminates the current JOBS \nprogram. Gone are the micromanaging rules under JOBS. We recognize that \nsome welfare recipients made modest gains under JOBS. But, we believe \nthat States ought to have far more flexibility to put welfare \nrecipients to work.\n   Therefore, we replace the current JOBS program with a Work First \nEmployment Block Grant. Under Work First, the focus is on job creation \nand employment in the private sector.\n   Once an individual receives Temporary Employment Assistance, she \nwould spend up to two months in intensive job search activities to be \ndesigned by the States. At that point, we hope \n\n[[Page S 11326]]\nthat the most job-ready of welfare recipients will have found a job and \nbegun the transition out of welfare.\n   For those who have not found a job after 2 months, States can offer \na variety of options under the Work First Employment Block Grant: \nplacement services or vouchers; microenterprise or self-employment \nactivities; work supplementation; grant diversion; workfare; community \nservice; something like the GAIN program in Riverside County, CA; \nsomething like the JOBS Plus program in Oregon that provides clients \nwith on-the-job training by cashing out AFDC and Food Stamps in return \nfor wages; something like the Family Investment program in Iowa that \nmoves families off welfare and into self-sufficient employment; or any \nother work-related option to employ welfare recipients.\n  For States that exceed the work performance rates under the Work \nFirst plan, we will provide bonuses on a per-person basis to the State. \nThe bonuses are based on job retention. After the first 3 months, a \nState will receive one-third of the bonus. After 6 months, a State will \nreceive another third. And, after 9 months of work, States will receive \nthe final third.\n   As I said before, the objective of our plan is work first. That is \nthe name of our bill, and that is our absolute goal. We not only want \nto move welfare recipients into the workforce. We want to keep them \nthere.\n   As we consider welfare reform, there will undoubtedly be vigorous \ndebate about various facts and statistics. But there is no denying one \nfact. And, that is that the overwhelming majority of welfare recipients \nare women, mothers raising children alone.\n   That is why it is no surprise that the greatest barrier for moving \nwelfare recipients from welfare to work is the lack of child care, the \ninability to afford child care, and the anxiety about leaving one's \nchild in the care of another.\n   We believe that the linchpin between welfare and work is child care. \nWe believe that if we help mothers afford child care and help \ncommunities expand child care opportunities, we will tear down that \nbarrier.\n   An investment in child care today pays off in two ways tomorrow. \nFirst, it enables welfare recipients to go to work. And second, quality \nchild care provides a positive environment for children to better \nprepare for school and a life free of welfare.\n   If we are serious about putting welfare recipients to work, then we \nneed to be equally serious about providing child care assistance.\n   To date, the focus of welfare reform has been on work. An essential \npart of that debate ought to be about child care assistance.\n   To leave her house, to get a job, to keep that job, a mother first \nmust be able to find and afford child care. If we are going to retain \nwomen, particularly single women, in the workforce, then we need to \ninvest in child care.\n   Another barrier to employment is the lack of health coverage. For \nmany child care if has not become an insurmountable problem, then \nhealth care coverage has.\n   It is well know that many low wage jobs, often the only jobs \navailable to welfare recipients, do not come with health care coverage. \nAnd we all know of stories of women who left welfare for work only to \nface a health care crisis and realize that welfare with Medicaid \ncoverage is their only viable option. The incentives under the current \nsystem are all wrong. We have to make work pay.\n   That is why under Work First, we provide for 2 years of Medicaid \ncoverage for those transitioning from welfare to work.\n   I know that, ideally, this problem should be considered within the \ncontext of overall healthcare reform. But, until that happens, through \ntransitional Medicaid coverage, we have provided an incentive to keep \nwomen in the workforce.\n   Another critical issue in the welfare debate is teen pregnancy. I \nhave talked to many experts throughout the country and in South Dakota \nabout teen pregnancy. No one has come up with the perfect solution.\n   Under the Work First plan, mothers are required to live at home or \nin an adult-supervised environment. They are required to stay in \nschool. States are free to reduce benefits to those who do not and \nprovide bonuses to those who do.\n   Because there is no one-size-fits-all answer to reducing teen \npregnancy, the Work First plan offers grants to States to work with \ncommunities to develop their own innovative approaches to reduce teen \npregnancy.\n   With regard to absent parents and child support enforcement, our \nmessage is clear. The Work First plan includes the Bradley-Snowe \nprovisions to improve child support enforcement and bring about \nuniformity to interstate cases so that they will no longer be \nimpossible to enforce.\n   The Work First plan also goes one step further. Noncustodial parents \nwith overdue support orders are required to pay up, enter into a \nrepayment plan, or choose between community service and jail.\n   No longer will deadbeat parents be able to escape their financial \nresponsibility. It is a crime that the default rate on used cars is \nabout 3 percent, while the default rate on child support orders hovers \naround 50 percent. No longer. Not under the Work First plan.\n   The Work First plan is really about priorities. It is a priority for \nus to fundamentally change the welfare system to put welfare recipients \nto work--not to put them on someone else's doorstep.\n   We cut existing welfare and welfare-related programs and invest \nthose savings in efforts to promote work and child care. Beyond the \ninvestments we make, we have savings of about $15 billion so that we \nnot only put welfare recipients to work, but we reduce the deficit at \nthe same time.\n   The time has come for fundamental change. The Work First plan is a \npragmatic approach that focuses on work--private sector work.\n   We are told that the Senate will begin debating welfare reform on \nSaturday. I look forward to reviewing the revised Republican plan and \ncomparing it to our plan. And I continue to urge my colleagues, on both \nsides of the aisle, to review the Work First plan.\n   Welfare reform should not be a partisan issue. It is time to put \npolitics aside and get down to the business we were sent here to do. If \nwe do that, there is no doubt in my mind that we can develop a welfare \nreform package that garners a large consensus in the Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with the \nDemocratic leader in introducing the work first bill. It is the \nDemocratic leadership's welfare reform bill.\n  We Democrats believe that welfare should not be a way of life but a \nway to a better life. The people on welfare agree that it is a mess. \nThe taxpayers who pay for welfare agree that it is a mess. All agree \nthat the current system does not work, and all agree that it needs to \nbe replaced. It discourages work and economic self-sufficiency.\n  Therefore, the Democratic work first bill addresses these concerns. \nThat is why we are absolutely firm on work. That is why the Democratic \nbill that we introduce today not only moves people off of welfare but \nhelps them stay off.\n  The Republican welfare bill simply pushes people off welfare and \npushes them into poverty. The Democrats have a work first plan. It \nfocuses on ending the cycle of poverty and the culture of poverty. How \ndo we do it? Our bill ends AFDC and creates a temporary employment \nassistance program. We require job readiness assessments of each adult \njob placement, job search, and on-the-job work activity. We require \nthem to sign a parent empowerment contract that requires them to take \nthe steps they need to go to work and be responsible parents. Then we \nexpect the individuals to go to work.\n  But while being firm on work, we provide these individuals with the \ntools they need to get a job and keep a job. We also provide a safety \nnet for children. That means quality day care for 2 years as parents go \nto work, the extension of health care protection, and making sure that \na child has health care while their mothers are moving to work and \nself-sufficiency. This also means we look out for the food and \nnutrition programs.\n  The Democratic bill also brings men back into the family. Sure, we \nare very tough on child support. We strengthen the child support rules. \nBut we do not look at men only as a child support check. We want men \nback into the family. We want to remove the barriers to \n\n[[Page S 11327]]\nfamily, the barriers to marriage, because we believe the way the family \nis going to move out of poverty is the way people move to the middle \nclass, with two-parent wage earners. That is why we will eliminate the \nman-in-the-house rule and other barriers to men being in the family.\n  The Democratic plan also tackles the growing problem of teenage \npregnancy. Under our bill, teen mothers must stay in school and stay at \nhome as a condition of receiving benefits. If they stay in a home that \nis not desirable, where they are a victim of abuse, or where there is \nalcoholism or drug abuse, we create a network of second-chance homes. \nThe work first plan also gives broad flexibility to States, \nadministrative simplification and helps with those issues that \nGovernors have complained about.\n  Finally the Democratic welfare bill saves money and lowers the \ndeficit. Through a series of reforms in the current system and the \nelimination of fraud and waste, our bill will have a net savings of $21 \nbillion over a 7-year period.\n  This work first bill is an act of tough love. Sure it is tough, but \nwe have a lot of love in it. As we approach welfare reform, we ask \npeople to take charge of their lives and go to work. In exchange for \nthat, we give them the tools to stay at work, the opportunity for a \nbetter life, enable them to marry. And I believe that our bill brings \nabout real reform because we do not have requirements, we have results \nand resources.\n  I hope that this bill will attract bipartisan support and we can \ntruly end welfare as we know it.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Maryland \nfor the excellent job she has done. As a former professional social \nworker, when Barbara Mikulski speaks about welfare reform, she does not \nspeak from having read a book about it; she speaks from having led a \nlife of trying to improve the conditions of lives of people who have \nhad the great misfortune of being on welfare.\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief. Today is an important day \nbecause today the Democratic leadership, with a number of cosponsors, a \nmajority of all Democrats, have introduced our Work First welfare \nreform bill. It is a major document. It is a major document because it \nmakes major changes in the current welfare system that we, as \nDemocrats, and I think most Republicans would agree welfare as we know \nit today simply does not work.\n  I know of only a few people who may stand up anywhere and say the \nsystem we have is a good system. It does not work well for the people \nwho are on it and it does not work well for the people who are paying \nfor it.\n  I think there is a general consensus that we have to make major \nchanges. How we make those changes is the subject, I think, of \nlegitimate debate. There are a lot of different suggestions about what \nshould be done to make it work better than it has worked in the past. I \nsuggest that any program that is tough on work, any program that is \ngood for children, is a movement in the right direction as to what we \nas a Congress should be doing.\n  It was an issue at the last Presidential campaign. I hope it will not \nbe an issue in the next Presidential campaign, because I hope by that \ntime we will have adopted a real bipartisan program that is good for \nall Americans.\n  We, as Democrats, could not do this by ourselves. I suggest that our \nRepublican colleagues, by themselves, cannot do it either.\n  Therefore, this is a subject that will have to have bipartisan \nagreement. We are going to bring a real welfare reform bill to the \nPresident's desk, one that he can sign in this Congress. That should be \nthe goal of all of us, Republicans or Democrats.\n  Let me just suggest that the bill that we are introducing today, the \nDemocratic Work First Program, is an excellent vehicle. I wish all of \nour colleagues would join and we could pass it unanimously. I know that \nthat is not likely.\n  I do think that it presents a document in a package of principles \nthat we can all agree on and then tinker around the edges to make it a \npolitically acceptable document to all of our colleagues.\n  Our bill starts off by recognizing that the current system does not \nwork. We abolished the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the \nAFDC program, which has been around for so long. We are saying that in \nthe 1990's it does not work. Not only does it have to be changed a \nlittle bit, it has to be changed a lot. Not only does it have to be \nchanged, it should be abolished, and start off with a new program.\n  That is what we have in our document. We replace Aid to Families with \nDependent Children with a temporary employment system that requires \npeople, when they walk into the welfare office, to sign a contract. \nThat contract is going to get them starting to look for a job from the \nfirst day. If they do not follow the terms of the contract, their \nbenefits can be reduced.\n  I think that is something that is incredibly important. They start \nfrom the first day they walk in the office looking for a job. The best \nsocial program that this Congress can pass is a good job, not another \nFederal program, but a good job for someone who currently is under \nwelfare assistance in their particular State.\n  The program that we are offering abolishes the current system, starts \nover with a temporary employment program from the very first day. There \nare penalties and there are time limits. We are saying that people \ncannot be on welfare assistance forever. There is a 2-year time limit, \nand a total of 5 years in a person's life that they would be eligible \nfor welfare assistance.\n  We also, I think, protect children. We also say to States that we are \nnot going to give you an unfunded mandate to do things without helping \nyou pay for those programs.\n  One of my concerns about the bill that came out of the Finance \nCommittee was that we froze the amount of money going to the States at \n1994 levels, yet we are telling States they have to do a lot more with \na lot less. That is not real reform.\n  I suggest that plan is like putting all the welfare problems in a box \nand then mailing that box to the States and say, ``Here, it is yours. \nWe are washing our hands of the problem. You take it. We will give you \nless money to fix it.''\n  That is not reform. That is passing the buck. That is not what we \nshould be doing in this Congress.\n  Our program is real reform. We should not be arguing, I suggest, as \nto whether the Federal Government should do it or the State should do \nit. The fact is we both should do it. The Federal Government should \nwork with the States and give them more flexibility, and the Federal \nGovernment should be there as a partner--not as a supervisor, not as a \nbig heavy hand from Washington, but as a partner--with the States to \nwork on what is best for a particular State.\n  Our bill does that. It gives great flexibility to the States to \ndevise the proper system that works in their State, to design what is \nbest for the State of Mississippi, the State of Louisiana, Maryland or \nCalifornia, or whatever State is involved. Let the States design the \nprogram.\n  We, as Federal officials who raise the money to pay for those \nprograms, should not be unconcerned with how those funds are spent. \nThere should be some national standards. There should be some national \nparameters.\n  We, for instance, feel that States should not be able to tell \nchildren who are innocent victims, who did not ask to be born, that \nthey somehow will lose any benefits that they have to live because of \nthe mistakes of their parents. We think that is hard. We think that is \ncruel. We think that should not be the policy of this country.\n  We think, however, parents should be penalized when they make \nmistakes. We think parents who refuse to work should be penalized for \nnot wanting to work. Our bill does that by reducing the benefits to \nadults who refuse to live by the terms of their contract. I think that \nis good.\n  We do not say in our bill to an innocent baby who did not ask to be \nborn that because your parent is a teenager, we are going to penalize \nyour life and make it more difficult for you to be a functioning \ncitizen in this society.\n  Mr. President, our bill may not be perfect. We are not saying it is. \nWe are not saying that perhaps it cannot be improved by amendments, \nbecause perhaps it can be. What we are saying is that our Work First \nProgram is a solid package that is going to arrive out \n\n[[Page S 11328]]\nwith a lot of debate, a lot of discussion, where liberals and moderates \nand conservatives within our party have been able to come together and \njoin hands and introduce this as a work first welfare package, which I \nthink makes a great deal of sense.\n  We encourage our Republican colleagues, we challenge our Republican \ncolleagues, to introduce your bill, to start the debate --not in an \nadversarial relationship, because this is something that truly should \nnot be Republican or Democrat. We should be looking for an American \nsolution to a uniquely American problem.\n  We all agree it does not work today. We all agree it needs to be \nfixed. We should come together and work together and get the type of \nprogram that this President is willing to sign and that we all can be \nproud of the ultimate results. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \ntoday to introduce our Work First welfare reform legislation. This \nCongress has an historic opportunity to address the welfare crisis. The \nprimary welfare program--Aid to Families With Dependent Children \n[AFDC]--is viewed by those participating in it and those paying for it \nas a failure. It is failing at its most important task--moving people \ninto the work force. Worse yet, it is contributing to the cycle of \npoverty. By rewarding single parents who don't work, don't marry, and \nhave children out of wedlock, the current system demeans our most \ncherished values and deepens society's most serious problems.\n  The Work First plan repeals the failed AFDC Program and replaces it \nwith a temporary employment assistance program focused on putting \npeople to work. It gives States the flexibility and incentives they \nneed to successfully move people into private sector jobs. And it \naddresses two key causes of welfare dependency through tough new child \nsupport enforcement laws and provisions to reduce out-of-wedlock births \nto teenagers.\n  The Work First Program ends unconditional benefits that foster \ndependency. Each person receiving assistance will sign an\n individualized contract for achieving self-sufficiency. If recipients \ndo not comply with the plan, then they will lose some or all of their \nbenefits. While the plan may include some training or education, the \nemphasis will be squarely on work experience; all recipients will be \nrequired to search for a job from day one.\n\n  Eligibility for benefits will be limited to 5 years, although \nchildren whose parents reach this time limit will still be eligible for \nassistance. We must continue to meet our responsibility to our Nation's \npoorest children.\n  States must focus their program directly on placing people in private \nsector jobs. The bill requires States to have at least 50 percent of \ntheir caseload working by the year 2001. It moves away from telling \nStates how to succeed and instead rewards results--States that have \nhigh private sector job placement rates will receive a financial bonus.\n  Our work requirements are tough and funded. We understand that child \ncare assistance is the critical link between welfare and work and, \nunlike Republican welfare proposals, our bill gives States the child \ncare funding they need to put people in jobs and move them off of \nwelfare. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, \nunder the Republican proposal, only 6 States could afford to put 50 \npercent of people on welfare to work.\n  The legislation also tackles the critical problem of teen pregnancy. \nUnmarried teen parents are particularly likely to fall into long-term \nwelfare dependency. More than one-half of welfare spending goes to \nwomen who first gave birth as teens. This legislation, among other \nthings, requires teen mothers to live at home and helps communities \nestablish supervised group homes for single teen mothers.\n  Finally, the bill incorporates strong child support enforcement \nlegislation Senator Bradley introduced, and I cosponsored, earlier this \nyear. The legislation will make it easier for States to locate absent \nnoncustodial parents; establish paternity; establish a court order; and \nenforce payment of court orders. A tough child support enforcement \nsystem will help keep millions of children out of poverty and off of \nwelfare. And tougher laws will send a message of responsibility to \nwould-be dead-beat parents. In an era of skyrocketing out-of-wedlock \nbirths and rising teen pregnancy rates, child support enforcement \npayments must become a well-known and unavoidable fact of life for \nabsent fathers and mothers.\n  The work first plan is true welfare reform. It demands responsibility \nfrom parents while providing continued protection for children. It \naddresses two of the key causes of welfare dependency--teen pregnancy \nand unpaid child support. It gives States the incentives and funding \nthey need to put people back to work--and it holds States accountable \nfor results.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Glenn):\n  S. 1118. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of bone mass measurements for certain individuals \nunder part B of the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the bone mass measurement standardization act of 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bone Mass \nMeasurement Standardization Act of 1995. A companion bill is being \nintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representative \nConnie Morella.\n  Millions of women in their post-menopausal years face a silent killer \n* * * a stalker disease we know as osteoporosis. This unforgiving bone \ndisease afflicts 25 million Americans; causes 50,000 deaths each year; \n1.5 million bone fractures annually; and the direct medical costs of \nosteoporosis fracture patients are $10 billion each year, or $27 \nmillion every single day. This cost is projected to reach $60 billion \nby the year 2020 and $240 billion by the year 2040 if medical research \nhas not discovered an effective treatment.\n  The facts also show that one out of every two women have a lifetime \nrisk of bone fractures due to osteoporosis, and that it affects half of \nall women over the age of 50 and an astounding 90 percent of all women \nover 75. Perhaps the most tragic consequences of osteoporosis occur \nwith the 250,000 individuals annually who suffer a hip fracture. Twelve \nto 13 percent of these persons will die within 6 months following a hip \nfracture, and of those who survive, a 20 percent will never walk again, \nand 20 percent will require nursing home care--often for the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  We all know that osteoporosis cannot be cured, although with a \ncontinued commitment to research in this area I remain hopeful that we \nwill find one. We also know that once bone mass is lost, it cannot be \nreplaced. Therefore, early detection is our best weapon because it is \nthrough early detection, that we can thwart the progress of the disease \nand initiate preventative efforts to stop further loss of bone mass.\n  Bone mass measurement can be used to determine the status of a \nperson's bone health and to predict the risk of future fractures. These \ntests are safe, painless, accurate and quick. Our expanding technology \nis adding new methods to determine bone mass and we need to keep up \nwith this technology. The most commonly used test currently is DXA dual \nenergy x ray absorptiometry.\n  In order to ensure that we detect bone loss early, we need to ensure \nthat older women have coverage for bone mass tests. According to the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation, only about one half of private \ninsurance policies cover these tests for diagnostic purposes, and the \nFederal Medicare coverage is inconsistent in its coverage depending on \nwhere an individual resides. For example, Medicare currently covers the \nDXA test in 42 States--including my home State of Maine. But it is not \ncovered in 4 States and the District of Columbia, and it is covered \nonly in parts of 4 additional States, some of which are our most \npopulous, including New York.\n  This patchwork coverage means that on older women who lives in \nFlorida will be covered, but if she moves to Pennsylvania, she will not \nbe. And a Medicare beneficiary living in Baltimore will be covered, but \nif she moves to Rockville, Medicare will not cover the test.\n  Mr. President, a woman shouldn't have to change zip codes to obtain \ncoverage for a preventive test, especially when early intervention is \nthe only action we can take right now to slow the \n\n[[Page S 11329]]\nloss of bone mass. Once it is lost, it cannot be replaced.\n  The Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Standardization Act will clarify \nthe Medicare coverage policy for DXA testing to make it uniform in all \nStates. It also will provide an expanded definition of the types of \ntests covered for bone mass measurement in order to keep up with the \nexpanding technology in this area.\n  We all know that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure''. \nThis bill will ensure that older women, regardless of where they live, \nwill have access to bone mass measurement technology that will help \ndetect bone loss and allow preventive steps to be taken. It is our only \nweapon right now in the fight against osteoporosis.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1119. A bill to define the circumstances under which earthquake \ninsurance requirements may be imposed by the Federal Home Loan Mortage \nCorporation on a specifically targeted State or area; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n           the earthquake insurance availability act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Earthquake \nInsurance Availability Act of 1995.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that all 50 States in \nour Nation are treated equally by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \nCorporation with respect to special insurance requirements, \nspecifically earthquake insurance.\n  The legislation I am introducing today specifies that earthquake \ninsurance requirements targeted to a specific state, by the Federal \nHome Loan Mortage Corporation, may be imposed only after the State \ninsurance commissioner for the affected State certifies in writing \nthat: First, reasonable insurance capacity exists in the State; and, \nsecond, compliance would not cause undue hardship for citizens of the \nState.\n  Mr. President, nobody in this Chamber is more aware of the threat of \nearthquakes than I am. I have seen the devastation they can cause, and \nI know of the terrible hardships, loss of life, and loss of property \nthey leave behind.\n  Let me begin by saying that I believe everyone should have adequate \ninsurance on their home to protect against hazards--including natural \ndisasters.\n  The problem is, however, that adequate insurance is not always \navailable. This is especially true, in California, with respect to \nearthquake insurance.\n  The truth is no region of our country is immune to natural disasters. \nIn the last decade, different parts of our Nation have been hit by \nhurricanes, tornadoes, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic \neruptions, and firestorms, and I believe that it is essential that \nCongress enact natural disaster legislation as quickly as possible.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the Natural Disaster Protection and \nInsurance Act recently introduced by the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye.\n  In the interim, however, my State of California which has experienced \nsignificant earthquakes in recent years--the Loma Prieta earthquake in \n1989; and the Northridge earthquake in 1994--has experienced a sharp \ndrop in the availability of earthquake insurance.\n  Simply stated, since the Northridge earthquake, many major insurers \nhave pulled out of the California market. Many others have increased \ntheir premiums to such a point that they are beyond the reach of many \nhomeowners, and even then there are very steep deductibles.\n  Recently the situation became much worse, for owners of California \ncondominiums, when the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company--commonly \nknown as Freddie Mac--issued a policy requiring earthquake insurance, \nonly for California condominiums, as a condition of purchase of \nmortgages.\n  I believe this policy, which targets only one State, is inappropriate \nfor a federally chartered corporation which was created by Congress in \n1970 to ensure a stable flow of mortgage funds for the entire Nation.\n  This policy which, in a way, redlines my State, is designed to \nminimize Freddie Mac's loss in the event of a future earthquake in \nCalifornia.\n  I can understand why the corporation feels the need to protect its \nshareholders from potentially lower dividends. But Freddie Mac, while a \nstockholder-owned corporation, enjoys considerable tax benefits by \nvirtue of its Federal charter.\n  I believe that those benefits are provided by the American taxpaying \npublic--which includes, I might add, many Californians--to assist \nFreddie Mac in accomplishing its mission of helping more Americans \nbecome homeowners.\n  California still lags the Nation in its recovery, and the economy \nthere is very fragile. In implementing its new policy, Freddie Mac, in \neffect, is reducing the number of options for California homeowners, \nand this will have a direct impact on the value of their homes. I \nbelieve this sets a dangerous precedent for other parts of the country \nwhich are prone to natural disaster.\n  I am not unsympathetic to Freddie Mac's position, and I have \nindicated a willingness to sit down with them and work out a solution. \nBut that solution must take into consideration the underlying problem--\nwhich is the lack of earthquake insurance availability.\n  In addition, the solution must take into consideration not only the \nprotection of Freddie Mac's investors. It must also include the \nprotection of the homeowners of my State, for it is they whom I was \nelected to represent.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues \nattention to a report just released by the General Accounting Office \nthat I requested on May 24, 1995. The report is entitled ``Superfund: \nInformation on Current Health Risks,'' and it examines the actual, \ncurrent health risks at Superfund sites. I believe the results of this \nstudy are very surprising, and may have very important implications for \nthe Superfund budget and possibly for Superfund reauthorization.\n  At the recent White House Conference on Small Business, Superfund \nreform was voted the No. 5 issue out of literally hundreds of topics of \nconcern to small business. As these small businesses representatives \nknow all too well Superfund liability is literally killing many small \nbusinesses. As chairman of the Small Business Committee in addition to \nbeing a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for the EPA, I asked GAO to \nprepare this report because I wanted to get a better understanding of \nthe reduction in health risks and other benefits of the money spent on \nSuperfund.\n  The GAO report looked at EPA's own data from 225 recent records of \ndecision signed between 1991 and mid-1993. These are the sites that \nwill soon be moving into the expensive construction phase and will be \ndriving a big portion of the Superfund budget in the next few years.\n  The report found that less than one third of the sites posed health \nrisks serious enough to warrant a cleanup under current land uses. Some \nof the sites in this category have no current exposure and hence no \ncurrent risk. However, under current land uses, there could be a risk \nin the future if, for example, a ground water plume migrated to a \ncurrently used drinking water source. So this category is over-\ninclusive if anything. In addition, about one-half of the other sites \nin this category used to pose a health risk but a removal action has \nalready been completed to address any immediate risks.\n  Over one-half of the 225 sites do not pose any risk warranting a \ncleanup under existing conditions, although they might pose a risk in \nthe future if current land use patterns change. The remaining 15 \npercent of the sites do not pose risks serious enough to warrant \ncleanup under existing conditions or under foreseeable future \nconditions. They are already in EPA's target risk range for completed \ncleanups.\n  The implications of these findings are profound. Superfund sites \nclearly do not threaten the health of millions of Americans. As is \noften stated in fact, if we stopped conducting Superfund remedial \nactions altogether there are only a few sites that would have any \nimpact on human health today. However, I do not think we can conclude \nfrom this report that Superfund should be abolished entirely, this \nreport shows that some sites do indeed pose a risk to health, and other \nsites may pose environmental risks sufficient to warrant cleanup, but \ndramatic reform is clearly needed.\n  I believe this report can help us to use our increasingly scarce \nFederal dollars more wisely, without putting anyone's health at risk. \nIn fact, I think we can use this report to protect people's health by \nbetter prioritizing EPA's efforts on sites posing current health risks. \nThis doesn't mean we should ignore environmental risks or future risks, \nbut current health risks should be our first priority.\n  The decline in overall discretionary spending in forcing us to make \nsignificant changes in the EPA's budget. As chairman of the VA, HUD, \nand Independent Agencies Subcommittee, I must make reductions totaling \nmore than $9 billion in budget authority from the fiscal year 1995 VA-\nHUD bill. This is a reduction of about 12 percent, and will impact \nvirtually all of the agencies under my subcommittee's jurisdiction, \nincluding the Department of Veterans Affairs, HUD, NASA, EPA, and the \nNational Science Foundation, to name a few. This reduction in \ndiscretionary spending will mean that increases for any program will be \nnearly impossible.\n  Clearly, in coming years, the Agency will simply have to get used to \ndoing more with less. The Superfund Program will not be exempt from \nthese changes. With decreasing resources available to EPA, Superfund \ncan be expected to take its share of cuts. In this tight budgetary \nclimate, it is only prudent to plan for smaller budgets by focusing on \nprioritizing among Superfund NPL sites.\n  The taxes funding the Superfund trust fund are set to expire on \nDecember 31, 1995.\n  Legislation to reauthorize Superfund is currently moving through \nCongress that will bring much needed reform to the program. Fiscal year \n1996 will likely be a transition year for the Superfund Program. I want \nto ensure that the transition is an orderly one and the Agency can \navoid the problems encountered by the program during the last \ntransition in 1985 and 1986.\n  In my opinion, the highest priority of the Superfund Program should \nbe to protect current risks to human health and to ensure that sites on \nthe national priorities list are not currently causing illness. It is \ninappropriate to expend significant resources on remedial action at \nsites that will only pose a risk in the future, and only under changed \ncircumstances, while sites that pose a health risk today--that are \nmaking people sick today--go unaddressed.\n  Currently, the Agency is not doing a sufficient job or prioritizing \nits resources to address the worst sites first, in part because it does \nnot distinguish between current risks, future risks under current land \nuses and future risks that will only exist under changed circumstances. \nIn response to a question by the Appropriations Subcommittee on how the \nAgency prioritizes its Superfund resources, EPA responded, ``Once sites \nare listed on the NPL, Ban effort is made to maintain a stable pipeline \nof projects in the remedial process through resource allocation \ndecisions.'' I am very concerned that by its own admission, EPA is \nplacing a greater emphasis on bureaucratic convenience than on ongoing \nimpacts to human health.\n  Our first obligation must be to protect the health of people who live \naround Superfund sites to stop people from getting sick due to real, \nongoing exposures. It seems wrong to divert funds from these sites to \nsites that might only pose a risk warranting cleanup under changed \ncircumstances simply ``to maintain a stable pipeline of projects.''\n  This GAO Report shows that Superfund is even more broken than we \nrealized. I urge all my colleagues to read this report and consider its \nfindings as we move forward to fund the program in fiscal year 1996 and \nto reauthorize the Superfund Program. I ask that the GAO Report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The report follows:\n             SUPERFUND--Information on Current Health Risks\n\n         U.S. General Accounting Office, Resources, Community, and \n           Economic Development Division,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Superfund cost estimates are growing at \n     a substantial rate. The Superfund program was authorized \n     through 1994 at $15.2 billion, covering over 1,100 nonfederal \n     sites on the National Priorities List (NPL).\\1\\ These figures \n     could grow to $75 billion (in 1994 dollars) and 4,500 \n     nonfederal sites, according to the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO).\\2\\ Because of these escalating costs, \n     congressional decision makers want to know more about the \n     human health risks addressed by the program. Although the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     recently testified to the Congress that approximately 73 \n     million people live fewer than 4 miles from at least one \n     Superfund site, much debate has occurred about the extent to \n     which these sites pose health risks for cancer or other \n     conditions, such as birth defects or nerve or liver damage.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       To help measure the health risks from Superfund sites, you \n     asked us to provide the best available information on (1) the \n     extent to which sites may pose health risks under \n\n[[Page S 11337]]\n     current land uses, as opposed to the risks that may develop if land \n     uses change in the future; the nature of the current risks; \n     and the types of environmental media (e.g., groundwater, \n     soil, or air) that pose these risks and (2) whether EPA's \n     short-term response actions to mitigate the health risks from \n     Superfund sites have reduced the risks under current land \n     uses. This report presents our findings on these issues as \n     they relate to the 225 nonfederal NPL sites contained in \n     EPA's data base on health risks from Superfund sites--the \n     most comprehensive automated information available as of \n     early 1995. These sites constitute most of the sites where \n     EPA made cleanup decisions between 1991 and mid-1993. As \n     agreed with your office, in our ongoing work for you we will \n     examine other related issues, such as the nature of health \n     risks from the Superfund sites under future changes in land \n     use.\n                            Results in Brief\n\n       About one-third (or 71) of the 225 sites contained in EPA's \n     data base posed health risks serious enough to warrant \n     cleanup, given current land uses.\\3\\ About another one-half \n     (or 119) of the 225 sites did not pose serious health risks \n     under current land uses but posed such health risks under \n     EPA's projections about future changes in land use. The \n     remainder of the sites did not pose health risks serious \n     enough to warrant cleanup action under either current or \n     future land uses. However, EPA may decide to clean up these \n     remaining sites to comply with other federal or state \n     regulations or because of a threat to the environment, such \n     as contamination endangering a wetland. The current health \n     risks at the 71 sites usually occurred through a single \n     environmental medium, most commonly groundwater or soil. Of \n     these 71 sites, 28 percent posed cancer risks; 30 percent \n     posed risks for noncancer conditions, such as birth defects \n     or nerve or liver damage; and the remainder posed risks for \n     both cancer and other, noncancer conditions.\n       According to officials from EPA's Office of Emergency and \n     Remedial Response, EPA's short-term response actions have \n     temporarily mitigated the health risks that could immediately \n     endanger the population surrounding the 71 sites that posed \n     serious health risks under current land uses. Under EPA's \n     policy, whenever a Superfund site poses such a health risk, a \n     short-term response, known as a ``removal action,'' will be \n     undertaken. EPA's data indicate that various removal actions \n     have occurred at 31 of the 71 sites. EPA officials caution \n     that while removal actions clearly reduce health risks, \n     information is not readily available to determine the extent \n     to which the removal actions taken at these 31 sites affected \n     the risks reported in the data base. The remaining 40 sites \n     did not pose immediate risks substantial enough to warrant \n     removal actions, according to the officials, although the \n     sites still pose longer-term health risks under current land \n     uses. For example, at some sites contaminated groundwater \n     that does not immediately endanger surrounding populations \n     may eventually reach the drinking water supplies used by \n     current residents, thereby posing an eventual health risk.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       With the enactment of CERCLA in 1980, the Congress created \n     the Superfund program authorizing EPA, among other things, to \n     clean up contamination at hazardous waste sites. CERCLA also \n     created a trust fund available for various cleanup activities \n     and authorized EPA to compel the parties responsible for \n     these sites to help conduct or pay for the cleanup. The \n     Superfund program was extended in 1986 and in 1990 and is now \n     being considered for reauthorization. Under CERCLA, EPA \n     assesses contaminated areas and then places the sites it \n     considers to be the most highly contaminated on the NPL for \n     further investigation and cleanup.\n       EPA responds to hazardous substances at Superfund sites \n     through ``removal'' and ``remedial'' actions. Removal actions \n     are generally short-term (less than 1 year), low-cost (under \n     $2 million) measures intended to address actual or potential \n     releases of hazardous substances that pose a threat to human \n     health or the environment. Although many removal actions are \n     temporary measures to prevent exposure by stabilizing \n     conditions at a site or limiting access to the site, some \n     removal actions may permanently clean up contamination.\\4\\ \n     Typical removal actions include installing security measures \n     at a site, removing tanks or drums of hazardous substances \n     from a site, or excavating contaminated soil. By contrast, \n     remedial actions are long-term measures intended to \n     permanently mitigate the risks from a site. Typical remedial \n     actions include treating or containing contaminated soil, \n     constructing underground walls to control the movement of \n     groundwater, and incinerating hazardous wastes.\n       Once a site is on the NPL, EPA conducts a ``remedial \n     investigation'' to determine whether the nature and extent of \n     the contamination at the site warrant remedial action. One \n     component of this investigation is a baseline risk assessment \n     to evaluate the health risks the site would pose if no \n     cleanup occurred.\\5\\ For the baseline risk assessment, EPA \n     evaluates health risks under both ``current land-use \n     conditions'' and ``alternate future land-use conditions.'' As \n     an example, a site would pose health risks under current \n     land-use conditions if local residents used groundwater \n     containing a hazardous level of contaminants from the site as \n     drinking water or if contaminated groundwater could \n     eventually reach the wells of distant residents. By contrast, \n     a site would pose health risks under alternate future land-\n     use conditions if future land development would expose people \n     to health risks from the site's contaminants, even if the \n     site may not pose risks under current land uses.\n       At each site, EPA assesses the cancer risk, as well as the \n     risk for other ill health conditions (noncancer risk), posed \n     by the contaminants in groundwater, soil, surface water, \n     sediment, air, and other environmental media to determine if \n     these risks warrant cleanup. In the case of cancer, EPA \n     considers the risk serious enough to warrant cleanup if the \n     risk assessment indicates more than a 1 in 10,000 probability \n     that exposure to the site's contaminants may cause an \n     individual to develop cancer. In the case of noncancer health \n     effects, such as birth defects or nerve or liver damage, EPA \n     considers the risk serious enough to warrant cleanup if the \n     risk assessment indicates that exposure to the site's \n     contaminants might exceed the level that the human body can \n     tolerate without developing ill health effects.\n       EPA's Responsive Electronic Link and Access Interface \n     (RELAI) data base, from which we drew information for this \n     report, is the most comprehensive and current automated \n     source of EPA's data on the health risks of Superfund sites. \n     Created in 1993, this data base contains information about \n     health risks from EPA's risk assessments and other documents \n     related to 225 nonfederal sites, which constitute most of the \n     sites where EPA made cleanup decisions between 1991 and mid-\n     1993.\n\n\n         One-Third of Sites Posed Risks Under Current Land Uses\n\n       About 32 percent (71) of the 225 sites in EPA's data base \n     posed serious health risks under the land uses current at the \n     time of the risk assessment. About 53 percent (119) of the \n     225 sites did not pose risks warranting cleanup under current \n     land uses, but posed such risks under EPA's projections about \n     future changes in land use.\\6\\ The remaining 15 percent (35) \n     of the sites did not pose health risks serious enough to \n     warrant cleanup action under either current or future land \n     uses. As we noted earlier, EPA may still decide to clean up \n     these remaining sites because of federal or state regulations \n     or because of a threat to the environment, such as \n     contamination endangering a wetland.\n       Our analysis of EPA's data on the 71 sites posing health \n     risks under current land uses indicates the following: At 77 \n     percent (55) of the sites, a single environmental medium, \n     usually groundwater or contaminated soil, posed the health \n     risks, and at the remaining 23 percent (16) of the sites, \n     multiple environmental media posed the health risks.\n       EPA's data for the 71 sites also indicate that 28 percent \n     posed cancer risks, 30 percent posed noncancer risks, and 42 \n     percent posed both cancer and noncancer risks. EPA's \n     noncancer risk category includes such conditions as birth \n     defects or nerve or liver damage.\n\n\n          removal actions have reduced immediate health risks\n\n       According to officials from the Office of Emergency and \n     Remedial Response (OERR), EPA's removal program has mitigated \n     the immediate health risks from Superfund sites, at least \n     temporarily. EPA's policy requires a short-term response \n     whenever a Superfund site poses a health risk that \n     immediately endangers the surrounding populations. According \n     to the OERR officials, under the removal program EPA has \n     periodically evaluated the NPL sites and has taken \n     intervening steps at those sites determined to pose immediate \n     threats to health. EPA's data indicate that removal actions \n     have occurred at 31 of the 71 sites that posed risk under \n     current land uses.\n       OERR officials caution that while removal actions have \n     mitigated the immediate health risks at these sites, \n     information is not readily available to determine the extent \n     to which removal actions have affected the health risks \n     reported in the data base. According to these officials, the \n     available information does not indicate whether the removal \n     actions removed or treated only enough contaminants to \n     mitigate the risks that immediately endangered a site's \n     surrounding population. For example, a small pile of highly \n     contaminated soil might have been removed, mitigating the \n     immediate risks to children playing nearby but having little \n     effect on the site's more extensive soil contamination.\n       OERR officials also caution that the available information \n     does not indicate the extent to which the health risks \n     reported in the data base may already reflect the effect of \n     the removal actions. In some cases, a removal action may have \n     taken place before the risk assessment. OERR officials are \n     uncertain about whether, in such cases, risk assessors might \n     have considered the effect of the removal in reporting the \n     site's health risks.\n       Of the 71 sites posing risks under current land uses, 40 \n     sites did not pose immediate threats substantial enough to \n     warrant removal actions, according to OERR officials. These \n     officials explained that although these sites did not pose \n     risks that immediately endanger nearby populations, they \n     still pose risks under current land-use conditions. For \n     example, according to these officials, at some sites \n     contaminated groundwater has not yet reached drinking water. \n     However, under current land uses, the groundwater could \n     eventually reach a drinking water supply, thereby posing a \n     health risk. Table 1 categorizes these 40 sites by the \n     environmental media posing the current health risk.\n\n[[Page S 11338]]\n\n\n Table 1--Forty sites posing health risks under current land uses that \n                   have not warranted removal action\n\nEnvironmental medium that posed health risks                     Number\nGroundwater..........................................................18\nSoil.................................................................13\nSediment..............................................................2\nAir...................................................................1\nSurface water.........................................................0\nMultiple media........................................................6\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total..........................................................40\n\nSource: GAO's analysis of data from EPA's RELAI data base.\n                            agency comments\n\n       We requested that EPA provide comments on a draft of this \n     report. On June 19, 1995, we met with officials from EPA's \n     OERR, including the Chief, Response Operations Branch, to \n     obtain the agency's comments on the draft report. The \n     officials told us that they were generally satisfied that the \n     information presented in the report is accurate. The \n     officials provided additional perspectives on several issues \n     discussed in the report and also suggested technical \n     corrections on a few matters. We revised the draft report to \n     incorporate these comments.\n                         scope and methodology\n\n       To provide information on the extent to which Superfund \n     sites may pose serious health risks under current land uses \n     and on the nature of those risks, we analyzed pertinent \n     information from EPA's most comprehensive data base on the \n     health risks from Superfund sites. While we did not \n     independently verify the accuracy of EPA's data, we reviewed \n     the agency's data collection and verification guidelines and \n     internal quality assurance procedures, and determined these \n     internal controls to be adequate. We worked closely with EPA \n     officials to ensure a proper interpretation and analysis of \n     the data. Although the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry--the Public Health Service agency \n     responsible for identifying health problems in the \n     communities around Superfund sites--also assesses sites' \n     health risks, we did not analyze the agency's evaluation data \n     on Superfund sites for this report because of time \n     constraints.\n       To provide information on whether EPA's short-term response \n     actions have reduced the health risks from Superfund sites, \n     we obtained EPA's data on the removal actions that have \n     occurred at the 71 sites where current health risks existed. \n     Although we did not verify this information, we discussed the \n     information and EPA's removal policy and actions with \n     officials from OERR's Response Standards and Criteria and \n     Response Operations branches.\n       We performed our work between April and June 1995 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n       As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce \n     this report's contents earlier, we plan no further \n     distribution until 10 days after the date of this letter.

Mr. President, the Bosnian policy of the United States is \nlacking in backbone and commitment.\n  I confess, it discourages me.\n  I am not the only one who is discouraged.\n  A column by Tom Friedman appeared in the Sunday July 30, 1995, New \nYork Times that is, unfortunately, on target. And I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                [From the New York Times, July 30, 1995]\n\n                            Fire, Ready, Aim\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Washington: Lost in the commotion about the Senate vote to \n     lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, and President Clinton's \n     threat to veto such a move, is a small fact of some \n     importance: Both the President's policy and the Congress's \n     policy duck the real issue in Bosnia and are formulas for \n     continued war.\n       What are our real interests in Bosnia? They are four: halt \n     the killing, prevent the conflict from spreading, prevent the \n     conflict from turning into a Christian-Muslim holy war and \n     insure that it does not end in a way that permanently damages \n     America's ties with its European allies, NATO and Russia.\n       The only way to realize those objectives is for the U.S. \n     and its allies to draw up a map that divides Bosnia roughly \n     along the lines of the NATO-Russia Contact Group proposal--50 \n     percent Serb, 50 percent Muslim-Croat--and then use all \n     necessary force, including bombing Belgrade it necessary, to \n     impose those cease-fire lines on all the parties.\n       But, you might say, that would drag the U.S. into the war. \n     Hey, we're already in the war. The U.S. and NATO last week \n     committed to using their air power to defend a Muslim safe \n     haven from further murderous Serbian attacks. Well, if we are \n     ready to use what Defense Secretary William Perry called \n     ``massive'' air bombardments to defend an isolated Muslim \n     safe haven, why not use them to defend a cease-fire and a \n     settlement map that could stop the killing altogether? Why \n     not use them to defend a peace plan that would establish a \n     Bosnian Muslim state centered around Sarajevo, next to a \n     Bosnian Serb entity that would be federated with Serbia and a \n     Bosnia Croat entity that would be federated with Croatia?\n       Moreover, since we want the British, French and U.N. to \n     keep their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, and they are \n     willing, why not have them use their power to oversee a \n     partition plan and cease-fire lines, instead of to just \n     oversee further carnage?\n       Usually countries decide their war aims first and commit \n     their military power second. The Clinton Administration has \n     done just the reverse. It has decided to get involved \n     militarily in Bosnia, but with no clearly defined plan for \n     achieving America's basic interests. If we are going to enter \n     this war, it should only be to end this war--and the only way \n     to do that is through some form of partition.\n       Of course it would be preferable to have a pluralistic, \n     multi-ethnic Bosnian society and state, where everyone lives \n     together. But the parties had that once. It was called \n     Yugoslavia, and the Serbs, Muslims and Croats all helped to \n     rip that state apart. That is why the only way to stabilize \n     things now is to divide Bosnia among them.\n       But instead, the Administration and Congress are posturing. \n     The Administration doesn't want to lift the arms embargo, but \n     it also doesn't want to impose any settlement, because it \n     fears that would involve America too deeply and because it \n     knows it would mean accepting the very partition plans it \n     advised the Muslims for years to reject. The Clinton \n     Administration wants more of the status quo because its only \n     clear goal is to get through November 1996 without U.S. \n     troops in Bosnia.\n       The Congress, by contrast, just wants to get through the \n     evening news. It wants to feel good about lifting the \n     embargo, but does not want to recognize that this will only \n     trigger a heavier Serbian onslaught against the Muslims, \n     which they will only be able to resist in the short term with \n     the help of direct Western military intervention, which is \n     precisely the sort of deep involvement Congress is actually \n     trying to avoid.\n       With the Administration plan the Muslims lose slowly. With \n     the Congress plan the Muslims lose quickly.\n       Neither the Administration nor the Congress wants to \n     recognize what the Europeans already have--that the ideal \n     multi-ethnic, democratic Bosnia, if it were ever possible, \n     cannot be achieved now. The only way to achieve it would be \n     to force the Serbs, Muslims and Croats to live together under \n     one roof, which they demonstrably do not want to do. None of \n     the parties right now are fighting to live together. They are \n     each fighting for ethnic survival or independence.\n       We can lament the idea of a multiethnic, pluralistic Bosnia \n     but we cannot build it from the raw material at hand. The \n     only sane thing left is to stop the killing and build the \n     least bad peace around the Bosnia we have, which is one in \n     which Serbs, Croats and Muslims live apart until they can \n     learn again to live together.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11338-S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT\n\n   Mr. DOMENICI.

Johnson, Governor of New Mexico, do \n     hereby order that on August 26, 1995, at twelve noon Mountain \n     Standard Time, bells shall be rung in recognition and \n     celebration of the adoption of the 19th amendment to the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n  Through the efforts of a committed group of New Mexican citizens, \norganized by Elizabeth Iolene McKinney-Brown, an organization was \nestablished to pay special tribute to the 75th anniversary of the 19th \namendment, Celebrate Partners United. As the group said about August \n26, ``This is a special day and we need to recognize it as such so that \nall can participate in the celebration.'' As a result of this group's \nefforts, New Mexico issued its executive order to set aside 12 noon on \nAugust 26, 1995 for the ringing of bells in celebration of the adoption \nof this important amendment. I understand that New Mexico is the first \nState to set aside a certain time of day as a special tribute to the \namendment.\n  The members of Celebrate Partners United and the Governor of New \nMexico are to be commended for their dedicated efforts to recognize \nthis special day. As Lieutenant Governor Bradley stated in the letter \nof transmittal of the executive order:\n\n       The people of this nation are indebted to those who fought \n     bravely in the face of adversity for the right of women to \n     vote. This all important right is at the heart of our \n     democracy. As we continuously strive for equality in this \n     great nation, we must never forget the struggles of the past. \n     We can only learn from the historic efforts of women fighting \n     for suffrage and will continue to tell their story and \n     celebrate their victory.\n\n  Elizabeth Iolene McKinney-Brown brought the Celebrate Partners United \nactivities to my attention. It is her and the group's hope that all the \nStates' Governors will consider the New Mexico example and issue \nsimilar proclamations. She pointed out that the ringing of bells ``is \nreminiscent of the simple act, first done by our forefathers when they \nrang the Liberty Bell.'' She suggests that if there are no bells in the \nlittle towns and communities, that horns or sirens are just as good \nbecause ``anyone, anywhere, can make a sound in remembrance of the 75th \nanniversary of the 19th amendment.''\n  I am pleased that New Mexico has taken the initiative to honor August \n26 in this unique way. I am also equally proud that many men and women \nof New Mexico, at the grassroots level, have led this statewide effort \nto make a sound for this very important amendment to our U.S. \nConstitution. I urge my colleagues to share a similar challenge within \ntheir own States--it is a unique way for all Americans to acknowledge \ntheir appreciation for the special significance of this date in \nhistory.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11338-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN M. CURRAN\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJohn M. ``Mike'' Curran, an outstanding public servant from my State, \nwho will soon retire from Government service after a distinguished 32-\nyear career with the U.S. Forest Service.\n  Mike began his career with the U.S. Forest Service in 1965 as a \nlandscape architect in the Intermountain Regional Office in Ogden, UT, \nand was later reassigned to the Ashley National Forest. In 1968, he \nmoved to the Rocky Mountain Regional Office in Denver, CO. From there \nhe went to the San Juan National Forest in Colorado where he served as \nforest landscape architect for 5 years. Mike held District Ranger \npositions from 1975 to 1981 in Wyoming, Buffalo Ranger District, and \nColorado, Taylor River Ranger District. In 1981, he was selected as a \nLoeb Fellow at Harvard University. He then spent 4 years in the Forest \nService's Washington office in programs and legislation where, during \n1984, I was privileged to have Mike assigned to my staff as a \nLegislative Fellow to the U.S. Senate. In working with Mike on a daily \nbasis, I developed a great respect and appreciation for his \nintelligence, his integrity, his judgment, and his sensitivity to the \nmany complexities of environmental issues. Imagine my delight when, in \n1986, Mike became the Forest Supervisor of the Ouachita National \nForest, headquartered in Hot Springs, AR.\n  During his tenure in the Ouachitas, Mike has worked hard to forge a \nunique partnership between research and the forest which fosters the \nadvancement of ecosystem management. His vision, initiative, and \ntireless efforts have earned the Ouachita National Forest national and \ninternational recognition for leadership in the evolving concept of \nsustainable forestry. He also made involvement of the public in the \ndecisionmaking process a priority, always striving for new and \ninnovative ways to improve this relationship. Significant recognition \nof his efforts include the Chevron Conservation Award, the Oklahoma and \nArkansas Wildlife Federation Forest Conservationist of the Year Awards, \nthe United Nations Environment Programme Award, the Chief's Ecosystem \nManagement Award, and the Charles L. Steele Award by the Arkansas \nNature Conservancy.\n  On a personal note, it was a unique set of circumstances which \ncombined to forge the decade-long relationship Mike and I have enjoyed. \nFrom a valued staff member to an agency head in my home State, Mike has \nalso become a personal friend. We have argued over issues and worked \ntogether to preserve and protect the beautiful land surrounding Lake \nOuachita, and we have celebrated together those accomplishments which \nhave added to Arkansas' deserved reputation as the Natural State. After \nhe retires, Mike and his wife, Leslee, will be dividing their time \nbetween Arkansas and Colorado. I am pleased that although my State and \nour Nation are losing an exemplary public servant, I will be keeping a \nvalued friend and constituent.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11339-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN FRAZER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJohn Frazer, a resident of Frankfort, KY, who is being recognized as a \nman who has contributed more than two decades of his life to the \nlobbying and leadership of Kentucky's coalition of private colleges.\n  At 66 years of age, this man retired in July after serving 21 years \nas the president of what is now referred to as the Association of \nIndependent Kentucky Colleges and Universities. Mr. Frazer served as \nlobbyist and leader of the coalition which comprises 20 Kentucky \nschools, including Alice Lloyd, Bellarmine, Centre, Thomas More, \nTransylvania, and Union. Together, these colleges represent about \n20,000 students, which is about 12 percent of Kentucky's college \nstudents and about 20 percent of its annual graduates.\n  Mr. President, this man's dedication to the liberal arts education \nand the institution of the private college is admirable. Mr. Frazer \nused funds from the Kentucky General Assembly to provide a private \nschool education to students who were unable to afford otherwise. In \naddition, he coordinated libraries and created a central information \nsystem for the 20 colleges. A future problem solver, he started a joint \ninsurance program that saves the colleges more than $300,000 each year.\n  In an age where educational reform has become one of the leading \nconcerns among Kentuckians, Mr. Frazer's dedication to ensuring the \ntradition of excellence of the liberal arts education and the \naccessibility of such an education lives on. This lobbyist, leader, and \ngood friend is being recognized today not only for this earnest \ndedication, but for the admirable way he represented these colleges.\n  Gary Cox, executive director of the Kentucky Council on Higher \nEducation, recently described Mr. Frazer's honorable character this way \nin a recent Louisville Courier-Journal article: ``He's a gentleman, a \nfella above reproach. That has added to his credibility, and to the \nstature of the schools he represents.''\n  It is my honor to pay tribute today to this representative of \nKentucky--this fine example for the future educators of our \nNation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11339-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 11340]]\n\n\n             MARTHA PAYNE: A TRUE FRIEND AND PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \ninform the Senate that I am losing one of my most dedicated and trusted \nstaffers to retirement--Martha Payne of Columbia, SC. At the same time, \nI am happy for Martha and her family because she is going to have a \nwhale of a time in what will be her best years ever.\n  Since 1960 when she started working with me in the Governor's office, \nMartha has stood with me through thick and thin. Within months, her \ncompetence and commitment made her indispensable. At the end of my \nservice as Governor when Senator Olin Johnston gave me a classic lesson \nin politics, I returned to Charleston to practice law and Martha \nassumed a position as manager of our State municipal association.\n  Martha and I never lost contact. I relied upon her to keep me advised \non happenings in State and municipal government, and as a conduit to \nold, and more importantly, new friendships. In 1965 when I decided to \nagain seek election to this august body, the first person I asked to \njoin my campaign was Martha Payne.\n  Martha was the glue that held a fragile and inexperienced campaign \ntogether. She brilliantly bridged the gap between past Hollings \nsupporters and thousands of new ones who rallied to our undermanned but \ncommitted cause. The victory we achieved in 1966 and all the victories \nin the 29 years since have, in no small measure, been Martha's \nvictories.\n  Since that victorious 1966 Senate campaign, Martha served as my \noffice organizer. She has been an office manager and staff assistant in \nColumbia. Day after day, she has helped thousands of people throughout \nSouth Carolina. Her energy and dedication to serving our people, our \nState, and our country has made my job easier and our successes easier \nto accomplish.\n  Through the many long and difficult days which saw some seek a safer \nhaven elsewhere, Martha never waivered. She has always been there, has \nbeen supportive, and has been a true friend.\n  Martha and her husband Rob first moved to Columbia from Monroe, NC, \nin 1950. They are the proud parents of three children--Rob Jr., a \npsychiatrist in Charleston Michael, a lawyer in Washington, DC; and \nNancy, a teacher in Charleston--and grandparents of four. She and Rob \nwill celebrate their 50th anniversary next May.\n  Mr. President, I often think of Martha as South Carolina's living \nRolodex. She is a library of knowledge and information. Perhaps the \nonly thing more impressive than the number of South Carolinians she \nknows is the information she knows about them--their parents, \ngrandparents, and children. In fact, Martha Payne, more than anyone I \ncan think of, understands the relationships that make South Carolina a \nbig, big family.\n  Mr. President, we in South Carolina owe Martha Payne a huge debt of \ngratitude. It is a debt that I never will be able to repay. But what I \ncan do is offer heartfelt appreciation for a job well done and my \nsincerest thanks for the 35 years of love, friendship, loyalty, and \nsupport. I wish her and Rob well in their years to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11340-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FREDDIE MAC'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the 25th \nanniversary of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation [Freddie Mac] \nand recognize Freddie Mac for its outstanding contribution in making \nfinancial credit available for home ownership.\n  In 1970, Congress created Freddie Mac to help ensure the nationwide \navailability of low-cost mortgage funds to home buyers everywhere. \nFreddie Mac has risen to this challenge by dedicating its resources and \ningenuity to making the American dream of home ownership a reality. \nSince 1970, Freddie Mac has purchased some $1.2 trillion in mortgage \nloans, including $16 billion in Missouri, enabling some 16 million \nAmerican families to own their own home. By purchasing mortgage loans \nfrom lenders, packaging loans into securities, and selling the \nsecurities to investors, Freddie Mac has been a primary participant in \ndeveloping a secondary mortgage market that provides a continuous flow \nof funds to finance home ownership.\n  I emphasize that Freddie Mac has made a real commitment and \ncontinuing contribution to the mortgage finance system. Part of this \ncommitment is Freddie Mac's effort to encourage fair lending and \neliminate barriers to home ownership. Freddie Mac also has made a \ncommitment to revitalizing neighborhoods by emphasizing community \ndevelopment mortgage lending for owner-occupied or rental housing which \nis affordable to low-, moderate-, and middle-income families. The \nshared commitment of Freddie Mac and its nonprofit partners have \nproduced programs that are helping to revitalize neighborhoods \nthroughout America.\n  The contribution of Freddie Mac to home ownership in America cannot \nbe minimized. Congratulations to Freddie Mac on its 25th \nanniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11340-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11340-S11341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, on July 28, Senator Harry Reid and I \nintroduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 Amendment Act \nof 1995.\n  In 1993, during consideration of the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct, Senator Reid and I introduced our amendment to establish a \ndifferent legal standard for judicial review of religious freedom cases \nbrought by prison inmates. This bill proposes again to establish an \nexception for prisoner-generated free-exercise lawsuits challenging \nprison regulations.\n  I supported and voted for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of \n1993. However, I continue to be very concerned about the act's impact \non increasing prisoner lawsuits.\n  This bill will retain the current U.S. Supreme Court standard for the \nevaluation of prison actions affecting religious activities. That \nstandard focuses on whether or not prison officials, in light of \nsecurity, discipline, and safety concerns, have acted reasonably in the \nmeasures they have taken which may impact religious activities.\n  In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has required courts to give great \ndifference to decisions made by prison officials regarding how their \nprisons are administered. Without such a prison exception provision in \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it is not clear such deference \nwill continue. Many attorneys general, including Nevada's attorney \ngeneral, Frankie Sue Del Papa, support this prison exception.\n  Without this provision, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has \noverturned judicial review standards for prison settings that have \nexisted for approximately 45 years. The result is not only increased \nnumbers of prisoner-generated lawsuits. Courts now are also able to \nsecond-guess prison administrators' decisionmaking by looking beyond \nconcerns for security and conditions of confinement in the prisons. For \nexample, the Santeria religion case upholding religious ritual animal \nsacrifices could create\n immense problems should such sacrifices be upheld in a prison setting.\n\n  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as enacted, would require \nprison officials to justify any actions involving prisoners' exercise \nof their religious belief by showing there was a compelling \ngovernmental interest for the action, and that any action taken was the \nleast restrictive alternative in burdening the prisoner's exercise of \nreligion.\n  Nevada's attorney general, Frankie Sue Del Papa, recently cited her \ntop-10 frivolous prison lawsuits. Among the top 10 are two religious \nfreedom claims. One inmate claimed the prison chaplain wrongly denied a \nmarriage ceremony between the male inmate and his male friend. Another \ninmate claimed the prison rule prohibiting inmates from receiving \nstamps in the mail violated his right as an indigent to engage in the \nUniversal Life Church practice of writing letters to others.\n  As a former attorney general, I am well aware of the amount of \nprisoner-generated litigation that engulfs attorney general offices \nacross this Nation. Oftentimes amounting to purely frivolous claims, \nthese prisoner lawsuits tie up our already stretched State and Federal \nlegal resources.\n\n[[Page S 11341]]\n\n  As a former Governor, I am also well aware of the difficult decisions \nfacing our prison administrators day in and day out as they strive to \nmaintain the security of their facilities, for both staff and inmates.\n  Also as a member of the Nevada State Prisons Board during my tenures \nas Governor and attorney general, I experienced first hand the burdens \nplaced on State governments as a result of Federal court actions. This \nburden continues to impact State governments' monetarily and \nadministratively through increased costs, time, and effort expended to \ncomply with required legal holdings.\n  The National Governors' Association during its annual meeting this \npast weekend addressed the impact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nhas had on State prison inmate claims. By voice vote, the NGA accepted \na policy position resolution that provides:\n\n       The Governors strongly support First Amendment rights that \n     protect an individuals freedom to worship. Governors also \n     recognize the importance of balancing the interests of prison \n     administrators responsible for running safe and secure \n     facilities with the legitimate claim of prisoners to exercise \n     their right to worship and practice according to their \n     individual religious faiths. Recently enacted federal \n     legislation disrupts this delicate balance and threatens the \n     ability of prison officials to effectively manage state and \n     local correctional institutions.\n       Under current Federal law, prison regulations governing \n     religious practices are subjected to strict legal scrutiny. \n     This effectively interferes with prison management on a day-\n     to-day basis. For example, correctional institutions can be \n     prohibited from regulating certain types of garments claimed \n     to be religious clothing, which may conceal weapons, \n     narcotics, and other contraband.\n       In addition to the concerns for safety within our prison \n     facilities, extensive litigation and an explosion of \n     frivolous petitions by prisoners demanding accommodations for \n     specific religious activities has a detrimental impact on the \n     costs of operating correctional institutions. Additional \n     guards, new physical structures, legal expenses, and other \n     additional costs are being incurred at a time when states can \n     least afford expenditures of this nature.\n       The Governors strongly believe that prison officials \n     require necessary flexibility to enact regulations that allow \n     religious worship, but that also preserve institutional order \n     and safety. For these reasons, the Governors believe Congress \n     should enact legislation without delay that would:\n       Exclude prison and jail inmates or any person held or \n     incarcerated as a pretrial detainee from provisions of the \n     Religious Freedom Restoration Act; and\n       Eliminate any liability that may have accrued to State and \n     local governments as a result of the misapplication of the \n     Religious Freedom Restoration Act to individuals who are \n     incarcerated in a State or local correctional detention, or \n     penal facility.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join with the Governors across this country in \nsupporting this bill to ensure our prisons and their administrators are \nallowed to exercise their judgment to maintain the security and of \ntheir facilities, and to have that judgment given due deference by our \ncourt system.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11340-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO RED BARTLETT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Red \nBartlett, a resident of Newport, KY, a man who has dedicated 50 years \nof his life  to  the  people  in  his  community, especially \n the children.  Mr. Bartlett is  marking  his  50th  year  \nof service to knothole  baseball  in  Campbell \nCounty. In addition to this commitment, Red has carried the \nchildren of Campbell County through many other programs.\n  It seems strange to refer to him as Mr. Bartlett. For thousands of \nnorthern Kentuckians know him--friend and stranger alike--simply as \nRed.\n  Red served as knothole supervisor for all of Campbell County \nbeginning in 1949. Currently supervisor of knothole District 22, he \nwill work with his replacement right up to the end of next year. \nAlthough he will soon retire, his memory will live on in the hearts of \nthe countless number of children to whom he was coach, role model, and \nfriend.\n  Red grew up in an orphanage and has spent his life enriching his \ncommunity by providing a fun, safe, and accessible recreational outlet \nfor children. He was honored by the Northern Kentucky Sports Hall of \nFame and recently by the Greater Cincinnati Knothole Hall of Fame for \nhis extensive commitment to athletic supervision. He has worked as the \nNewport city recreation director and as the Newport Central Catholic \nHigh School tennis coach.\n  Red organized Youth, Inc. Boys Club. That organization ran the junior \nolympics program in northern Kentucky, a youth basketball league, and \nwas instrumental in establishing the Pee-Wee football league in \nCampbell County.\n  Mr. President, a little more than 4 years ago, Red reorganized the \nall-stars games to recognize knothole players of northern Kentucky. The \nproceeds benefit the family nurturing center child abuse prevention \nprograms and local food pantries. He organized the games and made sure \neach young star received an engraved trophy.\n  Red believed each child should have a chance to build character and \nconfidence on the athletic field. He provided a channel, gave positive \nrecognition, and taught self-esteem.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close now with a thought expressed in \na recent editorial by the Kentucky Post. The Post wrote, ``No one hands \nout hero's medals to men who serve 50 years in knothole. Maybe they \nshould. Red Bartlett just may have done more for youth sports and for \nthe young people of Campbell County over the last half-century than \nanyone.''\n  To sum it up, Red gave children a chance to learn some of life's most \nlasting lessons through athletics. His commitment to his community made \nRed the real star.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11341-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             RELEASE OF NEW OTA REPORT ON COMPUTER SECURITY\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in the new hit movie, The Net, \nprivate information is hacked into via the Internet, turning a young \nwoman's life upside-down. While The Net is a work of fiction, it is \nbased on a factual premise: that information held in computer networks \nis susceptible to intrusion.\n  Unknown crackers routinely scan government and private sector \ndatabases for military research, confidential personal information and \nother sensitive data. This jeopardizes our Nation's security and our \nindividual privacy. A report issued today by the Office of Technology \nAssessment clearly states the problems facing the Federal Government in \nensuring the integrity and usefulness of America's information \ninfrastructure. Its title is Issue Update on Information Security and \nPrivacy in Network Environments.\n  Securing public and private databases from the mischievous and \ncriminal elements of the computer community is not a simple task. The \nsheer number of break-ins and the electronic nature of this crime makes \nprosecution, and often even detection, almost impossible. It is neither \naffordable nor effective to prosecute each cracker. Defending the data \nand computer systems from infiltration has emerged as the most cost-\neffective and smartest way to deal with this problem.\n  The most recent issue of Defense News underscores the need for secure \ndatabases, as opposed to stronger enforcement. In it, Paul Strassmann, \na distinguished visiting professor for information warfare at the \nNational Defense University is quoted as saying: ``new laws are not \nlikely to stop on-line criminals because the professionals are \nundetectable.'' Against this kind of threat, prevention in the form of \nsecuring the data is more effective than prosecution.\n  Fortunately, we have already laid the groundwork to meet the \nchallenge of securing sensitive Federal data. The Computer Security Act \nof 1987 established an approach for protecting the Federal Government's \nunclassified but sensitive data, and developed guidelines and standards \nto promote Federal data protection. However, the Computer Security Act \nneeds to be updated and enforced for it to prevent thousands of \ncomputer break-ins currently occurring annually.\n  The costs of not facing these challenges are enormous. As Chairman of \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, my primary goal is the \nrestructuring of the Federal Government to be smaller, more effective \nand less expensive. Accomplishing this goal depends on automation, and \nwill require enhanced protection of computer databases and networked \ninformation. OTA's report highlights why the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee must update the Computer Security Act for today's networked \nsociety.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/03/senate-section/article/S11341-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 11342]]\n\n\n  REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--EXCHANGE OF NOTES RELATING TO TAX \n        CONVENTION WITH KAZAKHSTAN (TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-15)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the amendment that my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka, and I are offering today makes clear that net \noperating losses under the 1984 and 1986 Tax Reform Acts are not \nsubject to sharing under section 7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act.\n  Section 60(b)(5) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, as amended by section \n1804(e)(4) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, allowed Alaska Natives--both \nregional and village corporations--to sell losses generated by the \nFederal Government's failure to transfer lands to Native people \npromised to them 15 years earlier. Other multi-billion dollar \ncorporations had been permitted to sell their tax losses prior to 1984, \nand my amendment to the 1984 tax bill simply extended the program to \nAlaska Native corporations who had not been able to participate.\n  Section 7(i) of ANCSA requires the 12 Alaska Native regional \ncorporations to distribute 70 percent of the natural resource revenues \nderived from their lands, after deducting expenses, to the other 11 \nregions. The provision was designed as a mechanism to share the \nrevenues of regional Native corporations in Alaska naturally blessed \nwith timber, minerals, and oil and gas--after the deduction of \nexpenses--with regions which lacked such resources.\n  Although revenues after expenses from disposition of natural \nresources must be redistributed, the tax consequences of these\n natural resource transactions, such as credits or deductions for \ndepletion and losses, remain with the producing region. For more than \n20 years, this has been the position of the Internal Revenue Service on \nwhich the Native corporations have relied.\n\n  When I offered amendments in 1984 and in 1986 to extend the NOL \nprovision to Alaska Native corporations, it was not my intention, nor \nthe intention of Congress, that the revenue generated by the sale of \nNOL's be subject to sharing under section 7(i). On average, for every \n$100 in net operating losses, Native corporations received only $30 in \nNOL recovery and in no case more than $34. A recovery of $30 by a \ncorporation because it has sold the right to offset its losses against \nincome is not subject to sharing. Revenue recovered from the sale of \nnatural resources NOL's is not revenue from natural resource \nproduction.\n  Congressional intent has been well-understood by most Alaska Native \ncorporations. The provisions in the 1984 and 1986 Tax Reform Acts \nenabled eleven of the twelve regional corporations subject to ANCSA \nsection 7(i) sharing requirements to partially recoup their losses from \nnatural resource development and kept several Native corporations out \nof bankruptcy. It also benefited virtually every Native Alaskan. \nWithout exception, the NOL proceeds have been retained by the receiving \ncorporation, as was intended. In fact 10 of the regions signed an \nagreement to clarify their understanding that NOL proceeds were not \nsubject to sharing under section 7(i). My amendment simply confirms and \ncodifies that understanding. The phrase ``losses incurred or credits \nearned'' in the amendment precisely parallels the language in section \n1804 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and is intended to have the same \nmeaning.\n  Several of these corporations have already distributed NOL proceeds \nto their shareholders in reliance on the provisions of the tax reform \nlegislation. To change the rules now would be unfair to both the \ncorporations and the shareholders who received dividends.\n  A lawsuit was filed on the issue, but it was dismissed for lack of \nstanding. However, to avoid future costly litigation, congressional \naction is required. My amendment simply clarifies that net operating \nlosses are not revenues \n\n[[Page S 11346]]\nrequired to be redistributed under section 7(i) of ANCSA.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the bill before us today contains \namendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. However, I want \nto address my remarks to title II of the bill which contains the text \nof the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and \nas the author of the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act during the 103d \nand 104th Congresses, I would like to speak for a few moments about the \nprocess and mechanisms that this legislation would institute. My \npurpose in doing so is to establish legislative history which will \nbetter enable Federal agencies to implement the legislation.\n  First, let me offer some historical background. More than 70 years \nago, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole issued an urgent plea to the \nFederal Government expressing concern about the plight of native \nHawaiians. During the late 19th century and the early part of this \ncentury, the number of native Hawaiians declined dramatically and there \nwas a significant disintegration of Hawaiian culture and society.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, Franklin Lane, responded to Prince \nKuhio by recommending that the Federal Government establish a \nhomesteading program for native Hawaiians. In his testimony before \nCongress on the Hawaiian homes legislation, Secretary Lane stated that \nthe United States has a ``moral obligation to care'' for the native \nHawaiian people. Secretary Lane went on to say that ``the natives on \nthe islands who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we \nare trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are \nin poverty.''\n  In response to this appeal, legislation was drafted to help \nrejuvenate the Hawaiian people by establishing a home lands to promote \nhousing and agricultural opportunities. The resulting legislation, \nknown as the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, set aside 203,000 \nacres for this purpose. Homesteading opportunities would allow native \nHawaiians to, once again, enjoy their traditional lifestyle.\n  Regrettably, the enlightened program that Secretary Lane envisioned \nfell far short of expectations. One of the more significant provisions \nof the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act set aside land for native \nHawaiians in perpetuity. The act permitted the transfer of home lands \nonly in exchange for lands of equal value. Unfortunately, the \nprohibition against alienation of land was overlooked or ignored by the \nFederal Government. During Hawaii's territorial period, the Federal \nGovernment acquired Hawaiian home land in violation of the statutory \nprohibition against alienation. The Federal Government still retains \n1,400 acres of these lands.\n  During hearings conducted by the Energy Committee on this issue, the \ncommittee received a report prepared by the General Accounting Office \non the Hawaiian Home Lands Program. The most significant finding of the \nGAO report is that land was withdrawn from the home lands by executive \naction on 37 occasions during Hawaii's territorial period. These \nwithdrawals were in clear violation of the provision of the Hawaiian \nHomes Commission Act which prohibits the transfer of land unless the \nhome lands receives land of equal value in exchange. Native Hawaiians \nhave always contended that territorial withdrawals violated the 1920 \nact, and the GAO report confirms this fact.\n  The Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act seeks to redress this issue by \nauthorizing the transfer of Federal lands to the Department of Hawaiian \nHome Lands in exchange for Hawaiian home lands retained by the Federal \nGovernment. Although the term ``exchange'' is used in this legislation, \nthere is no expectation that DHHL will relinquish land to the Federal \nGovernment. DHHL need only relinquish any remaining claim it may have \nto former home lands now controlled by the Federal Government. The bill \nwould also provide compensation for lost use of Hawaiian home lands \ncontrolled by the Federal Government.\n  In advance of land being conveyed to the Department of Hawaiian Home \nLands under sections 203(b) and 203(f) of the bill, the Secretary of \nthe Interior is required to determine the value of lands currently \ncontrolled by the Federal Government that were designated as available \nlands under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. It is important to note \nthat section 203(a)(1)(A)(i) states that this determination is to be \nmade based upon the HHCA, as enacted. Thus, the valuation shall include \nlands designated as home lands under the 1920 Act that are not \ncurrently part of the home land inventory, whether the withdrawal \noccurred as a result of executive action, or through an act of \nCongress. The Secretary is also required to determine the value of the \nlost use of lands currently controlled by the Federal Government so \nthat this, too, can be compensated.\n  The valuation required by the legislation is not intended to be a \nunilateral action by the Secretary. On the contrary section \n203(a)(2)(A) requires the use of a valuation method that is acceptable \nto the Chair of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands and, most \nimportantly, is in the best interests of the beneficiaries. These two \nconditions exist regardless of whether the Secretary uses an appraisal \nor non-appraisal method of valuation. Section 203(a)(2)(A) requires the \nSecretary to be an advocate for the best interests of Hawaiian home \nbeneficiaries in reaching a determination of value. Thus the Secretary \nhas a fiduciary responsibility for seeing to it that the beneficiaries \nreceive the maximum possible compensation.\n  Under section 203(a), the Secretary need not determine the value of \nland and lost use by appraisal. The committee included a provision \nallowing valuation by a method other than appraisal in order to promote \na speedy resolution of this longstanding conflict. The committee \nconsiders valuation by mutual agreement to be far preferable to the \nburdensome process of appraisal. During our hearings on this \nlegislation, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was \nadvised that the State of Hawaii had appraised most of the Federal \nproperties in question. The GAO, in their report to the committee, \nanalyzed and the state appraisals and found the appraisal methodology \nused by the state was appropriate and that proper accounting principles \nwere employed. The state appraisals therefore supplant the need for a \nseparate appraisal by the Department of the Interior.\n  In the unfortunate event that the Interior Department decides to \nproceed with an appraisal, a number of specific safeguards have been \ninstituted to ensure that the Department properly discharges its \nfiduciary responsibility to protect the interests of the Hawaiian home \nbeneficiaries. These include a guarantee that the Chairman of the \nDepartment of Hawaiian Home Lands shall have opportunity to present \nevidence of the value of the home lands that were lost as well as the \nvalue of the lost use of these lands, the right to review and comment \non a preliminary copy of the appraisal, and most importantly, the \nrequirement that the Secretary give full consideration of the evidence \nof value presented by DHHL. Given the responsibility under section \n203(a)(2)(A) that the Secretary represent the best interests of the \nbeneficiaries, the requirement in section 203(a)(4)(B) is not \nephemeral. When construed together, these provisions require the \nSecretary to give great weight to the recommendations of the DHHL on \nmatters of value, especially if the interests of home land \nbeneficiaries would be advanced by doing so.\n  In addition to all these protections, the Chairman of the Department \nof Hawaiian Home Lands has the right to dispute the determinations of \nvalue for land and lost use. Thus it is unmistakably clear that the \nSecretary and the Chairman of DHHL must mutually consent to the values \nto be determined under section 203 of the bill.\n  Section 203(b) authorizes the conveyance of land to the Department of \nHawaiian Home Lands as compensation for lost lands, and the lost use of \nhome lands retained by the Federal Government. This section further \nauthorizes the head of any Federal agency to transfer land and \nstructures to the Secretary of the Interior for subsequent conveyance \nto DHHL. I want to contrast the two-step conveyance process described \nin section 203(b)(5) with the authority for the General Services \nAdministration or the Department of Defense to convey property directly \nto DHHL under Section 203(f)(6) of the bill. A section 203(f)(6) \nconveyance \n\n[[Page S 11347]]\nwould be a direct transfer of title, without intervention by the \nDepartment of the Interior, whereas the Interior Department would act \nas a transfer agent for conveyances executed under section 203(b)(5). \nLet me point out, however, that although jurisdiction and control of \nland would be transferred to the Interior Department under a section \n203(b)(5) conveyance, the Interior Department's responsibility in \ncompleting the transfer is nothing more than a ministerial function. In \nthis case the agency serves as a conduit for consummating the transfer \nof title to the DHHL.\n  Section 203(f) of the bill establishes a second means of conveying \nlands to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by allowing DHHL to \nobtain lands that are excess to the needs of individual Federal \nagencies. Subsection (f) places the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \nin the same, or better, status as a Federal agency for the purpose of \nbeing notified of excess property and for obtaining the property from \nthe excessing agency. Under no circumstances should the land that has \nbeen selected by the Chairman for appraisal under section 203(f)(2), \nand possible conveyance under section 203(f)(5), be transferred or \notherwise disposed of by any Federal agency until the opportunity of \nthe DHHL to obtain the land has expired.\n  Finally, let me comment on section 207 of the bill. This section \nestablishes a cost sharing for Bureau of Reclamation projects on \nHawaiian home lands that is the same as the cost sharing authorized for \nprojects on Indian lands.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 2110) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, as amended; that the bill be deemed read a \nthird time and passed, as amended; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
