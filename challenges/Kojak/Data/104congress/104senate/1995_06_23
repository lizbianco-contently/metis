Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to eliminate \nthe Office of the Surgeon General in the Public Health Service. In \nlight of what we have just been through with Dr. Foster's nomination, \nwhat Dr. Elders went through, and even Dr. Koop, I think it has never \nbeen more clear that this position is a lightning rod. Let me say at \nthe outset, this has nothing to do with Dr. Henry Foster, and \neverything to do with politics.\n  For years, this office has been used by both parties as a political \nfootball. Instead of fulfilling the duties as spokesperson for public \nhealth, the Surgeon General has found himself or herself as a puppet \nfor the administration, pushing forward rhetoric on whatever pet topic \npeaks their interest.\n  I guess as a political appointee, you would expect this. However, \nwhen it comes to the public's health, politics should not come into \nplay.\n  But what makes this bill timely is the effort being made by both the \nadministration and Congress to shrink the size of Government. Being a \nvoice for good health habits is not a job that only a Surgeon General \ncan do.\n  There have been times in our recent history when we had no Surgeon \nGeneral. Was the public's health in danger during that time? No. The \nduties were picked up by the Assistant Secretary for Health. In fact, \nthrough most of the 1970's there was no Surgeon General. During the \nCarter administration, the Assistant Secretary for Health doubled\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\nas Surgeon General. And it worked. It wasn't until Dr. Koop was named \nto the position, that the offices were again split.\n  Do not get me wrong--those who have filled this position have done \nsome remarkable things. But the position is redundant. And if we are \nserious about wanting to reduce the size of Government and save the \ntaxpayers money, then we have to take a close look at why this position \nis still there.\n  The Office of the Surgeon General has six employees and costs the \ntaxpayer close to $1 million each year. In the scheme of things, that \nmay not sound like a lot, but to folks in Montana, folks in Arizona, in \nfact, folks anywhere outside the beltway, a million dollars is a lot of \nmoney.\n\n  Am I saying the public doesn't need the information they get from the \nSurgeon General? No. They will still get the information that is \nimportant to preventing disease promoting wellness and learning how to \nlive healthy lives. But that information will come from the Assistant \nSecretary for Health, who by the way should be no less credible. This \nposition is consistently filled by a medical doctor. And again, it's \nbeen done before.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time we stop playing games with the \npublic's dollar. This is one level of bureaucracy that we don't need. \nIt has been proven in the past and we can make it work again. \nEliminating the Office of the Surgeon General would not only save \nmoney--without hurting the public, I might add--it will also remove the \nfootball that has been used by both Republicans and Democrats to \ncontrol a pulpit that the public has come to count on.\n  We do not need a separate Office of the Surgeon General, Mr. \nPresident. I have been joined by Senators Kyl, Thomas, Helms, Santorum, \nNickles, Thompson, and Brown in introducing this bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me in this effort to restore common sense to \nthe Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Senator Shelby has an amendment dealing \nwith proportionate liability. It is an amendment really that goes to \nthe heart of the legislation. He is going to offer it and take it up at \nthis time. I believe we have agreed that at 10:55 we will have a vote \non it. At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Chairman D'Amato, \nSenators Domenici, Dodd, and Gramm for their hard work in trying to \nforge a consensus behind reforming our securities litigation system to \nweed out abuses and eliminate frivolous suits.\n  I am concerned and disappointed, however, that the bill before the \nSenate will do more to impair the rights of the small investor than it \nwill to place checks on abusive conduct and frivolous litigation. For \nthis reason, I continue to oppose S. 240.\n  Earlier this spring, Senator Bryan and I introduced a bill aimed at \nstriking a balance between preserving the rights of the small investor \nand eliminating incentives for frivolous and abusive litigation.\n  Senate bill 667 incorporated many of the widely supported provisions \nincorporated in the bill before us like prohibiting referral fees, and \nthe payment of attorney fees from the SEC disgorgement fund, increasing \nfraud detection and enforcement, and ensuring adequate disclosure of \nsettlement terms.\n  In addition, our bill addressed many of the concerns that Chairman \nLevitt and the SEC have raised against S. 240 regarding pleading \nrequirements, liability standards, and statute of limitations issues.\n  While the bill before us responds to some of these concerns--it still \nfails to ensure adequate protection of the rights of the innocent \nvictim of securities fraud and effectively leaves the little guy who \nseeks redress for professional wrongdoing out in the cold.\n  On several key issues, S. 240 fails to preserve the important role \nthat legitimate private securities litigation plays in checking abusive \nconduct and, in fact, makes it more difficult for the small investor to \ngain access to the courts and obtain full recovery for securities \nfraud.\n  I believe that individual investors, particularly small shareholders, \nmust be assured a full recovery against professional wrongdoers if we \nare to maintain integrity in our securities markets.\n  Like Chairman Levitt and many other colleagues, I believe the bill \ncan still be improved.\n  I, therefore, intend to offer a couple of amendments that I believe \nwill help assure that meritorious claims are not inhibited in our \neffort to prevent frivolous and abusive ones.\n  Mr. President, S. 240 makes important reforms, many of which I \nsupport. Sadly, however, the bill would come at too great a cost to the \nsmall individual shareholder.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 240 as currently drafted and \nsupport\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\namendments to reinstate important investor protections against \nsecurities fraud.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1468\n\n (Purpose: To amend the proportionate liability provisions of the bill)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 1468.\n       On page 134, strike lines 5 through 24, and insert \n     ``uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, as determined under \n     subsection (c).''.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering I am \noffering on behalf of myself and the Senator from Nevada, Senator \nBryan.\n  S. 240, which is the bill before us, provides for proportionate \nliability for defendants found guilty of reckless conduct by limiting \njoint and several liability to defendants found guilty of knowing \nsecurities fraud.\n  As an equitable matter, I generally support proportionate liability \nas between wrongdoers. Less culpable defendants should not, I believe, \nnecessarily be liable to the same extent as more culpable defendants. I \nthink that is just common sense.\n  However, proportionate liability should not act to deprive the \ninnocent victim of a full recovery--in other words, defraud people of \ntheir basic rights. Much more important than ensuring equity among \ndefendants, I believe is ensuring that as between the wrongdoer and the \ninnocent victim, it is the wrongdoer that bears the burden--yes, Mr. \nPresident, bears the burden--of any uncollectible judgment caused by an \ninsolvent defendant, not the victim.\n  S. 240 turns the principle on its head. S. 240 before us today would \nmake the innocent victim bear the loss of an insolvent defendant by \ncapping the liability of proportionate defendants to only an additional \n50 percent of their share. Beyond that, the victim bears the loss.\n  Additionally, S. 240 would only allow the victim to recover his full \ndamages against the remaining defendants if his or her net worth is \nless than $200,000 and the victim's damages are greater than 10 percent \nof their net worth.\n  Mr. President, why we would want to place restrictions on a victim's \nfull recovery, to limit a defendant's liability is beyond me in the \nfirst place. But the provision also fails in its purpose. Many retirees \nown their own homes and have significant equity in their property. Many \nhave saved and invested for years and years for retirement. This is not \na bad thing. We usually encourage such behavior. Yet, many older \nretirees would be precluded from a full recovery here because their net \nworth is over $200,000 and their damages are less than 10 percent or \n$20,000. Why we would want to intentionally punish an individual who is \nproductive, who saves and invests for the future, is not completely \nclear to me.\n  Further, Mr. President, I must seriously question, as others have, a \nbill like this that makes a judgment that these productive members of \nour society should somehow be less entitled to recovery because they \nhave more net worth than the next guy.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated, this amendment that I offer on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Bryan is simple. It would strike the net \nworth and damage requirements and make proportionate defendants \nresponsible for the uncollectible share of an insolvent codefendant in \nproportion to their percentage of responsibility or culpability. It \nputs the victim before the defendant, as I believe it should in this \nsociety, as it rightly should. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  This bill has some good things in it, but this is not one of them. I \nthink it is time we think up here today--and I hope we will--about the \nvictim and not the perpetrator of fraud and abuse in securities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I feel this amendment addresses one of \nthe areas that is in the most significant need of reform.\n  Imagine yourself being named as a defendant in a class action suit \nwhere the damage claims are $100 million. Further imagine that a jury \nfinds you reckless or negligent, because you are an insurance company, \nor because you are a securities firm, or because you are a bank, or \nbecause you are a large accounting firm associated with the people who \ncommitted the fraud. Your liability could be 2 percent, because you \nfailed to see the violation and take action against it; you, therefore, \nwere negligent and should be held accountable.\n  Well, you could settle and pay that 2 or 3 or 5 percent, or you might \nwant to fight and say that given your tangential relation to the fraud, \nthe duty was not yours to uncover it, but if you are found liable you \ncould be held accountable for the full $100 million. For example, an \naccounting firm who cannot go beyond the numbers that were put forth in \nthe audits that they conducted, who has had almost nothing to do with \nthe alleged grievance, could be named as a defendant because they have \na large asset base--we call these firms deep pockets.\n   I, myself, would never have to worry about being named as one of \nthose defendants because I do not have deep pockets. Deep pockets are \ngenerally firms of economic substance who are generally well insured. \nThey find themselves dragged into these suits, and their lawyers tell \nthem it will cost $700,000, $800,000, maybe $1 million to defend \nthemselves, even if the company has had literally little, if anything, \nto do with the alleged fraud that was perpetrated on stockholders. Let \nme say again, that these firms are brought in only because they \nrepresent an economic interest of some substance. As I said last night, \nin these lawsuits, they sue everybody and anything that moves and some \nthings that do not move. Your involvement in the fraud could as little \nas you walked into the building on the days the fraud was committed, \nbut if you have deep pockets you will be sued. They will sue an \noutsider on the board of directors, who had no knowledge of the \nschemes, but he will face a $100 million suit, notwithstanding the fact \nthat he had little or nothing to do with the fraud. Even the standard \nof proof does not help the director; the plaintiffs will claim he \nshould have know, or could have found out about this, or with more \ndiligence could have stopped the fraud, the distinction legally between \nreckless conduct and negligent conduct is rather unclear. Let me say \nthat again. It is very blurry.\n  So now the director, or the accounting firm, has a corporate decision \nto make. Whether they will settle the case for what is nothing more \nthan a legal payoff to get rid of the suit, or whether they try to \ndefend themselves, because they think they can win. By staying in the \nsuit the firm could risk a $100 million when they could settle it for \n$2, $3, or $4 million, and avoid the legal costs. Ordinarily, I expect, \nfirms would fight it out, but under joint and several liability, it \ndoes not matter what damage the firm caused, because they have the deep \npockets; they can be held liable for the full amount of the settlement.\n  Now, we hear that we should not put the burden on the victims, nor do \nI think we should. What we have said here is that if somebody committed \na tortious act, he will be held responsible for his portion of the \ndamage. If it is 2 percent, he will pay 2 percent of the damages. We \neven went beyond that. If the fraudulent defendant is bankrupt and \ncannot pay, we would double the liability of the other defendants. So \nif a defendant was found 5 percent negligent, but the main defendant \nwas not able to pay, the 5 percent negligent defendant would be held \nresponsible for 10 percent of the damages.\n  If we really want to be fair, and we all want fairness, we should \nprotect the small investor who is legitimately aggrieved but, also \nprotect people who are unfairly dragged into a suit that is nothing \nless than legal blackmail. These firms are forced to settle because \ntheir business cannot be subjected to years of this litigation, or the \npossibility of having to pick up the entire cost --notwithstanding that \ntheir contribution to this scheme was not fraudulent. If a person has \ncontributed 2 percent to the fraud, they should pay the 2 percent of \nthe damages.\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\n  Why does the plaintiff's bar not want this? Because more firms would \nbe willing to stand up and say, ``Okay, we will battle it out,'' and \nbecause more of the charges that the cases are frivolous would be \nproven. These lawyers are suing the people because they are given an \nopportunity to hold them up.\n  Now the victim is fighting back. The victim in this is not just the \nshareholder. The victims in many of these cases are the people with \ndeep pockets who may just associated with the fraudulent company, and \nbecause of their connection with a company, they are dragged in.\n  That is not what the law should be about. If you do the act, then you \nshould pay. I absolutely agree. But do not bring in some guy who just \nhappens to be in close proximity or has some connection with the \ncompany, has not really participated in this.\n  But let me tell you, if you commit fraudulent conduct, or intentional \nwrongdoing, there is no escape from paying the full settlement.\n  In our attempt to be fair, we have said quite clearly, that if you \nare knowingly participating--knowingly--in a fraudulent act then even \nif you committed only 2 percent of the fraud, you can be held liable \nfor all of it. If you intentionally participate--intentionally--then \neven though you may have been only 1, 2, or 3 percent liable, who can \nbe held responsible for the entire amount.\n  We do not, as some have claimed, make it possible for people to lie, \nto cheat, and escape their liability. That is an oversimplification. It \ndemonstrates the lack of knowledge of this legislation on the part of \nsome of the editorial writers. I wish their newspapers had to be held \nto the same standard that they would ask the business community to be \nheld to. That would be nice. That would be incredible.\n  Imagine, they would have to be accurate, and truthful. It would be \nquite something. Quite something.\n  We want to be fair, and I think we have tailored this legislation in \nsuch a way that we make it clear--if you intentionally mislead, even if \nthat act causes only 1 to 2 percent in damages, you will be held for \nthe whole. We have not changed that.\n  I hope the Senate will not however, make it possible for people to \nbecome further exposed to these plots of extortion. That is wrong. Our \nFounding Fathers did not want it that way. This has developed over the \nyears, and it has come about as a result of the lawyers practicing law, \nwho act not on behalf of the poor stockholders, but on behalf of their \nown economic aggrandizement. That is not what the practice of law \nshould be about.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I think something deserves to be repeated here, and that \nis, of course what we are talking about here is the process of \nintimidation, quite frankly, to achieve settlement.\n  What needs to be pointed out, rarely do these cases ever go to court. \nWe have seen that 98 percent, I think, is the number, ends up being \nsettled. The reason is because, as our colleague from New York has \npointed out, is because of that protracted lengthy process, where a \nperson who is marginally involved can end up being held accountable for \nthe entire cost.\n  Of course, who pays for all of that? It is also investors who pay for \nthis. At the end of the day, this is not a cost that is just absorbed \nby one group of business people or another. This ends up being passed \non.\n  The very investors that we talk about that can be damaged, and where \nthere is intentional fraud, obviously, they collected from anyone who \nis involved, but in the cases where it was not fraudulent intent, then \nthe investors on the other side of this end up paying, because those \ncosts get shifted.\n  So my colleagues make the point here, it is not just the individual \ncompanies that end up being damaged as a result of this, where they \nliterally today write into their budgets in preparation for these kinds \nof lawsuits being filed, which ends up costing consumers, costing \nbusiness, costing jobs, as a result of a present scheme which allows \nfor people who literally happen to be hanging around, as the \ndistinguished chairman has pointed out, on the margins of this, being \ndrawn into this. That is patently unfair by anyone's standard.\n  In fact, Jane Bryant  Quinn, whose column has been referred to on \nnumerous occasions here in the last 24 hours, makes the point in a \ncolumn. She has criticisms about some aspects of the bill and supports \nothers. She makes a point that the issue of the proportional liability, \nto quote her column, she says ``Some sort of proportional payment is \nfair,'' as the proposal suggests here, and what we have tried to do is \nfashion a scheme that would make those who are even marginally \ninvolved, fully culpable, where you have fraudulent intent; where that \nis not the case, at all, then proportional liability would trigger in.\n  What the amendment from the distinguished Senator from Alabama would \ndo is eliminate virtually that entirely.\n  Again, whatever differences people may have with this bill on safe \nharbor and securities, statute of limitations and so forth, there is, I \nthink, some general consensus that some notion of proportional \nliability and protection against the small investor, particularly the \ninvestor who does not have the kind of resources which this bill also \nprotects, ought to be a part of this legislation.\n  We have tried to do that here in a way that is fair and balanced, and \ntakes into consideration the legitimate concerns of bona fide \nplaintiffs that have been intentionally defrauded, those who are even \nintentionally defrauded, but fall into the smaller category, so there \nis a way to protect their particular interest.\n  We also must try and keep in mind the legitimate interests of those \nwho are not fully culpable. Those businesses out there that are then \nbeing drawn in and asked to pay the entire freight on a matter where \nthey are not at fault to that extent. That is fair, as well.\n  This amendment would gut that, destroy that entirely. We would go \nback to the status quo, and once again we get into this hijacking \nprocess here where those individuals and those companies have to be \nheld accountable.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court observed in the Central Bank of Denver,\n\n       Newer and small companies may find it difficult to obtain \n     advice from professionals because professionals may fear that \n     a newer or smaller company may not survive, that business \n     failure would generate securities litigation against the \n     professional. In addition, the increased costs incurred by \n     professionals because of the litigation and settlement costs \n     may be passed on to their client companies and in turn \n     incurred by the company's investors, and intended \n     beneficiaries of the statute.\n\n  The point being they are the investors that pay the price as result \nof destroying the proportional liabilities provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  I hope this amendment would be defeated.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think what we need to do here this \nmorning is focus on what we are really doing here; focus between a \nwrongdoer, perpetrator of wrong, and the victim of the action.\n  It is not the process of intimidation--I would reject that--but the \nprocess of wrongdoing that we should be concerned with.\n  We should not, Mr. President, we should not protect the perpetrator \nof wrongdoing over the victim. That turns American jurisprudence upside \ndown. I believe here in the Senate today that we should be thinking \nabout the innocent victim and not the perpetrator, not the people who \nput these things in motion and then they want a statute to protect them \nto some extent. That is what that is about here. I think, if the \nMembers of the Senate would really focus on the content of this bill \nand what it will do to the innocent victim, they would feel a lot \nbetter about the amendment.\n\n  The phrase ``hijacking'' was using. That is right, ``hijacking.'' Who \nis going to be hijacked if this bill passes? I will tell you who it is \ngoing to be, it is going to be the innocent victims, it is going to be \nthe innocent people who are going to be hard pressed to press their \nclaims or to collect anything for the wrongdoing in the future.\n  I am real concerned and really disappointed that this bill before the \nSenate will do more to impair the rights of\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nthe small investors in America--and there are millions of them--than it \nwill do to place checks on abusive conduct and frivolous litigation. \nNone of us are interested in frivolous litigation. There is no room for \nthat in our courts. You know, that is one of the reasons, I suppose--\none of the reasons, not the only reason--this bill was brought.\n  But there are bona fide cases in America and there will be in the \nfuture where, if this bill passes, the innocent victims will not be \nable to redress their injuries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared \nin Newsweek by Jane Bryant Quinn, ``Losing Your Right To Sue? Congress \nmay make it hard for you to pursue a case of securities fraud,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, something I thought was ironic here, if \nyou look at S. 240 it starts out and says:\n\n       A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to \n     establish a filing deadline and [listen to this] to provide \n     certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors \n     are well protected.\n\n  Is that what this bill is really about? I submit that it is not. I \nhope the Members of the Senate will focus on this amendment because it \nhas a lot of merit to it. It will strengthen this bill. It will \nstrengthen the rights of victims in America, victims of securities \nfraud. I do commend my colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, for his \ncosponsoring this, and his leadership in this direction.\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 26, 1995]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Losing Your Right To Sue?\n\n\n Congress may make it hard for you to pursue a case of securities fraud\n\n                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)\n\n       Talk about a twist of fate. Rep. Christopher Cox, a \n     California Republican, wrote a tough, aggressive bill on \n     securities-law reform, which passed the House of \n     Representatives in March. If it becomes law, investors who \n     think they've been defrauded will find it incredibly hard to \n     bring a class-action lawsuit to recoup their loss.\n       Just two months after this bill passed, Cox found himself \n     tagged by just such a suit, brought by some victims of the \n     noxious First Pension fraud. In a second suit last week, \n     First Pension's court-appointed receiver charged Cox, among \n     others, with contributing to the hoax. ``Defamatory and \n     wildly false,'' Cox fumes.\n       First Pension handled the paperwork for tax-deferred \n     retirement accounts. It also sold clients fraudulent real-\n     estate investments and secretly tapped their accounts for \n     cash. The company is in receivership, its principals in jail \n     and its customers out $136 million. To recover some money, \n     investors are going after the supporting players. That \n     includes Cox and his former law firm, Latham & Watkins. Cox's \n     job was to set up a company that could have absorbed the \n     purported mortgage investments. The lawsuits allege that he \n     knew, or recklessly failed to find out, that the mortgages \n     weren't sound. Says Cox, ``I did not know. First Pension \n     concealed the fraud.''\n       So is Cox the innocent victim of scorched-earth lawyering? \n     Or is he an enabler who deserves to be called to account? The \n     courts will decide this specific case. But the issue \n     encapsules the conflicts that swirl around securities-law \n     reform.\n       The objective of reform is to staunch what companies claim \n     is a flood of frivolous lawsuits. Greedy lawyers, they say, \n     sue on flimsy grounds. The companies pay as the cheapest way \n     out. But the Cox bill and another bill before the Senate \n     would stifle honest lawsuits, too. Among other things, they:\n       Preserve a Supreme Court decision that sharply limits the \n     time for bringing a securities suit. Formerly, you had three \n     years to sue in federal court, starting from when the fraud \n     was discovered. In 1991, the court cut that back to just one \n     year but in no event more than three years after the date you \n     bought. So if a crook can deceive you long enough, you lose \n     the protection of these laws. Most of First Pension's \n     investors have been caught in that trap, says San Diego \n     attorney Michael Aguirre. The scam began more than a decade \n     ago but investors just recently found it out. So they can't \n     sue for securities fraud, either in federal or state court. \n     Aguirre is suing for common-law fraud, but says that it's not \n     an easy fit.\n       Preserve another Supreme Court decision that lets some of \n     the people who helped with a fraud escape liability for the \n     loss. It's the lawyers/accountants/consultants self-\n     protection clause (although those who are central to the \n     fraud remain on the hook). This rule would have limited the \n     sums recovered by those who bought bad bonds from the \n     notorious Charles Keating, chief of the Lincoln S & L. \n     Keating's company went broke and he went to jail. His duped \n     investors got most of their money back, says San Diego lawyer \n     Bill Lerach, but only because they successfully sued the \n     minions who helped him operate. (I do think, however, that \n     marginal players shouldn't have to foot the entire bill. Some \n     sort of proportional payment is fair, as the proposals \n     suggest.)\n       Make it harder to sue a company that grievously misleads \n     investors. Under current law, it's OK for execs to make good-\n     faith business predictions, even if their guess is wrong. \n     They're liable only for deliberate fibs. But because they \n     worry about lawsuits, they may suppress even reasonable \n     forecasts that might help investors make a decision about the \n     stock. Hence, this proposal, which makes it safer for \n     managers to talk. But like so much else in these slipshod \n     bills, it goes too far. A shady promoter could safely say \n     almost anything. You'd call it a lie; he'd say it was \n     innocent optimism. To win a lawsuit you'd have to prove that \n     the speaker intended to deceive--which is pretty tough to do. \n     Cox's bill (but not the bill in the Senate) could protect \n     even a deliberate lie.\n       Put investors and their lawyers at risk of owing the \n     defendants' legal fees if they lose their case. Cox scoffs at \n     the thought that judges would actually order individuals to \n     pay. ``The lawyer would pay'' and adds the cost to your fee, \n     he says. But the mere threat of owing a corporation's costs \n     will scare people off--and scare all but the best-funded \n     lawyers, too. Sen. Richard Bryan has a better idea. He \n     proposes a screening process that would test the merits of a \n     suit. If the screener thought it was frivolous--and you \n     brought it and lost--then you'd risk paying all the costs. \n     Ditto on the other side, if the company refused to settle \n     what looked like a meritorious claim.\n       Some reasonable, Bryan-like compromises need to be reached \n     because Congress (especially the House) is throwing a bomb at \n     a problem that just needs a switchblade. There's not even a \n     litigation explosion, says James Newman, publisher of \n     Securities Class Action Alert in Cresskill, N.J. The number \n     of lawsuits is up, but that's because more are filed in each \n     dispute. The number of companies sued remains in a constant \n     range. There were only 140 in 1993, he says.\n       Another myth is the oft-heard claim that ``vulture \n     lawyers'' automatically sue if a company's stock falls by 10 \n     percent in a single day. Baruch Lev, a professor at the \n     University of California, Berkeley, tested a version of this \n     idea for the three years ending in 1990. Of 589 companies \n     whose stock price dropped by more than 20 percent in the five \n     days around the time of a disappointing earnings report, only \n     20 were hauled into court. And rarely on the strength of the \n     price drop alone, says Jonathan Cuneo, general counsel of the \n     National Association of Securities and Commercial Law \n     Attorneys. In many of these cases, he says, ``executives are \n     telling the public that everything is going to be great while \n     they're bailing out and selling their own stock.''\n       There's some good stuff in these bills, especially in the \n     Senate version. They stop lawyers from paying a bounty to \n     people who find them clients, block stockholders who sue for \n     a living and try to discourage frivolous suits. But they \n     overreach. In a nation of laws, you're disenfranchised if you \n     lose your day in court.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I see my good friend, Senator Bryan, would like to speak \nand although I do not want to dominate this debate I think it is \nimportant to note that as a result of the give and take in shaping a \nbill that is balanced, we have put into this bill a provision, on page \n138 of the bill, called the Audited Disclosure Of Corporate Fraud. That \nprovision was suggested by our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry.\n  By the way, I do not think including this provision is going to \nchange his final vote on the bill, nor was it an attempt to do that. It \nwas an attempt to make this bill better at the suggestion of our \ncolleague. Senator Kerry pointed out that after our accountants come \nacross situations which are fraudulent, they have a duty to report that \nto the board but they should not be allowed to sit back and relax and \nsay, ``I reported it to the board.'' When we say we are trying to \nprotect the little guy, we are. This provision means that if the board \ndoes not do anything the accountants have to follow up on their report. \nThey must then go to the Securities and Exchange Commission and report \nthis wrongdoing.\n  Why do I mention this? Because when the bill has been characterized \nin some of the media, there is no mention of the protections we have \nbuilt in. I continue to hear that this bill allows people to commit \nfraud. Let me say, as it relates to proportional liability, if you \nknowingly are involved in a fraud you do not escape being liable for \nthe entire suit. And that is the way it should be. In other words, if \nyou participate in a fraudulent scheme then you should be and would be \naccountable for the entire loss.\n  Let us understand what this legislation does is not let the \nfraudulent conduct, or the people who participate in that, off the \nhook.\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge this is an extraordinarily \ncomplicated area of the law. But it has profound implications for \nmillions of Americans who have lost money as a result of investment \nfraud. So, as I commented last night, this is not just an argument \namong lawyers, accountants, bankers and securities underwriters. \nEverybody who has one nickel in a retirement fund, who invests in the \nstock market, everybody who owns a single share of stock, can be \npotentially affected by this.\n  Historically, under the law, since ``the memory of man runneth not to \nthe contrary,'' defendants were jointly and severally liable, \nirrespective of their degree of culpability. That is to say, in a case \nin which several defendants are joined and are found liable, an \nindividual who is 5 percent liable was jointly and severally liable \njust as the individual who may have been 50, 60, or 70 percent liable.\n  The theory is one of equity, balancing the scales of justice that are \nsuch an important symbol of the American judicial system. And that is, \nbasically, who ought to bear the burden? The innocent plaintiff--in \nthis case the investor? Or an individual whose conduct was responsible \nfor the loss? I think it is important to understand that under the \nSecurities Act of 1934, if a defendant is guilty of ordinary \nnegligence--no recovery at all; no recovery at all. An individual \ndefendant who is guilty of gross negligence--no recovery at all.\n  In order for liability to attach to any defendant under the \nSecurities Act, the conduct must be either intentional or knowing or \nreckless conduct. So when we are talking about balancing the burden we \nare not talking about somebody who just made a little mistake. We all \nmake mistakes. We are not talking about somebody who did something \naccidental. We are talking about somebody whose conduct was intentional \nor knowing, or somebody whose conduct was reckless. In my judgment that \nis not an unreasonable standard to hold somebody liable for.\n  What S. 240 does is to change centuries of American jurisprudence by \ndividing categories of defendants, some jointly and several, and some \nproportionate liability. Let me say, I agree in part with what our \ncolleagues who drafted S. 240 have attempted to do. The amendment, \nwhich my distinguished colleague from Alabama offers, recognizes that \ndistinction.\n  What we say, and what S. 240 in its current form says, is that if the \nconduct is intentional or knowing, then all such defendants whose \nconduct rises to that level of misconduct are jointly and severally \nliable, which means that a plaintiff can recover against any one of \nthose the full 100 percent of his or her or its loss.\n  A new category is established under S. 240, and also under the \namendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Alabama, that says \nwith respect to those who are reckless---not intentional, not knowing \nmisconduct, but reckless misconduct, they will be guilty in a \nproportionate liability sense. That is their legal responsibility.\n  I am willing to recognize that in terms of trying to seek that \nequilibrium on the scales of justice that is not an unreasonable \nproposition. But here is the fundamental distinction between S. 240 in \nthis, and the amendment of my distinguished colleague that I am happy \nto support. Remember the basic premise: Who ought to bear the burden, \nthe totally innocent investor or those whose conduct rises to the level \nof intentional and knowing fraud or reckless misconduct? That is not a \ndifficult proposition for me. I think, between those two categories, \nthose who are totally innocent of any misconduct ought to have the \nright to recover for their economic loss.\n  I might just say, over my years as a Member of this institution, we \nhave debated product liability endlessly.\n  That was one of the titanic battles of the last Congress, the \nCongress before that, and this Congress. And, as the distinguished \noccupant of the chair and my colleagues on the floor know, we passed \nproduct liability. Some of us were against it; some of us for it. But \nit is interesting to note that with respect to product liability and \neconomic loss as opposed to pain and suffering, there was never a \nsuggestion that we ought to, in effect, make some of those defendants \nproportionately liable and not jointly and severally liable.\n  So for those who followed that debate closely, it was never suggested \nthat someone who was only 5 or 10 or 15 percent liable for the economic \nloss in a product liability lawsuit would only be responsible for 10 or \n15 percent. Each and every defendant is jointly and severally liable \nunder the new product liability bill that passed this Congress.\n  So whether the misconduct is 5 or 95 percent, the plaintiff has the \nright to recover 100 percent of his or her or its economic loss. The \nonly thing we did--many of us disagreed with that--is we put a cap on \npain and suffering but not economic damage.\n  What we are talking about in this legislation is not pain and \nsuffering. We are talking about economic loss for investors who have \npurchased securities and, as a result of securities fraud, they have \nlost money.\n  So I just share with my colleague the irony that all of this great \nordeal that we have gone through over the past--this will be the fourth \nCongress that I have been privileged to serve in--it was never \nsuggested in product liability that we ought to, in effect, create \nthese categories of proportionate or joint and several liability. The \nplaintiff was entitled to 100 percent of his or her or its recovery.\n  This is in the abstract. My distinguished colleague from California, \nmy distinguished colleague from Maryland, and I yesterday mentioned the \nKeating case. The reason why we mentioned the Keating case is, if you \nlook at the malefactors' greed in that great decade of the eighties and \nyou look at the icons, you see the Milkens, the Boeskys and the Charles \nKeatings. Those are household names in terms of frauds perpetrated upon \nthe American people costing innocent people hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  Somehow it has been suggested that this action 240 has nothing to do \nwith the Keating case. Let me remind my colleagues that I will be \noffering in the Record that the actions brought on behalf of a class of \ndefrauded investors against Mr. Keating were brought under the \nSecurities Act, the very act that we are amending. We are talking about \nthe Securities Act of 1934, the RICO provisions, and the Securities Act \nof 1933.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am not certain, but I believe--and I know that we all \nwatch legal proceedings today--that the securities actions that were \nbrought against Charles Keating were brought by the Government. Is not \nthat true?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is not true. In responding to my good friend and \ndistinguished chairman, they were brought as part of a private cause of \naction on behalf of a class. Mr. Keating was a defendant together with \na whole host of others. I will not belabor the chairman's time. But it \nwas a whole category.\n  The point I want to make in responding to my good friend's question \nis that the heart and soul and essence of the recovery, $262 million, \nwas brought under the Securities Act. That was the underpinning, the \nfoundation, the premise, the essence of the cause of action.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is it not true, though, that there was knowing fraud \nbeing committed?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The answer to that would be, in some instances, yes. But \nthere were other defendants which, under S. 240, would fit under the \nproportionate liability classification. And in the Keating case, as the \ndistinguished chairman knows, Mr. Keating was bankrupt. There is no \nquestion he was a primary offender; no question he would be jointly and \nseverally liable under the bill as drafted by the chairman.\n  But what makes the Keating case so significant is that the amount of \nrecovery by the plaintiffs would have been reduced dramatically because \nthere were others who were not in the category of potential and knowing \nfraud whose conduct was knowingly reckless.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. In fairness, my friend did answer that. I would like to \nmake the point that those people whose conduct under this bill was \nknowingly fraudulent, even if they were only partially responsible, \nwill still be liable\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nfor the entire amount if the others have gone bankrupt. In other words, \nand in layman's terms, if you committed fraud intentionally, and others \nhave gone bankrupt, you can be held liable for the entire amount. I \nthink we need to keep that fact in sight. That was my the point.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Before responding to a question from my colleague from \nCalifornia, the chairman is correct that those who are intentional in \ntheir fraud, and knowingly, are jointly and severally liable. In the \nKeating case, there was a whole list of people, however, who would be \naiders and abettors. Under the provisions of S. 240, aiders and \nabettors are home scot-free; no recovery at all.\n  There was another category of individuals. Some of them were firms \nand some of them were securities underwriters who would fit under the \nnew classification of reckless conduct. And they would come under only \nthe proportionate liability. Much of the recovery, much of the $260 \nmillion the innocent plaintiffs in the Keating case recovered, was from \nthe reckless category.\n  I say in all due respect to the chairman, whom I greatly respect, \nthat recovery would be greatly and dramatically reduced because under \nS. 240 there is only proportionate liability.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just want to point out that the \nrecklessness standard has long been a part of the common law for \npurposes of fraud. It is a very high standard. The chairman of the \ncommittee earlier said, Well, you know, someone could come in and be \nnegligent, and they are going to be held jointly and severally liable. \nThat has never been the law. It is not the law. It will not be the law \nunder the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  The definition of reckless conduct--let me read the definition that \nis generally used by the courts: ``A highly unreasonable omission \ninvolving not merely simple or even gross negligence''--so it is higher \nthan simple negligence, it is higher than gross negligence--``involving \nnot merely simple or even gross negligence but an extreme departure \nfrom the standards of ordinary care, and which present a danger of \nmisleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant, or \nis so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.''\n  The way the bill is written now, the phrase ``ignorance is bliss'' is \ngoing to take on a meaning that just staggers the imagination.\n  The problem that is being talked about, about the strike suits, is \ndealt with up front in the bill. You try to make it harder to bring \nthose suits. We support a lot of those provisions. This is, simply put, \na question whether fraud participants are going to be put ahead of \ninnocent victims and individual investors. I mean, why in the world, if \na fraud has been committed, should the burden fall on the innocent \nvictim of the fraud and not on the people who have been participants in \nthe fraud?\n  I defy anyone to explain to me the logic or the rationale for \nprotecting the participant of the fraud ahead of the innocent victim of \nthe fraud.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California. I \njust assure my friend from North Carolina that I intend to be very \nbrief because I know he wishes to speak. It is not my purpose to \npreempt the time of those who share a different point of view.\n  I am delighted to respond to my friend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Nevada and my friend from Alabama \nfor this amendment because if we are not here to protect innocent \nvictims, then what are we here for? That is the bottom line. Yes, we \nwant to correct problems and we want to do it right, but we have to \nlook at the bottom line. That is why I am so grateful to my friend for \nbringing up the Keating case, because when this Senator brought up the \nKeating case late in the night she was told--in some very agitated \ntones, frankly--that the Keating case had nothing to do with this \nsection of the law we are amending.\n  Well, I have the documents in front of me, and it is very clear they \nare class action lawsuits based on violations of the Securities Act of \n1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. And at some point I am going to \nput these in the Record, as I promised my chairman last night that I \nwould do, for all to see.\n  I am so grateful to my friend from Nevada for bringing this up. This \nbill is about the Charles Keatings of the future and whether they are \ngoing to commit the kind of financial atrocities they committed in the \npast.\n  Now, that is not the goal of the authors of this, but it is an \nunintended consequence of this if we are not careful, if we do not \nlisten to Arthur Levitt of the SEC, if we do not listen to the \nconsumers, if we do not listen to the securities people in each and \nevery State including my own State, including those in Connecticut, \nincluding those in New York, and all over this country who are against \nthis bill, and a New York Times editorial today, which really takes on \nthis bill.\n  So the question I have for my friend is this. The Senator from \nAlabama and the Senator from Nevada are putting before us what they \nconsider to be a correction. It is technical; it is difficult for \npeople to understand, but I wish to ask my friend a direct question \nbecause I know he is a student of the Keating case and I know he has \nstated that the Keating case is involved here.\n  If S. 240 had been in effect and the joint and several liability had \nbeen changed, would it have adversely affected those people who \neventually collected because they were able to go to these other actors \nin the suit?\n  Mr. BRYAN. To answer my distinguished colleague from California, it \nwould have adversely affected the plaintiffs. It would have reduced \ntheir amount of recovery by tens of millions of dollars. The overall \namount of the recovery was $262 million as a result of the class action \nfiled under the securities laws. It would have reduced that amount by \ntens of millions of dollars, and I will try--I do not have the number \nright before me--to develop that number to give more particularity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am finished with my questions. But what I really \nappreciate about his presentation is it is not some academic debate. \nYou are telling this Senate, and I hope they are listening, that if we \nchange the laws too much, if we go too far--and, yes, we should correct \nit--the people who collected in the Keating case would not have \ncollected tens of millions of dollars, and it includes this amendment \nthat is standing before us.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from California. I am going to be very \nbrief, as I assured my colleague----\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would be happy to yield. I recognize that others want to \nspeak on this issue, and I do not want to dominate, and I do need to \nmake a couple other points. But I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I just ask my colleague here: If the provisions of this \nlegislation, in fact, had been in place at the time, my colleague from \nNevada is not suggesting, I hope, by his comments that the Keating case \nwould have, as it was finally concluded as we know, changed necessarily \nthe awards to the plaintiffs in that case because of the proportionate \nliability provisions of this legislation, because we are not dealing \nwith that?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would respond with all due respect--the Senator knows \nhow greatly I respect his insight into this process--dramatically, \ncategorically and emphatically. If S. 240 had been in effect at the \ntime of the Keating action, the recoveries would have been tens of \nmillions of dollars, maybe even more than $100 million, less.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, I totally disagree with that \nconclusion. In fact, I think we might have enhanced, had the provisions \nof this bill been in place, the collection rather than deny, because of \nthe requirement of accountants to actually report the kind of problems \nthat they were not required to under existing law at the time of the \nKeating proceedings.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator. I am just going to make one point. \nThe fundamental difference between the Bryan-Shelby amendment and S. \n240 is that it recognizes, as does the chairman and the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, that we create two classes of liability. One \nis joint and\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\nseveral, and the other is proportionate. But the fundamental \ndistinction is that in the Shelby-Bryan amendment, if those who are \njointly and severally liable are judgment proof, that is, they are \ninsolvent, they are in prison, they have taken flight, they are unable \nto respond to the full amount of damages, our legislation in the \namendment would require you to look first to the joint and several \nliability. But if the innocent investor was unable to recover the full \namount of his or her losses, then you could look to the proportionate \nliability, those people whose conduct was reckless, and the plaintiff \ncan fully recover.\n  Under the print before us, that would not be possible; there is a \nlimitation, and you can only recover against the proportionate \nliability the amount that is determined to be the proportionate \nliability plus another 50 percent.\n  So let us say, for example, that the loss was $1 million, that there \nwas a 10-percent responsibility on the part of a reckless defendant. \nWith proportionate liability, the full amount that you could recover \nwould be $100,000. Under the bill that is currently before us, the full \namount that you could recover would be $150,000, even though the loss \nmight be $1 million.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Who would bear the burden of the other $850,000 in that \ncase?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The innocent plaintiff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The plaintiff.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The investor, who was not at fault at all.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why should that investor, who was the victim of a \nfraud, have to swallow $850,000 of the loss when there are parties who \nwere participants in the fraud who ought to be held accountable?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would agree with the observation made by the Senator \nfrom Maryland. I cannot comprehend the public policy of saying, look, \nthose who are active and are involved in reckless misconduct in this \ncase, they should have their liability limited so that the innocent \nplaintiff, innocent investor, should bear the loss. I do not think that \nis responsible public policy, I would say in response to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield further, because I wish to \nbe fair to my friend from Connecticut and the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, they say, well, there are these strike suits and we have \nto try to preclude them because these deep pocket people are being held \nup, as it were.\n  The way you handle that problem, as is done in this bill, is you make \nit more difficult to bring the strike suit so you clear out the so-\ncalled frivolous suits that have been asserted. And we agree that that \nis a desirable objective. But by definition, the cases we are talking \nabout are cases where there is liability and there has been fraud, and \nin that instance there is no rationale that I can think of that \nwarrants putting the participant in the fraud ahead of the innocent \nvictim of the fraud.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I simply respond to my friend's question by saying I share \nthat view.\n  I know others desire to speak. I must say the view shared by the \nSenator from Maryland and the distinguished Senator from Alabama and I \nis a view that is endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the North American Association of Securities Administrators. So we \nare not alone in making that determination.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Nevada would \nyield for one question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Does the Senator from Nevada know anywhere in American \njurisprudence where the victim is left out in the cold like they would \nbe if this bill passes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. In responding to the question, I would not presume to know \nall jurisprudence, but I can think of no instance in which, as a matter \nof public policy, a determination is made where the wrongdoer should \nbenefit and that the innocent victim should suffer the consequence of \nthe wrongdoer's conduct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I heard the questions and the arguments \nback and forth on the Shelby-Bryan amendment, and certainly both are \ndistinguished Senators and very good friends, so I somewhat with \nhesitation oppose the Shelby-Bryan amendment. But as I mentioned \nyesterday, one of the key provisions of this bill is the reform of the \nproportionate liability rules. This is unethical lawyers going after \ndeep pockets.\n  It says very simply that you or a company pay your fair share of the \nlosses that you or your company might have caused. If 10 percent was \nyour share of the loss, then you pay 10 percent. I think it is a \nreasonable provision that you pay for the damages that you cause, but \nnot others.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the bill already goes several steps in the \ndirection that Mr. Shelby and Mr. Bryan would like.\n  First, for those persons or companies that engage in knowing fraud, \nthey become jointly and severally liable. So they do not come under the \nproportionate rules. They will have to pay more than their share and if \nany of the fellow defendants--anybody else in the suit--are insolvent, \nthen they are committed to paying that portion. If knowing fraud was \ncommitted, they are not covered, and they simply have to pay it all if \nthey are the only ones with any money.\n  Second, investors with a financial net worth under $200,000 will be \nmade whole even if there are insolvent defendants. This is not a small \npool of people. This is about 99 percent of America. This was supposed \nto be the so-called widows and orphans provision that I assume was one \nof the things being talked about this morning.\n  This was a provision whereby we protect the small investor. I think \nthe current bill goes further, so the bill is already protecting \nwidows, orphans and a lot more.\n  The Shelby-Bryan amendment would go even further. His amendment \nproposes to protect the little fellow, which we have already covered, \nbut also it would protect the sophisticated investor without \ndistinction.\n  I have to oppose the amendment. Too often the lawyers that deal in \nthese type of securities suits go after one thing: The deep pockets, \nknowing that the deep pockets will have to pick up the whole tab of the \nlitigation. That is why they get sued in the first place. The fact that \nthey can go after the deep pockets is probably one of the principal \nreasons the suit was filed to begin with.\n  Of course, the lawyers hope it will never go to trial. They hope that \nthe person with the deep pockets will simply settle the case and they \nwill simply never have to take a weak case to court. We know that the \nlawyers collect the lion's share of the money that is settled before or \nduring court. The investors get pennies, if even that, on the dollar.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I have a great deal of respect for both \nSenator Bryan and Senator Shelby, but I am adamantly in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager of the bill is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let us take a look at this. My \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada has put forth a very compelling \ncase on the principles underlying joint and several.\n  Let us turn to the abstract--let us look at reality. Do you want to \nknow what the reality is? About 300 cases being brought a year--and, \nbelieve me, they are not being brought on behalf of stockholders, the \nstockholders are being used; 93 percent of those cases are settled. Do \nyou think they are being settled because the people have done something \nwrong? The vast majority of those cases are being settled because an \ninnocent person cannot face the exposure and cost of this kind of suit.\n  Minimal participation, not knowing fraud, but just being around the \ncompany, being the auditor, being the lawyers, being the investment \nadviser can bring you to the case. Let me tell you something, when you \nare facing a $100 million or a $200 million lawsuit and you can buy \nyour way out for $6 or $7\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nmillion, and your lawyer says and the board of directors says settle \nit, you have no choice but to settle. These cases take people and put \nthem up against a wall. They cannot fight; they have to surrender. It \nis as if you held them up. We are providing the ability for legal \nblackmail. We have to stop that.\n  This bill does assign greater responsibility. If you know the fraud \nis taking place, that this business that is going on, this hanky-panky \nin the company, if you are the auditor, you have to report it.\n  Some people in the past did report it. They said, ``We reported it to \nthe managing directors,'' and that is the end of our responsibility. We \ngo further and say you have to report it and see that the directors \nact, and if they do not, you have to go to the SEC. That is how you \ndeal with fraud.\n  I want to assure you that Senator Domenici and Senator Dodd do not \nwant to protect fraudulent acts. But just because they are alleged does \nnot mean the companies should be forced to settle without a chance to \ndefend themselves. Is it right to force people who are coerced into \nsettling to pay for the losses of the so-called victims? I say so-\ncalled. Some of these cases are totally without merit. I am not talking \nabout the Keating case. Of the 300 cases that are settled, most of them \nare meritless, but what we have constructed is a system where a person \ncannot defend him or herself because the cost of that defense, is \nprohibitive and the effects of the negative exposure, even though the \nexposure may be minimal, are so great.\n  A company can be wiped out by these suits, a company can be hit for \n$300, $400 million, so how can they not settle for $2 or $3 million? \nInvestors are not being made whole. You would believe and think somehow \ninvestors are being made whole, but they get pennies for their losses.\n  What we are talking about is giving people the ability to defend \nthemselves. Most of these defendants have not even reached negligence \nstandards. But the law is not clear on those standards, and a jury \ndecision is never a sure thing. How can a firm put in the hands of the \njury the decision of whether they are totally wiped out? Some 600, 700, \n800, 900 people who everyday go to work and depend on those jobs, wiped \nout? They cannot afford to defend themselves. A lawyer can say, ``Look, \nI think you are going to win; you have a 90-percent chance of \nwinning.''\n  ``Ninety percent? You mean to tell me that I have a 10-percent chance \nof losing and getting hit with the entire settlement which could wipe \nout this firm just because I'm the guy with the deep pockets?\"\n  The answer is yes. This causes a huge cost to society? When you pay \nyour insurance premiums, you are paying for these settlements. Also, \nthe cost of insurance for the firms has gotten so high, because the \ninsurance firm is worried it will be sued, that many small firms cannot \nafford it. These costs are passed out to everybody.\n  We are not protecting somebody who commits fraud. What we want to do \nis give people a reasonable opportunity to defend themselves; to have \nthat opportunity and not to face this incredibly destructive process in \nwhich they really cannot defend themselves; 93 percent of these cases \nare being settled because the firms cannot afford to defend themselves.\n  That is not what the American justice system is about: You should \nsend somebody a summons and they have to surrender. That is what is \nhappening. You have the entrepreneurial lawyers who have made this an \nart form, who basically hire these plaintiffs. They have them on the \npayroll. They bring them in and race to the courthouse. They are not \ninterested in getting money back for poor defrauded people and, in many \ncases, there has been no fraud.\n  I will tell you what is a fraud in this system. When you coerce \nsomebody to pay and they have not done anything wrong, that is a \nfraud. I have not heard anybody say anything about the fraud of \ncoercing honest, hard-working people because they find they would face \nfinancial ruin if they defended themselves or there were some finding \nagainst them and they would be responsible for the entire settlement. \nThey cannot even fight it out because the risks are so great, they must \nsurrender.\n\n  What about that kind of fraud? Is that what our system is about--that \nwe strip away the ability of a person to stand up for his or her rights \nbecause to do so would be totally destructive to them? I do not think \nthat is what our system is about, but that is what they have turned the \nsystem into. If you intentionally committed fraud you should pay the \npiper. That is what we are saying.\n  Do you know why the lawyers are against this? I will tell you why. It \nis because this will give to the entrepreneur who built a building, the \nfellow that is the accountant, the securities people, the investors, \nthe ability to stand up and fight. The strike suit lawyers do not want \nthat. These lawyers be able to hit everyone with that summons--just \nlike holding a gun to them--and then say, OK, how much you are going to \npay us. They do not want the guy to have the ability to reach back and \ntake that gun and say, in return, OK, let us fight it out. They do not \nwant cases to be heard on whether or not there was real fraud.\n  This Senator does not want to protect anybody who commits fraud. That \nis nonsense that I read in these insipid editorials--insipid. We want \nto give people their day in court. If you want to protect the holdup \nartists we should we should keep joint and several liability.\n  I hear people say, you are going to be defending the Keatings. No \nway. If the fraud is intentional, we are going to get you. Charles \nKeating was selling products for a bank and suggested that the Federal \nGovernment was insuring it. Senator Dodd and I cosponsored legislation \nwe introduced on May 5, 1995, that financial institutions cannot sell \nthese products and imply they are backed by the Government. That is how \nyou stop the Charles Keating types. We will hold these people \nresponsible, and we are going to stop them from conducting these \nactions. Let us not talk about defending fraudulent conduct. We do not. \nBut we must give a person an opportunity to fight for himself instead \nof giving up to the holdup artists.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me try to bring this back to the point \nat hand here. Let us get some matters off the table. We are not talking \nabout intentional and knowing fraud. ``Joint and several'' still \napplies on intentional and knowing fraud. We have tried to deal in this \nlegislation with the issue of recklessness, because it is in that area \nof recklessness that we feel the issue of proportionate liability ought \nto have some application--not intentional, not knowing, but in reckless \nbehavior.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the thoughts of those who spent a \ngreat deal of time on this issue. In fact, as pointed out by one \nauthority, the vagueness of the recklessness standard is one of the \nprincipal reasons, Mr. President, that the joint and several liability \nprovisions ought to be modified. In practice, the legal standard does \nnot provide protection against unjustified and abusive claims, because \njuries can--and as a practical matter do--misapply the standard. Juries \ntoday, quite frankly, have considerable difficulty in distinguishing \ninnocent mistakes, negligence, and even gross negligence--none of \nwhich, by the way, Mr. President, is actionable under rule 10(b)(5) \nfrom recklessness.\n  One commentator observed that the courts have been less than precise \nin defining what exactly constitutes a reckless misrepresentation. The \nimprecision of the court, he went on to say, has resulted in ad hoc, if \nnot arbitrary and reckless, determinations. The result is that the \nactual and potential parties to section 10 and rule 10(b)(5) actions \ncannot predict with any degree of certainty how a trier of fact would \ncharacterize alleged conduct and thus whether it may serve the basis \nfor liability.\n  There is a whole series of discussions about the problems in \ndetermining that particular criteria. So in the recklessness area, we \napply the proportional liability provisions. Much of the reason goes to \nthe heart of what the Senator from New York was talking about. Once you \nare into it, and if it is only joint and several, and if you are a \nmarginal player and you could be held for the whole amount, that is \nunfair and lacks balance, just as it would be if\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\nyou would deprive a legitimate plaintiff of any kind of compensation at \nall.\n  Go back and look, if you will, at the statements of all of the \npreceding members of the Securities and Exchange Commission on this \nvery point.\n  Carter Bees said:\n\n       Allocating liability on the basis of the proportion of each \n     defendant's contribution to a plaintiff's harm would address \n     these problems by changing incentives. Plaintiffs may be less \n     likely to name secondary market participants if the potential \n     recovery from these entities was relatively small. Secondary \n     market participants who are nonetheless sued would be more \n     willing to defend those cases they believed were without \n     merit, rather than entering into a quick settlement in order \n     to avoid broader liability exposure.\n\n  Adversely, I point out, affecting these investors as well.\n  The Senator from New York is correct. Let us make the system work. \nLet us get to court if that is where you have to go. This involves very \nlittle court participation because of this particular standing. ``You \nare an idiot not to pay.'' That is what their lawyers and accountants \ntell them, rather than jeopardize the entire operation, in some cases, \nbecause of the size of the claims.\n  Richard Breeden, former SEC Chairman noted:\n\n       The current application of joint and several liability \n     results in a system that should perhaps be called inverted \n     disproportionate liability. Under this system, parties who \n     are central to a perpetrating of fraud often pay little if \n     anything. At the same time, those whose involvement might be \n     only peripheral and lack any deliberate or knowing \n     participation in the fraud often pay the most in damages.\n\n  That is not right. That is unfair, Mr. President. He concluded by \nsaying:\n\n       Paying your fair share but no more than your fair share of \n     liability is hardly a radical proposal.\n\n  That is what we are suggesting.\n  David Ruder, a former Chairman of the SEC, said:\n\n       The threat that the secondary defendants can become liable \n     for all of the damage caused by the primary wrongdoers has \n     had a dramatic affect upon the settlement negotiations in \n     large class action suits. These actions frequently have been \n     settled by secondary defendants for significant sums because \n     of the possibility that they will be required to pay the \n     entire amount claimed and thus destroying them.\n\n  He concluded:\n\n       Reform of joint and several liability is necessary because \n     the fees received by accountants, lawyers, and banks for \n     their commercial services do not justify enormous dollar \n     judgments against them on securities class action cases.\n\n  So, Mr. President, what we have tried to do in this bill is to strike \nthat balance that everybody talks about rhetorically but denies we have \nachieved here. We do not include the intentional knowing specifically. \nWe protect the small investor--$200,000. Only 1 percent of the people \nin this country have incomes in excess of $100,000. We are talking \nabout a very small number of people who would actually be affected. The \noverwhelming majority are still protected as a result of the widows or \norphans provision we put in.\n  Also, recent data indicate that the median net worth of American \nfamilies is $47,200. So we protect those people when we have \nintentional and knowing fraud. Even if you are marginally involved, you \npay all of it. That is what we have tried to do. To wipe all of that \nout strikes out the balance of this legislation. That is what the years \nof work have tried to achieve here.\n  Now, do we know how perfectly it is going to work? No. To my \ncolleagues who cite potential future cases, how do I argue against a \npotential future case without knowing the facts except to cite some \ndraconian case that conjures up the worst fears in people. I do not \nknow the exact application. I know that presently the system stinks. \nThat much I know. We have made an effort to change this, to avoid the \nkind of problem that exists where 93 percent of the cases are settled \nbecause people make the conclusion you would be an idiot not to do so \nbecause you are jeopardizing your entire business.\n  There is something wrong with the system that results in that kind of \nconclusion.\n  Now, we hope this will work. Time will tell whether or not we have \ndone it absolutely perfectly. I suspect we have not done it perfectly.\n  This much we know: The present system does not work. It says to \ninnocent, relatively innocent, marginal players, ``You must assume the \nentire responsibility for the vague standard of recklessness,'' I think \nis unfair.\n  Intentional knowing--pay the price. Protect the widows and orphans--\nthat you must do. To say we are sorry, those on the periphery here will \npay a full tab where a reckless standard is applied, I think is unfair.\n  We have applied the standard in the law to see if we can get some \nbalance into the system, get people to court. If there is a real fight, \nfight it out. Do not just achieve these huge awards because people are \nafraid to go into court, knowing what the price would be if they are \nultimately asked to pay the entire tab, when they are only marginally \ninvolved.\n  That is the whole purpose. Citing future cases and what may happen \ndown the road, engaging in the scare tactic approach--the Senator from \nNew York, the Senator from New Mexico, myself, and others who put this \nbill together--do my colleagues really believe we are trying to do \nsomething here that would potentially expose people to future Keatings? \nBy God, how could any Member possibly draw that conclusion?\n  We are trying to get balance into a system that is out of balance. \nThat is all this is intended to do. My hope is that the Shelby \namendment will be resoundingly defeated.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBoxer and Sarbanes be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask that a statement by the Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission regarding proportionate \nliability be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       SEC Chairman Levitt has been forceful about the need to \n     protect fraud victims in the insolvency situation, even when \n     it forces parties who are only partially responsible for the \n     harm to bear more than their proportionate share of the \n     damages. In 1994 House testimony, Levitt explained:\n       ``Since securities fraud cases often involve insolvent \n     issuers or individuals, however, some defendants in such \n     cases may not be able to pay their fair share of the damages \n     they have jointly caused. Advocates of proportionate \n     liability argue that joint and several liability produces an \n     inequitable result in such circumstances because it forces \n     parties who are only partially responsible for the harm to \n     bear more than their proportionate share of the damages. . . \n     .''\n       ``The response to this argument is that, although the \n     traditional doctrine of joint and several liability may cause \n     accountants and others to bear more than their proportional \n     share of liability in particular cases, this is because the \n     current system is based on equitable principles that operate \n     to protect innocent investors. In essence, as between \n     defrauded investors and the professional advisers who assist \n     a fraud by knowingly or recklessly failing to meet \n     professional standards, the risk of loss should fall on the \n     latter. Defrauded investors should not be denied an \n     opportunity to recover all of their losses simply because \n     some defendants are more culpable than others.''\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe the bottom line here is balance. \nThe balance is, who should bear the cost of fraud? That is the question \nbefore the Senate today. Who should bear the cost of fraud?\n  Should it be the perpetrators, or should it be the victims? It should \nbe the perpetrators, and never the victims. I think that is a bottom \nline of American jurisprudence.\n  This bill, if it were to pass, would change that, unless we adopted \nthe amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself, Senators Bryan, \nBoxer, and Sarbanes.\n  This amendment makes sense. Why do we think the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission supports it? We do not need any more \nKeatings in America. We did not need anything close to that in America. \nWe do not need to pass a bill up here without protection of the \ninnocent people that invest. We should never, never, Mr. President, try \nto protect the perpetrators of wrong in America.\n  I believe this amendment makes a lot of sense. I urge my colleagues \nat the proper time to vote for it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, under the agreement, we indicated we \nwould\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\nvote at 10:55. Let me suggest at 10:55 we vote.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to commend both Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Dodd for their splendid arguments today.\n  While I normally find the distinguished Senator, Senator Shelby, to \nbe rational and reasonable, let me suggest in this case I would \nsummarize this, this way: What we have had heretofore in the United \nStates, before this new approach, is a cookie-cutter complaint.\n  What they do is draft up a complaint, and it contains the right \nwords, regardless of the facts.\n  Now, we can count on it, I say to my good friend from Mississippi, \nmake this joint and several, dependent upon recklessness--which nobody \nunderstands--and every complaint will accuse the whole crowd of being \nreckless.\n  It will not be just a case of ``under certain circumstances.'' The \nissue will be, those reckless people will have to be subject to joint \nand several total liability for a little tiny bit of negligence. It \nwill be all of them in the same suit, under the word ``reckless,'' and \nwe are right back where we started, and we will not have accomplished \nthe reforms that we seek, to balance a very unfair system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, because of a longstanding \ncommitment to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars, I will be \nnecessarily absent on Friday. If I were to be present, I would vote for \nthe Shelby-Bryan amendment on joint and several liability.\n  This amendment would continue to allow victims of securities fraud to \nrecover their losses by holding all those who participated in the fraud \njoint and severally liable for the damages.\n  In many instances, the primary culprit in a securities fraud declares \nbankruptcy. The only resource for an innocent victim is to recover \ntheir full losses from others who contributed to the fraudulent \nactivity.\n  While the pending bill would hold those who ``knowingly'' contribute \nto a fraud severally liable, it would limit the liability of those who \n``recklessly'' contribute. This provision means that innocent victims \nwill pay for the fraud inflicted on them, rather than those who \nrecklessly contributed to their victimization. That is simply not \nright.\n  Mr. President, there is serious abuse of our litigation system. Too \noften, frivolous suits are brought in order to wrest money from \ndefendants who find it far easier and less expensive to settle the case \nout of court than to pay the exorbitant cost of defending themselves. \nWhile we must take steps to address such abuse, we must take great care \nthat in that effort we do not unfairly diminish the ability of truly \ninnocent victims of fraud to fully recover their losses from those who \nparticipated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10:55 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Shelby amendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nKempthorne], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], and the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], \nthe Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], the Senator from New York [Mr. \nMoynihan], the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], and the Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Simon] are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 30, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 282 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Cohen\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thompson\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Bond\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--13\n\n     Bumpers\n     Campbell\n     Gramm\n     Harkin\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Pryor\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n  So the amendment (No. 1468) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues are inquiring \nabout the schedule for the remainder of the day, and I want to \ncongratulate the managers for their good work until late last evening \nafter somewhere around 10:30. This is a major bill.\n  What I would like to do is propound a unanimous-consent request. I \nhave been told it has been worked out with the managers for action on \nMonday, and if we can do this on Monday, then there will be no more \nvotes today.\n  So I would ask consent that when the Senate resumes S. 240 at 12 noon \non Monday--there is going to be additional debate this afternoon. This \nrefers only to Monday. We go on the bill at 12 noon--Senator Sarbanes \nbe recognized to offer an amendment relative to proportional liability, \nand there be a time limitation of 2 hours to be equally divided in the \nusual form, with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that at 2 p.m. the Sarbanes amendment be laid \naside, and that Senator Boxer be recognized to offer a relevant \namendment, on which there be 90 minutes equally divided, with no \nsecond-degree amendment in order prior to a failed motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could I just make an inquiry, reserving the right to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have no objection. In other words, we are leaving the \nBoxer amendment open to a second-degree amendment, is that right?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. We were not certain what the subject matter is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And I further ask that at 3:30 p.m. the Senate resume the \nBryan statute of limitations amendment, and there be 90 minutes of \ndebate to be divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator indicated he needed additional time.\n  I further ask that at 5 o'clock on Monday, the Senate proceed to vote \non or in relation to the Bryan amendment, to be followed by a vote on \nor in relation to the Sarbanes amendment, to be followed by a vote on \nor in relation to the Boxer amendment; that there be 2 minutes for \nexplanation between the second and third stacked votes to be in the \nusual form. In other words, Members get a brief explanation. Senator \nByrd suggested, I think, a good idea. So that when they vote, they will \nhave the latest information on that particular amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There will be 2 minutes to a side?\n  Mr. DOLE. One.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One minute to each side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I would ask the majority \nleader--I am told we have one Member\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\nwho is returning at 5 o'clock--if we could move that to 5:15 to \naccommodate his schedule I think it would probably work a little bit \nbetter.\n  Mr. DOLE. As long as it does not cause any problem. The time of 5:15 \nis fine with me.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Burns actually spoke to me earlier, and we \nslipped it from 4:30 to 5 to accommodate him, or as I understood it was \nslipped from 4:30 to 5 to accommodate Senator Burns, and if we could \nslip it another 15 minutes----\n  Mr. DOLE. At 5:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The first vote will be at 5:15, and the rest will follow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished majority leader \nproceeds--reserving the right to object, and I will not object--I thank \nthe distinguished majority leader for providing time for explanation \nbefore the vote on each of the stacked amendments. My question is, Will \nthere only be three stacked votes for Monday?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DODD. There may be votes after 5:15.\n  Mr. BYRD. That was not my question.\n  Mr. DODD. Stacked votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Only three stacked votes. I thank all leaders.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. For the information of all Senators, a lot of amendments \nwill be debated during the day on Monday and the first vote will occur \nat 5:15. We will notify all offices, certainly the Democratic side and \nthe Republican side, and I again wish to thank the managers for the \nprogress. It is a very important bill. I listened to the debate last \nnight and learned a little bit after I got home. You were still \ndebating. It is an important bill, very important bill. In view of the \nprogress made and the fact there is going to be an amendment debated \nthis afternoon, I think it is safe to announce--and I have checked with \nthe Democratic leader--no more votes today.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, as we return to the bill, Senator Bryan \nhas an amendment to offer.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I say to the Senator, because others have asked to \nproceed in morning business, we are ready to take the amendment which \nour colleague wants to put up, and if it is going to be protracted, I \ndo not want to open the door.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I only asked to speak in morning business for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Might I ask my colleague--because he has a time problem, \nwe have provided that we would go to this--that Senator Bryan be at \nleast permitted to proceed and then I would have no objection to moving \nforward.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might, I can assure my colleague that I am simply \ngoing to lay an amendment down, speak for approximately 5 minutes, so \nthat I do not in any way--we did make a commitment to lay this down, \nand I have a time commitment in terms of a flight to get so I will \naccommodate the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of that comment, I will defer \nfor a few moments. And I thank the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1469\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide for a \n        limitations period for implied private rights of action)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1469.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 129, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 111. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       Title I of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n     78a et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 38. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, an implied private right of action arising under this \n     title may be brought not later than the earlier of--\n       ``(1) 5 years after the date on which the alleged violation \n     occurred; or\n       ``(2) 2 years after the date on which the alleged violation \n     was discovered.\n       ``(b) Effective Date.--The limitations period provided by \n     this section shall apply to all proceedings commenced after \n     the date of enactment of this section.''.\n       On page 131, strike line 1, and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 39. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.''\n\n       Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, this is an amendment dealing with \nthe statute of limitations. Some of my colleagues will recall that in \n1991, the Supreme Court of the United States decided by a 5-to-4 vote a \ncase that is referred to as the Lampf decision. The Supreme Court in \nthat decision determined that there would be with respect to securities \nactions a statute of limitations that would limit an investor from \nbringing a cause of action to 1 year from the point that the fraud was \ndiscovered and in no event longer than 3 years.\n  The Supreme Court gave that a retrospective interpretation as well as \na prospective interpretation. A number of us came to the floor in 1991, \nbecause this would have wiped out a number of the cases in which \nCharles Keating had been named the defendant, and the Congress \ncorrected it. It changed the law--that it would be 2 to 5 years.\n  Now, this deals prospectively. Under the Lampf case, the 1- to 3-year \nstatute was identified as the appropriate statute of limitation. This \namendment would provide rather than a 1- to 3-year statute of \nlimitation, a 2- to 5-year statute of limitation.\n  I must say that S. 240 in its original form as introduced contained \nthe identical provision.\n  So, in effect, this amendment, if adopted, would restore S. 240 to \nits original form.\n  The importance of the statute of limitations, as the Securities and \nExchange Commission and other regulators point out, is that by the very \nnature of these securities frauds, they are not easily detected. The \nlast thing in the world we would want to do is to give comfort to those \nwho are clever enough to conceal their fraud to effectively preclude a \nplaintiff from bringing his or her cause of action.\n  There will be much more debate on this on Monday, but suffice it to \nsay what we are trying to do is to provide 2 years from the date of \ndiscovery, in no event longer than 5 years, recommended by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, recommended by the North American \nAssociation of Securities Administrators, and just one point for my \ncolleagues to contemplate.\n  In testimony before the Banking Committee, the Chairman of the SEC \nadvised us that even with the enormous resources available to the SEC, \nall of the staffing that they have, and the sophistication that they \nhave acquired over the past 60 years, it takes approximately 2.25 years \nto conduct such an investigation.\n  Obviously, individual plaintiffs have much less in the way of \nresources available, and their likelihood of completing an \ninvestigation in the timeframe is considerably more limited.\n  What we seek to do is provide a 2- to 5-year statute of limitations \nprospectively, and we will point out in the debate with more detail on \nMonday the overwhelming public policy argument in favor of this.\n  Suffice it to say this has nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits--\nnothing to do with frivolous lawsuits. There are provisions in the mark \nwhich deal with enhanced enforcement provisions under rule 11 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure to deal with the issue of frivolous \nlawsuits. This simply is a provision that will provide some fairness to \ninvestors to be able to present their claim in the first instance.\n  I thank my colleagues for permitting me to go forward at this time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to do so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to underscore the importance of \nthis amendment.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Nevada, did the Banking \nCommittee not report an amendment lengthening the statute of \nlimitations for securities fraud actions to 2 years after the plaintiff \nknew of the violation and to 5 years after the violation occurred, \nfollowing that Supreme Court decision?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Responding to the distinguished ranking member, that was, \nin fact, what the Banking Committee did, and on the floor of the \nSenate, the Senate followed the lead of the Banking Committee and \nultimately, as the Senator from Maryland will recall, we protected \nthose cases that were pending in the 1991 action we took.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the proposal, your amendment, in effect, is seeking \nto put into the law the very provision that we had previously reported.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is essentially correct. This operates prospectively. \nWhat we did, as the Senator from Maryland will recall, is to try to \nprotect all of those actions that were pending in 1991 which had been \nwiped out by the Supreme Court decision and we, in effect, provided at \nthat time that the operable State law would apply, which had been, in \neffect, the interpretation of the courts over the years.\n  In essence, we kept those cases active so that they could be decided \non their merits, not having been precluded by a decision, which \nsurprised many, that the Court gave and particularly the retroactive \nportion of that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, following the Supreme Court \ndecision in the Lampf case, the then-Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, Richard Breeden, a Republican nominee--because I \nthink it is very important to understand, as far as Chairman of the SEC \nis concerned, they are bipartisan in their view about this matter--\ntestified or stated, and I quote him:\n\n       The timeframe set forth in the Court's decision is \n     unrealistically short and will do undue damage to the ability \n     of private litigants to sue.\n\n  Chairman Breeden pointed out that in many cases:\n\n       . . . events only come to light years after the original \n     distribution of securities and the cases could well mean that \n     by the time investors discover they have a case, they are \n     already barred from the courthouse.\n\n  As I understand it, the States securities regulators and the FDIC at \nthe time joined the SEC in this position. As I understand it, the \nStates securities regulators today feel very strongly that the \namendment which the Senator is offering is an extremely important \namendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. This has had \nbipartisan support with the Commission. Chairman Breeden, as the \nSenator points out, strongly urged upon the committee a 2- to 5-year \nstatute of limitations. That same position has been taken by Chairman \nLevitt under the current administration.\n  The North American Association of Securities Administrators then and \nnow have urged this course of action. I simply point out to my friend \nand colleague that S. 240, in the last session of the Congress its \ncounterpart, had a 2- to 5-year statute of limitations, and in this \nCongress, the very bill we are debating in its original form, as \nintroduced by Senators Dodd, Domenici, and others, had a 2- to 5-year \nstatute of limitations.\n  So what this amendment would do is simply restore S. 240, with \nrespect to the statute of limitations, to its original form as \nintroduced by a number of colleagues.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is an extremely important \namendment. The 1- and 3-year time periods are unrealistically short, \nand the danger that is associated with an unrealistically short time \nperiod for the application of the statute of limitations is that people \nwith meritorious causes will be barred from the courthouse door.\n  We have statute of limitations because we say, ``Well, we do not want \nthis thing just hanging out there indefinitely, and people ought to \nassert their rights,'' and so forth and so on. But the time periods \nhave to be reasonable.\n  Under the amendment, there is a 5-year time period regardless, so \nthat the victim may never know of it. If 5 years goes by, he is closed \nout. The bill would reduce that to 3 years. People have to make their \njudgment, but why should you come down on the side of concealment \ninstead of on the other side in terms of protecting the investor?\n  The 1 and the 2 years is very important because you may discover, or \nthink you have discovered, the fraud, but then you have to work it up \nto determine whether you have a case or not, and 1 year is a very \nunrealistically short time period. In fact, I think the Senator \nyesterday quoted a time period that it took the SEC from when they \nbegan working on a case before they felt they could bring it. Was I \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct. I cited Chairman Breeden, I \nbelieve, who indicated it was 2.25 years for the average case to fully \ninvestigate. I might just say in response to the distinguished \nSenator's point about the inherent complexity, Chairman Levitt \ntestified earlier this year on April 6, and I will read a very short \nquote, in support of the proposition before us:\n\n       Extending the statute of limitations is warranted because \n     many securities frauds are inherently complex and the law \n     should not reward a perpetrator of fraud who successfully \n     conceals its existence for more than 3 years.\n\n  I think that is a compelling policy argument, I say to my good friend \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is an extremely important point. This does \nnot affect the basis on which you can bring the suit in any way. All \nthe other provisions are unaffected. This only affects the time period \nwithin which the suit must be brought.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleagues, this is a very rough bill on \ninnocent investors who have been victimized, as it were swindled, and I \ncertainly hope that at a minimum, the Senate would be willing to \nrestore an appropriate statute of limitations back to the time periods \nthat have prevailed, generally speaking, throughout most of our \nexperience with the securities laws. It has been related to the State \nlaws, and most of the State laws are 2 to 5 and some even longer than \nthat, if I am not mistaken.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct, and I think his observation is \nparticularly insightful. If you look at S. 240 in its original form, \nthere is only one provision that could reasonably, arguably be \nsupported in providing a consumer, investor, a victim of fraud, with an \nadditional benefit, and that is the statute of limitations provision. \nThat was in the original bill, as the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland knows. During the course of processing that legislation, for \nreasons which I do not understand, the provision was deleted.\n  But even those who are the most fervent advocates of the bill--I know \nour distinguished colleague, Senator Dodd, has spoken eloquently on \nbehalf of the statute of limitations--we may have differences with \nrespect to proportionate liability and some other issues. But I point \nout, in response to the Senator's question, that the introducers of the \nbill, Senator Dodd, Senator Domenici, and many others on both sides of \nthe aisle, felt that it was inherently fair for the reasons which the \nSenator from Maryland so aptly pointed out, and that the statute of \nlimitations needs to be extended to 2 to 5 years so those who \nperpetrate fraud do not benefit by the cleverness of their ability to \nconceal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, S. 240, the private securities litigation \nlegislation addresses a very important issue of concern to many \nAmericans, securities litigation reform. While this is a subject that I \nbelieve needs to be addressed and one I have some personal views and \nexperience in, I will not be participating in the debate or votes on \nthe floor.\n  I inform the Senate that I am currently engaged in securities \nlitigation of the kind this legislation seeks to reform. As a result, I \nhave decided to recuse myself from the debate. Given the status of my \ncurrent suit and the issues before the Senate, I have been advised that \nI should not participate in the proceedings or voting on the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the high cost of litigation imposes an \nenormous burden on our economy. According to some estimates, legal \njudgments account for 2.3 percent of our gross national product. \nPlaintiffs' lawyers earn\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\nnearly $20 billion annually in legal fees, often as a result of \ncontingency-fee arrangements guaranteeing a 30 or 40 percent share of \nany jury award.\n  These are the big-picture statistics. But, as we all know, the fear \nof litigation can hit much closer to home:\n  Playgrounds and little leagues shut down because local communities \ncan't afford the insurance. Boy Scout troops disband because there \naren't any adults around who are willing to be troop leaders. Doctors \npractice defensive medicine, increasing the cost of health care in the \nprocess. Volunteers stay home instead of offering their services to the \ncommunity. Police officers start second-guessing their own actions, \nwondering whether they're going to be hauled into court for some minor \nmisstep.\n  Even worse, people start to lose faith in the system. They begin to \nview the system not with respect, but as an opportunity to make a quick \nbuck. Everyone becomes a potential victim. Every social transaction, no \nmatter how minor or benign, becomes a potential lawsuit leading to a \nmultimillion-dollar jackpot.\n  That is why comprehensive legal reform is so important--not only to \nreduce costs for businesses and consumers alike, not only to protect \nthe innocent from frivolous lawsuits, but also to restore a sense of \nperspective and personal responsibility.\n  So, earlier this year, the Senate took the historic step of passing \nlandmark product liability reform legislation.\n  And, today, we continue the reform process in another key area--the \narea of securities litigation.\n  Why securities litigation? Because our securities markets provide the \nfuel that drives our economy. When these markets run efficiently, \nallocating capital to established companies and to newer, emerging \nbusinesses, we all win out with more economic growth, more jobs, a \nstronger economy.\n  Of course, those who seek to invest in our securities markets need to \nbe confident that these markets operate efficiently and fairly. And \nthat is why Congress acted more than 60 years ago to promote investor \nconfidence by passing the Landmark Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.\n  Unfortunately, a handful of lawyers today devote their professional \nlives to gaming the system by filing strike suits alleging violations \nof the Federal securities laws--all in the hope that the defendant will \nquickly settle in order to avoid the expense of prolonged litigation. \nThe lawyers who file these suits often rely on professional plaintiffs, \nshareholders with only small stake in the company being sued, but who \nare nonetheless willing to stand on the sidelines ready to lend their \nnames to the litigation.\n  Needless to say, these strike suits are often baseless, triggered not \nby any evidence of fraud, but by a drop in stock price or the \nannouncement of some bad news by the company. In effect, the lawsuits \nact as a litigation tax that raises the cost of capital and chills \ndisclosure of important corporate information to shareholders. High-\ntechnology, high-growth companies are particularly vulnerable to these \nbaseless strike suits because of the volatility of their stock prices.\n  S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, seeks \nto reduce the number of meritless securities fraud cases, while \nprotecting investors, by proposing several commonsense reforms:\n  First, it puts an end to the use of professional plaintiffs by \nrequiring that the court appoint as the lead plaintiff the party \nwilling to serve in this capacity who has the greatest financial stake \nin the outcome of the litigation.\n  Second, it clamps down on skyrocketing attorney's fees by requiring \nthat fees be awarded as a percentage of the actual recovery based on \nthe efforts of the attorney.\n  Third, it retains joint and several liability for those who knowingly \ncommit fraud, but establishes a system of proportionate liability for \nother, less culpable defendants.\n  Fourth, it adopts the second circuit's pleading standard, which \nrequires specificity when pleading securities fraud cases. As a result, \ngeneral allegations of fraud will no longer be enough to justify a \nlawsuit.\n  And fifth, it creates a statutory safe harbor for those companies \nwhose good-faith estimates about future earnings do not materialize. \nStatements that are knowingly false, however, are not protected by the \nsafe harbor.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, and the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for their leadership in moving this bill \nthrough Senate. I also want to commend my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, whose involvement in this issue is proof that there is \nnothing partisan about securities litigation reform.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who \nare supportive of this legislation and to also take the opportunity to \ncommend the sponsors of S. 240, Senator Domenici and Senator Dodd. It \nis through their hard work and effort that we now have a balanced bill \nthat protects both investors, and defendants of securities litigation.\n  It almost seems as if the class--action securities fraud suit has \nbecome a feature of doing business for just about every size and type \nof company in the United States. In 1990 and 1991, a record 614 \nsecurities class action suits were filed in Federal courts against \nAmerican businesses. In an article printed in the Wall Street Journal \non September 10, 1991, Mr. Vincent O'Brien reported that he collected \ndata on more than 330 Federal class-action securities-fraud cases \ninvolving common stock. In every case, the plaintiffs alleged material \nmisrepresentations and omissions by management regarding the true \nhealth and potential of the defendant company. Of the 330 case sample, \nonly 3 cases were decided by a jury; an additional 5 were dismissed or \nwithdrawn, and an astonishing 96 percent were settled out of court.\n  Proponents of securities class actions say that the suits prevent \nfraud and help maintain the integrity of financial markets. It is \ncertainly true that one aspect of a fair marketplace is that those \npersons who have been injured by fraud in connection with a securities \ntransaction, have some avenue available to retrieve their losses.\n  While the current system does provide for a means to address fraud, \nthe evidence is overwhelming that the real victims of securities fraud \nare not receiving adequate compensation for their losses. In fact, the \nplaintiffs in a lawsuit, those who were actually damaged, obtain only \nabout 60 percent of the settlement while attorneys' fees and litigation \nexpenses eat up the rest. Moreover, because plaintiffs' attorneys only \npursue cases involving large offerings, the lion's share of the stock \nat issue tends to be held by institutional investors. Small investors \noften account for only an insignificant percentage of the shares at \nissue.\n  Many of these lawsuits, whether they are with or without merit, \ngenerally come to the same end. Settlement amounts depend entirely on \nthe amount of damages claimed or the defendants' insurance coverage. \nThe sad part is, that between 5 and 15 cents on each dollar sought is \nactually returned to the plaintiffs while the lawyers average $1 \nmillion in fees for each case.\n  Mr. President, it has become far too easy and profitable to file \nsecurities suits. Computer tracking of stock prices has led to nearly \ninstantaneous suits filed by class action plaintiffs' attorneys. The \nincentive to the lawyers for being first is simple: Usually the judge \nwho ultimately presides over the case will name the lawyers who got \ntheir cases filed first to be lead counsel. On what basis do they file? \nIf a company's earnings are less than projected, a suit is filed \nclaiming shareholders were not told of the dangers. If earnings shoot \nthrough the roof, they can be sued for withholding good information \nthat would have prevented impatient stockholders from selling their \nstock. Such suits, or threats of suits, have a serious consequence of \ndeterring valuable risk-taking and cause qualified persons to be \nunwilling to serve as directors because of the risks of liability. \nAmerican business and the American consumers are the big losers.\n  Mr. President, once a suit is filed, defendants face enormous \nincentives to settle. Those who choose to fight the allegations face \nlarge legal fees even if they ultimately prevail. For some defendants, \nthe stakes are even higher because the law currently does not \ndistinguish differing degrees of fault and you could very well be \nliable for losses\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nattributed to other parties. Even though claims might be completely \nmeritless, firms feel coerced to settle rather than assume the open-\nended risk.\n  The legislation we have before us today will go a long way toward \ncurbing abuses in securities litigation. It will provide a filter at \nthe earliest stage of a lawsuit to screen out those that have no \nfactual basis. A complaint should outline the facts supporting the \nlawsuit and not just a simple assertion that the defendant acted with \nintent to defraud. If the complaint does not set forth the facts \nsupporting each of the alleged misstatements or omissions, the law suit \nmay be terminated.\n  In order for the judge to be able to determine whether the case has \nany merit prior to subjecting the defendants to the time and expense of \nturning over the company's records, a stay of discovery is included in \nthis bill. A typical tactic of plaintiff lawyers is to request an \nextensive list of documents and to schedule an ambitious agenda of \ndepositions that take up the time and resources of a company. The \ndiscovery costs comprise 80 percent of the expense of defending a \nsecurities class action lawsuit. The stay of discovery provision will \nprovide the defendants with the opportunity to have a motion for a \ndismissal considered prior to entering into the costly discovery \nprocess.\n\n  Securities laws are intended to help investors by ensuring a flow of \naccurate information about public companies. However, the present \nsystem reduces the amount of information as companies limit their \npublic statements to avoid allegations of fraud. In fact, an American \nStock Exchange survey found that 75 percent of corporate CEO's limit \nthe information disclosed to investors out of fear that greater \ndisclosure would lead to an abusive lawsuit. To encourage disclosure of \ninformation, the bill will create a statutory safe harbor.\n  To deter plaintiffs' attorneys from filing meritless securities class \nactions, judges will have the authority to review the conduct of \nattorneys and discipline those who file frivolous suits. Suits filed \nwith little or no research into their merits can cost companies \nthousands of dollars in legal fees and company time. According to a \nsample of cases provided by the National Association of Securities and \nCommercial Law Attorneys [NASCAT] 21 percent of the class action cases \nwere filed within 48 hours of a triggering event such as the \nannouncement of a missed earnings projection. Innocent companies pay \nmillions of dollars defending these frivolous cases and are left with \nlarge attorney bills even when they win. If a judge finds that an \nattorney filed a frivolous suit, he can award sanctions as appropriate.\n  This bill ensures that those primarily responsible for the \nplaintiff's loss bear the primary burden in making the plaintiff whole. \nUnder current law, codefendants each have liability for 100 percent of \nthe damages irrespective of their role in a fraudulent scheme. In this \nbill, the courts would determine who has committed knowing securities \nfraud, and hold them fully responsible for all damages. Any other \ndefendants named in the suit would be held proportionately liable.\n  As we all know, there are instances when a defendant is insolvent and \nis unable to pay their share of damages. This bill contains provisions \nto ensure that investors are compensated in cases where there is an \ninsolvent codefendant. When plaintiffs are unable to collect a portion \nof their damages from an insolvent codefendant, the proportionally \nliable codefendants would be required to pay up to 150 percent of their \nshare of damages.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk that this legislation \nwould adversely impact small investors. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth because this bill actually provides special protection for \nthem. All defendants, whether they are jointly and severally liable or \nproportionately liable, would be held fully responsible for the \nuncollectible shares of plaintiffs whose damages are more than 10 \npercent of their net worth, if their net worth is less than $200,000. \nProviding special protection for small investors is a critical \ncomponent of this bill and one I support strongly.\n  Mr. President, there has been an effort by the critics of this bill \nto misrepresent the facts. Several opponents have claimed that if the \nbill had been law during the savings and loan crisis, investors \ndefrauded by Charles Keating would have been left without remedy. \nHowever, they fail to tell you that most of the losses from the S \ncrisis did not result from securities fraud and this bill would not \napply. The primary enforcement mechanism in dealing with the S crisis \nwas the bank regulatory system, not the Federal securities law.\n  Finally, oppoinents allege that S. 240 would make it impossible for \nmunicpalities to recoup losses from securities fraud involving \nderivatives. However, the Domenici-Dodd bill preserves investors' \nrights to sue. Just as under current law, defrauded investors who \npurchased or sold derivatives would still be able to sue defendants who \nhad actual knowledge of the fraud or who acted recklessly.\n  In concluding, Mr. President, legislative reform is needed to return \nrationality to the system so that meritorious claims are compensated \nand meritless claims are neither rewarded nor encouraged. Business \ndesperately needs relief from both the financial and management burdens \nattending these abusive suits. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and I once again want to commend Senator Domenici and \nSenator Dodd for their tremendous work on this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S8966-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8979-S8989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE BUDGET RESOLUTION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nwhat has happened with regard to the concurrent budget resolution. The \nRepublican leadership have unveiled their final conference budget \nproposal. I just have to say that I am appalled at the fiscal \nirresponsibility that it represents.\n  I, for one, disagree with some other Democrats in that I am glad the \nPresident came in with a budget that had a date certain for balancing \nthe budget. I am glad that the Republicans are working on a date \ncertain to balance the budget. I happen to think both of them wait too \nlong. I think it can be done before the year 2000, if you really put \neverything on the table.\n  I recognize that the President himself has proposed a tax cut--\ncertainly, a much more modest tax cut than the various Republican \nproposals. I happen to disagree with any tax cut at this time if we are \ngoing to balance the budget as fast as we can, Mr. President. But this \nagreement last night really takes the cake. It includes a massive, $245 \nbillion tax cut--not the $50 or $60 billion the President was talking \nabout, or $90 billion that some said the process would end up with, but \nreally an unbelievably high figure, at a time when this country has a \n$5 trillion debt. A $245 billion tax cut over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, such a tax cut at this time is so fiscally \nirresponsible as to be downright reckless. To me, Mr. President, this \nis not just a budget compromise, it is a compromising of the economic \nhealth of the American people. It could not come at a worse time. It \ncould not be more irresponsible. This is a deal cut in the back room by \nmembers of one party, which sacrifices the whole principle of fiscal \ndiscipline for very shallow political ends, Mr. President. I am afraid \nthe Senate budget conferees have totally caved in to political \ngamesmanship, Presidential politics, and the Contract With America.\n  I was watching TV this morning. On the Today Show, I saw the \nSpeaker's comment when the reporters asked him what this deal was all \nabout. With a wink, the Speaker said, ``You are going to have more \ntake-home pay. You will like it.'' He knows what he is doing. He is \ntrying to tell the American people they can have their cake and eat it, \ntoo. They can have a $245 billion tax cut and a balanced budget by \n2002.\n  But the American people know better. They know that cannot be done. \nIn fact, I would almost understand it if this deal was based on a \npolitical understanding of what the people in America really want. But \nI cannot find anywhere in the State of Wisconsin, which I represent, \npeople clamoring for a tax cut. I have been watching this\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\ncarefully every day since last November. The people of my State, \nwhether Republicans or Democrats, millionaires or working-class people, \nare not clamoring for tax cuts. They know you cannot have a $245 \nbillion tax cut and balance the budget by 2002 or 2005, or any time in \nthe foreseeable future.\n  So I find this hard to understand. It does not seem to fit politics. \nIt certainly does not fit policy, and certainly does not fit in with \nour economic needs and the goal of eliminating the deficit. I remember \na few months ago that the chair of the other body's Budget Committee \nwent to a town meeting in his district, and he got confirmation that \nthe American people in his district want a balanced budget. He said, \n``You folks want a tax cut, too, do you not?'' Guess what, the crowd \noverwhelmingly told the budget chair in the other body they did not \nwant a tax cut because we need to balance the budget now. Well, the \nchair of that committee completely ignored the wishes of the people at \nhis town meeting, and he went ahead and joined in this deal to take \n$245 billion that could be used for deficit reduction and give it \nparticularly to those who are the wealthiest among us.\n  Mr. President, the proposed tax cut jeopardizes not only an \nopportunity to eliminate the Federal deficit and balance our books, it \nrisks our Nation's economy. Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve may \nbe considering lowering interest rates because of the possibility now \nof some sort of recession. But a fiscally irresponsible tax cut of $245 \nbillion could put any plans to lower interest rates on hold, and might \neven lead to an interest rate increase.\n  To accommodate this unnecessary tax cut and to accommodate an \nunjustified increase of $58 billion, to an already bloated defense \nbudget, this document that was cooked up in the last few days adds to \ndefense and forces draconian cuts in the most important programs in the \nbudget. There are stark parallels between the level of the tax cuts, \nalso, and the proposed cuts to Medicare, Mr. President. The tax cut \nfigure from last night is $245 billion. The Medicare cuts that the \nRepublicans say we have to have is $270 billion. It is not hard to \nconclude, Mr. President, a very simple proposition: Medicare cuts are \nbeing made to fund tax cuts, especially for upper income people.\n  I happen to be one who has said on this floor repeatedly that some \ncuts in Medicare can be made. Certainly, we can make some cuts in \nadministrative aspects, in some formula-driven overpayments, and other \nareas. But what this tax cut means is that the very harsh Medicare cuts \nincluded in the budget agreement have to happen. They could be reduced \nsignificantly, cut in half, or almost completely eliminated, if we did \nnot have this $245 billion tax cut. The same goes for the Medicaid \ncuts. There has been a lot of talk about Medicare, but what about the \nimpact on the poor because of these $180 billion in Medicaid cuts? You \ncould completely wipe out that cut and still have $65 billion left over \nif you did not do this irresponsible tax cut.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has prepared a list here of what the \npriorities really are represented by the decision to do tax cuts \ninstead of having an earlier balanced budget while taking care of \npeople. The priorities for the Republican agenda here with this big tax \nare slashing Medicare, slashing education, reducing college \nopportunities that are already very thin, and lowering wages for \nworking families.\n\n  Mr. President, we do not even have to have most of the Medicare cuts. \nWe do not have to have the Medicaid cuts. We do not have to have the \ncuts in student loans, if we use a little willpower and resist the \ntemptation to hand out goodies to people in the form of tax cuts they \ndo not want anyway.\n  Mr. President, this budget imposes devastating cuts to essential \nprograms in order to fund increases to the defense industry. In fact, \nthe way I like to talk about it, there are at least three sacred cows \nprotected by this budget resolution: The first one is the tax cut; a \n$245 billion sacred cow that could help solve our problems and should \nbe taken care of and eliminated.\n  Second, corporate tax loopholes, growing at a rate of 24 percent, \nsecond only to entitlements at 27 percent, are not touched. They are \ncompletely protected by this budget resolution.\n  Finally, almost unbelievable to my constituents, the third sacred \ncow--the Defense Department budget, which not only is not cut, it is \nactually increased. Everybody in this game at this point says, ``Gee, \nwe have to increase the defense budget at a time when we are trying to \nbalance the Federal budget.''\n  More important than Medicaid, education, and college is protecting \ntax loopholes, protecting tax cuts, and giving up more money to the \nDefense Department.\n  Mr. President, possibly an even greater tragedy of this budget \nagreement is that it missed an opportunity. This compromise missed \nmaybe the opportunity to set forth the plan to balance the budget that \nwould have had bipartisan support in Congress, and more importantly, \nbroad-based support from the American people.\n  I suppose there is a tiny hope that this budget agreement still could \nbe prevented. I do not hold much hope for it, but there is a chance, \nnevertheless, if we defeat this irresponsible budget agreement, we \ncould go back to the drawing board.\n  I know we could fashion a budget plan that would have the support of \nthe majority of this body, and in this case the Members on both sides \nof the aisle. It would be a plan that could achieve a balanced budget \nnot only by the year 2002 or 2000, but even earlier; a plan that would \nhave a very good chance of enacting all the ensuing appropriations and \nreconciliation bills into law. Most importantly, Mr. President, it \nwould be a plan that would have the support of the American people.\n  I know the votes are there. In their hearts, I think many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle know it, too. If the leadership \nwould allow Senators to do it, I bet we could have a plan drawn up and \npassed within a week.\n  Of course, that is almost certainly not going to happen. The \nleadership will not permit Members to vote their conscience. There are \nmany Members in this body on the other side of the aisle who know and \nhave said to me that tax cuts do not make sense at this time.\n  Whatever happened to the charade in the Senate during the budget \nresolution debate? We heard Members on the other side say there is no \ntax cut in the budget resolution; what are you talking about? Some \nMembers tried to point out there was a $170 billion item that said if \ncertain things happened, we would have $170 billion available that \ncould be used for a tax cut.\n  On the television and on the Senate floor the fraud was perpetrated \nthat that $170 billion was not specifically devoted to tax cuts. Some \nof the Members on the other side were more straightforward, including \nthe Chair. He did not mess around. He put out an amendment that said if \nthere is $170 billion, it shall be used for a tax cut. That at least \nwas honest. He was not pretending. The Chair does believe in the tax \ncut and was straightforward about it.\n  He had a good day yesterday. Not only did that $170 billion get \nlocked in, he got it up to $245 billion with the help of the Members of \nthe other body. This whole charade that was played out in the national \nmedia that the Senate Republicans were trying to fight the tax cut has \nbeen permanently put to rest.\n  Both the other House and this body are led by folks who intend to \ndeliver a tax cut, at the same time they are trying to tell the \nAmerican people their top priority is balancing the Federal budget.\n  Extreme elements have made it clear what happens to Members when they \nvote their conscience. Presidential politics has further taken a budget \nthat is already thoroughly contaminated. But, there is still the \ntiniest hope.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to consider that avenue. I \nworked on deficit reduction packages with Members of both parties, and \nthe spirit and willingness to work together for a fair package is \nthere. The group led by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] and the \nSenator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] is one example of a bipartisan \ndeficit reduction effort in which I had the chance to participate.\n  And I am proud to be working with my good friend from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, on a number of budget reforms. I know there are Members on both \nsides of the aisle who want to work together. I know there are Members \non the Republican side who are\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\nsimply embarrassed to put forward an irresponsible tax cut at this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I urge them to look at this again, to consider \nrejecting this agreement and forcing the body to consider, instead, a \nresponsible budget.\n  Mr. President, we need to pull back from this tax cut. We need to \nmake a budget that is tough, that makes justifiable cuts to all areas \nof Government. Mr. President, we need a budget that gets rid of this \nunwarranted tax cut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend my friend \nand colleague from Wisconsin for his excellent presentation. He has \nspoken with great eloquence about the role that we will be faced with \nhere in the U.S. Senate in these next several days.\n  Most importantly, he has pointed out responsible alternatives that \ncan help this Nation deal with its fiscal challenges. I think all \nMembers would be wise to heed the clarity of his thinking and the power \nof his persuasion.\n  I thank him very much for an excellent presentation. I certainly hope \nour colleagues will pay attention to it. I\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from Wisconsin has pointed out, and \nwhat is increasingly apparent to the Members of this body and I think \nto the American people, is that there is an ongoing process that is \ntaking place in both the House of Representatives and Senate as to what \nis going to be the investment policy of the United States; how we are \nreflecting our priorities of what we are going to invest in or cut back \nin; what groups are going to benefit from these decisions and \njudgments, and who is going to pay a price for it.\n  That process has been going on for a number of weeks. Now, with the \nannouncement that was made last evening, the focus has become sharper \nas to the direction that the Congress will follow.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget deal announced yesterday is one \nmore salvo in the Republicans' continuing war on working American \nfamilies. In fact, it's another attack on senior citizens, children, \nfamilies, and veterans.\n  It pretends to protect Social Security, while making harsh cuts in \nMedicare. But the distinction is a false one, because Medicare is part \nof Social Security. Like Social Security, Medicare is a compact between \nthe government and the people that says ``Pay into the trust fund \nduring your working years, and we will guarantee good health care in \nyour retirement years.''\n  Any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a \nserious chronic illness knows full well there is no security without \nMedicare; the cost of illness is too high. A week in an intensive care \nunit can cost more than the total yearly income of most senior \ncitizens.\n  In fact, the Republican attack on Social Security is even more \ndirect. The Medicare part B premium is deducted directly from Social \nSecurity checks.\n  In particular, it is the low and moderate-income elderly who will \nsuffer most from Medicare cuts. Eighty-three percent of all Medicare \nspending is for older Americans with annual incomes below $25,000; two-\nthirds is for those with incomes below $15,000.\n  The conference agreement maintains the misplaced priorities of the \nbills passed separately by each House.\n  The Medicare cuts are so deep as to break America's contract with the \nelderly--even worse than the draconian cuts passed by the Senate.\n  Over the life of the resolution, the average senior will have to pay \nan additional $3,200. Elderly couples will have to pay $6,400. Seniors \nwith the highest health costs will pay even more.\n  The authors of the resolution do not seem to understand that the \nelderly cannot afford these cuts. The average senior only has an income \nof $17,750 a year. Seniors already pay 21 percent of their income for \nhealth care--a greater amount than they paid before Medicare was even \nenacted. Eighty-three per cent of Medicare spending is for seniors with \nincomes of less than $25,000. Two-thirds is for seniors with incomes of \nless than $15,000.\n  These cuts are so deep that they will devastate not only seniors but \nour health care system as a whole. Rural hospitals, public hospitals, \nand academic health centers will be particularly hard hit. The leaders \nof academic medicine concluded that these cuts will mean that ``Every \nAmerican's quality of life will suffer.''\n  Cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid will shift costs to every working \nfamily in the form of higher health care charges and higher insurance \npremiums.\n  Medicare is part of Social Security. Seniors have worked hard all \ntheir lives. They have earned their Medicare. They deserve it. It is \nwrong to break the promise of Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the \nwealthy. It is a false economy to shift costs from the Federal budget \nto the family budgets of senior citizens and working families.\n  The Medicaid cuts are equally wrong. Five to seven million children \nwill lose their coverage. One million seniors will lose coverage. \nStates will face huge new fiscal burdens.\n  This proposal is wrong for seniors. It is wrong for working families. \nIt is wrong for children. And it is wrong for America.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Because of gaps \nin Medicare, senior citizens already pay too much for the health care \nthey need. Average elderly Americans pay an astounding one-fifth of \ntheir income to purchase health care--more than they paid before \nMedicare was enacted 30 years ago. And the reason we enacted Medicare \nwas because the elderly faced a health care crisis then.\n  Lower income, older seniors pay more than a fifth of their income for \nhealth care. Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. And its \ncoverage of home health care and nursing home care is limited.\n  Unlike private insurance policies, Medicare does not have a cap on \nout-of-pocket costs. It does not cover eye care or foot care or dental \ncare. Yet this budget plan piles additional medical costs on every \nsenior citizen--while the Republican tax bill that has already passed \nthe House gives a lavish tax break to the rich.\n  It is interesting to compare the generous benefits that the authors \nof this resolution enjoy under the FEHBP plan available to every member \nof Congress to the much less comprehensive benefits provided by \nMedicare. Medicare has no coverage at all for outpatient prescription \ndrugs, although they are fully covered under Blue Cross-Blue Shield \nStandard, the most popular FEHBP plan. The combined deductible for \ndoctor and hospital services under Blue Cross/Blue Shield is $350. For \nMedicare, the combined deductible is $816. Blue Cross/Blue Shield \ncovers unlimited hospital days with no copayments. Under Medicare, \nseniors face a $179 per day copayment after 60 days and $358 after 90 \ndays. After 150 days, Medicare pays nothing at all.\n  Medicare covers a few preventive services, but it does not cover \nscreenings for heart disease, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer--\nall covered by FEHBP benefits. Dental services are covered for Members \nof Congress--but not for senior citizens. Members of Congress are \nprotected against skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs by a cap on their \ntotal liability, but there is no cap on how much a senior citizen has \nto pay for Medicare copayments or deductibles.\n  Members of Congress earn $133,600 a year. The average senior's income \nis $17,750. For the limited Medicare benefits they receive, seniors pay \n$46 a month, but for their comprehensive insurance coverage Members of \nCongress will pay a grand total of $44 a month. Senior citizens pay $2 \nmore out of incomes only about one-eighth as large.\n  Republicans do not seem to understand that the average senior citizen \nhas an income of only $17,750 a year. The Republican budget will force \nmillions of elderly Americans to go without the health care they need. \nMillions more will have to choose between food on the table, heat in \nthe winter, paying the rent, and paying for medical care. Any plan that \ndoes that is cruel and unjust.\n\n  Senior citizens have earned their Medicare. They have paid for them, \nand they deserve them. Yet our Republican friends would deny them these \nmuch deserved benefits.\n  How do they explain this to senior citizens? This is a budget that \nMarie Antoinette would love--``let them eat cake.'' And it is Medicare \nthat is being sent to the guillotine.\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n  The Medicare cuts in this resolution harm more than senior citizens. \nThese proposals will also strike a severe blow to the quality of \nAmerican medicine--damaging hospitals and other health care \ninstitutions that depend heavily on Medicare.\n  These institutions provide essential health care for Americans of all \nages, not just senior citizens. Progress in medical research and \ntraining of health professionals depends on the financial stability of \nthese institutions academic health centers, public hospitals, and rural \nhospitals will bear an especially heavy burden. As representatives of \nthe academic health centers that guarantee our world-renowned \nexcellence in health care said of the Republican budget, ``Every \nAmerican's quality of life will suffer as a result.''\n  In addition, these massive costs will inevitably impose a hidden tax \non workers and businesses. They will face increased costs and higher \ninsurance premiums, as physicians and hospitals shift even more costs \nto the nonelderly. Accordingly to recent statistics, Medicare now pays \nonly 68 percent of what the private sector pays for comparable \nphysicians' services; for hospitals care, the figure is 69 percent. The \nproposed Republican cuts will widen this already ominous gap.\n  Republicans have argued that the deep cuts are needed to save \nMedicare from bankruptcy. The hypocrisy of this claim is astonishing. \nJust a few weeks ago--before they began to feel the political heat on \nMedicare cuts--the Republicans passed a tax bill in the House that took \nalmost $90 billion in revenues of the Medicare hospital insurance trust \nfund over the next 10 years--and brought it that much closer to \ninsolvency. We did not hear a word then about the impending bankruptcy \nof Medicare.\n  We also did not hear about it when last year's Medicare trustee's \nreport was issued. Republicans were too busy last year blocking health \nreform and pretending there was no health care crisis at all.\n  This year's trustees report actually shows the Medicare trust fund to \nbe in a stronger financial position than last year. The new-found \nRepublican concern for the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is a \nsham--a convenient pretext to rob Medicare to pay for tax breaks for \nthe rich. Medicare is nowhere near as bankrupt as Republican \npriorities.\n  It is true that the April 3 report of the Medicare trustees projects \nthat the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will run out of money \nby 2002. But few if any Republicans would be talking about Medicare \ncuts of this magnitude, absent the need to finance their tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. As the Medicare trustees themselves noted in their report, \nmodest adjustments can keep Medicare solvent for an additional decade--\nplenty of time to find fair solutions for the longer term.\n  Similar projections of Medicare insolvency have been made numerous \ntimes in the past, but adjustments enacted by Congress were able to \ndeal with the problem without jeopardizing beneficiaries. Now is no \ndifferent. For example, an estimated 20 percent of all Medicare \nhospitalizations could be avoided with better preventive services and \nmore timely primary and outpatient care. As much as 10 percent of all \nMedicare expenditures may be due to fraud, and could be reduced or \neliminated by better oversight.\n  Some Republicans have accused Democrats of attempting to scare \nAmerica's senior citizens. Senior citizens do have reason to fear what \nthis budget resolution will do to their Medicare benefits. But the real \nfearmongers are those who attempt to cloak their misguided budget in \ndemagoguery about the bankruptcy of Medicare.\n  We do not have to destroy Medicare in order to save it.\n  Another false Republican argument in defense of Medicare cuts is that \nthey are not really a cut, because the total amount of Medicare \nspending will continue to grow. The fact is that the Republican plan \ncalls for spending far less on Medicare than the Congressional Budget \nOffice says is necessary to maintain the current level of services to \nthe elderly.\n  Every household in America knows that if the cost of your rent, the \ncost of your utilities, and the cost of your food go up--and your \nincome stays the same--you have taken a real cut in your living \nstandard.\n  Only in Washington could someone say with a straight face that making \nsenior citizens pay hundreds of dollars a year more for their medical \nneeds is not a cut in their benefits. Every senior citizen understands \nthat.\n  Republicans speak of a cut in defense, even though defense spending \nhas stayed stable. Apparently, the same Republican logic does not apply \nto senior citizens that applies to defense. Well, I say to them--a cut \nis a cut is a cut--whether it is in Medicare or Social Security or \nnational defense.\n  The third specious Republican argument is that Medicare costs can be \ncut by encouraging senior citizens to join managed care. True, such \ncare may help bring Medicare costs under control--in the long run. \nEnrollment by senior citizens in managed care is already increasing \nrapidly. It is up 75 percent since 1990. But no serious analyst \nbelieves that increased enrollment in managed care will substantially \nreduce Medicare expenditures in the timeframe of the proposed \nRepublican cuts.\n\n  In fact, according to the General Accounting Office, Medicare now \nactually loses money on managed care, because the healthiest senior \ncitizens tend to enroll in managed care and the payment formula is too \ngenerous. This kind of problem can easily be worked out, and will help \nto restore the fiscal stability of the program. But the only way to \nsave serious money in the short term on managed care is to penalize \nthose who refuse to join. This harsh option has already been suggested \nby the Republican health task force in the House of Representatives.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues--it is wrong to force senior \ncitizens to give up their freedom to choose their own doctors and \nhospitals. It is wrong to penalize them financially if they refuse to \nenroll in managed care.\n  The American people will never accept a policy that tells senior \ncitizens they have a right to go to the hospital and doctor of their \nchoice, or that puts unfair financial pressure on senior citizens to \ngive up that right.\n  A further Republican argument is that deep cuts in Medicare are \nnecessary to balance the budget. That argument refutes itself. It is \nnothing of the kind. All it proves is that Republican priorities are \nwrong. There is a right way to balance the budget, and a far-right way. \nAnd unfortunately, the Republicans have picked the latter.\n  It is true that we need to bring health care spending under control. \nBut that applies to all health spending, not just Medicare. As \nPresident Clinton told the White House Conference on Aging last month, \n40 percent of the projected increase in Federal spending in coming \nyears will be caused by escalating health costs.\n  But what this Republican budget fails to recognize is that the \ncurrent growth in Medicare spending is a symptom of the underlying \nproblems in the entire health care system--not a defect in Medicare \nalone.\n  In fact, Medicare has done a better job than the private sector in \nrestraining costs in recent years. Since 1984, Medicare costs have \nrisen at an annual rate that is 24 percent lower than comparable \nprivate sector health spending. As a result, Medicare now pays only 68 \npercent of what the private sector charges for comparable physicians' \nservices; for hospital care, the figure is 69 percent.\n  Slashing Medicare unilaterally is no way to balance the budget. It \nwill simply shift costs from the budget of the Federal Government to \nthe budgets of senior citizens, their children, and their \ngrandchildren. That's not a real saving.\n  Moreover, senior citizens will also face greater discrimination from \nphysicians and hospitals less willing to accept them as patients, \nbecause Medicare reimbursements are already much lower than the \nreimbursements available under private insurance. Previous cuts in \nMedicare have already led to serious cost shifting, as a physicians and \nhospitals seek to make up their reduced income from Medicare patients \nby charging higher fees to other patients. The result has been higher \nhealth costs and health insurance premiums for everyone, as cost \nshifting becomes a significant hidden tax on individuals and \nbusinesses.\n  The right way to slow rising Medicare costs is in the context of \nbroader\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\nhealth reforms that will slow health cost inflation in the system as a \nwhole. That is the way to bring Federal health costs under control, \nwithout cutting benefits or shifting costs to working families. In the \ncontext of broader reform, the needs of academic health centers, rural \nhospitals, and inner city hospitals can also be met. Unilateral \nMedicare cuts alone, by contrast, will reduce the availability and \nquality of care for young and old alike.\n  The cuts in Medicaid proposed in the Republican budget are equally \nunfair--a total of $175 billion over 7 years. The double whammy of huge \nMedicare cuts and huge Medicaid cuts will hit hospitals and other \nhealth care providers even harder than Medicare cuts alone. Struggling \nState governments and State and local taxpayers will also face heavy \nburdens. Massachusetts would lose billions of dollars in Federal \nmatching funds over the next 7 years. By the year 2002, we would need \nto increase State spending by 26 percent to maintain current program \nlevels. Other States with higher Federal matching rates would be hit \neven harder.\n  States cannot afford these huge increases. And the impact of these \narbitrary cuts on working American families is even more disturbing. \nMedicaid is a key part of the safety net for senior citizens, the \ndisabled, and children. Two-thirds of all Medicaid spending is for \nsenior citizens and the disabled. If an elderly American becomes sick \nenough to need long-term nursing home care, Medicaid is the only source \nof funding after personal savings are exhausted. Cuts in Medicaid will \nmean that needed care for senior citizens is denied. Heavy additional \nburdens will be imposed on their children and grandchildren.\n  At a hearing in the last Congress by the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee in Quincy, MA, one of the witnesses was a retired veteran \nnamed Clifford Towne, who lived with his wife Marie in South Dartmouth.\n  Clifford Towne is a veteran who fought in World War II. He worked \nhard all his life in the textile business. When he retired, he had over \n$100,000 in the bank. He owned his own home, and he had a good pension \nfrom Social Security. But both he and his wife developed serious \nmedical problems. High medical costs that Medicare did not cover well \nenough--especially prescription drugs--had wiped out his savings. He \nhad to run up large debts. As he told our committee, he tried to \nqualify for Medicaid, but his Social Security income was too high. \n``They told me,'' he said, ``that the only way I could get help for my \nwife was to leave her. But after 48 years, I just couldn't do that. I'd \nrather kick the bucket than be forced to get a divorce. So my wife and \nI talked it over and decided that when we couldn't pay for the drugs \nany more, we just would have to stop taking the prescription drugs. \nWe'd rather pass away together--or at least as close together as we \ncan. About 3 or 4 months ago, I already cut down on drugs for my blood \npressure. I don't want my wife to have to cut down on her medications \nuntil we have no other choice.''\n  Children depend on Medicaid as well. Eighteen million children--more \nthan a quarter of all children in our country--receive health care \nunder Medicaid. More than half of these children are members of working \nfamilies. Their parents work hard--most of them 8 hours a day, 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year. Without Medicaid's help, all their hard work \nwill not buy their children the health care they need.\n  We often hear that the reason to balance the budget is for America's \nchildren. A budget that denies health care to millions of children is \nthe wrong way to express concern for their future.\n  Not only does the Republican budget slash health benefits for low-\nincome children, it cashes out the investments we have made in the \nNation's youth by cutting education programs severely over the next 7 \nyears.\n  And for what purpose? To ``ensure a better future for our children?'' \nTo provide them with ``more and better opportunities than we now \nenjoy?'' Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Every parent knows that education is the foundation of a better life \nfor their children. Deep Republican cuts in education betray the hopes \nand dreams of parents for their children and undermine the Nation's \nfuture strength. As America moves into the high-technology world of the \n21st century, our schools and colleges and students need more help, not \nless.\n  The Senate budget contained the largest education cuts in U.S. \nhistory--over one-third of the investment in education by the year \n2002, and $30 billion in cuts in financial aid to college students.\n  This budget conference agreement makes these completely unacceptable \ncuts worse. During floor debate on the Senate budget resolution, we \npassed a bipartisan amendment by a vote of 67 to 42 to restore $9.4 \nbillion to student loan accounts so that students would not face \nincreases in personal indebtedness of up to 50 percent. Republicans and \nDemocrats in both the House and the Senate wrote to the conferees to \nurge them to adopt the Senate number on student loans. Fourteen Senate \nRepublicans signed a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to the conferees \nreinforcing this point.\n  And what does this budget agreement do? It requires $10 billion to be \ntaken from students in the form of increased fees and interest rates on \nstudent loans; 88 percent of the cuts in student aid contained in this \nbudget fall on families earning $75,000 or less. The Republicans claim \nto balance the budget to protect the next generation. But they are more \nthan willing to bury this generation of students in debt. And for what? \nTo pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  The following is a summary of the consequence of the conference \neducation cuts:\n  Overall: Largest education cuts in U.S. history; eliminates 33 \npercent of the Federal investment in education by year 2002 based on \nCongressional Budget Office estimates.\n  College aid: Cuts $30 billion in Federal aid to college students over \nthe next 7 years. Half of all college students receive Federal \nfinancial aid; 75 percent of all student aid comes from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Increases personal debt for students with subsidized loans by 20 to \n48 percent by eliminating the in-school interest subsidy. Affects up to \n4 million students a year; undergraduate students who borrow the \nmaximum of $17,125 will pay an extra $4,920.\n  Reduces Pell grants for individual students by 40 percent by the year \n2002, or terminates Pell grants altogether for over 1 million students \nper year, even assuming a freeze at 1995 funding levels.\n  Could increase up-front student loan fees by 25 percent, raise \ninterest rates on student loans, or eliminate grace period for students \nto defer payment on loans after graduation.\n  School aid: Elementary and Secondary Education Act--Cuts funding for \nimproving math and reading skills to 2 million children; reduces \nfunding for 60,000 schools.\n  Safe and drug free schools--Cuts over $1 billion in antidrug and \nantiviolence programs serving 39 million students in 94 percent of the \nNation's school districts.\n  Head Start: Denies preschool education to between 350,000 and 550,000 \nchildren.\n  Special education: Eliminates $5 billion in Federal support for \nspecial education services for 5.5 million students with disabilities.\n  Goals 2000: Denies assistance to 47 States and more than 3,000 school \ndistricts helping students to achieve higher education standards.\n  School-to-work: Cuts $5.3 billion from initiatives to improve job \nskills for up to 12 million students through local partnerships of \nbusinesses, schools and community colleges.\n  Technology: Eliminates Federal initiatives to develop and provide \neducational technology for the classroom through collaboration with \nprivate funders.\n  In the last Congress, Republicans and Democrats stood together as the \neducation Congress. In the last Congress, we voted 98 to 1 to expand \nHead Start to make preschool available to more children. Yet the \nRepublican budget eliminates hundreds of thousands of eligible children \nfrom Head Start over the next 7 years.\n  In the last Congress, we voted 77 to 20 to improve the way the \nFederal Government supports elementary and secondary education. We \nstrengthened our commitment, through title I, to help children improve \ntheir basic reading\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\nand math skills. The Republican budget denies those services to \nmillions of children and reduces funding for tens of thousands of \nschools. These damaging cuts would affect virtually every public school \nin the country, and many parochial and private schools as well.\n  In the last Congress, we enacted Goals 2000--again with a bipartisan \nvote--to support States in their efforts to develop high standards for \nstudents. The Republican budget denies assistance to States and \nthousands of school districts, drastically reducing Federal support for \nthese essential reform efforts.\n  In the last Congress, we joined together to create school-to-work \ninitiatives that provide seed money to every State to design and \nimplement systems that will provide more effective connections for \nyoung people between classroom learning and real job opportunities in \nlocal communities. The Republican budget repeals this highly successful \nlegislation. Additionally, it cuts billions of dollars over 7 years \nfrom a number of education and work preparation initiatives designed to \nimprove the job skills for students.\n  In the last Congress, we launched the National and Community Service \nProgram--another bipartisan effort--to support local efforts throughout \nthe Nation that encourage young people to serve in their communities. \nUnder the Republican budget, AmeriCorps and service learning are \neliminated, denying funds for the 40,000 students planning to devote \nthemselves to a year of full-time service in 1996 and the 550,000 \nstudents in American schools who could take advantage of service \nlearning opportunities in and out of the classroom.\n  And what about the Nation's students and working families struggling \nto pay for college? In the last Congress we enacted the Student Loan \nReform Act, which is saving the Nation's students over $2 billion in \nloan fees, lower interest rates, and more favorable repayment terms.\n  The Republican budget cuts Federal support for student financial aid \nby billions of dollars over the next 7 years. And this is not an area \nwhere States will pick up the slack; 75 percent of all student aid \ncomes from the Federal Government, and one-half of the Nation's \nstudents receive Federal aid.\n  Under the Republican budget, no aspect of student aid would remain \nuntouched. For 30 years, the Federal Government has paid the interest \non federally subsidized Stafford loans while students are in college, \nso that the interest does not build up before students graduate and can \nbegin paying back their loans. Under this Republican budget, that vital \nsupport would be denied.\n  Something has to give, and apparently the Republicans have decided \nthat it is the Nation's students who must give.\n  And it is not only student loans that will be slashed by the \nRepublican budget. Over the next 7 years, Pell grants will drop \nsteeply. This decline in buying power comes at a time when the cost of \nattending State universities is rising by an average of 5 percent per \nyear.\n  Three other major sources of Federal student aid--supplemental \neducational opportunity grants, State student incentive grants, and \nPerkins loans--would also be drastically cut by this budget.\n  This is not sharing the pain. This is a full-scale assault on the \nNation's students and working families.\n  Thousands of students from across the country have written to me by \nmail and on the Internet to describe in personal terms what these cuts \nin student aid would mean to them. They speak of the sacrifices their \nparents are making, the extra jobs they are holding down, and the value \nof every dollar in financial aid making it possible for them to pursue \ntheir education.\n  Let me share with you a few examples of the moving testimony I have \nreceived from students across the country.\n  A student attending medical school in Massachusetts writes:\n\n       I am a 24-year-old African-American woman, born and raised \n     in St. Louis, Missouri. I come from a poor, working class, \n     two-parent household. I am proud to say that I was the first \n     African-American valedictorian at my high school. I went on \n     to college at a private institution. I received very much \n     needed financial aid while there, including loans and \n     scholarships. My parents helped as much as they could, but \n     with two other children, they could only help a little . . . \n     Without the Stafford and Perkins loans that I received, I \n     would not have been able to continue my education. After \n     graduating from college I was accepted to an Ivy League \n     medical school where I am still very much dependent on \n     federal financial aid. I hope to practice primary care \n     pediatrics in an indigent community. I am close to finishing \n     school and may not be affected by such harsh cutbacks, but I \n     am very concerned for the future generation of students.\n\n  Under the Republican budget a student following this course of study \ncould well face over $40,000 in additional interest payments at the end \nof her medical training.\n  A student from New York writes:\n\n       My mother just got laid off today. I only have one year \n     left before I receive my bachelor's degree. I don't want my \n     opportunity and those of others to be cut short.\n  Everyone in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the State \ngovernments had their opportunity. Why are you taking away ours?\n\n  A college graduate from Colorado writes:\n\n       I am not a student, but I'm raising my voice in support of \n     government backing for student loans. If it were not for \n     student loans, I would not have been able to attend college. \n     My mother was supporting two kids and we lived in government \n     subsidized housing--the projects. There was simply no way she \n     could have paid for a college education for us, so we applied \n     for loans and more loans. I received some grants and a great \n     deal of loan assistance, and still I worked at McDonald's. I \n     am now a consulting writer and I never have to look for work \n     . . . it looks for me. This is a most wonderful life and I \n     wouldn't have had any chance at all of attaining it without \n     those student loans and grants. Please do whatever it takes \n     to ensure that others get this chance . . . it is what \n     allowed me to become who I am today, and I thank you all.\n\n  Another student, from Maine, summed up the situation: ``If you think \neducation is expensive--try ignorance.''\n  The Republican budget turns its back on investing in our future--our \nchildren's education. It is the wrong priority for the Nation, and that \nmakes no sense.\n  Children will also suffer because the Republican budget cuts back on \nthe earned income tax credit. The earned income tax credit gives \nfamilies with incomes of up to $28,000 a year the incentive to enter \nthe work force and become self-sufficient. It makes work pay by \nproviding a tax credit up to 40 cents for every dollar a low-income \nworker earns. The average credit is $1,400 a year. It offers major \nassistance to working families to raise their standard of living and \nclimb out of poverty.\n  The Senate Republican budget slashes billions of dollars from the \nearned income tax credit over the next 7 years. That's an unacceptable \ntax increase of $1,400 for 12 million working American families and \ntheir children.\n  Tax increases for the working poor--and tax cuts for the rich. What a \nshameful commentary on Republican priorities and the Republican budget. \nNo wonder the country is turning against the Republican Congress.\n  Republicans claim that they are interested in moving welfare \nrecipients into work. But slashing the earned income tax credit, along \nwith the other punitive proposals in the Republican welfare reform \nbill, makes a mockery of that claim. These cuts will encourage \ndependence, not independence. They will weaken the safety net that \nprotects working families and children from falling into poverty.\n  The earned income tax credit has always had bipartisan support in the \npast. President Reagan called it ``the best anti-poverty, the best pro-\nfamily, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.'' It is \nshocking that the Republicans are proposing to cut this tax credit for \nlow-income workers to pay for tax breaks for the rich.\n  During the budget debate last month, Democrats offered amendments to \nuse the $170 billion tax cut fund not only to restore the earned income \ntax credit for working families, but protect Medicare and Medicaid as \nwell as reverse the cuts in the student loan program. On amendment \nafter amendment, the Republican majority voted to protect only one \nthing--their tax breaks for the rich and the special interests, instead \nof helping working families and their children.\n  One of the worst examples of Republican misplaced priorities is their \nblatant attempt vote to keep the tax loophole open for billionaires who \nrenounce\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\ntheir American citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes on \nthe massive wealth they've accumulated in America. These unpatriotic \nbums get a tax loophole--and hard-working low-income Americans get a \ntax increase. Does anyone in America seriously agree with those \nshameful Republican priorities?\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation recently completed its long-awaited \nstudy on the billionaires' tax loophole, and the report was a further \nblatant attempt to save the loophole, rather than close it.\n  According to earlier revenue estimates, closing the loophole would \nraise $3.6 billion over the next 10 years. Clearly, substantial \nrevenues are at stake.\n  At least the Finance Committee tried to close this flagrant loophole.\n  But it reappeared in the bill in conference with the House, \nsupposedly because a few so-called technical issues needed to be \naddressed.\n  It turns out that the only serious technical issue was how to keep \nthe loophole open. Well, our Republican friends studied the issue as \nhard as they could, and a few days ago, they came up with a way to save \nas much of the billionaires' loophole as possible.\n  It took a bit of work. But the Ways and Means Committee has finally \nfound the ways and means to keep the loophole open. Earlier this month, \nthey reported out a bill to do it. They have even given the bill an \nappropriate number: H.R. 1812. What a perfect number for a tax loophole \nbill--1812. That is about the year their thinking on tax reform \nstopped. Well, I think we will just try to bring their 1812 bill into \nthe 20th century when it gets to the Senate--and close that loophole \nthe way it ought to be closed--closed tight on those unpatriotic \nbillionaires.\n  I just wish our Republican friends would put as much time and effort \ninto closing tax loopholes and reducing corporate welfare as they put \ninto keeping these loopholes open. We would save tens of billions of \ndollars, and be able to balance the budget fairly, instead of balancing \nit on the backs of Medicare and education and low-income working \nfamilies.\n  The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee proposed to tinker with \nthe existing law--and in a way which does not address the fundamental \nproblems of this tax loophole.\n  First, the proposal allows expatriates to pay no U.S. tax on their \ngains if they are willing to wait 10 years before they sell their \nassets. This part of the loophole already exists in current law, and \nhas been repeatedly pointed out. There is no logical reason to leave it \nopen.\n  Second, one of the major problems of current law is the fact that \ngains from foreign assets built up during U.S. citizenship are not \nsubject to U.S. tax after expatriation. Yet, some of the most flagrant \ncases of expatriate tax abuse involve individuals who avoided taxes on \nforeign income.\n  Any serious proposal to address these issues must tax the gains on \nthe expatriate's worldwide assets, and this tax must be imposed at the \ntime of expatriation.\n  Third, expatriates will continue to use tax planning gimmicks to \navoid taxes on gains from domestic assets by shifting income from the \ndomestic to the foreign side of the ledger. As long as the Tax Code \nexempts foreign assets from taxes upon expatriation, taxpayers will \nfind new ways to shift their assets and avoid their taxes.\n  Fourth, the proposal allows billionaires to avoid the expatriation \ntax by taking up residence in certain countries with which the United \nStates has a tax treaty that prevents taxation of former citizens. An \nexpatriate and their lawyer can easily find tax havens with such tax \ntreaties, and we ought to reject that easy means of tax avoidance.\n  Fifth, the so-called reform cannot be effectively enforced. \nExpatriates can leave U.S. tax jurisdiction without paying a tax or \nposting security. Expatriates will merely fill out a form at the time \nof expatriation, and the IRS will be left holding the bag.\n  At the very time when Republicans in Congress are cutting Medicare, \neducation, and other essential programs in order to pay for tax cuts \nfor the rich, they are also maneuvering to salvage this unjustified \nloophole for the super wealthy. I say, this loophole should be closed \nnow and closed tight--no ifs, ands, or buts. I intend to do all I can \nto see that it is.\n  Working families have been asked to shoulder too much of the burden \nof deficit reduction in the Republican budget. The cuts in important \nhealth, education, and income assistance programs will diminish the \nopportunities of millions of Americans to improve their lives and their \nfuture. I urge the Senate to reject this unconscionable budget.\n  All Members urge our colleagues and the American people to take the \ntime to focus on exactly what the alternatives are that are being \nrecommended by the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate of the United States.\n  The reason that we urge this very careful attention over these next \nfew days is because of the enormous consequences that it is going to \nhave on them, on their children, and on their parents.\n  No judgment will have been made in recent times that will be more \ndecisive as to the impact on American families than the outcome of \nthese budget considerations.\n  The actions that we took here in the last Congress that saw the \nchanges in the Head Start Program to reach younger children and improve \nthe quality of its services, in the title I education program for \ndisadvantaged children, in Goals 2000, in the School-to-Work Program, \nin the direct loan program--all are reflective of Republican and \nDemocratic efforts to protect the priorities of working families in \nthis country, that education is important. With this budget, that \neffort is significantly undermined. And it is undermined not just in \nthis Congress but it is undermined for the next 7 years. That is what \nwe are talking about. That is why this whole debate and discussion is \nof such importance.\n\n  We are not just talking about what is going to be appropriated in 1 \nparticular year. We are deciding a glidepath for the next 7 years and \nwe are making judgments about what is going to be invested in the \nchildren of this country over the next 7 years. What we are talking \nabout is what is going to be the increase in out-of-pocket payments for \nour seniors over the period of the next 7 years. And what we are \ntalking about, which is the most unconscionable item, is what is going \nto be going into the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations over the period of the next 7 years.\n  That is the issue that is before this country. That is the issue of \nimportance for every American family to take note of. We are urging \ntheir focus and attention on this issue today and over the period of \nthese next several weeks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This 7-year blueprint which the Republican budget plan \nis laying out for the country, is it not correct that the cuts in the \ninvestments in the future--cuts in education, in college opportunities, \nin work training programs, all of the things that build a stronger \neconomy--that those cuts intensify in each of the subsequent years as \nyou move through the 7-year period?\n  So that people need to understand. I think the Senator is making an \nextremely important point. This is not just the plan for next year. It \nis the plan for 7 years. Furthermore, the way this plan is structured, \nas I understand it, the impact will intensify as we move through the \ntime period so what people will experience in the first year of the \nplan, which I submit will be very draconian, will worsen as the time \npasses through the 7-year period. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely right and is focused on what \nmight be considered a subtlety because it is not talked about and is \ndeemphasized by those who are supporting this program. But in reality \nthe Republican budget is going to adversely impact our seniors and our \nchildren over the next 7 years, in a cumulative way, which I believe \nwill do serious damage to the next generation as well as older \ngenerations as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? Do the tax cuts for the wealthy \nthat are provided in this plan--in other words, what the plan is doing \nis sharply curtailing opportunities for working\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\npeople, taking the money that is realized from that, and then using it, \nas I understand it, to give a tax cut to the very wealthy. Do those tax \ncuts occur in the beginning or in the front of this 7-year period? Or \ndo they occur at the end of the 7-year period?\n  As I understand it, with the changes made in the budget conference \nthe tax cuts now will be part of the reconciliation and therefore will \nbecome applicable at once, or in the near future, for the benefit of \nthe very wealthy while the rest of the population will begin to bear \nthese cuts and then bear them throughout the 7-year period, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Not only do you have \nthe imbalance of the cuts on working families, on their children, and \non senior citizens, but you also have this enormous benefit to the \nwealthiest individuals through this tax break.\n  I would just ask my friend and colleague, if these cuts went in as \nincentives to improve our economy and create more jobs, you might be \nable to find some justification. But the nature of these cuts--it is \nlike taking billions of dollars and throwing them off the Capitol. Some \npeople will pick them up and buy tee shirts and hotdogs, but the \nbenefits will go in the most extraordinary way to the wealthiest \nindividuals without having the real, positive impact in terms of \nencouraging investment in our society.\n  Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator is absolutely right. People have to \nunderstand, because people say we want to eliminate the deficit, then \nthey say we ought to cut spending, but with this plan, a good part of \nthe cut in spending is not to eliminate the deficit but to provide a \npool of money which can then be given as tax cuts for the people at the \nvery top of the income scale. In effect, what this budget plan is doing \nis, it says to people on Medicare, our senior citizens: You are going \nto take a reduction in your Medicare services. It says to young people \nwho want to go to college, it is going to become much more costly for \nyou to go to college. And the reason this is happening, a good part of \nthe reason this is happening, is to create a pot of money with which to \ngive these tax cuts.\n  I submit, anyone weighing the equities of this and the desirability \nof this in terms of investing in the future would conclude it would be \nbetter to keep open the opportunities for college, not to subject our \nsenior citizens to higher risks with respect to medical treatment and \nmedical care, not to impact on child nutrition and feeding programs, \nschool lunches, and so forth --not to hit those programs so heavy and \nto give up on the notion of giving a large tax cut to very wealthy \npeople.\n  I do not understand the rationale for doing that, in terms of the \npriorities of the country, I say to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it well. I think it is important \nfor all Americans who are going to pay attention to this debate to \nunderstand who are really being adversely impacted--working families \nand their children.\n  First of all, for the very young members of their families, they are \ngoing to be adversely impacted by the cutbacks in terms of the support \nfor education reform in the schools across this Nation. If they have \nchildren that qualify for the Head Start Program, there will be 500,000 \nfewer children who will participate in this program. If they were \ndependent upon any kind of help and assistance in the Summer Job \nProgram, that opportunity will be cut back. Their smaller children will \nbe adversely impacted with the reduction in support for the public \nschools of this country.\n  Second, they are going to be adversely impacted if they have sons and \ndaughters who go on to the fine schools and colleges in this country. \nOne of the great phenomena that has taken place since the end of World \nWar II is how American universities have dominated the world. Of the \n140 great universities, 127 of them are in the United States of \nAmerica. That is because of the policies which provide help and \nassistance to children; why we have a research program, and how those \nuniversities now are working with the private sector. They have been \nabsolutely a phenomenal success to the benefit of our young people, the \nsons and daughters of working families. And 75 percent of all the \nfunding for help and assistance to those children comes from the \nStafford Loan Program and the other Federal support programs. Seventy \npercent of the children in the State of Massachusetts are dependent for \nthat help and assistance. This is going to mean a $30 billion reduction \nin this program over the next 7 years--$30 billion in the education \nsupport programs for the young men and women.\n\n  Now let me just mention that not only will we see a reduction in the \nsupport for the education programs for children, we will see an \nincrease of what their parents are going to have to pay as well. This \nis not just a family that is out somewhere in Main Street America. If \nthey were working on the lowest level of the economic ladder, they \nwould have qualified for the earned income tax credit that would help \nkeep them off welfare and in jobs. We see the $20 billion earned income \ntax credit expansion being effectively taken off the plate as to not \nbenefit those working families.\n  What we are saying to the Medicare recipients, two-thirds of which \nare only making $17,000 a year, is that they will have an average \nincrease of $3,200 over the next 7 years.\n  So we see the damage that is being done to the children of working \nfamilies. We see the damage which is being done to the seniors who have \npaid into the Medicare Program and are entitled to that benefit. We see \nthe reduction in the support of individuals that are going to those \nschools. And we see the slashing of the EITC Program for working \nfamilies. The leadership in the Congress is opposed to an increase in \nthe minimum wage, and is trying to bring a reduction under Davis-Bacon \nto diminish working families' income, which averages $27,000. You have \nto ask yourself, what have working families done to deserve this?\n  Does the Senator from Maryland agree that this is not a wholesale \nassault on the working families of this country?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. What is happening is there is a massive \neffort to shift the economic benefits to a small group at the top of \nthe income scale, a trend that has already been going on over the last \ndecade and a half.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, does the provision from the \nconference committee drop the forgiveness of paying interest on your \nstudent loans while you are in school?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. If I could just mention in \nresponding to that, does the Senator remember when this body, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, saw a restoration of billions of \ndollars to the Student Loan Program? I think it was an amendment of the \nSenator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, cosponsored by the Senator from \nIllinois. And after all the speeches that were made in support of that \nprogram, all the speeches of individuals who went on record to increase \nour investment in education, the ink was not even dry before the \nRepublican conferees dropped it in conference.\n  I mean, does the Senator from Maryland find that is a way in which we \nattempt to reflect our commitment to higher education? And second, \ngoing back to the increase in interest payments on borrowing while the \nstudent is in school and college, mark this, every young person in \nAmerica: You will pay an additional 30 percent in student loans as a \nresult. And, as the Senator from Maryland said, why? To give $245 \nbillion to the wealthiest individuals. The young people of this country \nwill say: All right. We are prepared to tighten our belts if everyone \nelse is doing it. We are prepared to try to deal with the national \nchallenge and a national need.\n  But are you prepared to support a program that says you are going to \nput that on the backs of the young people under the phony argument that \nwe are doing this in order to get the country out of debt? Young \nAmericans will be in debt for years and years to come as a result of \nthis.\n  Does the Senator from Maryland think that makes any sense?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely not. People have to understand that under \nthe existing program, which is now about to be changed, young people \nand their families take out loans in order to finance their college \neducation. That is tough because it means they come out of school with \na burden hanging over them which they then have to\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\npay off as they go through their working lives. Not to compound that \nproblem, under the current system, the interest on those loans is \nabated or forgiven while they are in school, so you are not in this \nsituation where you took out a loan and then you have to pay interest \non the loan while you are in school. I think that is reasonable. That \nis sensible.\n  It is bad enough that you are taking on this heavy burden of paying \noff in the future. At least, do not compound the financial problem \nwhich these families confront at the very time they are trying to get a \ncollege education for their young men and women.\n  This proposal, as I understand it, will drop that provision, so they \nwill be confronted then with the task of an additional burden added \nonto their loan responsibility in order to get a college education. It \nis tough enough now. I have talked with these families. They come to \nsee me. They are desperate to find a way for their young son or \ndaughter to get through college. The young people themselves are \ndesperate. Sometimes they go out there holding three or four jobs at \nthe same time to try to get enough money. They are committed to getting \nthrough college. Many families have never sent children to college \nbefore. It represents a breakthrough. They are out on an uncharted \npath.\n  Mark this: Other industrialized countries do not put their young \npeople under this kind of stress and strain in terms of furthering \ntheir higher education. They make it possible for their young people \nwith talent and ability to get a higher education. Why do they do that? \nBecause they recognize that the benefit of further education is not \nonly to the individual who gets it. That is an obvious benefit. But it \nis a benefit to society. They build a stronger society by making it \npossible for their young people to get an education. Here we are \nretreating from that challenge.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it accurately. But it is even \nworse than that. Last year, we moved in a very gradual way toward a \ndirect loan program to permit young people to borrow at the same level \nat which the Federal Government borrows. That would mean lower interest \nrates, allowing an additional $2 billion to be available for education \nto try to get a handle on the ever-increasing escalation of costs for \ntuition.\n  Effectively, with the action of the Budget Committee, that very \nmodest but important step that can save kids anywhere from $1,000 to \n$2,000 over the period when they are going to school is effectively \nwiped out. Here we had a bipartisan effort to do it.\n  Beyond this, the Senator from Maryland is familiar with the \nPresident's program that says in this area of education, he had a small \ntax deduction as well. His program in terms of the reduction in taxes \nis focused on education. The Republicans are going to make it more \ndifficult for the students of this country to be able to afford to get \nan education. And what was on the other side? What we ought to be \ndebating out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate is what the President \nsuggested, and that is the following: That families with incomes up to \n$100,000 would be able to deduct up to $10,000 in tuition from their \ntaxes to make it more affordable. Second, that they would be able to \ndeduct the interest that they are paying on their debt.\n  Why does it make any sense when we permit deductions on interest on \nhomes for wealthy individuals and we permit the deduction of other \nexpenses for industry, why should we say education is of less \nimportance?\n  That is what this President was fighting for. That is what we ought \nto be debating. If there is anything out here, any resources that could \nbe used for tax cuts, would the Senator not agree with me that it makes \na great deal more sense than taking the kinds of cuts in Medicare, in \neducation, in slashing wages for working families and using it for the \nwealthiest individuals?\n  Mr. SARBANES. May I ask the Senator a question. Does the budget \nresolution cut back the earned-income tax credit program which was \nestablished to help working families get above the poverty line? This \nhelps families, I think, with incomes up to $27,000 or $28,000.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. We have some 84,000 families, \nand we have about 300,000 individuals in my own State of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Just in the Senator's State alone.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In my State alone. And this was targeted, as the Senator \nunderstands. It had strong support from President Reagan and other \nRepublicans. It had bipartisan support as well. And as the Senator \nunderstands, the reason for that is because of the increasing \nobligation that these families have in terms of paying the increase in \nSocial Security and other tax programs just when they were moving off \nthat bottom rung to the second rung of the ladder.\n  Mr. President, $26,000 a year is not a lot to pay a mortgage, put \nfood on the table, clothe your kids, and try to give them at least some \nlimited relief.\n  As the Senator knows, in that budget there is a continuation of about \n$4 trillion over the next 7 years of what we call tax expenditures \nwhich are available to wealthy corporations and companies.\n  At the same time they kept these tax breaks for the rich, they \ntargeted the earned income tax credit. They took that away. They \neffectively raised the taxes on the lowest income people.\n  I would just finally ask, does the Senator not find it somewhat \nextraordinary they have eliminated the EITC, the earned income tax \ncredit, without addressing the billionaire's tax loophole?\n  We found those economic forces working their way in that conference \ncommittee after our Finance Committee and the Senate went on record to \nclose that tax loophole that says to Americans, become modern Benedict \nArnolds; renounce your citizenship; take your money and go overseas and \ndo not pay any taxes.\n  We have been out here trying to get that closed. They need some \nadditional money. Why are they closing that loophole? Oh, yes, there is \nquietness about it, no explanation.\n  It does not take a lot to figure out how that ought to be closed. \nHowever, they found all different ways of cutting back on children, the \nsmallest children, the most vulnerable, cutting back on education, \ntargeting our senior citizens. But they refuse to close the biggest and \nmost unjustified loophole of all.\n  I just wonder if the Senator does not feel that that is something \nwhich the American people ought to begin to wonder about. They have \nread about it. They have heard about it months ago. They should be \nwondering why is it that we cannot have that loophole closed as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. It is very important \nfor the public to understand that a tax measure built into the law \nbefore, which would have allowed working families to get an earned \nincome tax credit in order to improve their position to support their \nfamily--these are people making up to $27,000 a year--that is being cut \nback, that is being cut back at the same time that it is proposed to \ngive tax breaks to people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a \nyear.\n  Where is the fairness or the equity in that? If you were not giving a \ntax break, then you would have an argument about where the cuts should \ncome, and there I think this program is draconian, but at least it \nwould be in that context. But what is happening is you are cutting a \ntax provision to benefit working families in order to give a tax break \nto people making six-figure incomes, and to compound the bizarre nature \nof this, they are unwilling to close the billionaire's expatriate tax \nloophole on which the Senate has gone on record, I think unanimously or \nalmost unanimously----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, two votes on that side of the aisle.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All right--to do away with it. And these are people, \nextremely wealthy people, literally billionaires we are talking about, \nwho renounce their American citizenship in order to avoid paying \nAmerican taxes. And the Treasury has worked out a proposal whereby they \nwill not be able to get away with that. The conference was unwilling to \nencompass that proposal and to include it in the report.\n  So you have these tremendously wealthy people in effect walking scot-\nfree from paying reasonable taxes. When you talk about this, the other \nside says, well, there you are; it is class warfare.\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\n  The class warfare is coming from the people at the top who are \npulling in these benefits. That is the real class warfare that is \nhappening here. Those who have much want more, more, more, and they \nthrow the burden on those who have little, those who are struggling to \nmake it through the day, struggling to educate their children, senior \ncitizens who are struggling to meet their medical need problems, young \nfamilies that are worried about how they are going to provide for their \nparents, worried about how they are going to provide for their \nchildren.\n  They cut back on the very programs designed to address those \nproblems--Medicare, college loans, child nutrition programs, earned-\nincome tax credit for working families--they cut back on those programs \nand at the same time that they are cutting back on those programs, they \nare giving large tax breaks to people with six-figure incomes, well \nabove $100,000 a year.\n  Now, what is the sense of that? Where is the equity in that? Where is \nthe wisdom in that in terms of investing in America's future? Those \nmaking those large incomes ought to be concerned about what is \nhappening to working families and their children because you cannot \nreside at the top of the house with any sense of security and comfort \nwhen the foundations down below are not solid. And those foundations \nneed to be solid. We have to break out of this mentality of trickle-\ndown economics: You put it all in at the top, and somehow it is going \nto trickle its way down to ordinary people. We need percolate-up \neconomics where you create prosperity in the great base of American \nsociety. The people at the top will benefit from that, as will \neverybody else. But it will work its way up; it will come up from the \ngrassroots; it will come up from working people; we will have a strong \nmiddle class, which was always the hallmark of a strong American \neconomy and which we are losing. This budget resolution is a classic \nexample of how to intensify those negative trends.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just review with the Senator from Maryland one \nother major impact that this has. Let us take the State of \nMassachusetts. This kind of reduction on the budget is going to mean \n$1.2 billion less in scholarship assistance for students in the next 7 \nyears. We can say, well, maybe the States are going to make up that \ndifference. Just ask what has happened in Massachusetts over the last 5 \nand 7 years in terms of tuition.\n  The States have not been making it up. The States have not been \nmaking that contribution. And that has been true in every State of the \ncountry.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, with this Republican budget, it is \ngoing to mean a loss of $9.8 billion in Medicare and $4.6 billion in \nMedicaid over the next 7 years to the elderly and to the neediest \npeople in our State, as well as to education. I do not know what it is \nin the State of Maryland, but the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid will \nlikely be equally harsh.\n  Who are the ones getting the help and assistance of Medicaid? Sixty-\nseven percent of the Medicaid money is spent for long-term care for the \nelderly poor and the rest for the disabled. And the rest are going to \nbe the 5 to 7 million American children that are the poorest children \nin this country that are going to be off the list. Where are the States \ngoing to be coming up with that kind of money?\n  Who is going to pick that up? What has been the record of the States \nover the last 15 years in terms of the poorest children? It has been \nunacceptable. They say, ``Look, we can do this here, we will just shift \nall of this back to the States.'' I know in Massachusetts, those kinds \nof offsets are not indicated in the Governor's budget, and I have not \nfound any Governors across this country that have said they are \nprepared to make up the difference.\n  So what is going to happen? Here it is, long-term care, frail elderly \nwho have no other resources, have qualified for the Medicaid; and the \ndisabled, with all of the attendant costs and needs that families have \nwhen they have a disabled child--the emotion of that--the Medicaid \nprogram just providing enough to get along and provide some of those \nessential services are being told that they are going to have a $175 \nbillion cutback.\n  If you are talking about the Medicare, which our seniors have paid \ninto, if you are talking about the Medicaid, which serves the most \nvulnerable people in our society, if you are talking about the children \nof working families and you do not qualify for these Stafford loans or \nPell grants. The Pell grants, in terms of purchasing, are alone going \nto decrease 40 percent in value over the next 7 years. You have to be \nneedy in order to qualify for those grants. We are talking about men \nand women, workers in America, playing by the rules, working 45 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks out of the year, paying taxes and trying to bring up \nfamilies, and this is going to hit every aspect of their life.\n  I am just wondering whether the Senator feels that the States, as \nformer chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, are going to be in an \nposition to be able to make all of this up?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, most of the Governors have \nbeen very clear that they cannot make it up. They are just not in a \nposition to do so. Now what that means, because you talk about these \ncuts and you talk about numbers, you have to talk about services and \npeople.\n  And what it means, as the Senator from Massachusetts so eloquently \npointed out, is the frail elderly who are now benefiting from the \nMedicaid program in terms of long-term care in nursing homes and so \nforth and so on. What is going to happen to those people? What is going \nto happen to them and to their families? Some families are stretched \nbeyond the limits trying to handle the problem of their aged parents--\nbeyond the limits.\n  Is it not enough of a burden to face the emotional and the \npsychological stress and strain which goes with that kind of problem? \nTalk to a young couple, with a parent who has Alzheimer's and is in a \nnursing home, about what they are up against, just emotionally what \nthey are up against, the stress in their lives. Then you are going to \nadd to it an intense financial and economic stress.\n  Why are we doing this? Why are we subjecting so many of our people to \nthis incredible pressure? We have to cut so we can give big tax breaks, \nthat is one reason. We will not reform the medical care system, which \nmight well help us to deal with these problems; we are unwilling to do \nthat.\n  So we leave this incredible pressure and burden on ordinary families \nall across America to face what for many of them are desperate \nproblems. It is the same thing with educating their children. Any young \ncouple will tell you that is one of the prime worries in their mind, \nhow they are going to educate their young children.\n  We tried to put together a system. We had the Pell grants, which is a \ngrant, not a loan. It has diminished in impact because we say we cannot \nafford it, so we shift it over to loans. We said, ``All right, you take \na loan, you will enhance your earning capacity, you will pay it back \nover your working career.'' Now the loan is going to be compounded \nbecause we are not going to forgive the interest charge. So this is \nwhat has happened.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Senator just to draw his attention to the \nissue of fairness with regard to Medicare. I think the Senator from \nMaryland is familiar with what happened at the start of this year about \nwhatever laws we apply and pass here we ought to make applicable to the \nCongress and to the Senate. That is a principle with which I agree. We \ncould have done it last year. We had resistance from our Republican \nfriends. Now we have passed it.\n  But there is an interesting flip side to that issue, which is about \nthe benefits that we get. Should we not make sure that the people \nacross the country are going to get the benefits that we get?\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives have resoundingly said no \nwhen it comes to health care reform. You have that little blue form, \nany Member of Congress or the Senate does not have to fill it out in \norder to participate in the Federal employees program. I do not know of \nany Senator who has filled that out. They are all taking advantage of \nit. So we see what happens under the program that is being put forward.\n  The annual incomes of Members of Congress is $133,000; for seniors, \n$17,750.\n  The monthly premiums, $44; the seniors, $46.\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\n  Deductible, $350; for the seniors, $816.\n  On the hospital care, we have unlimited care and theirs is defined \nand limited.\n  We have prescription drugs covered; not covered for our seniors. That \nis a key area we had included in President Clinton's program last year.\n  On the dental care, we are covered; our seniors are not covered.\n  And then a whole range of preventive services which are included, and \nthey have some benefits but not nearly as extensive.\n  Then we take care of our out-of-pocket limit of $3,700 and there is \nno out-of-pocket limit for the senior citizens.\n  It seems to me if you have that $245 billion out there in the \nRepublican budget, that we ought to be able to look out after our \nsenior citizens and try to at least make these more equitable, some of \nthese more fair, some of these that are important lifelines for our \nsenior citizens to live in some peace and some dignity.\n  These are the issues, Mr. President. We are talking essentially about \nwho is going to bear the burden of these economic cuts. Make no mistake \nabout it, it is going to be the youngest people in this country who are \ngoing to find it more difficult, more expensive to go on to the schools \nand colleges. It is going to be the reduction of services that working \nfamilies are going to need. It is going to be the concern of working \nfamilies in recognizing that their parents are going to have to pay \nmuch more out of their pockets for the Medicare coverage which they are \nreceiving now.\n  It is basically unfair to put that kind of burden on working families \nand to have the benefits for the wealthiest individuals.\n  So, Mr. President, these are the issues which we are going to have a \nchance to debate as we move on through. This debate is enormously \nimportant and of great consequence. It is going to have a direct impact \non every family in this country, not just for this year, but over the \nperiod of the next 7 years. It is going to affect every parent and \nevery child. That is what is going to be before this Senate and before \nthe House in these days and weeks to come. We urge them to give it \ntheir attention, and let their Members of Congress know where they \nstand.\n\n  Do they think we ought to have these kinds of cuts in education and \nin the quality of life of our seniors in order to have a tax benefit \nfor the wealthiest individuals? I say ``no.'' That will be an issue we \nshould debate, and we ought to hear from the American people as to what \nthey believe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S8979-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8989-S8990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment \nthat was submitted by my colleague, Senator Bryan. The issue of whether \nwe should extend the statute of limitations to bring an implied right \nof action is fraught with confusion.\n  In 1991, the Supreme Court, for the first time, set the statute of \nlimitations on implied private rights of action. Before the Court's \nruling there was no unified statute of limitations in these kinds of \ncases. The statute of limitations varied from State to State. Whether \nyou could bring suit depended entirely on what the statute of \nlimitations was in any particular State.\n  In the 1991 Lampf case, the Court finally set a standard statute of \nlimitations. There has been no evidence shown that extending this \nSupreme Court set statute to 5 years will benefit wronged investors. In \nfact, extending the statute of limitations will do nothing more than \nhold a sword over businesses, and create more of an unreasonably long \nopportunity for litigation.\n  That is why we will be opposing this amendment to extend the statute \nof limitations. The bill holds to the statutes of limitations set by \nthe Lampf case, 1 year from the time of discovery. It seems to me that \nonce you discover fraud, you should be able to bring a lawsuit within 1 \nyear. To extend that to 2 years is unreasonable. If you have discovered \na fraud, then bring the suit. Why would you need 2 years?\n  Also, the SEC has the authority to bring suit at any time on behalf \nof investors who have been wronged; the SEC has no statute of \nlimitations. Extending the statute of limitations to 2 years will make \nour judicial system a paradise for these lawyers.\n  We have not diminished the right to bring a suit after fraud has been \ndiscovered, you can bring a suit 5, 10 years later through the SEC. \nHowever, the lawyers do not make money in huge settlements when the SEC \nbrings suit, so they oppose the provision. I would rather have the SEC \nbring suit so that the defrauded investors actually recover their \nlosses when a settlement is made. In fact, the function of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission is to protect the investor.\n  The SEC recently forced Prudential to set up an open-ended \ndisbursement fund to compensate investors who were defrauded in the \n1980's. I am confident that these investors are actually getting that \nmoney. The SEC had the authority to require this firm to set aside $330 \nmillion for investors, and the SEC did not skim off $30 million of that \nsettlement for lawyers. Is that not the way the system should operate?\n  We debate whether 1 year is enough time after the fraud is discovered \nto bring suit. I ask, why would 1 year not be enough time? Investors \nare protected by the SEC's authority after that 1 year has expired. By \nlimiting the statute of limitations to 1 year, however, we are able to \nstop lawyers from shopping around for years, looking for any possible \nviolation to allege. If there is fraud which comes to light after the \nstatute of limitations has expired the SEC can always bring suit. \nUnderstand that in most cases there is no fraud, the lawyers search \nuntil they find something with which to allege fraud so that they can \nforce the defendants to settle. We need to stop this wasteful practice.\n  We are not protecting people who commit fraudulent actions. We are \nsaying that you cannot allege fraud year after year, just to make the \ncharge. Again, I stress if there is a real fraud, doggone it, we know \nthat the SEC will bring suit. This is not a new practice for the SEC, \nthey have done it before and they will do it again. The SEC, however, \nwill not waste time or money on a multiplicity of specious, spurious \nclaims. So when the proponents of the extension of the statute of \nlimitations say that investors brought 300 suits and the SEC only \nbrought 1, I would note that those 300 suits were mostly frivolous. I \nwould rather have one meritorious suit that recovers money for \ninvestors and is not used as a vehicle to extort money, than hundreds \nof meritless suits.\n  So when we talk about extending the statute of limitations understand \nthat we are not doing anything more, in most cases, than giving people \nan opportunity to fish around until they catch a way to allege fraud \nand file a lawsuit. Once fraud has been discovered, I think it is \npreposterous to say that more than 1 year is needed to bring suit. \nRemember, most of these cases allege fraud although no fraud has been \ncommitted. They allege fraud in order to force defendants to settle \nbecause they cannot defend themselves without putting themselves at \nrisk of even greater losses.\n  So I very strenuously oppose the extension of the statute of \nlimitations, which I think would do a great disservice to the \nlitigation system. The Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, \nestablished this statute of limitations and stated the need for \nuniformity in that statute.\n  I would like to make two other observations. I read in a New York \nTimes editorial that we are making it impossible to bring suit. This is \nnot the case, we are only limiting the ability of lawyers to use these \ncases as a collection vehicle to enrich themselves just by alleging \nfraud. I will repeat that the SEC can bring a case where it believes \nfraud has been committed, without any statute of limitations, and the \nprivate right of action is still available in the State court system. \nIf a State court, or State legislature extends the statute of \nlimitations to 5 years from the commission of fraud and 2 years from \nthe time of discovery, investors will be able to file suit. Of course, \neven in the terrible Keating case suit was brought within a year of \ndiscovery and within 2 years of fraud. So when people say we are \nagainst extending the statute of limitations, I answer, yes, we are \ngoing to bar specious claims, ridiculous\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nclaims brought only to enrich the lawyers, however we keep protections \nagainst real fraud. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission, I \nbelieve, is in a much better position to judge where there is merit and \nwhere there is not in these cases.\n  Mr. President, I have nothing further to add on the amendment put \nforth by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nBryan] on the statute of limitations question is a very important \namendment. I hope my colleagues will consider it very carefully over \nthe weekend and again on Monday, when we will debate the amendment and \nhave a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Let me say that Senators Dodd and Domenici, when they introduced \ntheir bill, included a provision on the statute of limitations that \nclosely parallels what Senator Bryan has offered.\n  They recognized the statute of limitations problem and they sought to \ncorrect it in the package which they introduced. In fact, they \napparently thought it was of such consequence that in the title to \ntheir bill, they put it first and foremost.\n  Their bill as introduced is to amend the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 to establish a filing deadline, and to provide certain other \nthings. They put it right up front. That gives Members, perhaps, some \nindication of recognition of its importance.\n  That provision was then dropped out in the committee's \nconsideration--very unwisely, some Members think--and the measure now \nbefore the Senate does not contain that provision, which was in the \noriginal bill as introduced by Senators Domenici and Dodd. Of course, \nthe amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator \nBryan, is trying to correct that situation.\n  Now, once again, we hear this argument made about the frivolous suits \nor the strike suits, but that really is not related to the statute of \nlimitations problem.\n  A shorter statute of limitations may well knock out meritorious \nsuits, as well. Now, we tried to get a distinction between meritorious \nsuits and frivolous suits with other provisions of the bill--provisions \nthat we are not trying to amend here on the floor.\n  In other words, there has been an acceptance of the proposition that \nthere is something of a problem that we need to try to deal with. \nCertain provisions in this bill do that, and represent an appropriate \nchange in the existing securities litigation system.\n  Other provisions, we submit, go well beyond that. They are excessive \nand constitute overreach, and will in effect, reduce investor \nprotections. We hope, in the course of the consideration of this \nmeasure, to change those provisions, to strengthen investor protections \nand, in effect, to make this a better bill, and eventually, if one \ncould alter it sufficiently, make it worthy of broad-based general \nsupport.\n  The statute of limitations problem does not reach the question of the \ndistinction between meritorious suits and frivolous suits, unless one \nis going to assert the proposition: ``Well, the more immediate the \nstatute of limitations, the more suits you can knock out.''\n  It makes no distinction whether we are knocking out meritorious suits \nor frivolous suits. In fact, probably you will more likely knock out \nmeritorious suits, since those usually take time to work out, and if \npeople are responsible, they do not bring the suit until they have \nasserted a substantial basis for it.\n  Now, Senator Bryan earlier today said it takes the SEC itself--with \nall of the resources that it has, all of the expertise that it has, all \nof the experience that it has--about 2.2 years to bring a suit once \nthey begin working on it.\n  That is the SEC. What does that mean for investors who are trying to \nbring private suits in terms of what constitutes a reasonable statute \nof limitations for them?\n  Second, the 2- and 5-year time periods were what was generally \napplicable throughout a good period of our experience with the \nSecurities and Exchange Act. It worked well. I have heard very little \ncriticism of how it worked over that time period.\n  I have heard criticisms of other aspects of the litigation system, \nbut not really sharp criticism with respect to the statute of \nlimitations question. As I indicated earlier, in fact, a provision was \nincluded in the bill that Senators Dodd and Domenici are pushing, this \neffort to revise the securities litigation system, very strongly. They \nincluded that in the legislation which they proposed.\n  The Senate Banking Committee, in 1991, unanimously, just a couple of \nyears ago, unanimously approved a provision that provided for the 2- \nand 5-year statute of limitations. The 2 years would mean that from the \ntime you learned of the fraud, you would have 2 years to bring your \naction. These are complicated cases. You want people to bring \nresponsible actions, and bringing responsible actions means it takes \ntime to prepare them.\n  In some respects, a shorter statute of limitations is an invitation \nfor the filing of, in a sense, not well-grounded suits, because you \njust want to get in under the wire and you will go ahead and file the \nsuit. The 5-year period would be the statute no matter what, even if \nyou had not discovered the fraud.\n  Now, unless we change that, it is only a 3-year period. Some of these \nthings are concealed--they are concealed from the victims. In fact, the \nprevious Chairman of the SEC, Mr. Breeden, testified to that effect:\n\n       Adoption of these measures will give private litigants a \n     more realistic timeframe in which to discover that they have \n     been defrauded, while also accommodating legitimate interests \n     in providing finality to business transactions and avoiding \n     stale claims.\n\n  The shorter period does not allow investors adequate time to discover \nand pursue violations of securities laws. Many of these things are very \ncomplicated. There is a lot of deception and concealment involved. The \n1- and 3-year limits really break with 40 years of legal precedent.\n  I just hope that the Senate, when it considers this matter, will \nadopt the Bryan amendment, and go to the 2- and 5-year limitation \nperiod. I think it is reasonable. Some States have longer periods, as a \nmatter of fact. I think it is reasonable to go to the 2- and 5-year \nstandard, which is generally what prevailed over four decades of \nexperience with the security laws.\n  I am very hopeful my colleagues, in considering this amendment on \nMonday, will be supportive of it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, Vice President Gore is going to travel to \nMoscow this week to meet with Russian Prime Minister Victor \nChernomyrdin. The meeting takes place amid a renewed challenge to \nPresident Yeltsin and the Prime Minister by conservative elements of \nthe Russian Duma. Certainly just this morning's newspapers gives us a \npretty clear understanding of what is happening.\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\n  I want our Vice President and their Prime Minister to know that I \nsupport their efforts to strengthen cooperation between our two \ncountries. I believe here in the United States, despite our concerns \nabout issues like Chechnya, Russia's continuing efforts to establish \ndemocracy and an open market economy actually merit our support. I \nbelieve that the American people want to engage the Russians \nconstructively. We want to assist them with reform. Most of all, we \nwant to prevent a return to the authoritarianism of the old Soviet \nregime.\n  One topic of conversation between the Vice President and the Prime \nMinister will be the future of United States aid to Russia. Some \nSenators have argued that the aid should be terminated, or at least \nsubstantially curtailed, and I do not agree.\n  Indeed, I find that after a slow start 3 years ago, the United States \naid program to Russia is now making a significant contribution to \nadvancing political and economic reform. I would like to just lay out a \nfew examples.\n  The largest element of U.S. aid is to provide technical assistance to \nhelp the Russians privatize their state-owned enterprises. Think what \nwe have here. We have people who have lived their entire lives in a \ncentrally planned economy. They do not have any idea how to run a \nprivate enterprise. They have never had to sell their products. They \nhave never had to worry about productivity. In fact, when the Berlin \nWall fell, there probably were not more than 100 people in the Soviet \nUnion who actually knew how to analyze an honest corporate profit-and-\nloss statement. They also did not have stock markets, banks or the \nlegal system necessary to support private enterprise. You could not \nenter a contract in Moscow and have it enforced in St. Petersburg. You \ncould not enter a contract in Moscow and have it enforced in other \nparts of Moscow.\n  I think it is in our national interest to help them acquire this \nknow-how. Thanks in large part to our assistance, 50 percent--50 \npercent--of the Russian gross domestic product now comes from the \nprivate sector, and with United States help the Russians are drafting a \ncommercial code, setting up stock markets, and training their police to \nfight the organized crime that could so easily stifle entrepreneurship.\n  I support this aid effort. I support the aid effort because I think \nthat the more successful private enterprise Russia has, the more people \nare going to be resisting any attempt to reestablish Communist \ndictatorship.\n  I want to assure other Senators we are simply not shoveling money out \nthe door to them. In fact, many aid dollars are going to Americans. We \nare sending Americans over to show people how to run a private \nenterprise economy.\n  More and more, we are leveraging our taxpayer dollars with \ncontributions from the private sector. There are private enterprises \nthat are interested in participating in the assistance program as a \npart of an effort to sell products. There are also lots of volunteers. \nIn fact, these enterprises and volunteers allow us to multiply what we \ndo.\n  Another significant element is bringing Russians to the United \nStates. Most of us remember the days of the Soviet Union. The \nGovernment prevented most Russians from seeing what life outside their \ncountry was like. Unless you held a special privileged position in \nacademe or the government, you could not leave. Most people only had a \nvague notion of the advantage of living in an open society. I think \nthat the more Russians actually visit the West, talk to Americans, see \nhow we live, the more likely it is they will resist a return to \ntotalitarianism.\n  Some have suggested that we suspend all aid to show our objections to \nthe sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, or Russian actions in Chechnya. \nOf course, I am intensely concerned about what is happening in \nChechnya. Russian military violence against civilians has far exceeded \naccepted standards of civilized behavior, regardless of what they claim \nwas the provocation by Chechen separatists. Use of landmines aimed \nprimarily at the civilian population is just one of the egregious \nthings they have done.\n  By its actions in Chechnya over the last 6 months, the Russian \nGovernment shows it still has a lot to learn about democratic values \nand respect for human rights. I hope now with the current negotiations \nthey are finally learning. In fact, that is why I joined with Senator \nMcConnell this spring in insisting on shifting some of our proposed aid \nto Russia to provide humanitarian assistance to the Chechens as a token \nof our disapproval.\n  Let us think about what we are talking about as far as aid to Russia \nis concerned. We are talking about $200-$300 million overall in aid. \nThink about what we spent in waging the cold war over the years with \nthe former Soviet Union. This does not even cover the interest on what \nwe used to spend. It is also a drop in the bucket compared to the \nRussian Government budget. If we cut the aid off, nobody in the central \ngovernment in Russia is going to notice, because the amounts would not \nbe that large. The people who will notice are those reformers and those \nentrepreneurs and those in the private sector in Russia who are \npointing to the West and the United States especially as somebody who \nis helping them move to democracy. They will notice, because they are \nthe ones who will find their voices not heard as well if aid is cut \noff.\n  And so, Mr. President, I support the Vice President's mission to \nMoscow. I believe that promoting democratization of the second greatest \nmilitary power in the world enhances U.S. security. I know that the \nVice President will convey forcefully to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin \nAmerica's concerns regarding Chechnya and the Iran reactor sale. I also \nknow that he will work to strengthen dialog and cooperation between our \ntwo countries. And I do not know of any better way to promote world \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S8990-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8991-S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL ANTITRUST REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that we are approaching the end of \nJune. We are approaching the July Fourth weekend. I must say, I hear \nstaff and everybody else's sigh of relief, and I agree.\n  But as we approach the July Fourth weekend, we know the All Star \ngame, featuring the finest major league baseball players, cannot be all \nthat far behind. It looks like the All Star game will actually be \nplayed this year and the year-old dispute about player pension fund \npayments has now been resolved.\n  We should also note that this year the major league season did not \nbegin until a Federal judge granted an injunction, and the owners and \nthe players, who shut the game down last August and robbed the fans of \npennant races and the World Series, finally declared a cease-fire in \ntheir ongoing hostilities. They then had to scramble to begin a \nshortened 144-game schedule.\n  Another unfair labor practice proceeding against the owners is still \npending, although that hearing has now been postponed. I hope that this \nis a sign that the owners and the players will finally do the right \nthing, finally be responsible, finally get back to the bargaining table \nand reach a collective bargaining agreement that will remove the cloud \nthat is hanging over the rest of the season and all of major league \nbaseball.\n  I am not the only one who expresses that concern, Mr. President. Look \nat the fans. Interest in major league baseball is undeniably down. \nAttendance figures show it. They are down between 20 and 30 percent. I \nsuspect the viewership figures show it and certainly advertising and \nmerchandising revenue show it as well.\n  In fact, in another major blow to the grand old game this morning, \nboth NBC and ABC have indicated that they are not even going to bid on \nbroadcast rights for baseball in the future.\n  When I go to a baseball game this evening, I suspect for the first \ntime in years I am going to see empty seats. I think that is really \nsomething we should all be concerned about, those who love baseball.\n  Older fans have been turned off, and the younger ones have decided to \nspend their time and attention on other pursuits.\n  Of course, injuries to some of the star players have not helped. \nThose injuries are not the cause of baseball's decline, however. \nIndeed, other players and teams are having outstanding seasons and \nmajor league rosters are full of bright, young, talented players.\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\n  The problems are anger, disillusionment, and disdain. As the season \nbegan, the acting commissioner was quoted as saying: ``We knew there \nwould be some fallout. It's very tough to assess, but there is a \nresidue from the work stoppage, there's no question. There is a lot of \nanger out there.''\n  Let me tell him, there is. At our February 15 hearing on legislation \nto end baseball's antitrust exemption, I asked the acting commissioner \nhow fans get their voices heard. I will quote what I said at that time: \n``Fans are disgruntled; I mean, they are really ripped. Do they vote \nwith their feet?''\n  I asked that question of the acting commissioner at that hearing. \nUnfortunately, that was in February. The strike dragged on, fans \nsuffered through the owner's experiment with so-called replacement \nteams--and what a laugh that was--and the matter remains unsettled and \nunsettling.\n  Mr. Selig answered me last February by declaring he understood the \nfrustration fans were feeling, but he observed that when the strike \nended, there would be an enormous healing process. I told him back in \nFebruary, ``The longer you go, the harder that healing process is going \nto be.''\n  I wish I had been wrong; I believe I was right. Because it is sad \nthat for some, the wounds will not heal; for others, it will take a \nvery long time; for still others, they will never have the attachment \nto the game that begins in childhood and binds generations and nurtures \nover time.\n  I do not think that those who are the game's current caretakers \nappreciate the damage they have done. I do not believe those who are \nrunning major league baseball today, with few exceptions, realize the \nenormous damage they have done to baseball. Slick advertising and \ndiscount tickets and special giveaway nights are not going to make up \nthe difference. The last year has been disastrous. There are a lot of \npeople who are more interested in their own egos and own pocketbooks \nthan they were in the true interest of the fans.\n  What the fans are saying is, ``You took us for granted, you hurt us, \nyou insulted us, you disregarded us, you worried only about your own \negos and your own pocketbooks, so now maybe we will let you know how we \nfeel.''\n  With broadcast networks, who were partners with the baseball owners \nin the baseball network, today indicating that they will be abandoning \nthe game, fans across the country who had expected to follow their \nteams over free television will likely be forced to suffer another \nblow.\n  Nothing has been solved. The problems and differences persist, and \nthings are getting worse. There is no collective bargaining agreement \nand, as far as the public is aware, no prospects of one any time soon. \nTo borrow from an old baseball observer, ``It ain't over.''\n  Why should people return to the game or, as we are apparently viewed, \nwhy should we patronize this commercial activity if the risk remains of \nhaving affections toyed with again and having hopes of a championship \ndashed--not by a better team but by competing economic interests?\n  So I believe the time has come for the Senate to act. The Senate \nAntitrust Subcommittee has reported a bill to the Judiciary Committee. \nThis consensus bill, S. 627, is sponsored by Senators Hatch, Thurmond, \nMoynihan, Graham, and myself. It would cut back baseball's judicially \ncreated and aberrational antitrust exemption. Congress may not be able \nto solve every problem or heal baseball's self-inflicted wounds, but we \ncan do this: We can pass legislation that will declare that \nprofessional baseball can no longer operate above the law. We can say \nthe same laws that apply to every other business apply to baseball. The \nantitrust laws that apply to all other professional sports and \ncommercial activity should apply to professional baseball, as well. \nProfessional baseball has a very special exemption that no other \nbusiness got. It was given to them with the trust and expectation that \nthey would use it in the best interests of the game. They have violated \nthat trust. They have had people testify before us who were less than \ncandid with the Congress. And they turned their backs on the most \nimportant people--the hundreds of thousands, even millions, of fans \nthroughout this country.\n\n  Along with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, I recently \nreceived a report of the section on antitrust law of the American Bar \nAssociation that examines the Hatch-Thurmond-Leahy, et al., bill. The \nantitrust section of the ABA reasons that professional baseball's \nantitrust exemption is not tailored to achieve well-defined, justified \npublic goals. The antitrust section, therefore, ``supports legislative \nrepeal of the exemption of professional major league baseball from the \nFederal antitrust laws.'' Moreover, the report notes that putting \nprofessional baseball on an equal footing with other professional \nsports and business and having the antitrust laws apply ``cannot fairly \nbe criticized as `taking sides' '' in baseball's current labor-\nmanagement battle.\n  I look forward to working with our Judiciary Committee chairman to \nhave our bill, S. 627, considered by the Judiciary Committee at our \nearliest opportunity and then promptly by the Senate. It is time the \nSenate act and end this destructive aberration in our law. Then maybe \nwhen baseball is subject to the same laws as everybody else, when they \nare subject to the same laws as all other professional sports, as all \nother commercial activity, maybe they will realize that they are not \nabove the law--just as I hope they begin to realize they are not above \nthe fans' interests.\n  So, Mr. President, when I go to the baseball game this evening--\nsomething I will thoroughly enjoy doing with friends and family--I hope \nI see more people than we have seen in the past. But I also hope I see \nowners and players coming together to put the interests of baseball \nabove themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report of the ABA \nsection on antitrust law be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nReport of the Section of Antitrust Law of the American Bar Association \n  on the Proposed Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995--\n                              June 9, 1995\n\n       These views are presented on behalf of the Section of \n     Antitrust Law of the American Bar Association. They have not \n     been approved by the Board of Governors or House of Delegates \n     of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not \n     be construed as representing the position of the Association.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       On March 27, 1995, Senators Hatch, Thurmond, Moynihan, \n     Leahy and Graham introduced the Major League Baseball \n     Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 (the ``Baseball Antitrust \n     Act'').\\1\\\n       The bill would amend the Clayton Act \\2\\ to subject the \n     business of professional major league baseball to the federal \n     antitrust laws.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The Senate is considering legislation to reverse major \n     league professional baseball's judicial exemption from the \n     antitrust laws. The exemption dates to a 1922 Supreme Court \n     decision that the business of major league professional \n     baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce.\n       Supreme Court decisions affirming the baseball exemption on \n     the grounds of stare decisis in 1953 and 1972 indicate that \n     judicial reversal of the exemption is highly unlikely. These \n     decisions cite repeated Congressional consideration and \n     inaction in support of the conclusion that it is up to \n     Congress to repeal the exemption.\n       The American Bar Association disfavors any exemptions that \n     are not narrowly tailored to achieve well-defined goals. The \n     baseball exemption, rooted in a limited, long-since-\n     abandoned, view of interstate commerce, does not meet this \n     test. Accordingly, the Section of Antitrust Law of the \n     American Bar Association (the ``Section'' or the ``Antitrust \n     Section'') supports legislative repeal of the exemption of \n     professional major league baseball from the federal antitrust \n     laws.\n       Repeal of the baseball exemption can and should permit \n     uniform development of antitrust law in the sports industry. \n     The Supreme Court has ruled that other sports businesses are \n     subject to the federal antitrust laws, giving rise to a \n     substantial body of sports-related antitrust law, notably in \n     connection with football and basketball. The very interest in \n     uniform application and development of antitrust law that \n     prompts support for repeal of baseball's anomalous exemption \n     demands that Congressional consideration of any such \n     provision be industry-wide rather than baseball-specific.\n\n\n                               discussion\n\n       In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that the business of \n     professional baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce, \n     and, consequently, was exempt from antitrust scrutiny.\\3\\ \n     Both professional baseball and judicial interpretation of the \n     commerce clause subsequently evolved. In 1953, the Court \n     upheld\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\n     the exemption in a per curiam opinion.\\4\\ By 1972, the Court, \n     acknowledging that professional baseball was in fact a \n     business engaged in interstate commerce,\\5\\ refused to \n     overturn the exemption on the ground that Congressional \n     failure to reverse it was tantamount to endorsement.\\6\\\n       The Court's adherence to precedent, in 1953 as well as \n     1972, was based on Congress' positive record of inaction. \n     Removal of professional baseball's antitrust exemption has \n     been the subject of various unsuccessful legislative efforts. \n     At least one such effort, in the early 1950's, was abandoned \n     in the belief that the Supreme Court would reverse its \n     earlier position with respect to baseball.\\7\\ In baseball \n     terms, the Supreme Court and Congress have been pointing to \n     one another and shouting, ``Yours'' for decades.\\8\\\n       It has long been the position of the American Bar \n     Association that any exceptions to antitrust regulation \n     should be narrow and focused to achieve well-defined \n     goals.\\9\\ Professional baseball's exemption is neither. \n     Accordingly, we recommend that major league baseball should \n     be made subject to the same antitrust laws generally \n     applicable to all other American businesses in general and \n     sports businesses in particular.\\10\\ To that end, we support \n     the bill, S. 627, proposed by Senators Hatch, Thurmond, \n     Leahy, Moynihan and Graham, to the extent that each reverses \n     baseball's anomalous antitrust exemption and places \n     professional baseball on the same footing as other \n     professional sports.\n       The courts have readily acknowledged, and the Section \n     agrees, that a certain level of cooperation among franchises \n     is essential to the business of baseball and that this is an \n     important difference from most other businesses. Although, \n     for example, the Dodgers and Giants may want to dominate one \n     another on the field, they do not want their rivals to go out \n     of business. There is little dispute that sports businesses \n     can agree on many matters, such as scheduling and rules of \n     play, essential to the joint enterprise.\\11\\\n       Accordingly, baseball owners may persuasively argue that \n     they may lawfully enter into agreements as joint venturers \n     that owners of other business could not. However, much the \n     same can be said of other American sports businesses. While \n     baseball owners particularly emphasize franchise relocation \n     issues and their commitment to the minor leagues in support \n     of the exemption, all professional sports leagues face \n     franchise relocation issues and at least one, professional \n     hockey, supports a minor league player development structure. \n     With parity in circumstances should come parity in treatment \n     under the law.\n       Arguments as to the alleged necessity of various trade \n     restraints can and should be made in court. Like professional \n     baseball and commerce clause interpretation, antitrust law \n     has also evolved since 1922. The ``rule of reason'' standard \n     of review, which has largely supplanted the labeling of \n     various acts as per se antitrust violations, and which is \n     routinely applied to antitrust cases involving sports,\\12\\ \n     will afford baseball ample opportunity to demonstrate that \n     specific cooperative activities among its franchises do not \n     unreasonably restrain competition. Any truly pro-competitive \n     conduct should be adequately protected by proper application \n     of the rule of reason. The existing baseball exemption is not \n     based on any determination to the contrary; indeed, because \n     of the exemption, there is essentially no judicial history \n     upon which to base a contention that the rule of reason \n     cannot be properly applied to professional baseball. Nor do \n     fact-specific applications of the rule of reason in cases \n     involving other sports support such a contention.\n       In addition, professional baseball cannot and should not be \n     prevented from seeking explicit Congressional authority for \n     internal governance of, for example, minor league player \n     development or the location of major league franchises.\\13\\ \n     The antitrust laws sanction legitimate efforts to petition \n     the government for legislative action. While we take no \n     position at this time on the need for any particular grant of \n     such authority, we note that the current judicial exemption \n     immunizes professional baseball from antitrust scrutiny \n     without the factual predicate necessary for Congress to make \n     an informed determination. Continuation of this exemption is \n     therefore inconsistent with the goal of narrow, focused \n     exceptions to antitrust principles and the status of the \n     other major sports businesses that do not enjoy exemptions.\n       The proposed legislation would permit judicial \n     determination of the proper application to baseball of the \n     labor and antitrust laws. The non-statutory labor exemption, \n     and the statutory labor exemption, embody the delicate and \n     sometimes elusive balance between the oft-conflicting goals \n     of antitrust law and labor law. Properly striking this \n     balance is no small task, particularly in the context of \n     professional sports. The contours of this body of law have \n     been shaped by decisions rendered over more than half a \n     century.\\14\\ The judicial process of resolving the proper \n     application of the non-statutory exemption to professional \n     sports is well under way,\\15\\ and the proposed legislation \n     will further this process.\n       We neither endorse nor reject the major league player \n     associations' argument that were professional baseball \n     subject to antitrust laws, the non-statutory labor exemption \n     would not exempt from antitrust scrutiny the owner's \n     unilateral imposition of a salary cap.\\16\\ Such an argument \n     should be made in court, so that it may be resolved in \n     harmony with analogous cases. Similarly, the courts are also \n     the proper forum for resolution of any dispute over whether \n     and to what extent labor markets are a proper subject of \n     antitrust regulation.\n       Putting professional baseball on an equal footing with \n     other professional sports cannot fairly be criticized as \n     ``taking sides'' in favor of players in baseball's current \n     labor strife. Representatives of the baseball owners have \n     repeatedly argued that baseball's current exemption is \n     irrelevant to its bargaining relationship with major league \n     players because the owners' conduct is protected by the labor \n     laws and the non-statutory labor exemption.\\17\\ Repeal of the \n     exemption will afford the owners the opportunity to prove \n     this contention. Freeing them from the responsibility to do \n     so, by Congressional inaction, would be ``taking sides'' in \n     favor of the owners.\n       We look forward to working with the members of the \n     Judiciary Committee on legislation to reverse major league \n     baseball's exemption from the antitrust laws.\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ A copy of the proposed legislation, S. 627, is appended \n     hereto.

Mr. President, this Congress and the American people are \nnow engaged in a historic debate about welfare. I would like to talk \nthis afternoon about the people we need to focus on in that debate.\n  Mr. President, when I was in Youngstown, OH, a couple of months ago, \nI visited a church that ran a program for what is termed ``at-risk \nyouth.'' The kids that I saw that evening were seated in a circle \ntalking about their lives, talking about their problems. One of the \nteenagers was asked this question: ``Why do you get up in the \nmorning?'' That is a simple question. This young man responded: \n``Because I don't want to be dead.''\n  Mr. President, people that were there that evening thought he might \nhave missed the meaning of the question and misunderstood it. So they \nasked him his goals for the rest of the day. He said, again, that he \ndid not want to die.\n  That was his objective for an average day.\n  Mr. President, that teenager, that young man, is growing up in a \ndifferent country from most of the rest of us--a country most of us \nwould have a very difficult time recognizing.\n  Now, the sociologists call that teenager at risk. That is kind of a \nstrange term. As parents, we know that, in a sense, all children are at \nrisk at all times. But these children are at risk in a different sense, \nin a different way. They are in grave danger of living very sad, very \nunhappy, very tragic lives.\n  By the term ``at-risk,'' we mean children who are not learning the \nskills they need to really participate at all in society; children who \nare more than a grade behind in school; children who drop out; children \nwho are abused, assaulted and live in constant danger of violent crime; \nchildren who are homeless or who run away from home. By at-risk, we \nmean children who are having children, children who are juvenile \noffenders themselves, already experiencing the justice system because \nof the crimes that they have committed.\n  By at-risk, we mean children who live in neighborhoods where work is \nmore the exception than the rule, children who do not have any \nresponsible adults playing a meaningful role in their lives--no role \nmodels, no one to look up to, no one to trust.\n  These young people are growing up so far outside the mainstream that \nthey are going to have really very little chance of ever joining what \nyou and I know as the American community.\n  They will certainly have very little chance to ever participate in \nthe American dream.\n  Mr. President, these young people do not share in the values of \nAmerica. It is not so much that they reject our values. It is not that \nthey are protesting against our values. Rather, they never learned \nthese values to begin with. This group of young people is, \nunfortunately, tragically, growing.\n  Since 1965, the juvenile arrest rate for violent crime has tripled. \nChildren are the fastest growing segment of the criminal population.\n  Mr. President, since 1975, homelessness has been on the rise, and it \nhas increased faster among families with children than among any other \ngroup. Every year, nearly one million young people between the age of \n12 and 19 are themselves victims of violent crime.\n  Mr. President, too many young people are not getting the education \nthey need either. Since 1960, we have spent 200 percent more on public \nschools, in real dollars. But the quality of education is not \nimproving. A 1988 study found that of all the nations tested, the \nUnited States finished dead last in science.\n  In my home State, the State of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Education \nsays that they really do not have complete statistics on graduation. \nBut the statistics they do have suggest that of the children who enter \nOhio high schools, only 75 percent graduate 4 years later. But that \nstatistic really sugarcoats the much more dismal reality in many of our \ncities. In Youngstown, OH, for example, the reported figure is that \nonly 46 percent graduate after 4 years; in Columbus, only 44 percent; \nand in Toledo, only 37 percent. I suspect that these figures would not \nbe different in any major city in this country today.\n  Mr. President, these children are really not being educated. We all \nknow what not educating a young person leads to. According to the \neducational testing service, half of the heads of households on welfare \nare dropouts. That should not be a surprise. The Ohio Department of \nRehabilitation and Corrections--our State prison system--reports that \nat least 25 percent of the inmates in Ohio prisons are dropouts.\n  I would say, Mr. President, based on my own experience as Lieutenant \nGovernor in Ohio and being in charge of our prison system and working \nwith the Governor in this area, that figure is probably a lot higher \nthan that.\n  Mr. President, these young people are falling behind every day. They \nare falling behind too far and too fast. Almost 5 million children are \ngrowing up in neighborhoods where the majority of men are unemployed \nfor most of the year.\n  And certainly too many children are having children. Since 1960, the \nrate of unmarried teenagers having children has increased almost 200 \npercent.\n  Since 1960, the percentage of families headed by single parents has \nalso tripled. You hear a lot, of course, about single-parent families. \nBut I feel that too many people really are missing the point. They are \nmissing the point about why this is really an important issue and what \nall of the ramifications really are.\n  Let me point out for the Senate, Mr. President, one reason why that \nstatistic, that figure, is so very important. It is important because \nchildren growing up in single-parent families are poorer than children, \non the average, who live with two parents.\n  Children who do not have fathers around are five times more likely to \nbe poor. They are also 10 times more likely to be extremely poor, to \nlive in the kind of grinding poverty which is very hard to escape.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to escape this poverty because it is more \nthan economic poverty. It is a poverty, really, of the spirit, the \npoverty especially of young men who are growing up with no role models.\n  It is a basic fact of human existence that when boys grow up without \nfathers, they become men without knowing what mature manhood really is \nsupposed to be. That is really what fatherhood is all about, giving \nyoung people an adult male, a role model, to learn from. Young people \nneed to have strong adult role models around if they are going to break \nout of the cycle of dysfunctional behavior.\n  All the social pathologies I talk about in this speech really \nreinforce each other. Only the involvement of strong, caring adults in \nchildren's lives can ever truly break this vicious cycle.\n  Consider another fact: 54 percent of all females who drop out of \nschool are either pregnant at the time or already have children. Mr. \nPresident, the early, decisive intervention of a strong adult role \nmodel can certainly prevent a lot of problems. The young people I am \ntalking about many times lack fathers. They lack role models, they lack \neducation, they lack hope. That is why America today is losing these \nyoung people.\n  The class of young people I am talking about who are seriously at \nrisk is growing, and it is heading toward an explosion, right in the \nmiddle of what is and what should remain the richest, greatest, the \nmost powerful country in the world.\n  Mr. President, that is simply wrong. We, as a society, cannot afford \nto lose more and more young people to social trends that hurt people \nand destroy lives. We simply cannot let this problem continue to grow. \nWe have to do\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\neverything we can to roll back that tide of what really is a social \ncollapse.\n  Now, this is not going to be an easy tack. It will be an extremely \ndifficult task. It will take a lot more than Government programs to get \nAmerica through what amounts to a full-scale social crisis. We need \nchurches, businesses, labor groups, and, indeed, all of American \nsociety to reach out to these young people in a way that is truly \neffective.\n  This past Wednesday, the Labor and Human Resources Committee reported \nout the Work Force Development Act. This is, of course, the Senate's \njob training bill. Mr. President, as we shift responsibility for job \ntraining to the States, because I think we should, there will be a \ntemptation to focus the job training effort to a relatively--I say \n``relatively''--easier task, like assisting the skilled and educated \nworkers who are temporarily out of work. They certainly need help.\n  I think that our Nation must have a different primary focus. I \nbelieve we must target America's No. 1 problem and tackle it head on. \nThere are millions of young people in this country who are growing up \nin an environment that really all but guarantees their failure. If our \njob training legislation does not make a difference in the lives of \nthese young people, we will be sacrificing not just an entire \ngeneration, but because these kids are having kids, we will be \nsacrificing the generation to follow.\n  We will sacrifice more than that, really, because this is an issue \nnot just about these children's future, it is about who we are as a \npeople. These young people are really not strangers among us. They are \nus. We will not be able to rest until we have brought the young people \nback into the American mainstream--a mainstream of work, a mainstream \nof responsibility, and a mainstream of opportunity.\n  That is why, Mr. President, during Wednesday's hearing, I proposed an \namendment that would establish, as part of the Senate job training \nblock grant, a $2.1 billion fund for programs to help these threatened \nyoung people.\n  My amendment passed the committee by a vote of 12 to 4. I believe \nthat our committee's intent could really not be more clear. We must \nhave a national focus on at-risk youth.\n  Mr. President, I held a job training field hearing in Ohio a few \nweeks ago. I heard from people on the front lines, the people who get \nup every morning and try to make a difference by helping train some of \nthese young people. I also heard at that hearing from some of these \nyoung people themselves. It is pretty clear from what we heard that \ntheir needs are not being met by our current system.\n  In fact, State job training programs many times simply do not focus \non this very difficult but crucial task. If we, as Americans, want to \ndo something about this problem, I believe that we have to have a \nnational commitment.\n  Now, it remains as true as ever that Federal mandates are not--let me \nrepeat, are not--an effective way to tackle social problems. That is \nwhy it is essential we not try to prescribe particular solutions from \nWashington, DC. We do not need more micromanagement out of this \nCapitol.\n  However, I do believe what we should do is make a national commitment \nto target this at-risk youth population. At the same time we make this \nnational commitment, we must match that national commitment and a \nnational setting of priorities with a commitment to give the States the \nmaximum amount of flexibility to design their own programs to target \nthis group of our young people.\n  Mr. President, the history of the last 30 years proves that the \nFederal Government does not have the answers. We have to give the \nStates the funding and the flexibility they need to design and support \nprograms that will, in fact, work.\n  I also believe we must, as a nation, as a people, say that the saving \nof this group of young people is, in fact, a national priority. Even \nnow, as we speak today, a number of communities are pointing the way to \npossible solutions. They are doing it with programs that may be \npartially federally funded, may not be federally funded at all, may \nhave some State money in them, or some of the programs I have seen have \nno government money. A number of the communities I have visited are \nreally leading and pointing the way.\n  The Youngstown church, for example, which I mentioned earlier at the \nbeginning of my remarks, is a place where kids can go between the end \nof school, when they get out of school, and bedtime. It is a place \nwhere they have things to do and a place where they are safe.\n  Being safe from physical violence is a good start. In Cleveland, OH, \nCharles Ballard started a program 13 years ago that helped teach these \nyoung people how to be fathers. His organization, the Institute for \nResponsible Fatherhood, is making a big difference; 2,700 men have \nparticipated so far, and 97 percent of the program's graduates are, in \nfact, supporting their own children.\n  Last week, Mr. Ballard announced he will be expanding his program to \nfive new cities. I had the opportunity to see him last week when he \nstopped by my office here in Washington.\n  In San Jose, CA, there is a project called CET that provides 3 to 6 \nmonths of vocational training to disadvantaged young people and adults. \nA study of this local San Jose program indicates that the young people \nwho participate in it end up doing substantially better many years into \nthe future. Their annual earnings increase by more than $3,000 a year. \nThat is one of the best results ever achieved by such a youth training \nprogram.\n  Their success in San Jose is really because the program is tied \nclosely--very closely, intimately--to the local labor market. The CET \nprogram's staff keeps in close touch with local employers so they know \nwhat jobs really exist in the community, so that they are training \npeople for jobs that really exist. CET emphasizes practical job \ntraining over more rigid, classroom-focused instruction.\n  Mr. President, Cleveland, OH, has a program called Cleveland Works. \nThis program provides training, day care, and health care for welfare \nrecipients. Each welfare recipient receives some 400 or 500 hours of \ntraining, and then gets placed with one of the 630 employers who \nparticipate in that area in the program. These workers get full-time \nwages and health care benefits for themselves and for their families. \nCleveland Works has tracked all of its clients over the last 9 years \nand about 80 percent of them --80 percent--never go back on welfare.\n\n  Cleveland Works breaks down the barrier between the two cultures of \nwork and welfare. It can be done. Cleveland Works is a success story \nthat is already being replicated by dedicated people in six other \nAmerican cities.\n  At the other end of the State is Cincinnati. In Cincinnati's Over-\nthe-Rhine district there is a program called Jobs Plus, which I \npersonally visited, which gives intensive training and counseling to \nat-risk individuals. All Jobs Plus clients are enrolled in a 90-day \nprogram, a crash course in the values and skills that are required in \nthe working world. But the Jobs Plus program does not stop when the \nclient gets a job. The client is then encouraged to join the Jobs Plus \nClub, to get moral support for what can be a very tough transition to a \nlife of work and responsibility.\n  Should we mandate any of these programs nationally? No. I do not \nthink so. But they look like good programs, and I think it would be \nwise for local communities across the country who are concerned about \ntheir at-risk youth to consider programs such as these.\n  The bottom line is that we have to keep on looking for the answers. \nThere is no one right answer. We have to keep the focus on this \nproblem. We have to keep the focus on this challenge. We have to do \nthat. We have to keep reminding ourselves about the problem because \nthere is simply too much of an incentive for us to forget these kids. \nThere is a wall between these children and the rest of America, a wall \nevery bit as real as if it were the stone wall of a prison or a \njailhouse. We need to bring that wall down.\n  That is why, as we discuss the job training legislation and the \nwelfare reform bill that will certainly follow, we must not lose sight \nof these particular children who have simply been forgotten for too \nlong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio for \nhis\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\nvery thoughtful and indepth statement on the job training programs and \nhow they should be adjusted to better deal with the issue of actually \ntraining people versus just creating bureaucracy. I think his proposals \nare excellent and I hope this Senate will take heed of what he has said \nand follow them closely. As a member of the Labor Committee, I have \ncertainly tried to do that relative to his recommendations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S8994-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8996-S8997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BUDGET CONFERENCE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit here today, \nhowever, about the budget conference agreement which has just been \nreached, because I do think there has been some information presented \nin the community at large that is inaccurate and misleading. This \nbudget conference, which I had the opportunity to serve on, has reached \nagreement between the House and the Senate as announced last night by \nLeader Dole and Speaker Gingrich. It is a very positive event for \nAmerica. It is the first balanced budget in 25 years, something we are \nin dire need of if we are as a nation to put our fiscal house in order \nand to pass on to our children a country which is prosperous rather \nthan a country which is bankrupt.\n  Those of us who have been working hard in the effort of trying to \nbring fiscal responsibility to this Government, to make sure we have a \nnation that does not continually spend away the legacy of our children, \nare proud that we have been successful in developing this budget. I \nthink there are some points about the balanced budget that need to be \nnoted. As we go into the debate next week, I am sure there will be a \nlot of discussion and a lot of hyperbole. But I hope we begin from a \nbasis of fact.\n  Some of the facts that are important are these. First, if we continue \non our present course of spending, the Medicare trustees have told us--\nand four of the Medicare trustees happen to be members of the \nadministration, including the Secretary of HHS and the Secretary of the \nTreasury--have told us that the Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt in \nthe year 2002. Under the law, once the Medicare trust fund goes \nbankrupt it cannot spend any money. There will, therefore, be no health \ninsurance program for our seniors. This needs to be addressed. The \nconference agreement which we have reached addresses that issue and \nreverses that insolvency situation.\n  Second, we know that if the Federal Government continues to spend in \nthe pattern which is presented in the original budget of the President \nand in the President's budget as recalculated, the President's most \nrecent budget as recalculated by CBO, that we would add over $1 \ntrillion of new debt to our children's shoulders over the next 7 years. \nThat would be a burden that would be unfair to load on them and which \nwe cannot afford to do. I am glad to report that this budget conference \ndoes not do that.\n  This conference leads us to a balanced budget and, as a result of \nleading us to a balanced budget, it takes out of the debt stream almost \n$1 trillion. That is debt our children will not have to pay. That is \ninterest on that debt that we and our children will not have to pay. \nThat is very important.\n  Of course there are a lot of side effects that are very positive to \nreaching a balanced budget and to passing this resolution. They include \nthe fact that for the first time in 25 years, the world community will \nbe able to look at this country and say we have our fiscal house in \norder. As a result, interest rates will come down for Americans and \nthat will benefit us as a Government, but more important, it will \nbenefit our citizens for, in borrowing to buy a home or improve on \ntheir home or to buy a car or to educate themselves or their children, \nthey will pay significantly less because interest rates will have come \ndown as a result of us passing this conference report, which is a \nbalanced budget. So that is some of the good news that comes from this \nproposal.\n  I heard reported on the news--and this is what I wanted to \nspecifically address this morning--as I was coming in, by a national \norganization funded by the Federal Government, that this budget \nproposal cuts Medicare by $270 billion and increases defense spending \nby $33 billion. If you wish to compare apples to oranges, and you wish \nto take great leave with the English language, maybe you could say \nsomething like that. But if you wish to be at all accurate or fair, you \nwould have trouble defending that statement.\n  The fact is, Medicare spending goes up significantly under this \nbudget. Under the present projected spending patterns, Medicare will \nincrease at 10 percent annually for as far as the eye could see. We \ncannot afford that rate of growth. That is three times the rate of \ninflation. It happens to be 10 times the rate of inflation in the \nprivate sector's premium costs on health care. And if it continued to \ngrow at that rate, as I mentioned earlier, the trustees of the Medicare \ntrust fund have told us that the Medicare system would go bankrupt.\n  But there is no proposal to cut Medicare. There is no proposal at all \nto cut Medicare. There is a proposal to slow that rate of growth, to \nslow that rate of growth to 6.4 percent, which happens to be twice the \nrate of inflation. What does that mean in real dollars? It means over \nthe next 7 years we will be adding in spending to Medicare, $349 \nbillion over what would be a freeze baseline. In other words, if you \nfroze spending today, you would pull that straight line out, and this \nis what we spend on Medicare today. How much will we spend over the \nnext 7 years? We will be increasing spending by $349 billion. In fact, \nover the next 7 years, we will spend more on Medicare than was spent \nover the last 7 years. What will the average recipient see as a result \nof this increased spending? They will see that instead of getting \n$4,300 today in benefit support payments, they will be getting $6,300 \nby the year 2000. And in the year 2002 alone, the increase in Medicare \nspending will be $96 billion.\n\n  How some national news media say we are cutting Medicare is beyond \nme, but they say it. Unfortunately, they are supported in that frame of \nreference by folks who are activists here in Washington. But it is \ninaccurate. It is inappropriate.\n  What we are doing in this proposal is proposing to slow the rate of \ngrowth in Medicare. That is accurate. We are proposing it because, if \nwe do not do that, the Medicare trustees have told us that the system \nwill go bankrupt. The way we are proposing to slow that rate of growth \nis, I think, constructive. We are going to say to senior citizens in \nthis country, you can have more choices for health care. Instead of \nusing fee-for-service, which is the most expensive system, we are going \nto give you the choice of also using fixed-cost health care such as \nHMO's, PPO's, things like that. It will allow you to purchase a health \ncare system at the beginning of the year for a fixed cost and get all \nof the health care provided to you by one group. It will not say that \nyou have to do that. You can still stay with fee-for-service, if you \nwant. But if you decide to go to an HMO, we will encourage you to do \nthat. As a result, we will slow the rate of growth.\n  There will also be some other action taken but it will be directed at \nmaking the system more efficient, more cost responsive, and continue to \ndeliver first-class quality care. But under no circumstances will there \nbe any cut in Medicare.\n  The same is true of Medicaid. There is no proposal to cut Medicaid. \nYet, if we are to listen to some of the media descriptions of this \nbudget conference, you would assume there was, because they say there \nis. Actually, Medicaid spending will go up $149 billion over the next 7 \nyears. Yes, we are going to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid \nspending again. We have to. Otherwise, we end up bankrupting our \nchildren's future. But there is no proposal here to cut it; it is to \nslow the rate of growth. And we will continue to deliver first-class \nservice and, in fact, I think we will end up with better services \nbecause hopefully we will send these dollars back to the States with \nfewer strings attached. As a result of doing that, I am sure the State \ngovernments--as the Presiding Officer, who was Lieutenant Governor from \nthe great State of Ohio, knows--will deliver those services much more \nefficiently and better once they are freed from this huge bureaucracy \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\nthe Federal Government. More people get more dollars in support of \ntheir needs, rather than more bureaucrats getting more dollars in \nsupport of their needs.\n  So the statement that we are cutting Medicare is inaccurate on its \nface. We are increasing Medicare spending by almost $349 billion over \nwhat would be a freeze level of 6.4 percent annually, a huge increase. \nProbably most healthy, it will still be the fastest growing function of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Yet, if you were to listen to this news report, you would presume \nthat we were slashing Medicare in order to increase defense. Well, \nMedicare will be the largest and fastest growing function of the \nFederal Government as result of this conference report.\n  And what will happen to defense? It goes down. It does not go up, it \ngoes down. The representation that we are increasing defense spending \nis once again on its face wrong. If you were to take today's defense \nnumber and freeze it for 7 years, of that number defense spending will \ngo down by $15 billion over next 7 years. Essentially, it is flat \nfunding. That would be the best way to describe it. But in real terms, \nit goes down $15 billion.\n  So the Defense Department accounts go down, and the Medicare accounts \ngo up dramatically, which is the policy that is correct, by the way. \nThat is exactly what we should be doing. We should be trying to get the \nMedicare system into a position where we can afford it, and into a \nposition where the trust fund will be solvent. We must face the fact \nthat we are going to have to downsize the military in the face of the \npost-cold-war period, and as a result of downsizing the military, less \nmilitary spending will occur.\n  This is what this conference accomplishes. Overall, what the \nconference accomplishes is something that no other Congress has been \nable to do for 25 years. It balances the Federal budget. It slows the \nrate of growth of the Federal Government. It does not actually cut \nspending over that period, overall Federal outlays. In fact, overall \nFederal outlays will go from $l.5 trillion in 1995 up to $1.875 \ntrillion in the year 2002. There will be an annual rate of growth of \nthe Federal Government of 3 percent. But, as I stated earlier, in \ngetting to a balanced budget, it eliminates almost $1 trillion of what \nwould have been deficit spending had we stayed on the glidepath \npresented by the President. Well, there was no glidepath presented by \nthe President. It was sort of a take-off path by the President in the \ndeficit area; or if we just let things be as they are.\n  The reason we have done this is very simple. If we continue to run \nthese deficits, if we do not address this issue now, as I said earlier, \nwe will pass on to our children a nation which is bankrupt. That is not \nfair, and it is not right. It has been said many times on this floor by \nmany members of our party that our reason, our purpose, in seeking this \nposition here in the Senate is to put the fiscal house of the Federal \nGovernment in order--to downsize the Federal Government, and to return \nauthority and the dollars to the States. This budget is the first step \nin accomplishing that goal.\n  I certainly congratulate Senator Domenici, who is the driving force \nbehind developing this budget on the Senate side; Chairman Kasich, on \nthe House side; and, obviously, Speaker Gingrich and Leader Dole, for \nhaving the foresight, the vision, and the courage to put together this \nmost extraordinary budget which will pass to our children a very \ncritical gift, which is the gift of a Government that is fiscally \nsound.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S8996-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1854.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the 1995 \nCommunity Protection Initiative Act, a bill\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nto aid in the fight against crime in America. This bill exempts \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers from state laws \nprohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. The effect is to \nincrease law enforcement potential by making thousands of highly \ntrained law enforcement personnel available to deter crime in emergency \nsituations, all at no additional cost to the taxpayer. We will strike a \nstrong blow for crime prevention without further burdening the Federal \nbudget.\n  Further, this bill eliminates jurisdictional limitations and provides \na clear and uniform rule to replace a complex variety of State and \nlocal laws. In an increasingly mobile society, it is important to \neliminate confusion and provide these public servants the opportunity \nto react in a way that protects potential victims of crime throughout \nthe country.\n  This is a commonsense and cost-effective step in the direction of \ncrime control. To do otherwise would be similar to preventing someone \ntrained in CPR from assisting a dying person merely because he or she \nwas licensed in another jurisdiction. Law enforcement personnel are \ntrained to think in a manner that protects lives. We need to allow them \nto act in the same manner by lifting current regulatory burdens.\n  This bill takes the precautions necessary to ensure that former and \nretired law enforcement officers have been properly trained in the use \nof firearms, have proper identification, and were in good standing \nduring their prior employment. Moreover, the bill allows them to \nprotect themselves, their families, and other citizens in need of \nassistance.\n  I look forward to enactment of this legislation. I also look forward \nto working with Representative Cunningham from California, who has \nintroduced a similar measure in the House of Representatives.

A bill to amend the Medicare Program under title XVIII of the \nSocial Security Act to improve rural health services, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE RURAL HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senator \nGrassley and Senator Rockefeller, the Rural Health Care Improvement Act \nof 1995.\n  They say that if you have your health, you have everything. Well, I \nmust say that for the small communities all across Montana and America, \naccess to health care is in danger. It is very tough to get good health \ncare in rural parts of our country. What with cuts in Medicare \nreimbursement, 10 percent of the America's rural hospitals closed in \nthe last decade. Ten percent of our rural hospitals have closed. The \ntrend, unfortunately, shows no signs of improving.\n  And the rural health care crisis goes beyond access. That is because \ninsurance policies are going up faster for the people who can least \nafford to pay--that is self-insured people like farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall business owners all across our country.\n  Rural areas also find it harder than cities and suburbs to attract \ndoctors, to attract nurses, to attract people to provide health care. \nAnd health care providers in rural areas have less access to state-of-\nthe-art medical technology than their colleagues do in the big cities \nand in the suburbs.\n  Yet, the Federal Government's usual approach to rural health care \nissues is one of indifference. No top-level official has the task of \nkeeping rural health care firmly in line.\n  Renewing the tax credit for self-insured people was just a start. We \nneed to preserve health care services in small towns. Rural doctors and \nnurses must be able to use the best available technology. And the \nGovernment must give permanent, top-level attention to rural health \ncare issues.\n  That is the comprehensive strategy that this bill provides.\n  Let me review it in just brief detail.\n  First, keeping hospitals and clinics in small rural towns open. It is \ncritical that these clinics stay open.\n  Our small rural hospitals have suffered for years with rigid and \nexpensive Medicare regulations and Medicare reimbursements too low to \nlet them stay open. So a few years ago I helped pass a bill giving some \nrural hospitals greater flexibility and Medicare reimbursements high \nenough to stay open.\n  This project is called the Medical Assistance Facility, otherwise \nknown as MAF. They operate in Culbertson, Jordan, Circle, Terry, and \nEkalaka, serving over 20,000 people.\n  That might not sound like very many people when you add the towns \ntogether, but let me tell you, when you are a town like Circle or \nEkalaka, hundreds of miles away from the best of health care service in \nthe world, these small clinics make a big, big difference. They are \nvery important to them. The MAF maintains access to basic, acute, and \nemergency care services and provides inpatient care for up to 4 days. \nThey have received glowing reviews from health experts, and other \nStates have called in to ask how they can set up similar facilities.\n  But most important, people in these towns believe it is \nirreplaceable. Walter Busch, the administrator of Roosevelt Medical \nCenter in Culbertson, had this to say:\n\n       The medical assistance facility has improved access to \n     quality health care services\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\n     in a cost-effective manner. It has restored health care \n     services to four remote, rural communities and prevented loss \n     of services in two others. It is a very flexible program and \n     yet one that has provided consistently high quality care.\n\n  Let me underline that point, Mr. President. Without MAF's, medical \nassistance facilities, or similar clinics, many small towns would have \nvirtually no health care service. The MAF preserves health services and \nit saves money. A new GAO report will show that the MAF saved over \n$60,000 per 172 patients. So especially when the leadership's proposed \nMedicare and Medicaid cuts will so drastically increase the pressure on \nrural hospitals, we must keep them open. Our legislation makes the MAF \npermanent and allows similar facilities to open up all over rural \nAmerica.\n  The second section offers grants for what is called telemedicine. \nThese grants will let rural doctors and nurses upgrade their \ntelecommunications and use modern computer networks to confer with \nspecialists in other parts of our country. So a family practitioner, \nfor example, with a tough case in Fergus County or on the Hi-line can \nhave access to diagnostic files and also access to techniques at the \nNational Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control.\n  Just think of it. With the computer, a doctor or a nurse in a very \nsmall town in a small clinic can have access to files and techniques of \nthe very best all around the Nation. They might not be able to use all \nthe techniques, but at least he or she knows what is available and has \na lot better access, a lot better information and can give better \ntreatment for that patient.\n  We also include another program of grants to encourage networking \namong rural health care providers. This would let them share \ninformation on equipment and also, again, share techniques specifically \ndesigned for rural areas and also help allow much more cooperation and \nalso more effective cooperation than exists today.\n  Third and last is a new permanent position of Assistant Secretary for \nRural Health at the Department of Health and Human Services in \nWashington, DC. My State of Montana and a lot of States need more \nadvocates within the Federal Government. People living in very rural, \nisolated areas need better advocates and more advocates in the Federal \nGovernment, more people who understand our unique problems and will \npush for solutions because, after all, there are a lot more people in \nthe cities who push for city solutions. We need some way to kind of \ncounterbalance, Mr. President, the advantage that the city folks have \nso that people in rural areas at least have someone to stand up for \nthem and argue their case so that problems are not further exacerbated \nbecause they do not have someone.\n  So when this bill passes, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, with its hundreds of thousands of employees, will have a top-\nlevel official whose job it is to remember small towns like Culbertson, \nMT.\n  This will put a higher priority on rural health care and make sure \nthat we have someone in the room when final decisions are made, for \nexample, on Medicare or Medicaid and other health care programs.\n  Mr. President, rural America deserves fairness just like urban, big \ncity America needs fairness. We in rural America deserve the same \naccess to top-quality doctors and nurses, to new medical technologies \nand to basic health care just as everybody else does in America. And \nthrough this bill, without much expense, rural America can get \nfairness. It is just that simple.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to include a copy of the bill \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Health Improvement Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICARE RURAL HOSPITAL FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (A) One-quarter of the United States population, or about \n     65 million persons, reside in rural areas. Rural areas have a \n     larger proportion of elderly residents. Rural populations \n     have a higher infant mortality rate, and a 40 percent higher \n     rate of death from accidents.\n       (B) Rural hospitals are forced to comply with burdensome \n     and inflexible medicare requirements that do not fit the \n     realities of the rural environment.\n       (C) Rural hospitals are inadequately reimbursed by the \n     medicare program.\n       (D) Inadequate medicare reimbursement and burdensome and \n     inflexible requirements contribute to the high closure rate \n     among rural hospitals, resulting in reduced access to primary \n     care and emergency services for millions of rural residents.\n       (E) Medical assistance facilities have been operating in \n     Montana since 1990 and rural primary care hospitals have been \n     operating since 1993. Both programs help rural hospitals \n     adapt to the changing health care needs of the local \n     community.\n       (F) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services has found that medical assistance facilities--\n       (i) provide access to health care in remote rural areas; \n     and\n       (ii) are cost efficient.\n       (G) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services found that flexible medicare requirements are \n     key to the success of medical assistance facilities.\n       (H) Twenty-one states applied to the Essential Access \n     Hospital (EACH) program authorized in the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1989. Seven states, West Virginia, \n     California, Colorado, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, and \n     South Dakota were awarded grants. Eleven hospitals have been \n     designated rural primary care hospitals since final Federal \n     regulations became effective in 1993.\n       (I) Medical assistance facilities and rural primary care \n     hospitals promote the development of rural health care \n     networks and result in increased access for rural residents \n     to a variety of health care services.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish \n     the medicare rural hospital flexibility program and to allow \n     all States to develop critical access hospitals.\n       (b) Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program.--Section \n     1820 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i-4) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n\n             ``medicare rural hospital flexibility program\n\n       ``Sec. 1820.

A bill to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of \n1965 with respect to fees for admission into units of the National Park \nSystem and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                       THE PARK RENEWAL FUND ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Park Renewal \nFund Act. This legislation would grant the Secretary of the Interior \nadditional authority to impose and collect entrance fees at units of \nthe National Park System and deposit those increased revenues in a \nspecial fund--\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nthe park renewal fund. These moneys could then be used, without the \nneed for further appropriation, to help cover the cost of priority park \nmaintenance and repair projects. The legislation also includes other \nprovisions designed to enhance the Park Service's ability to generate \nbadly needed funds from park users and other non-Federal sources.\n  Last year, I introduced park fee legislation at the request of the \nadministration. The committee unanimously reported an amended version \nof that bill late in the session, but no further action was taken in \nthe Senate. The bill I am introducing today is very similar to the \nversion I introduced last year and incorporates the current \nadministration position on park fees. Like last year, it is possible \nthat changes will be made to this bill before it is reported from the \ncommittee. I welcome the attention of my colleagues to this bill and \nurge their support. I also look forward to their input and the input of \nothers on how to improve the legislation. Although I am flexible on \nmany provisions in this bill, there is, in my view, one concept that \nmust be included in the final version of any park fee bill. New fee \nrevenue generated by this legislation must go directly to the parks for \nuse in the parks and not be diverted for nonpark purposes. There is \nconsiderable public support for paying higher park entrance fees if \nthose fees are used to enhance the parks and visitor use and enjoyment \nof them. Without such a provision, there is no need to raise fees and \ncertainly no incentive for the parks to collect them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis and the text of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The amount of the said \n     flat fee shall reflect both the commercial tour use fee rate \n     and current admission rates.''\n       (k) Fees for Special Uses.--Section 4 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6a) is amended \n     by adding the following at the end thereof:\n       ``(o) Fees for Commercial/Nonrecreational Uses.--Utilizing \n     the criteria established in Section 4(d) (16 U.S.C. 460l-\n     6a(d)), the Secretary of the Interior shall establish \n     reasonable fees for non-recurring commercial or non-\n     recreational uses of National Park System units that require \n     special arrangements, including permits. At a minimum, such \n     fees will cover all costs of providing necessary services \n     associated with such use, except that at the Secretary's \n     discretion, the Secretary may waive or reduce such fees in \n     the case of any organization using an area within the \n     National Park System for activities which further the goals \n     of the National Park Service. Receipts from such fees may be \n     retained at the park unit in which the use takes place, and \n     remain available, without further appropriation, to cover the \n     cost of providing such services. The portion of such fee \n     which exceeds the cost of providing necessary services \n     associated with such use shall be deposited into the \n     National Park Renewal Fund.''\n       (1) Fee authority.--Section 4 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6a) is amended \n     by adding the following new subsection at the end thereof:\n       (p) Admission or Recreation Use Fees.--No admission or \n     recreation use fee of any kind shall be charged or imposed \n     for entrance into, or use of, any federally owned area \n     operated and maintained by a Federal agency and used for \n     outdoor recreation purposes, except as provided for by this \n     Act.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES, DELAWARE WATER \n                   GAP NATIONAL RECREATION AREA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective at noon on September 30, 2005, \n     the use of Highway 209 within the Delaware Water Gap National \n     Recreation Area by commercial vehicles, when such us is not \n     connected with the operation of the recreation area, is \n     prohibited, except as provided in section (b).\n       (b) Local Business Use Protected.--Subsection (a) does not \n     apply with respect to the use of commercial vehicles to serve \n     businesses located within or in the vicinity of the \n     recreation area, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Conforming Provisions.--(1) Paragraphs (1) through (3) \n     of the third undesignated paragraph under the heading \n     ``administrative provisions'' in chapter VII of title I of \n     Public Law 98-63 (97 Stat. 329), are repealed, effective \n     September 30, 2005.\n       (2) Prior to noon on September 30, 2005, the Secretary \n     shall collect and utilize a commercial use fee from \n     commercial vehicles in accordance with paragraphs (1) through \n     (3) of such third undesignated paragraph. Such fee shall not \n     exceed $25 per trip.\n\n     SEC. 4. CHALLENGE COST SHARE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Agreements.--The Secretary of the Interior is \n     authorized to negotiate and enter into challenge cost-share \n     agreements with cooperators. For purposes of this section, \n     the term--\n       (1) ``challenge cost-share agreement'' means any agreement \n     entered into between the Secretary and any cooperator for the \n     purpose of sharing costs or services in carrying out \n     authorized functions and responsibilities of the Secretary \n     with respect to any unit or program of the National Park \n     System (as defined in section 2(a) of the Act of August 8, \n     1953 (16 U.S.C. 1c(a)), any affiliated area, or designated \n     National Scenic or Historic Trail; and\n       (2) ``cooperator'' means any State or local government, \n     public or private agency, organization, institution, \n     corporation, individual, or other entity.\n       (b) Use of Federal Funds.--In carrying out challenge cost-\n     share agreements, the Secretary is authorized to provide the \n     Federal funding share from any funds available to the \n     National Park Service.\n\n     SEC. 5. DONATIONS\n\n       (a) Requests for Donations.--In addition to the Secretary's \n     other authorities to accept the donation of lands, buildings, \n     other property, services, and moneys for the purposes of the \n     National Park System, the Secretary is authorized to solicit \n     donations of money, property, and services from individuals, \n     corporations, foundations and other potential donors who the \n     Secretary believes would wish to make such donations as an \n     expression of support for the national parks. Such donations \n     may be accepted and used for any authorized purpose or \n     program of the National Park Service, and donations of money \n     shall remain available for expenditure without fiscal year \n     limitation. Any employees of the Department to whom this \n     authority is delegated shall be set forth in the written \n     guidelines issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (d).\n       (b) Employee Participation.--Employees of the National Park \n     Service may solicit donations only if the request is \n     incidental to or in support of, and does not interfere with \n     their primary duty of protecting and administering the parks \n     or administering authorized programs, and only for the \n     purpose of providing a level of resource protection, visitor \n     facilities, or services for health and safety projects, \n     recurring maintenance activities, or for other routine \n     activities normally funded through annual agency \n     appropriations. Such requests must be in accordance with the \n     guidelines issued pursuant to subparagraph (d).\n       (c) Prohibitions.--(1) A donation may not be accepted in \n     exchange for commitment to the donor on the part of the \n     National Park Service or which attaches conditions \n     inconsistent with applicable laws and regulations or that is \n     conditioned upon or will require the expenditure of \n     appropriated funds that are not available to the Department, \n     or which compromises a criminal or civil position of the \n     United States or any of its departments or agencies or the \n     administration authority of any agency of the United States.\n       (2) In utilizing the authorities contained in this section \n     employees of the National Park Service shall not directly \n     conduct or execute major fund raising campaigns, but may \n     cooperate with others whom the Secretary may designate to \n     conduct such campaigns on behalf of the National Park \n     Service.\n       (d) Guidance.--(1) The Secretary shall issue written \n     guidelines setting forth those positions to which he has \n     delegated his authority under paragraph (a) and the \n     categories of employees of the National Park Service that are \n     authorized to request donations pursuant to paragraph (b). \n     Such guidelines shall also set forth any limitations on the \n     types of donations that will be requested or accepted as well \n     as the sources of those donations.\n       (2) The Secretary shall publish guidelines which set forth \n     the criteria to be used in determining whether the \n     solicitation or acceptance of contributions of lands, \n     buildings, other property, services, moneys, and other gifts \n     or donations authorized by this section would reflect \n     unfavorably upon the ability of the Department of the \n     Interior or any employee to carry out its responsibilities or \n     official duties in a fair and objective manner, or would \n     compromise the integrity or the appearance of the integrity \n     of its programs or any official involved in those programs. \n     The Secretary shall also issue written guidance on the extent \n     of the cooperation that may be provided by National Park \n     Service employees in any major fund raising campaign which \n     the Secretary has designated others to conduct pursuant to \n     paragraph (c)(2).\n\n     SEC. 6. COST RECOVERY FOR DAMAGE TO NATIONAL PARK RESOURCES.\n\n       Public Law 101-337 is amended as follows:\n       (a) In section 1 (16 U.S.C. 19jj), by amending subsection \n     (d) to read as follows:\n       ``(d) `Park system resource' means any living or nonliving \n     resource that is located within the boundaries of a unit of \n     the National Park System, except for resources owned by a \n     non-Federal entity.''.\n       (b) In section 1 (16 U.S.C. 19jj) by adding at the end \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(g) `Marine or aquatic park system resourse' means any \n     living or non-living part of a marine or aquatic regimen \n     within or is a living part of a marine or aquatic regimen \n     within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System, \n     except for resources owned by a non-Federal entity.''.\n       (c) In section 2(b) (16 U.S.C. 19jj-1(b)), by striking \n     ``any park'' and inserting in lieu thereof, ``any marine or \n     aquatic park''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Section-by-Section--Proposed Fee Legislation\n\n       Section 1. Entitles the bill the ``The Park Renewal Fund \n     Act.''\n       Section 2. Makes several changes to the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to provide the Secretary of the \n     Interior additional authority to manage the National Park \n     Service fee program. Specific changes follow:\n       (a) Admission Fees:\n       (1) Strikes ``fee-free travel areas'' and ``lifetime \n     admission permits'' from the section title as they were also \n     striken in the text of this section.\n       (2) Strikes the first and second sentence to eliminate the \n     cap on the amount to be charged for a Golden Eagle Passport \n     ($25) and the language mandating entry coverage under the \n     passport. The new language would authorize the Secretaries of \n     the Interior and Agriculture to set the fee and conditions of \n     coverage.\n       (3) Strikes the second sentence to eliminate the cap for \n     annual park specific permits. The rest of the section stays \n     intact and\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n     ties coverage of this permit to the same conditions to be \n     developed for the Golden Eagle Passport.\n       (4) Deletes the length of stay limitations, allowing the \n     administering Secretary to establish length of stays for \n     specific units. It would also eliminate the cap on fees to be \n     charged for single visit permits and other restrictions, \n     which would be determined by the administering Secretary.\n       (5) Makes a technical correction by inserting ``Great'' \n     before Smoky Mountains National Park.\n       (6) Deletes the sentence that exempts urban areas from \n     fees. Current law prohibits admission fees at any unit of the \n     National Park System which provides significant outdoor \n     recreational opportunities in an urban environment and to \n     which access is available at multiple locations. While not \n     specifically saying fees would be charged, this change would \n     provide authority for a review of the feasibility of charging \n     fees at these areas.\n       (7) Authorizes the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture \n     to modify the Golden Age Passport program as it currently \n     exists. The Secretaries would still be able to establish \n     discounted admission fees upon proof of age. However, the \n     discount would apply only to the eligible individual, and not \n     to persons accompanying that individual, regardless of the \n     method of travel.\n       (8) Limits coverage under the Golden Access Passport for \n     the disabled to the individual holding the passport and one \n     accompanying individual, regardless of method of travel. It \n     also deletes the word ``blind'' throughout the paragraph and \n     the portion having to do with the receipts of federal \n     benefits.\n       (9) Directs the Secretary to provide to Congress within 6 \n     months after enactment a report outlining the changes to be \n     implemented.\n       (10) Deletes paragraph (a)(9), which states specific areas \n     where fees will not be charged. This would not mean that fees \n     would be charged, but would provide an opportunity for review \n     (e.g., Canaveral National Seashore). Deletes paragraph \n     (a)(11) which established special rates for Grand Tetons, \n     Yellowstone, and Grand Canyon. With new fee authority, \n     special rates as established for these areas would \n     essentially become caps are unnecessary.\n       (b) Recreation Fees:\n       (1) Deletes personal collection of camping fees as one of \n     the criteria used in determining whether a fee can be charged \n     at a campground. Many campgrounds have gone to self-\n     registration systems over the years in the effort to more \n     efficiently use personnel. It is an outdated criterion, \n     especially as more efficient and technological changes in \n     collections occur. This section also removes the 50% discount \n     in user fees for those 62 and over, but retains that discount \n     for the disabled.\n       (c) Amends the criteria used for setting fees to include \n     comparable recreation fees charged by other public and \n     private entities. Current law requires comparison with fees \n     charged by non-federal public entities.\n       (d) Deletes a $100 cap on fines to comply with the Criminal \n     Fine Improvement Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-185). This Act \n     established uniform maximum fine levels for all Federal petty \n     offenses at $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for \n     organizations (18 U.S.C. section 3571).\n       (e) Removes the prohibition on fees or charges for non-\n     recreational and commercial uses. The language inserted \n     addresses those few park areas where state fishing licenses \n     do not apply and are not required because the areas are under \n     either partial or exclusive jurisdiction of the United \n     States. In these park areas (e.g., Glacier, Yellowstone) the \n     legislative jurisdiction means that the United States \n     (National Park Service) has, by cession or retention, all the \n     authority of the state and state fishing laws and regulations \n     do not apply.\n       (f) Changes the committee names to reflect current titles \n     and conditions.\n       (g) Use of Fees:\n       (1) Technical change in the title.\n       (2 & 3) Allows the 15% retained by the Park Service and \n     other agencies for fee collection costs to be figured on the \n     collections of the previous year, instead of the current \n     year. This will provide for a more accurate figure to be \n     retained, based on a full year's collections, rather than \n     partial year and estimates.\n       (4) Establishes a National Park Renewal Fund to be used for \n     infrastructure repair, interpretive media and exhibit repair \n     and replacement, and infrastructure projects associated with \n     park resources. The fund would be established in 1996 with \n     funds available beginning in 1997. It would authorize the \n     National Park Service to retain and use, without further \n     appropriation, all new revenue generated by this legislation. \n     Procedures are to be developed for the distribution of these \n     funds by the agency.\n       (5) Allows amounts covered into the existing U.S. Treasury \n     special account for the National Park Service that are \n     generated from admission fees, to be used for park operations \n     as opposed to limiting their expenditure to resource \n     protection, research, and interpretation.\n       (h) Deletes language requiring that private entities \n     willing to sell Golden Eagle Passports pay the amount ``up \n     front''. Also deletes this portion from the section title.\n       (i) Allows each park to retain 100 percent of receipts from \n     fees for transportation services, when charged in lieu of an \n     admission fee. Parks currently have authority to retain 50 \n     percent of such fee receipts and deposit the remainder in the \n     existing U.S. Treasury special account for the National Park \n     Service, although no fees are currently collected under this \n     authority.\n       (j) Combines the commercial tour use fee and admission fees \n     for commercial vehicles into a flat fee per entry, for such \n     vehicles. This would simplify fee collection and increase \n     revenue.\n       (k) Authorizes ``reasonable'' fees for non-recreational or \n     commercial uses of units that require special arrangements. \n     Receipts from such fees would be retained at the park unit in \n     which the use takes place and remain available to cover the \n     cost of providing such services.\n       (1) Applies the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to any \n     federally owned area operated and maintained by a federal \n     agency for outdoor recreation purposes.\n       Section 3. Renews the Secretary's expired authority to \n     collect fees for commercial vehicles driving through the \n     Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania. \n     Effective September 30, 2005, the park would be closed to \n     commercial vehicles, except for local traffic. This section \n     is identical to HR 536 as passed by the House of \n     Representatives on March 14, 1995.\n       Section 4. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into challenge \n     cost-share agreements with public or private entities to \n     share the costs of authorized National Park Service \n     activities.\n       Section 5.

Mr. President, last night the Senate passed the \nNational Highway System legislation, and in so doing determined the \nfuture of our Nation's intermodal infrastructure. New York has an \nimportant role in an efficient national intermodal system.\n  A month ago I rose before the Senate to remark how pleased I was that \nthe conference report for the Department of Defense supplemental \nappropriations bill included an appropriation of $21.5 million for \ncapital improvements associated with safety-related emergency repairs \nto Pennsylvania Station in New York City. The station is the busiest \nintermodal station in the Nation, with almost 40 percent of Amtrak's \npassengers nationwide passing through every day. It is the linchpin for \nintermodal travel in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, it is also the most decrepit of the Northeast corridor \nstations, others of which, such as Washington DC's own Union Station, \nhave been renovated with Federal grants. Today, Pennsylvania Station \nhandles almost 500,000 riders daily in a subterranean complex that \ndemands improvement. According to the New York City Fire Commissioner, \nthere have been nine major fires at the station since 1987. Luckily, \nthese fires have occurred at off-hours. As it stands, the\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nstation could not cope with an emergency when it is crowded with the \n42,000 souls who pass through every workday between 8 and 9 a.m. In \naddition, structural steel in the station has shown its age and needs \nimmediate repair. And these are just the most pressing needs.\n  There is also a need to add capacity as ridership grows. The station, \ndesigned in 1963, will not be able to accommodate the growing volume of \npeople. It is projected that by the year 2005, New Jersey Transit \nridership will increase 44 percent, Amtrak, 26 percent, and the Long \nIsland Railroad, 9 percent. If we do not act now, pedestrian gridlock \nwill shut us down in 10 years.\n  Happily, there is a redevelopment plan to change things for the \nbetter, a $315 million project to renovate the existing station in the \nonly way possible: across the street into a portion of the neighboring \nhistoric James A. Farley Post Office. The plan will nearly double the \naccess to the station's platforms, which lie far below street level \nbeneath both buildings. Moreover, there is a financing plan in place \nthat will accomplish this with $100 million from the Federal \nGovernment--$31.5 million has already been appropriated--$100 million \nfrom the State and city, and $115 million from a combination of \nhistoric tax credits, bonds supported by revenue from the project's \nretail component, and building shell improvements by the Postal \nService, owner of the James A. Farley Building. Governor Pataki of New \nYork and Mayor Giuliani of New York City strongly support the project \nand have made available funding in their budgets in accordance with a \nmemorandum of agreement signed in August 1994.\n  Now, $26\\1/2\\ million can be used immediately for pressing safety \nrepairs at the existing station, in the first step of the overall \nredevelopment effort. These are the first Federal funds into the \nproject that will actually go toward construction, and they will count \ntowards the Federal share of the $315 million project to transform the \nstation into a complex capable of safely handling the crowds that have \nmade Pennsylvania Station the Nation's busiest intermodal facility. The \nauthorization approved in this bill for the remaining Federal share of \nthe project will assure the viability of Pennsylvania Station into the \n21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9005-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE E. NORCROSS, SR.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na man who never failed to rise to the challenge of serving his fellow \nhuman beings; George E. Norcross, Sr.\n  George started as a union organizer in the 1940's. He got involved in \nthe labor movement because he understood that working people needed to \ncome together to protect their common interests and promote their \ncommon goals. He translated that theory into practice when he founded \nand served as president of RCA Local 106 in Morrestown, NJ. His \nresponsibilities to the local kept him busy, but they did not prevent \nhim from becoming involved in other activities. His commitment to the \nlabor movement ultimately resulted in his serving as president of the \nAFL-CIO Central Labor Council of South Jersey. In that capacity, he \nmade sure that the union movement contributed to the community as a \nwhole as well as its members.\n  George took steps to get the 80,000 members of the central labor \ncouncil's 73 locals involved in community events. He became active in \nthe United Way and served as chairman of the campaign in 1982 as well \nas holding other post of responsibility in that organization.\n  While George recognized the need for larger organizations like the \nUnited Way, he never lost sight of the obligation that labor unions \nthemselves had to assist those in needs. He served as president of the \nunion organization for social service which provided services to the \ncommunity ranging from food banks to job training and clothing drives.\n  George is the kind of man who believed that Americans ought to care \nabout their neighbors and accept a responsibility to help them. His \nlife has been devoted to basic values: seeing all men and women as \nbrothers and sisters, realizing that we share common dreams and face a \ncommon destiny, accepting the obligation and opportunity to give those \nin need a helping hand.\n  Mr. President, because of George, literally tens of thousands of \nlives have been improved and enriched. I join with those tens of \nthousands in wishing him a rewarding retirement and expressing our \nappreciation for all he has done, and all that he will continue to \ndo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9006-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9006-S9007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RURAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here \nwith my colleagues from Montana and Iowa, Senators Baucus and Grassley, \nto introduce a bill for rural America. The point of our bill is to help \nmake sure that the people living in rural areas--who are \ndisproportionately elderly--will be assured access to vital health care \nservices, especially primary care and emergency care services. Our \nlegislation is an effort to make sure that senior citizens are not \nforced to travel long distances in emergency situations or for simple, \nbut life-saving reasons like getting certain tests.\n  Getting reliable access to health care services has always been a \nstruggle for the people of rural West Virginia and the rest of the \ncountry. Now, as major changes are unfolding in the delivery of health \ncare and throughout the health care system, many rural hospitals are \nbeing forced to re-examine and re-focus their mission and their \ncapabilities.\n  Our bill steps in by giving rural hospitals across the country an \nimportant option that rural hospitals in West Virginia and 7 other \nStates already have to be more responsive to the people in their areas. \nUnder this bill, rural hospitals will be relieved of burdensome \nregulations that may interfere with their ability to meet the most \ncritical health needs of their local community.\n  Currently, most rural hospitals have only one choice when faced with \ndeclining occupancy rates, declining Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursement rates, and intense market pressures to lower their costs: \nclosing their doors. Small, rural hospitals are simply not able to take \nadvantage of the ``law of large numbers'' and economize like larger \nhospitals can. Under our legislation, when a full-service hospital is \nno longer sustainable, critical access hospitals will assure rural \nresidents basic access to essential primary care and emergency health \ncare services.\n  This legislation is modeled on two separate, ongoing rural hospital \ndemonstration projects. It is modeled after a demonstration project in \nMontana, called the Medical Assistance Facilities or MAF Program which \nhas been in existence since 1990 and the Essential Access Community \nHospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital Program, more commonly \nreferred to as the EACH/RPCH Program which exists in seven States.\n  Under these demonstration programs, limits are placed on the number \nof licensed beds and patient length of stays in the participating rural \nhospitals. In exchange, hospitals receive slightly higher Medicare \npayments to cover the important services they do provide--along with \nrelief from Federal regulations that are intended for full-scale, acute \ncare hospitals.\n  We believe, based on new cost information collected by the General \nAccounting Office, that our legislation will actually save the Medicare \nProgram money. By giving hospitals some flexibility on staffing and \nother Federal regulations, hospitals can staff-up based on their \npatients' need, not just to meet regulations meant for completely \ndifferent situations. We want to encourage the development of rural \nhealth networks, to help small, rural hospitals save money and improve \nquality by tapping into the resources of larger, full-service \nhospitals. The labors of health care should be divided according to who \ncan do what best, but there absolutely is a role for rural hospitals \nand a reason for Congress to help them survive.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will make sure that rural residents \nwill have immediate access to emergency care, and that they and their \nfamilies won't be forced to travel long distances for routine medical \ncare. Rural residents who need just a short stay in the hospital can \nstay and receive their care at the local hospital rather than traveling \nto a usually more expensive medical center.\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\n  The magnitude of Medicare cuts that are included in this year's \nbudget resolution make this legislation especially critical. We must \nmake sure that rural hospitals have the ability to react to huge \nMedicare cuts by becoming more efficient and closing down unused beds \nrather than by simply closing their doors.\n  I am very proud to note that West Virginia has been a leader in \nhelping small, rural hospitals figure out how to adapt and cope with \nrapidly changing economic circumstances. Webster County Memorial \nHospital and Broaddus Hospital in Philippi were two of the first few \nhospitals to be designated rural primary care hospitals nationwide. \nSeven other West Virginia hospitals are currently considering making \nthe transition.\n  According to Steve Gavalchik, the administrator of the Webster County \nMemorial Hospital, if they had not been able to take advantage of the \nEACH/RPCH Program, the hospital might have been able to hang on for \nonly about 16 to 18 months more before being forced to shut its doors. \nNow, Webster County hospital can focus on doing a few things well. \nNetworking with an essential access community hospital has been \ninvaluable as Webster County has made the transition to a rural primary \ncare hospital. United Hospital Center, their hospital partner, has \nprovided technical assistance, financial advice, quality assurance and \nquality improvement support.\n\n  For the people of Webster County, access to basic and emergency \nhealth care services would have been severely curtailed if Webster \nCounty Hospital had been forced to close. The nearest hospital is 43 \nminutes away--in the summer. In the winter, the drive is much more \ntreacherous and takes up to 1\\1/2\\ hours or more. Patients with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, pneumonia, and \ncongestive heart failure are the most common diagnoses of patients \nadmitted for short term stays. Just imagine if these patients, most of \nthem elderly were forced to travel an hour or so to get routine \nhospital care, not to mentioned the extra costs that would be involved \nfor them and their families.\n  Family practice services are now available on site at the hospital \nbecause the doctors in the town moved into unused space. The doctors' \npractice have benefited from sharing resources, and the local health \ndepartment has moved its headquarters to the hospital complex. As a \nresult, the hospital and the local health department are now working \ntogether in ways they would have never thought of before. More \nimportant, patients benefit from the ease of having a central place to \ngo to take care of their routine health care needs.\n  According to the hospital administrator at Broaddus Hospital, \nSusannah Higgins, Broaddus Hospital was also faced with possible \nclosure prior to being designated an RPCH hospital. Now, Broaddus can \nfunction as a mini-hospital. Through its relationships with partner \nhospitals, Broaddus offers oncology, general surgery, ob-gyn clinic \nservices on-site on a weekly basis. Family practice and internal \nmedicine services are available on a daily basis. Lifesaving emergency \nservices are on-site. Just recently a local resident severed his leg in \na logging accident. He was transported to Broaddus Hospital in a \nprivate car. By the time he arrived at the emergency room he was in \nextremely, extremely critical condition. Fortunately, he was able to be \nstabilized and was later transported to a medical center. If emergency \nservices had not been available in the area, there is a very good \nchance that man would not be alive today. When minutes and seconds \nliterally count, a helicopter landing pad cannot take the place of \nhaving highly trained and qualified emergency doctors and nurses \navailable immediately to stabilize and begin emergency care.\n  Webster County Memorial Hospital and Broaddus Hospital are examples \nof how rural communities can adapt to a changing health care \nmarketplace. This legislation builds on the strengths of the current \nEACH/RPCH program and the Montana MAF program; improves them; and \nexpands them to all 50 States so that rural hospitals all across \nAmerica will have the same opportunities.\n  Mr. President, under our bill, newly designated critical access \nhospitals would be limited to 15 inpatient days and patient stays would \nhave to be the kind involving limited duration--up to 96 hours, \nalthough exceptions are allowed in special circumstances, such as \ninclement weather or a patient's medical condition.\n  In this bill, we ease up on hospital regulations so that critical \naccess hospitals can meet the needs of their community and not the \nneeds of a Federal bureaucracy. We are not easing up on quality \nstandards but have rather allowed hospitals to use common sense when it \ncomes to staffing and certain other Federal standards. For instance, if \nthere are no inpatient beds occupied, hospitals do not have to have a \nfull complement of hospital staff on duty. Medicare reimbursement would \ntake into account a small, rural hospital's fixed costs and the \ninability of small, rural hospitals to take advantage of some of the \ncost-saving measures that larger hospitals can implement.\n  Our legislation is targeted at the 1,186 rural hospitals nationwide \nwith fewer than 50 beds. While these hospitals are essential to \nassuring access to health care services in their local communities, \nthese hospitals account for only 2 percent of total Medicare payments \nto hospitals. Our country's small rural hospitals needs special \nattention. This legislation gives them that attention and the ability \nto adapt to a rapidly changing health care world.\n  Finally, this legislation would require the Secretary of HHS to \nsubmit a report by next January on a methodology for Medicare \nreimbursement of telemedicine services. I recently, along with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, included an amendment in the \ntelecommunications bill--that was passed by the Senate just last week--\nthat will guarantee rural health care providers affordable transmission \ncosts when it comes to telemedicine and other telecommunications \ntechnology. The provision in the bill we are introducing today is \nanother important step to improving access to specialty and state-of-\nthe-art medical care for rural residents.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation is critically important \nand, if enacted, will have an important difference on the health of \nrural residents across America. I am honored to be part of this effort, \nand intent on continuing to respond to the health care needs of the \npeople in my State and rural America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9006-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9007-S9008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DECLINE OF DEMOCRACY IN NIGERIA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I remind my colleagues that \nJune 12, 1995, was the second anniversary of the annulled election of \nMashood Abiola as President of Nigeria. The people of Nigeria \ncommemorated this anniversary with a general strike that brought \nbusiness in Lagos and other cities to a standstill. The military regime \nof Gen. Sani Abacha marked the anniversary by rounding up and arresting \ndozens of Nigeria's prodemocratic leaders. As I speak today, General \nAbacha continues to hold in prison the legitimately elected leader of \nNigeria; the general also continues to deny President Abiola badly \nneeded medical attention.\n  Nigeria is a nation rich in natural and human resources. Besides \nproducing 2 million barrels of oil a day, Nigeria mines significant \namounts of coal, lead, zinc, and other minerals. Nigeria is also the \nmost populous nation in Africa. In the 1960's and 1970's, the people of \nNigeria set the standard for improving educational standards and \npromoting economic development in Africa. By the early 1980's, 100,000 \nmen and women were graduating each year from Nigerian postsecondary \ninstitutions and one-third of the population belonged to the middle \nclass. Observers of postcolonial Africa predicted that Nigeria would \nlead the way in building democracy and prosperity in sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Since that time, however, this optimistic outlook has been shattered. \nThe military leaders of Nigeria have systematically looted their \ncountry's wealth and brought Nigeria to the edge of economic and \npolitical ruin. Today the Nigerian Government cannot even make interest \npayments on its foreign debt and is losing control over many of its \nterritories. Fifteen years ago, Nigeria had a per capita income of \n$1,000,\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nwhile today per capita income in Nigeria has dropped to $200 and the \nmiddle class has almost completely disappeared into poverty. This \neconomic turmoil has undermined Nigeria's efforts to fight the spread \nof diseases like polio, riverblindness, and AIDS. Under the regime of \nGeneral Abacha and his predecessors, Nigeria has become one of the \nbusiest heroin trafficking points in the world.\n  In the past year General Abacha convened a constitutional conference \nto decide the future of the Nigerian Government. It is now clear that \nthis conference was stacked with pro-military delegates. The conference \nignored the views of the National Democratic Coalition and other groups \nboth in Nigeria and in exile which advocate the restoration of \ndemocratic institutions in Nigeria. Quite predictably, the conference \nvoted to indefinitely extend General Abacha's term.\n  The international community needs to intensify its efforts to restore \ndemocratic rule to Nigeria and end the flagrant human rights violations \nthis military regime inflicts daily on the people of Nigeria. President \nClinton has taken a good first step by suspending commercial flights to \nNigeria and denying entrance to the United States to those people who \nare suppressing democracy in Nigeria. Up to now, however, these \nsanctions seem to have had no effect on the behavior of the military \nregime. I encourage the administration to make further efforts to push \nNigeria toward democracy. The United States, along with the rest of the \ninternational community must support the prodemocracy movement in \nNigeria with the same resolve we showed for the anti-apartheid movement \nin South Africa.\n  Support for democracy in South Africa required a unified response \nthat increasingly isolated the South African Government from the rest \nof the global community. If General Abacha refuses to take any steps \ntoward relinquishing his power, the United States should look at ways \nto increase diplomatic pressure on Nigeria. The administration should \nconsider the recommendations of groups such as TransAfrica and the \nParliamentary Human Rights Group to strengthen sanctions, including, \nperhaps, a temporary oil embargo on Nigeria. The future of Africa \nhinges on the development of democracy in countries like Nigeria. It is \nin our national interest to force Nigeria's military leaders to stop \ntheir human rights abuses and begin the transition to a legitimate \ndemocratic government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9007-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORDER TO PRINT H.R. 956 AND S. 562 AS PASSED\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment today and call the \nattention of the Senate to the accomplishments of a good friend of the \nSenate community and an individual who performs one of the most vital \nfunctions in the Senate: The calling aloud and reporting by hand of \neach Senator's vote.\n  Mr. President, I know all of my colleagues join me in expressing a \nhearty congratulations to Scott Bates, the Senate's legislative clerk, \non the occasion of his 25th anniversary of work in the Senate.\n  Scott began his Senate employment 25 years ago today, on June 23, \n1970, when he was appointed the assistant bill clerk of the Senate. \nAfter growing up in Pine Bluff, AR, and graduating from Hendrix \nCollege, Scott came to Washington for what was to be a summer job in \nthe Senate. Twenty-five years later--the longest summer on record--\nScott finds himself seated at the rostrum of the Senate attending to \nthe important duties of the legislative clerk.\n  Scott performed the duties of the assistant bill clerk and bill clerk \nfrom 1970 to 1975, when he became an assistant legislative clerk. As \nthe Senate's bill clerk, Scott efficiently executed the important \nfunctions of assigning bill numbers to legislation, processing bills \nfor printing, and entering information in the Senate's Legis computer \nsystem to indicate the status of bills and amendments. In fact, Scott \nwas instrumental in converting the legislative tracking system from \ncumbersome index cards to a computerized system.\n  Due to his exemplary service and performance of duties, he was \nappointed as the Senate's legislative clerk on January 1, 1993. He \ncontinues to serve in this important role today. All of us who serve in \nthe Senate are familiar with the meticulous care with which he manually \ntakes and tallies rollcall votes and quorum calls and reads aloud bills \nand amendments when so ordered by the Senate's Presiding Officer.\n  Scott is quite experienced in the taking of rollcall votes, because \nhe started doing so at the young age of 27. Since he probably has taken \nmore votes than anyone in recent memory, it is no surprise that viewers \nof C-SPAN witness such an expert execution of that particular duty. I \nknow all Senators appreciate his accuracy and professionalism under the \nfrequent conditions of long and intense Senate sessions.\n  So it is with much gratitude that I congratulate Scott on this 25th \nanniversary of his Senate employment, and extend best wishes to Scott \nand his wife, Ricki, and their children Lisa, Lori, and Paul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9009-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GRATITUDE FOR SCOTT BATES' 25 YEARS OF SENATE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has not \nonly spoken for both of us, but I think for all of us, in expressing \nour sincere gratitude to Scott.\n  To look at him, you would think he was five when he started, not 27. \nHe still looks young and full of energy and vibrance. And that is the \nway he conducts himself each and every day. Many of us who have had the \ngreat fortune to work with Scott for a number of years have grown to \nadmire him and his professionalism each and every day when he comes to \nwork. It is not just the days when he has to call out each of our \nnames, but it is the long days when he has to read a bill, page by page \nby page, that we have a great sympathy for him and for the positions he \nfinds himself in from time to time.\n  But I know that all of us express today our sincere appreciation and \ncongratulations to Scott. He epitomizes public service. He epitomizes \nwhat we hope to be the real model of public life each and every day.\n  As the distinguished leader said, it is his voice and his persona \nthat people have the opportunity to see and hear each and every time \nthey tune into C-SPAN. Let me also say how grateful we are to his \nfamily, because these jobs sometimes take people away from their \nfamilies more than they should. It is only because we have \nunderstanding families, and families willing to support what it is we \ndo here, that we can be here at all.\n  So to Scott's family, and to Scott personally, we say congratulations \nand thank you.\n  Mr. DOLE. I might say, too, that it is particularly hard when \nSenators mutter and mumble sometimes, and whether they voted ``yes'' or \n``no'' or ``I do not care.'' But it generally works out alright, \nbecause the Record is always accurate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9009-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9009-S9010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WAR ON CRIME\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in just over a week, Americans will \ncelebrate Independence Day. But as we pay tribute to our heritage and \nour freedom; and as we remember what is right with America, we must \nalso rededicate ourselves to fixing what is wrong.\n  And one thing that is most definitely wrong is that millions of \nAmericans still live in fear of crime. Last fall, Republicans promised \nAmericans that if they gave us a majority in Congress, we would do all \nin our power to bring an end to crime without punishment.\n  I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch to be ready to \nbring to the floor a crime bill sometime after the Fourth of July \nrecess.\n  To his credit, President Clinton has spoken frequently and eloquently \nabout the need to combat crime and drugs. But, as an important article \nin June 19th's Investor Business Daily makes clear, the President seems \nto believe that rhetoric--and not resources--will win the fight against \ncrime.\n  As the article states, President Clinton has repeatedly sought to \nreduce funding and personnel from the FBI, the DEA, and U.S. attorney's \noffices.\n  The effect of this withdrawal of resources can most clearly be seen \nin the war against drugs.\n  In 1992, 347 new DEA special agents underwent training. In President \nClinton's first year in office, that number fell to zero. And his 1995 \nbudget proposal forecast training no new agents in either 1994 or 1995. \nUnder the President's proposals, total DEA personnel is slated to fall \nby nearly 800--from 6,149 in 1993 to 5,388 in 1995.\n  As a result, DEA arrests have decreased dramatically--from more than \n7,800 in the last year of the Bush administration, to 5,279 in 1994. In \nthose same years, Federal narcotics prosecutions have fallen by 25 \npercent.\n  All this is taking place at a time when surveys show that drug use \namong adolescents has climbed in the last 2 years.\n  President Clinton has also spoken eloquently about guns. Yet, as \nInvestors Business Daily details, the number of Federal prosecutions \nfor firearms-related violations has fallen by 20 percent in the last 2 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I believe these numbers are very disturbing, and they \nwill be analyzed more closely during the crime bill debate.\n  Talking tough is one thing. But getting tough is another. And Senator \nHatch and I share a commitment to passing legislation that will give \nour law enforcement community the resources they need to stop the tidal \nwave of crime and drugs that has washed over so many of our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by John \nBarnes in June 19th's Investor's Business Daily be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\n\n\n            [From Investor's Business Daily, June 19, 1995]\n\n                     Clinton's Real Record on Crime\n\n                          (By John A. Barnes)\n\n       President Clinton's high-profile demand for an anti-\n     terrorism bill has no doubt beefed up his image as ``tough on \n     crime.''\n       Indeed, he has made co-opting the crime issue--\n     traditionally a Republican preserve--a high priority for his \n     administration and his party.\n       To that end, he pushed hard to pass last year's widely \n     attacked crime bill, which the president bragged would add \n     100,000 new police officers to the streets. (The law is being \n     rewritten by the new Republican Congress.)\n       But Clinton's ``tough on crime'' posturing has not been \n     backed up by money for federal law enforcement since he took \n     office.\n       In listing his priorities for funding, he repeatedly has \n     sought to withdraw resources from the sharp end of federal \n     law enforcement--the FBI, the DEA, U.S. attorneys' offices--\n     while transferring funds to such areas as antitrust law, \n     child abuse and civil rights.\n       For instance, 320 new FBI agents were trained in 1992 at \n     the FBI's Academy, the last full year of the Bush \n     administration. But not a single new agent graduated from the \n     academy in 1993.\n       And Clinton asked for no new funding for new agents in his \n     fiscal 1995 budget either, the first one for which he had a \n     full year to prepare. Congress has approved around 600 new \n     agents for this year.\n       In that same fiscal 1995 budget, Clinton forecast dropping \n     the number of full-time equivalent FBI positions by 854, from \n     21,568 in 1993 to 20,714 by 1995, including a reduction of \n     436 special agents. The 1994 number was 21,034.\n       The argument could be made, of course, that with the \n     winding down of the Cold War, the FBI no longer needs as many \n     agents to fight domestic spying as it once did. And several \n     hundred agents have been transferred from such work to more \n     conventional law enforcement duties.\n       One would think that moving agents from espionage work to \n     fighting more conventional street crime, however, would mean \n     an increase in mid-career retraining. But that doesn't appear \n     to be the case.\n       The number of agents receiving such training at the FBI \n     academy has fallen sharply, from 14,741 in 1992 to 2,677 in \n     1994. The number of state and local police officers receiving \n     training at the academy has likewise seen a sharp drop, from \n     7,395 in 1992 to 3,710 in 1994.\n       The Cold War may be over, but the war on drugs has not let \n     up, and the cuts have been felt just as keenly at the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration as at the FBI.\n       In 1992, 347 new DEA special agents underwent training. \n     Like the FBI, that number fell to zero in 1993. The Clinton \n     administration's fiscal 1995 budget forecast training no new \n     DEA agents in 1994 or 1995 either.\n       The number of special agents fell by 123 between 1992 and \n     1994 and total DEA personnel was slated under the Clinton \n     budget to fall from 6,149 in 1993 to 5,388 in 1995. The \n     number in 1994 was 5,450.\n       DEA arrests fell from 7,878 in the last full year under \n     Bush to 5,279 in 1994. Drug-related arrests made in \n     cooperation with overseas law enforcement fell from 1,856 in \n     1992 to 1,522 in 1994.\n       Clandestine drug labs seized by specially trained DEA teams \n     fell from 335 in 1992 to 272 in 1994.\n       Laboratory exhibits analyzed by DEA lab technicians in 1994 \n     totaled 37,667, down from 41,225 two years earlier.\n       Forensic chemists trained by the DEA fell from 20 in 1992 \n     to zero in 1994.\n       ``Diversion'' specialists--who investigate the diversion of \n     prescription drugs from the licit to the illicit market--\n     undergoing training fell from 40 in 1992 to none in 1994.\n       New DEA intelligence specialists, 140 of whom were trained \n     in 1992, dropped to exactly zero in 1994.\n       The Interagency Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task \n     Forces have seen their budgets stagnate, meaning they have \n     been reduced in real terms after inflation has been taken \n     into account. Total spending on these task forces was $390.3 \n     million in 1992. That outlay dropped to $387.4 million in \n     1993 and then to $385.2 million in 1994.\n\n\n                         dropping prosecutions\n\n       Not surprisingly, given this withdrawal of resources, \n     narcotics prosecutions have fallen 25% in just those two \n     years, from 6,936 to 5,177.\n       And all this is taking place at a time when the University \n     of Michigan's 1994 High School Drug Survey shows that drug \n     use among adolescents has climbed in the last two years, \n     coming after the end of the Reagan-Bush era's ``Just Say No'' \n     campaign.\n       Marijuana use has doubled among eighth-graders, jumped two-\n     thirds among 10th graders and one-third among 12th graders.\n       The Drug Abuse Warning Network of the National Institutes \n     of Health has reported that emergency room admissions for \n     cocaine-related emergencies rose 8% in 1993 and those for \n     heroin are up 31%.\n\n\n                           anti-drug programs\n\n       At the same time, the Justice Department's funding for \n     anti-drug-abuse programs has been cut back. From $497.5 \n     million in the last year of the Bush administration, the \n     program was reduced to $474.5 million in 1994.\n       ``There's no question they've de-emphasized drug \n     enforcement,'' said conservative legal analyst Bruce Fein. \n     ``I'm not sure if you could call the change dramatic, but it \n     is noticeable.''\n       Despite all the publicity given the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms for its ill-fated raids in Waco, Texas, \n     and in Idaho, the number of federal prosecutions for \n     firearms-related violations has also fallen consistently \n     under Clinton. There were 3,917 such prosecutions in 1992, a \n     number that fell to 3,636 in 1993 and then 3,113 in 1994, a \n     20.5% fall.\n       At the same time, Clinton has been adding to the number of \n     crimes on the federal statute books. In last year's crime \n     bill, for instance, the following became federal crimes for \n     the first time: murder by a federal prisoner or federal \n     prison escapee; drive-by shootings; murder of a state or \n     local police officer assisting in a federal investigation; \n     use of a weapon of ``mass destruction'' resulting in death.\n       But it hasn't been all cutting at the Clinton Justice \n     Department. Some programs have received large increases in \n     funding and clearly have Clinton's approval.\n       One is the antitrust division, presided over by Ann \n     Bingaman, wife of Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.\n       In the fiscal 1995 budget, the president asked to have its \n     net outlays increased from $40.2 million to $50.8 million, a \n     better than 20% increase. The actual outlays, as is almost \n     always the case, turned out to be less than the requested \n     figure, $47.3 million.\n       This division's major triumph recently was forcing \n     Microsoft Corp.--one of the country's most successful \n     companies--to give up its effort to merge with Intuit Inc., \n     the leading publisher of personal finance software.\n       In addition, the unit announced it was looking into \n     Microsoft's planned on-line service for possible antitrust \n     problems.\n       Appropriations for programs that help victims of child \n     abuse, a particular favorite of Attorney General Janet Reno, \n     more than tripled during the first two years under Clinton, \n     rising from barely $2 million in Bush's last year to $7.5 \n     million in 1994.\n       Interestingly, missing children--which was the alarm bell \n     issue of a decade ago--is apparently no longer ``hot.'' From \n     just over $10 million in 1993, the budget for this program \n     was cut back to $6.6 million a year later.\n       Yet the budget for ``conflict resolution programs'' in the \n     department's Community Relations Service was increased from \n     $9.1 million in 1992 to $9.3 million a year later to $9.6 \n     million in 1994.\n       The Justice Department is also now responsible for \n     enforcing the Violence Against Women Act, which was a part of \n     the 1994 Clinton crime bill.\n       The president's speech March 21 at the opening of the \n     department's new office to enforce the act reflects \n     Clinton's view of law enforcement well.\n       The president reeled off a stream of statistics supposedly \n     showing that crime against women was soaring.\n       The president claimed that rapes were increasing three \n     times faster than the overall crime rate. ``Domestic \n     violence,'' the president declared, was the ``No. 1 health \n     risk'' to women between the ages of 15 and 44, ``a bigger \n     threat than cancer or car accidents.''\n       But his numbers do not accord with government data or \n     academic research in the area. Sociologists Dwayne Smith and \n     Ellen Kuchta, writing in Social Science Quarterly, concluded \n     there is no evidence that crimes against women are increasing \n     faster than the overall crime rate and that, if anything, the \n     rate seems to have decreased somewhat.\n       The study that supposedly showed domestic violence to be \n     the ``No. 1 threat'' to young and middle-aged women was done \n     in a single hospital emergency room in a high-crime \n     neighborhood in inner-city Philadelphia. It counted street \n     crime victims as well as victims of domestic violence.\n\n\n                          civil rights actions\n\n       The civil rights unit of Justice has received a 20% \n     increase in funding under Clinton. Under Deval Patrick, the \n     unit has become one of the busiest and highest profile \n     agencies in government.\n       Patrick has specialized in using threats of civil rights \n     lawsuits--and attendant bad publicity--to reach ``consent \n     decrees'' with banks to loan more money to blacks and other \n     minorities. This despite the fact that the proof of \n     intentional discrimination by such institutions is sketchy at \n     best.\n       The administration has engaged in plenty of other \n     questionable law enforcement.\n       The Housing and Urban Development Department, for instance, \n     has sought to bulldoze opposition to plans to place criminal \n     halfway houses and drug rehabilitation centers in middleclass \n     neighborhoods by threatening opponents with civil rights \n     violations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9009-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9010-S9011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUDGET RESOLUTION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I was pleased to join last night with \nSpeaker Gingrich and the chairmen of the Budget Committees, Senator \nDomenici and Congressman Kasich, in announcing an agreement between the \nSenate and House on the budget resolution--a monumental budget which \nwill balance our Nation's books for the first time in more than a \nquarter of a century. As we said last night, this agreement is another \nhistoric step in bringing the Federal budget into balance in 7 years by \nslowing the growth of Government\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nspending, by making Government leaner, more efficient and more cost-\neffective.\n  This budget finally turns off the out-of-control big government \nspending machine, and puts us on a responsible path to prosperity \nAmerica can rely on well into the next century.\n  While we ratchet down the deficit to zero by the year 2002, we also \nprovide for $245 billion in long overdue tax relief, putting more money \nin the pockets of American families and providing incentives for \nsavings, economic growth and job creation. Importantly, this budget \ntakes action to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare, while \npermitting Medicare and Medicaid spending to increase dramatically in \nthe next 7 years. Furthermore, this budget does not touch Social \nSecurity, and it maintains our commitment to national security second \nto none.\n  The American people have been drowning in a sea of red ink, and this \nbudget provides the liferaft they have been waiting for. Now, I know \nour opponents will try to deflate that liferaft with their sharp \npartisan darts and routine scare tactics, but the American people will \nnot be fooled. They know the status quo is no longer acceptable, and \nthey know leadership means making tough decisions.\n  Mr. President, this agreement reflects the product of countless hours \nof hard work, and on the Senate side, that effort has been led by my \nfriend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. The taxpayers of America are \nfortunate to have Senator Domenici on their side. He has done a \nremarkable job leading this historic effort, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him to ensure enactment of the balanced budget. \nI would also like to commend our Senate Republican conferees for their \ncrucial role in forging this agreement: Senators Lott, Brown, Grassley, \nGorton, Gregg, and Nickles.\n  I think the icing on the cake would be if the President of the United \nStates would announce his public support for a constitutional amendment \nfor a balanced budget.\n  We are just one vote short in the Senate. I am certain the President \nof the United States could find that one vote with the six Senators who \nvoted against the balanced budget this year, when they voted for it \nlast year on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to bringing this balanced budget \nconference report to the floor next week. We hope it will be no later \nthan Thursday, but it could be on Friday. By statute, there are 10 \nhours of debate, and we will complete action on the budget resolution \nnext week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9010-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9011-S9012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BAD NEWS FOR BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Finally, Mr. President, I have made a number of statements \nover the past couple of years on Bosnia. I keep thinking maybe someday \nthere will be some good news about Bosnia; that people who do not \nreally focus on it very much--Democrats, Republicans, it is not a \npartisan issue--maybe there is some good news that people might feel \ngood about if they watch TV or listen to the radio or watch television.\n  But I am afraid there is more bad news on the Bosnian fronts.\n  First, word leaked out of a letter from Boutros Boutros-Ghali's \nSpecial Envoy, Yasushi Akashi, to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs' \nmilitant leader, intended to assure the Bosnian Serbs that despite the \ndeployment of the European Rapid Reaction Force [RRF], the United \nNations. would continue business as usual in Bosnia.\n  I have obtained a copy of that letter. I would note that the letter \nis addressed to H.E. Dr. Radovan Karadzic--the H.E. stands for His \nExcellency--a term usually reserved for dignitaries and government \nofficials, not alleged war criminals.\n  The letter reads, and I quote:\n\n       I wish to assure you that these theatre reserve forces will \n     operate under the existing United Nations peace-keeping rules \n     of engagement and will not in any way change the essential \n     peace-keeping nature of the UNPROFOR mission. While the \n     reserves will enhance UNPROFOR's security, the understanding \n     and cooperation of the parties themselves will be the best \n     guarantor of the force's continued effectiveness as an \n     impartial force. The United Nations, troop contributing \n     states and the Security Council have all recognized that the \n     reserve force cannot and will not be a substitute for a \n     political process aimed at an overall peaceful settlement of \n     the Bosnian conflict.\n\n  Once again, Yasushi Akashi did what he does best as the United \nNations' appeaser on the front lines: delivers good news to the Serbs, \nand bad news to the Bosnians.\n  This morning, we read that the French held secret negotiations with \nthe Serbs--in Pale and in the ethnically cleansed city of Zvornik. \nReportedly, the French promised that in return for the release of the \nU.N. hostages, NATO would not conduct any further airstrikes on Serb \npositions. A lot of people suspected that and maybe this now makes it a \nfact.\n  Mr. President, the message is crystal clear: The United Nations has \nabandoned its mandate of protecting the so-called safe areas and \nintends to continue to bend to the will of the Serbs. And, it has done \nso not in the Security Council through a vote, but in back rooms with \nSerb militants whom French President Jacques Chirac publicly called \n``Terrorists.''\n\n  When President Chirac met with congressional leaders he called for an \nend to the humiliation of the peacekeepers. In my view, letting war \ncriminals blackmail the leaders of the Western World is humiliating--\nand an absolute outrage.\n  This brings us to the matter of the rapid reaction force, which is \nintended by the British and French to protect the U.N. forces in \nBosnia. From these reports it is obvious that the rapid reaction force \nwill not change the way UNPROFOR conducts its business. In other words, \nUNPROFOR will not do the job it was tasked to do by the Security \nCouncil in numerous resolutions--whether or not the rapid reaction \nforce is deployed. In fact, the rapid reaction force appears designed \nto protect UNPROFOR so that it can continue not doing its job.\n  And this brings us finally to the question of why the United States \nshould subsidize the rapid reaction force, let alone the entire \nUNPROFOR operation. We know that the taxpayer's dollars are being \ndumped in a big black hole because international leaders do not have \nthe courage to do what is right and what is smart--and that is to \nwithdraw the U.N. forces and lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. Can we in \ngood conscience continue to appropriate funds for such a failure?\n  Well, the administration appears committed to this massive \nmultilateral mess. In today's New York Times, administration officials \nwere cited as considering the use of funds designated for humanitarian \naid to pay for a U.S. contribution of about $100 million to the rapid \nreaction force. While there are budgetary reasons such a shift would be \ndifficult, congressional opposition would likely be strong. The fact \nthat anyone in the administration is thinking along these lines is \nshocking. People in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia are hungry--they \ncannot eat European pride. Furthermore, virtually the only effective \nUnited States activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been the provision \nof emergency humanitarian assistance.\n  Mr. President, the U.N. operation in Bosnia is in a meltdown. Now is \nthe time to cut our losses, not sink more resources into a failed \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter I referred to be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               U.N. Peace Forces Headquarters,\n\n                                            Zagreb, June 19, 1995.\n     Dr. Radovan Karadzic,\n     Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the \n         Former Yugoslavia.\n       Dear Dr. Karadzic: I wish to inform you that the Security \n     Council has recently reviewed the latest report of the \n     Secretary-General on the implementation of the mandate of \n     UNPROFOR. On 16 June 1995, it adopted resolution 998 (1995), \n     a copy of which is attached for your information. This \n     resolution covers a number of different issues, including the \n     status of the safe areas, and makes provision for the \n     establishment of a rapid reaction capacity to enable UNPROFOR \n     to carry out its mandate in a secure and safe environment.\n       Despite the recent intensification in hostilities, the \n     United Nations and troop contributors remain committed to the \n     continued presence of UNPROFOR in order to alleviate the \n     suffering of all the people of Bosnia, and to facilitate the \n     earliest possible end to hostilities through peaceful means. \n     However, risks to UNPROFOR have increased dramatically and \n     there has been a marked lack of respect by all sides with the\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n     security, safety and freedom of movement of UNPROFOR \n     personnel. The Security Council has accepted the offer of a \n     number of countries to provide flexible and mobile reserve \n     military reinforcements in order to reduce the vulnerability \n     of UNPROFOR personnel and to enhance the Force's capacity to \n     carry out its humanitarian tasks.\n       I wish to assure you that these theatre reserve forces will \n     operate under the existing United Nations peace-keeping rules \n     of engagement and will not in any way change the essential \n     peace-keeping nature of the UNPROFOR mission. While the \n     reserve will enhance UNPROFOR's security, the understanding \n     and cooperation of the parties themselves will be the best \n     guarantor of the Force's continued effectiveness in an \n     impartial force. The United Nations, troop contributing \n     states and the Security Council have all recognized that the \n     reserve force cannot and will not be a substitute for a \n     political process aimed at an overall peaceful settlement of \n     the Bosnian conflict.\n       I would like to emphasize that assistance for the delivery \n     of humanitarian aid, and the protection of civilians from \n     deliberate attacks, continue to be central to UNPROFOR'S \n     mandate. Alleviation of the very serious humanitarian \n     situation created by recent events in Sarajevo and other \n     enclaves will be one of UNPROFOR's primary objectives. In \n     this regard, the Security Council has demanded that all \n     parties respect the status of the safe areas and has \n     underlined the need for their demilitarization by mutual \n     agreement, in order that attacks both into and out of the \n     safe areas cease forthwith. I am confident that urgent action \n     to achieve progress in this direction would be of enormous \n     benefit to all parties. It would go a long way towards \n     realizing an overall stabilization of the current situation.\n       The Secretary-General has, in his recent report on \n     UNPROFOR, emphasized that the United Nations cannot operate \n     in a political vacuum. In the past few days, leaders of the \n     international community have also repeatedly emphasized that \n     there can be no military solution to the conflict in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina, and the measures set out in Security Council \n     Resolution 998 (1995) should be seen in this light. In view \n     of the critical situation facing us all, I would urge you to \n     take advantage of the current international climate in order \n     that we may promote initiatives favourable to a dynamic and \n     comprehensive peace settlement.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Yasushi Akashi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9011-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there were a couple of reports that the \nAugust recess would start on August 4. That has not yet been \ndetermined. I saw in a couple of the Hill publications--one called the \nHill, and I think the other was Roll Call--that that matter had been \nsettled. We hope it will start as previously scheduled but it depends \non what unfinished business there may be. I think August 4 would be the \nday we hope to start the recess, but it may go into the next week. It \ncould be the 11th or even shortly after the 11th, if we have unfinished \nbusiness.\n  We still have some very major pieces of legislation to deal with. One \nis certainly regulatory reform. We are working, in a bipartisan effort, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to try to come together. If we can do that \nand complete action on that next week, that will be a big step in the \nright direction. I have been asked by the Democrat leader to sit down \nwith him next week on that issue.\n  Also, before the recess, we have agreed to take care of the gift \nreform legislation and lobbying reform legislation. Again, we are \nattempting to work in a bipartisan way.\n  I have asked Senator Lott to lead a group on our side to meet with a \nlike group on the Democratic side to see if we cannot come to some \nconclusion for good, sound gift reform and lobbying reform legislation.\n  Welfare reform is another very important issue that will take some \ntime to dispose of. I think it is fair to say--I can say on the \nRepublican side, we are having problems coming together on some of the \nissues. That may be true on the other side. But we believe we can \nresolve any differences, at least on this side. That is a matter we \nwant to do before the August recess.\n  In addition, there will be a number of appropriations bills that will \nbe ready for action and a number of conference reports that will be \nready for action.\n  Hopefully, in the month of July, we can consider crime legislation. \nThat will depend on whether or not the Judiciary Committee will have \nthe time to report out reform of the present crime statutes. Hopefully, \nagain, that will have bipartisan support.\n  I am just speaking here from memory. I may have left out some \ncritical pieces of legislation. But the point I want to make is that \nobviously we want to start the recess as early as we can, hopefully on \ntime. That decision has not been made. I know many of my colleagues \nhave already made commitments in their own States for meetings, meeting \nwith constituents, and I certainly want to honor all those commitments \nif we can. But the other side of the coin is, if we do not complete it, \nit means we are going to be here longer this fall. Hopefully, we can \narrive at some agreement that will accommodate nearly all the views of \nMembers on each side of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/23/senate-section/article/S9012-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECESS UNTIL 11 A.M., MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
