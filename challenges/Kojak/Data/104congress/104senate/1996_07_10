Mr. President, over the Fourth of July, I guess our break \nwas taken a little bit differently. Due to circumstances of a personal \nmatter in both my wife's family and my family, we did not get to spend \nas much time in our home State of Montana as we would have liked.\n  Generally, a couple rides on an airplane, but basically we drove \nacross this Nation, across the heartland of this Nation, all the way \nfrom the Rocky Mountains back to Washington, DC.\n  But I flew into California. We were talking yesterday about the \nencryption issue, an issue that allows people to encode their messages \nthat are sent on the information highway and that there is some \nreliance that those messages are only received by the folks they are \nintended for, and when the folks receive those messages, they have \nconfidence that it was sent by the right person and the message has not \nbeen tinkered with before they received it.\n  That happens to be something in this new technology, this information \nage, that we will be talking a lot about. But as I sat on the airplane, \nI met a young couple, and I opened the newspaper to the situation with \nthe FBI files at the White House, of which the young woman said, ``That \ndoesn't make a lot of difference to me,'' because she was a supporter \nof this President and she was going to vote that way anyway. I did \nnot argue with her. She did not know me from Adam, but I asked what she \ndid for a living and she said she was a computer analyst.\n\n  I said, ``Well, does your company do business with the Government?''\n  She said, ``Yes, we do.''\n  I said, ``In sensitive areas like defense or security, or whatever?''\n  And she said, ``Well, I don't know about those things.''\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\n  I said, ``Well, would it make any difference if your records were at \nthe White House?''\n  All at once, it started to become a thing of conversation. I did not \nsay anything more about it, but she and her husband talked about it for \nthe rest of the trip.\n  When we talk about this issue of encryption and key escrow and those \nkinds of new terms that will filter into the conversations of America, \nwe have to talk about trust. That is key--trust.\n  We look at the situation as it is with our young people today and we \nsay, ``Well, maybe midnight basketball didn't work.'' We know that \njuvenile crime is on the upswing again. It is up 11 percent. Juvenile \nmurders are up 8 percent. Juvenile robberies are up 16 percent. \nMarijuana use is up 200 percent. That tells me that our young people \nare in a sense of hopelessness; that we leaders have not talked enough \nabout trust and we have not talked enough about hope and what this \ngreat country offers. We only hear that there will not be money for \neducation. They are scared they will not be able to go to school after \nall the rhetoric that we hear.\n  We ought to be talking the other way around. It is what we talk about \nand how we put it. We should talk about hope and opportunity. Only this \ncountry offers all kinds of opportunities for young people in today's \nage. And they yearn for discipline. They want to talk about hope and \nwhat is out there, and this new world of technology offers that.\n  So when we think about encryption, we think about the new \ntechnologies, we hear those new words that are going into the \nconversations, but there is one old standard standby. It is who do we \ntrust and how do we tell our young people today, how do we tell them \nthat there is hope and their opportunities are greater than of any \ngeneration, because electronically they open the doors of opportunity \naround the world and it can be done in 5 seconds. It is trust.\n  We who are put in positions to represent a constituency teach our \nyoung every day. Some days we even use words. Some days we use words, \nand that is what I think this is about when we start talking about this \nissue and the issue of what goes on on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The keyword is an old standby word called trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7507-7", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAREWELL TO LORI STALEY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to my \nlegislative assistant, Lori Anne Staley. She logged over 4 years time \nwith me and I will certainly miss her.\n  Lori joined my staff almost in the beginning back in 1989 as a staff \nassistant. She quickly learned the ropes and helped to keep my office \nrunning back in the early days when many of us were still figuring out \nhow to get around the Capitol.\n  Although she is from Ohio she easily adapted to Montana and soon \nMontana adopted her. She has worked hard for Montana and Montanans \nappreciate all that she has done. Her biggest compliment is when people \nforget she is not a native Montanan.\n  Lori left my office for a couple of years and then came back, proving \nthat you can come home again. She returned as a legislative \ncorrespondent and after 2 months took over international trade and \nforeign relations as a legislative assistant, continuing to add to her \nlist of duties over the course of 3 years. Today she not only handles \ntrade, foreign relations, and defense issues, but she is also \nresponsible for my duties as a member of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee. She has been willing and able to tackle any \nissue and has a broad understanding of the way Washington works.\n  From trains, planes, and space shuttles, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nHaiti, and B-2 bombers, to GATT and NAFTA, Canadian Durum wheat, and \nproduct liability reform--Lori knew the issues well and was always able \nto keep me informed and up-to-date.\n  She was able to juggle her multiple issues while keeping the big \npicture in perspective and knowing how Montana fit into it. No matter \nhow big or small the task she had a good sense of how to get the job \ndone right. I teased her as being hard hearted, but I knew I could \nalways count on her for a clear assessment of any issue in a snap.\n  I admire her energy and devotion to her job and to Montana. We have \nspent many late nights together as it seems the Senate gets the most \nwork done in the wee hours of the day. Whether preparing for committee \nhearings or monitoring floor debate I knew she was working overtime to \nkeep things running smoothly.\n  In her 3 years as part of my legislative team her accomplishments \nhave numbered many. She was instrumental in helping agriculture \nshippers during the sunsetting of the Interstate Commerce Commission. \nShe planned a small business committee field hearing in Kalispell, MT \non proposed OSHA regulations for the timber industry--two issues which \ndidn't know anything at all about when she started. She has also \npromoted distance learning which was showcased in a Commerce \nsubcommittee hearing earlier this year. Whether working with NASA or \nthe Montana Department of Transportation her ability to work through \nproblems and get the job done shone through every time.\n  We will miss more than just Lori's work around the Office. Even in \nstressful times she managed to keep her good humor. Everyone on staff \nknew they could turn to her for an amusing story, some good advice, or \na helping hand. Indeed we will also miss her cheerful smile.\n  Lori has changed a great deal since she first arrived on Capitol Hill \n7 years ago and started her first job in my office. I know that neither \nof us will forget this period of time and I hope that she leaves my \noffice with a feeling of having made a difference. She has done almost \nevery job and covered almost every issue as a part of my staff and \nevery time she goes in with a smile and comes out on top.\n  Today she is moving on to start a new adventure. I'm certain that she \nwill miss all the people she's worked with here in Washington, DC, and \nback home in Montana. Everything she has learned and all of her \nexperiences will be a part of her. And in return when she moves to her \nnew job she will leave a little part of herself with us.\n  In closing, I would like to bid good luck, but not good-bye, to my \nlegislative assistant and friend, Lori Staley. I know she will go far. \nLori, thanks for your good work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] \nis recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7508-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7508-S7511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TEAM ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this debate about the so-called TEAM Act \nhas, unfortunately, produced more heat than light. I first began to \nfocus on the issue several months ago when I visited a small high-\ntechnology firm in my State, Lasertechnics, in Albuquerque, NM. \nLasertechnics is a very good employer and has on staff about 60 people.\n  The issues related to unions organizing are far from the minds of \nanyone in that firm, as far as I can tell. The company has about two \ndozen different teams discussing many task-oriented items. But some of \nthose teams have the potential of running into subjects considered \n``terms and conditions of employment,'' as that phrase is used in the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  Flex time to help bolster Asia-Pacific sales is one example that \nstands out in my mind. If the owner of that company, Gene Borque, just \ndecides one day to issue flex time schedules or a policy governing flex \ntime, then clearly there is no violation of the law since there is no \nunion in that company. If he has a team decide on a policy, and the \nteam enters into back-and-forth discussions with him on that subject, \nthen according to the NLRB, there probably is a violation of the law as \nit now stands.\n  This circumstance should be the focus of our discussion if we are \never able to get into a meaningful discussion about these issues in the \nfuture, because, in my view, Gene Borque, the owner of this company, \nshould not be in danger of violating the law by operating as he does \ntoday.\n  The issues being debated are very real. First of all, how can we \nassure employers the right to organize their companies to get the best \neffort and\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nsense of ownership from their workers? And at the same time, how can we \nassure employees that they retain an ability to organize into unions \nand to bargain on terms and conditions of employment free from the \nthreat of sham unions being established or manipulated by employers? \nThese are both legitimate goals. Several weeks ago it was my hope and \nmy belief that we could develop language to offer as a substitute for \nS. 295 that would satisfy both of these objectives.\n  I had hopes of offering an amendment that would substantially improve \nthe TEAM Act so that, first, there would be no ambiguity that workplace \nteams and nonunion workplaces were permitted under the law, and, \nsecond, that we would specify that teams that discuss terms and \nconditions of employment would have to comply with certain other \nrequirements to assure that company dominated or sham unions could not \nbe established and that workers would have a determinative role in any \ndiscussions on those terms and conditions of employment.\n  Mr. President, after several weeks of trying to find this common \nground to propose a substitute for the bill that we are considering, I \nhave concluded that it is not possible at this time. The organization \nof employers that has been formed to support the TEAM Act has \ndetermined to resist amendments and to drive toward passage of S. 295 \neven though this legislation faces a sure veto by the President. The \nlabor unions, on the other hand, have organized to oppose the TEAM Act. \nRelying on the President's promised veto, they have determined that the \nTEAM Act or any substitute for it which amends section 8(a)(2) of the \nNLRA should be opposed.\n  In my view, the concerns that the unions have about the TEAM Act that \nis before us are well founded. I do not want to get into a technical \ndiscussion about the legislation, but many people, including the \nChairman of the NLRB, Howard Gould, as well as the Dunlop Commission \nand others have argued that an adjustment is needed in section 8(a)(2) \nof the National Labor Relations Act because of recent decisions that \nhave blurred the definition of what are considered terms and conditions \nof employment.\n  S. 295 tries to remove the ambiguity by providing a sweeping umbrella \nover all workplace teams and any discussions. In my opinion, this opens \nthe window to the possibility of company dominated or sham unions. I \nhave long believed that we might be able to fix the language of the \nTEAM Act so as to maintain the flexibility that is required to fit with \nthe highly fluid nature of a modern workplace team and still build in \nprotections for workers' rights and interests in this process.\n  S. 295 needs to be fixed. We have not been able to do so. \nAccordingly, I will vote against the bill. I regret that the two sides \non this important issue cannot be brought together on common ground. \nSome of the explanation is in the atmosphere of hostility that has \ntraditionally surrounded labor-management issues in our country. In \npart, the result flows naturally from the very different views that the \ntwo sides have of the relationship between employees and employers. Of \ncourse, to some extent, the result is a natural consequence of the \npolitical season that we are in.\n\n  Although the script for what is to happen with this legislation this \nyear is known to us all, I hope that in the next Congress we can have a \nmore serious and constructive debate about this important set of \nissues.\n  In many companies throughout the country, the workplace of 1996 is \nnot the workplace that Congress was reacting to when the Wagner Act was \npassed in the 1930's. For many, the term ``empowering workers'' is not \njust hollow rhetoric. On the other hand, all employers do not concern \nthemselves with the rights and prerogatives of workers. The concerns \nthat unions have raised are well rooted in our Nation's history.\n  At a future date I hope we can see adoption of some well-reasoned and \nbalanced reforms to the law that clearly is not possible today. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, for allowing me to go forward \nfor just a few minutes.\n  I want to follow, very briefly, on what the Senator from New Mexico \nhas said and basically to say that I associate myself with his remarks, \nas sad as that conclusion is here.\n  This is a case of the TEAM Act where, it seems to me, both sides, as \nit were, labor and management, had some merit to their arguments. There \nshould have been a way to put this together and bring about some change \nin the law that recognizes, respects, and facilitates the extraordinary \nchanges--in some ways the revolution--that have gone on in labor-\nmanagement circles in this country that the team proposals and programs \nare part of, and thousands of employers throughout America, and yet to \nhave done that in a way that does not threaten the organized labor \nmovement and does not inadvertently, one hopes, open the door to some \nof the practices of the past, as Senator Bingaman has referred to, such \nas sham unions or employer dominated unions.\n  This was a case where reasonable people should have been able to sit \ndown and reach a reasonable conclusion that would have brought about \nchange. I really thank the Senator from New Mexico for the leadership \nhe showed in this in trying to make this happen. He is a consummately \nreasonable person and has tried to pursue in a rational way that course \nin this matter. I followed his actions and tried to support them, in \nterms of the work that he was doing as they were going along.\n  I regret that in the end he concluded that the amendment that he had \nprepared really could not be introduced because it was not going to \nfacilitate the kind of movement that is needed here to create change. \nSo the result, unfortunately, in this polarized environment is--\npolarized for exactly the reasons that the Senator from New Mexico \nstates; one, because the debate over this bill has in some sense \ncontinued a kind of labor-management negotiation with mistrust on both \nsides; and, also, it is obviously an election year.\n  The result of all this, I presume, is that Congress will pass this \nbill, but the President will veto it. Then we will be at the status \nquo, which is not, in this case, terrible because as some I talked to \nin this debate have said, well, maybe a lot of businesses are running \ngood employer-employee teams in their workplaces who are technically \nviolating the law, but the NLRB is not taking action against them \nunless, in those relatively few cases, there is a complaint associated \nwith an organization driven by a union, and then the penalty is to \norder them to stop doing what they are doing.\n  I wish we could have come to a better result. The truth is that these \nemployer-employee teams--I have seen some of them in Connecticut. When \nthey work well, they work very well. They not only are great for the \nworkers; they are great for the management and great for American \ncompetitiveness and great for job creation and the sustaining of \nexisting jobs. However, like everything else, they can be misused. They \ncan be misused in a way that runs right into some of the original goals \nof section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act. Again, there \nought to have been a way we could bring this together.\n\n  I regret the Senator from New Mexico reached the conclusion he did. I \nregret that there will not be a proposal here on the floor that I feel \nI can support. I am very, very sad that we as a body and I as one \nSenator reach that conclusion. I can only say that I hope that all of \nus can come back, both sides, outside of the Chamber and all of us \ninside the Chamber, next year and work with the executive branch at \nthat time to fashion a bill that will acknowledge the extraordinary \nsteps forward in labor-management relations, and yet the continuing \nneed to protect workers, both in their right to organize and in their \nright to be members of employee management associations that are not \nemployer dominated.\n  I thank the Chair. Again, I thank Senator Faircloth. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from North \nCarolina, Senator Faircloth, will be recognized.\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\n\n\n                     THE NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson said, ``To compel a \nman to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions \nin which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.'' At noon today, the \nU.S. Senate will hold a historic vote on legislation to repeal those \nprovisions of Federal law which require employees to pay union dues or \nfees as a condition of employment. This vote is long overdue for the \nworking men and women of this country.\n  Since I introduced the National Right to Work Act, 22 of my Senate \ncolleagues have joined me as cosponsors. We share the belief that \ncompulsory unionism violates a fundamental principle of individual \nliberty, the very principle upon which this Nation was founded. \nCompulsory unionism basically says that workers cannot and should not \ndecide for themselves what is in their best interest, that they need a \nunion boss to decide for them. I can think of nothing more offensive to \nour core founding principles which we celebrated on the Fourth of July, \na few days ago, than that principle that the working people of this \ncountry do not have the ability to decide for themselves.\n  With this bill, not a single word is added to Federal law. It simply \nrepeals those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailway Labor Act that authorizes the imposition of forced-dues \ncontracts upon working Americans. It simply does away with the \nrequirement that people have to belong to a union to hold a job.\n  I believe that every worker must have the right to join and \nfinancially support a labor union if that is what they want to do. \nEvery worker should have that right, of his own free will and accord, \nbut he should not be coerced to pay union dues just to keep his job. \nThis bill simply protects that right, and no worker would ever be \nforced into union membership unless he wants to be.\n  Union membership should be a choice that an individual makes based \nupon merits and benefits offered by the union. If a union truly \nbenefits its members, then they would not have to coerce them. If \nworkers had confidence in the union leadership, if the union leadership \nwas honest, upright, and forthright, then they would not need to coerce \ntheir members to join. A union freely held together by common interests \nand desires of those who voluntarily want to be members would be a \nbetter union than one in which members were forced to join. If the \nNational Right to Work Act were passed, nothing in Federal law would \nstop workers from joining a union, participating in union activity, and \npaying union dues.\n  Union officials who operate their organizations in a truly \nrepresentative, honest, democratic manner would find their ranks \ngrowing with volunteer members who are attracted by service, benefits, \nand mutual interests, not because they are forced against their will \nwith no options to be a member of a union and pay union fees in order \nto hold a job. In addition, voluntary union members would be more \nenthusiastic about union membership simply because they had the freedom \nto join and were not forced into it.\n  When Federal laws authorizing compulsory unionism are overturned, \nonly then will working men and women be free to exercise fully their \nright to work. When that time comes, they will have the freedom to \nchoose whether they want to accept or reject union representation and \nunion dues without facing coercion, violence, and workplace harassment \nby overbearing--disreputable, in many cases--union bosses.\n  A poll taken in 1995 indicates 8 out of 10 Americans oppose \ncompulsory unionism--8 out of 10 Americans do not think you should be \nforced to belong to a union to hold a job.\n  At noon today, it is my sincere hope that my colleagues will join me \nin defending the fundamental individual liberty of the right to work, \nand will support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks an editorial which appeared in today's Wall Street \nJournal, setting forth clearly why this bill should pass.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 10, 1996]\n\n                           Labor Independence\n\n       Today members of the U.S. Senate will be counted on a \n     fundamental issue of individual freedom: the right to work \n     without paying union dues or fees as a condition of \n     employment. It's not likely that the effort to remove \n     sections of the 60-year-old National Labor Relations Act that \n     authorize forced-dues contracts will pass. However, the vote \n     will serve as a useful political marker as to which Senators \n     want individual workers to have a say in whether they should \n     continue to pay the $5 billion a year in dues that private-\n     sector unions collect.\n       No one argues that unions haven't done a great deal of good \n     in representing their members and in the mutual aid programs \n     they've set up. But that cannot justify allowing the forced \n     collection of union dues from workers who don't want to pay \n     them. In many unions, upward of 75% of the dues money goes \n     for political and other activities that have nothing to do \n     with collective bargaining rights. This year unions didn't \n     bother to consult individual workers before they financed an \n     unprecedented $35 million propaganda campaign against the GOP \n     Congress. In its 1988 Beck decision, liberal Supreme Court \n     Justice William Brennan led the Court in ruling that workers \n     were entitled to a refund of dues money not used to represent \n     them, but the Clinton Administration has acted as if Beck \n     didn't exist. That makes today's vote to put Senators on \n     record on the issue of coerced dues all the more appropriate.\n       Union leaders themselves were once leery of laws allowing \n     forced membership in their organizations. Samuel Gompers, the \n     father of American labor, warned workers that ``compulsory \n     systems'' were ``not only impractical, but a menace to their \n     rights, welfare and their liberty.'' Public opposition to \n     compulsory unionism has been so great (upward of 70% in most \n     polls) that 21 states have passed ``right-to-work'' laws that \n     allow individuals to opt out of union membership. On the \n     national level, however, reform has been blocked by the \n     formidable power of the unions to raise campaign cash to \n     defeat their opponents.\n       North Carolina Senator Lauch Faircloth says the time is \n     right to test the power of union bosses with his bill to \n     remove language from federal labor law that authorizes \n     forced-dues contracts for workers. For the first time in a \n     generation, Senators from right-to-work states will be \n     required to choose between the political power of the unions \n     and the clearly expressed views of their voters. In the past, \n     even liberal Senators such as George McGovern felt compelled \n     to support their states' right-to-work laws. Today, 25 \n     Republican and 17 Democratic Senators represent states with \n     such laws. If all of them supported Senator Faircloth, his \n     legislation would pass easily. The fact that many will oppose \n     it deserves to be a campaign issue in the 16 right-to-work \n     states with Senate elections this fall.\n       Compulsory union dues are not merely an esoteric issue of \n     whether employers or unions hold the upper hand in federal \n     labor law. The issue goes to the heart of individual freedom. \n     Thomas Jefferson once wrote that ``To compel a man to furnish \n     contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which \n     he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.'' Today we will \n     learn how many Senators agree with Jefferson's sentiment.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. HELMS. I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina on \nhis excellent remarks about a very serious subject. I do not know \nwhether this Senate is going to try to act on this bill or not, but I \nwant him to know that I am honored to be a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Now, did I understand the Senator to say that four-fifths of the \nAmerican people support the concept that working people should not be \nforced to associate with or support any organization or class of \norganization as a condition of getting a job or keeping the job?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That is exactly what the American people believe.\n  Mr. HELMS. Maybe one of these days Congress will pay attention to 80 \npercent of the people.\n  Mr. President, the National Right to Work Act stipulates that \nemployers and unions may no longer force American workers to pony up \nunion dues as a condition of keeping their jobs. It is about freedom, \npurely and simply. It does not discourage union membership. The \nNational Right to Work Act merely says that unions have to garner their \nsupport the old-fashioned way--they have to earn it.\n  Of course, there are those who suggest that this legislation is \nsomehow antiunion, those who parrot the apocalyptic pronouncements of \nthe AFL-CIO that this is union-busting legislation.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I would suggest that those union bosses opposing the National Right \nto\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\nWork Act are insecure about their ability to earn the support of the \nworkers they purport to represent.\n  Opponents of the National Right to Work Act may also suggest that it \nis fair to require employees who enjoy the so-called benefits of union \nmembership to share in their costs. Union leaders will complain that \nthis Congress should not change this policy.\n  Mr. President, union leaders, having bought the horse, are just \ncomplaining about the price of oats.\n  Union bosses lobbied for and jealously guard the privilege of \nexclusive representation. They will not give it up. And if you have any \ndoubts about that, then the answer is not to oppose this modest effort \nto limit union coercion, but to repeal exiting provisions of Federal \nlabor law providing for exclusive representation. I recall that union \nlobbyists say that this is a free-rider bill. The National Right to \nWork Act is not so much a free-rider bill as existing Federal labor law \nis forced-rider legislation.\n  Doubtless, too, we will hear complaints that there are more important \nissues facing Americans. There will be claims that this issue is being \npursued by a narrow special interest.\n  My colleagues should bear in mind that polls indicate that fully 76 \npercent of the American people--including a clear majority of union \nmembers--support the principle of right to work. Just yesterday, the \nadministration and various lobbying groups were telling us that an \nincrease in the minimum wage should be passed because 70 percent of the \nAmerican people support it.\n  My suspicion is that that they find this high level of support for \nright to work to be less persuasive, just as they have failed to \nsupport our efforts to pass a balanced budget amendment, \nnotwithstanding the support of overwhelming majorities of Americans.\n  After all, this administration's Secretary of Labor seems more \ninterested in advancing the agenda of organized labor, rather then the \nrights and interests of all American workers. This is, after all, the \nadministration which attempted to rewrite Federal labor law for Federal \ncontractors, to deny to Federal contractors the right permanently to \nreplace striking employees. The courts have rightly voided this \nusurpation of congressional authority.\n  Furthermore, the Secretary of Labor said, and I quote, ``In order to \nmaintain themselves, unions have got to have some ability to strap \ntheir members to the mast. The only way unions can exercise \ncountervailing power is to hold their members' feet to the fire.'' \nWhether or not that mast is attached to a sinking ship in something \nthat the Secretary seems not to have considered.\n  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, those who oppose this bill \ntoday oppose freedom. They make clear their ratification of Secretary \nReich's sentiments, that this Congress believes that union bosses know \nbetter than individuals what is in the interests of individual American \nworkers. I would respectfully suggest that this is a concept foreign to \nthe American way of thinking. And does anyone seriously suggest that \nRepublican majorities were sent to both Houses of this Congress in \norder to perpetuate the power of union bosses to force Americans to \nsupport their narrowly radical social and political agenda?\n  But perhaps there is another explanation. After all, look at the most \nvocal of opponents to this act. Is it mere coincidence that they \nbenefit from the forced-dues, soft-money political contributions of big \nlabor? Is it just an accident that the bulk of union political \nactivities and contributions benefit my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle almost to the exclusion of contributions to the GOP? Is it \nsurprising that an administration which promises to veto this bill, if \npassed, has the nearly unanimous support of the leaders of the AFL-CIO?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the National Right to Work Act \nbecause it is the right thing to do. It is a vote for worker freedom, a \nvote for responsible unions. American workers deserve the protection of \na National Right to Work Act, the protection of a basic personal \nfreedom. American working men and women deserve to be able to work and \nfeed their families without paying tribute to anyone, much less a class \nof specially protected organizations.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He served the State of Alabama, the \nAlabama judicial system, and our Nation with dignity, prudence, \ncourage, and honor.\n  Joe received both a bachelor's degree and a law degree from the \nUniversity of Alabama. Even as a youth, Joe showed character in all \nthat he did providing a glimpse into the future of the wise, Christian \nadult, leader, and honorable jurist he would later become.\n  In 1990, Joe was awarded the Alabama Bar Association's Judicial Award \nof Merit, its highest award for outstanding and constructive service to \nthe legal profession in Alabama.\n  Joe's Christian values are reflected not only in the way he lived his \nlife, but in the many positive organizations which he led, founded, \nbelonged, and served. He was the past president of the Montgomery \nCounty Bar Association, and has served as a member, past president, \ntrustee, and founder. He also served diligently in the YMCA; Montgomery \nLion's Club; Lion's Club International Youth Day in Court Program, \nwhich he founded; Jimmy Hitchcock Memorial Award; Fellowship of \nChristian Athletes; Salvation Army; Capitol City Boys Club; STEP \nFoundation; Blue-Gray Association; Leadership Montgomery; the \nGovernor's Study Task Force on Drugs; Alabama Trial Lawyers' \nAssociation; Association of Trial Lawyers of America; American \nJudicature Society; Montgomery Magnet Grant Review Committee; and \nnumerous other legal, civic, and Christian groups. He was an elder at \nTrinity Presbyterian Church, where he served on the Christian education \ncommittee, congregational involvement committee, and long-range \nplanning committee. Joe also taught ninth grade Sunday School. In 1980, \nJoe was honored as YMCA Man of the Year in recognition of his service \nto youth in Montgomery.\n  Joe's list of accomplishments are reflective of the life he led, the \ntype of friend he was, and the positive contributions he made \nthroughout his life to his community and his fellow Alabamian. Not the \nleast of which was his role as husband and father. My heart goes out to \nJoe's family.\n  Joe's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a \nbetter place. His presence will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7511-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      1996 JULY QUARTERLY REPORTS\n\n  The mailing and filing date of the July Quarterly Report required by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, is Monday, July 15, \n1996.

COOKE AT THE PENTAGON FOR HIS CONTINUING SERVICE TO \n                               OUR NATION\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, several months ago, I participated in a \nceremony at the Pentagon to open an exhibit honoring the office of the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This was a significant \nmoment in recognizing the remarkable success of the Goldwater--Nichols \nlegislation, which reorganized the Department of Defense. However, this \nmoment would not have been possible without the help of the pentagon's \nDirector of Administration and Management, David O. (Doc)\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nCooke. Today, I would like to extend my personal appreciation to Doc \nCooke for his help in establishing this exhibit but primarily I want to \nthank him for his long and continuing career in public service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article on Doc Cooke \nthat was published in Government Executive be reprinted in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, Doc Cooke's association with our Nation's \narmed services began in World War II, when he served as an officer \naboard the battleship U.S.S. Pennsylvania. In 1947, he became a \ncivilian employee with the Navy in Washington, DC. He completed his law \ndegree from George Washington University in 1950 and, shortly \nthereafter, was recalled to active duty during the Korean war as an \ninstructor at the School of Naval Justice. Since that time, Doc Cooke \nhas rendered outstanding service to 14 different Secretaries of \nDefense. In 1958, he became a member of a task force on Department of \nDefense reorganization that was led by Secretary of Defense, Neil \nMcElroy. Under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, he served on a \nbriefing team that advised the Secretary on issues related to \norganization and management. In his dual role as the Director of \nAdministration and Management and Director of Washington Headquarters \nServices, Doc Cooke has oversight responsibilities for more than 1,800 \nemployees throughout an impressive array of offices at the Pentagon, \nincluding the Directorate for Organizational and Management Planning, \nDefense Privacy Office, OSD Historical Office, Quality Management \nOffice, Directorate for Budget and Finance, Directorate for Real Estate \nand Facilities, Directorate for Correspondence and Directives, \nDirectorate for Personnel and Security, Directorate for Information \nOperations and Reports, Directorate for Federal Voting Assistance \nProgram, and the Office of General Counsel. The high level of energy \nand competence that Doc Cooke brings to his job has earned him the \ntitle of ``Mayor of the Pentagon'' from his friends and colleagues.\n  Doc Cooke has always recognized that people are the driving force \nbehind any organization's successes and shortcomings. His determination \nto never lose sight of the human factor in dealing with organizational \nand administrative issues has been a key contributing factor to the \nsuccess that he has enjoyed throughout his career. Doc's ability and \nsuccess in communicating with others is evident not only in his \nprofession, but also in his involvement in community service. In 1992, \nhe helped launch a program in Washington, DC, to encourage high school \nstudents to pursue careers in public service. This led to the \nestablishment of a Public Service Academy. The Public Service Academy \nworks closely with Federal agencies in planning the school's \ncurriculum, establishing internship opportunities for students, and \nproviding counseling for both students and their families. Last year \nthere were 28 seniors at the Academy. Of that total, 25 were accepted \ninto college and 3 found employment. This type of success is a shining \nexample of the integrity and compassion with which Doc Cooke approaches \nboth his profession and his community.\n  Last year, Doc Cooke received the Government Executive Leadership \nAward from the National Capital Area Chapter of the American Society \nfor Public Administration. This award was given in recognition of his \nstrong leadership throughout his outstanding career in the Federal \nGovernment. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in thanking \nDoc Cooke for his continuing service to our Nation. I hope that he will \ncontinue to serve for many years to come. We wish him, his wife, \nMarion, and his entire family every success for the future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the Government Executive, September 1995]\n\n                         Mayor of the Pentagon\n\n                          (By A.L. Singleton)\n\n       David O. Cooke, this year's winner of Government \n     Executive's annual award for leadership during a career in \n     federal service, may have a tough time deciding where to \n     display his plaque. After 37 years in Defense Department \n     management, Cooke has a Pentagon office that is crammed full \n     of trophies and medallions praising his dedication to public \n     service, executive development and good government.\n       Awards compete for wall space with photographs of Cooke and \n     a variety of associates from pals to presidents. There's a \n     shot of Cooke posing with radio/television personality \n     Willard Scott, each man covering his bald pate with a silly \n     wig. There's a picture of Cooke with President Clinton at the \n     White House.\n       But perhaps the photograph that best represents Cooke's \n     career shows him seated and grinning broadly in front of 9 of \n     the 14 Secretaries of Defense with whom he has worked.\n       Cooke is director of administration and management and \n     director of Washington Headquarters Services for DoD. This \n     means, among other things, he is in charge of the operation, \n     maintenance and protection of the Pentagon Reservation, which \n     spans 280 acres on the Virginia side of the Potomac River and \n     includes not only the Pentagon and its power plant but also \n     the Navy Annex and numerous other DoD buildings in the \n     National Capital Region. He oversees some 1,800 employees, \n     controls 20,000 parking spaces, runs a quality-management \n     unit and directs organizational and management planning for \n     the Department of Defense.\n       Cooke is often called ``the mayor of the Pentagon''--a \n     nickname that reflects the power his office wields over day-\n     to-day life in the Defense Department's huge headquarters \n     operations. Beyond the mundane tasks of ensuring adequate \n     cooling and equitable parking, Cooke's job requires a deep \n     understanding of the theory and practice of management in one \n     of the world's most complex enterprises. Yet most people, \n     from the workers who clean his office all the way up to the \n     Secretary of Defense, call him ``Doc.'' A man who doesn't \n     take his many impressive titles too seriously, Cooke enjoys \n     the familiarity.\n\n\n                      from teaching to task forces\n\n       The Doc Cooke story began 74 years ago in Buffalo, N.Y. His \n     parents were schoolteachers and that was what he also set out \n     to be, receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from the \n     State University of New York. World War II took him out of \n     the classroom and onto the decks of a battleship, the USS \n     Pennsylvania, where he served as an officer throughout the \n     war. Afterward, he returned to Buffalo to teach high \n     school.\n       Then, in 1947, three events changed his life. He entered \n     law school, met and married fellow law student Marion \n     McDonald and accepted an offer to become a civilian employee \n     of the Navy in Washington, D.C. Once settled in the capital, \n     he resumed law studies at night and received an LL.B. from \n     The George Washington University in 1950.\n       When the Korean War began, Cooke was recalled to active \n     duty, this time as an instructor at the School of Naval \n     Justice. Thereafter followed a stint as a maritime lawyer for \n     the Navy in New York. In 1957, he was reassigned to the Judge \n     Advocate General's Washington staff and a year later joined a \n     task force on DOD reorganization spearheaded by Secretary \n     Neil McElroy. This was the start of a highly specialized \n     career in military organization and management that would \n     lead him to the top ranks of federal civil service. ``I never \n     effectively got back to the Navy,'' Cooke recalls, even \n     though he remained on active duty for nine more years.\n       One of Cooke's most vividly remembered assignments of those \n     early years was to Robert McNamara's briefing team on \n     organizational and management issues, which the new Secretary \n     formed in 1961. McNamara intended to institute sweeping \n     changes in Defense organization, and he wanted a small group \n     to advise him.\n       Led by Solis Horowitz, a Harvard lawyer who eventually \n     became DOD's assistant secretary for administration, the \n     group consisted of Cooke, representing the Navy, Army officer \n     John Cushman and Air Force officer Abbott Greenleaf. Cushman \n     and Greenleaf ``both retired as three-star generals,'' Cooke \n     observes, ``so two out of the three became eminently \n     successful, and I was the guy who wasn't.''\n\n\n                     The Cooke School of Management\n\n       Such self-deprecating wit is classic Cooke. ``He might make \n     fun of himself, but not someone else,'' says DOD historian \n     Alfred Goldberg. ``He has a good sense of humor and uses it \n     in dealing effectively with people.''\n       Rossyln Kleeman, a distinguished executive-in-residence at \n     the George Washington University's School of Business and \n     Public Management who has served alongside Cooke in several \n     public-employee organizations, agrees. ``I've listened to a \n     lot of Doc's speeches,'' she says, ``and after an opening \n     joke or two, he will invariably have his audiences in \n     stitches.''\n       Cooke readily admits to using humor as a management tool. \n     One of the keys to success, he believes, is ``taking your \n     job, but not yourself, very seriously.''\n       Another, Cooke says, is a managerial style based on people. \n     ``You can think about an organization in terms of its wiring \n     diagram,'' Cooke explains, ``or its skeletal structure or the \n     task skills you need to make it function the way you want. Or \n     you can think in terms of the people involved. And to loosely \n     paraphrase the apostle Paul, the greatest of these is people.\n       ``When I get complaints, and I get a lot of them, from \n     managers who say that people who work for them aren't doing \n     what they're\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n     supposed to be doing, I always ask: `Have you told these \n     people? Have you explained to them what you expect?' Very \n     often I find they haven't gotten the guidance and direction \n     they should have gotten.\n       ``People constitute our most important resource,'' Cooke \n     concludes, ``and so often, we treat them like dirt.''\n       Cooke practices what he preaches, say three senior \n     executives who have worked at the heart of his 11-member \n     Pentagon management team.\n       Doc ``is very good at getting along with people, no matter \n     who they are,'' says Arthur H. Ehlers, who recently retired \n     from his post as director of organizational and management \n     planning in Cooke's office after 25 years.\n       Cooke has always maintained good relationships with members \n     of Congress and with leaders in the executive branch, says \n     Walter Freeman, another longtime top aide who is director of \n     real estate and facilities for DoD, ``and it's not because he \n     treats them differently from anyone else.''\n       Leon Kniaz, another key assistant who recently retired \n     after a decade as director of personnel and security, \n     elaborates. Cooke, he says, ``has always had an open-door \n     policy and listens well to people. There isn't anybody who \n     walks into that office and talks with Doc who doesn't think \n     that he or she has become a personal friend . . . [Cooke] is \n     people-oriented, and I think that comes through.''\n       Yet Cooke is no pushover. ``He doesn't just tell people \n     what they want to hear,'' says Kniaz. ``He knows how to say \n     no, and I've heard him do so in meetings where participants \n     were expecting him to say yes.''\n       And when Cooke is fighting for a cause in which he \n     believes, he fights hard, his associates agree. Perhaps \n     nowhere in his career is this more evident than in the \n     stubborn campaign he waged to launch the current renovation \n     of the Pentagon.\n\n\n                          A Bureaucratic Coup\n\n       Cracks in the walls, corroded pipes and frequently \n     overloaded electrical circuits attest to 50 years of neglect \n     in the upkeep of the Pentagon by the General Services \n     Administration, the agency charged with maintaining and \n     leasing most federal buildings. (See ``Operation Renovate,'' \n     February.)\n       ``For years,'' says Freeman, who joined Cooke as a tenant \n     of the Pentagon in 1983, ``Doc tried to get GSA to renovate. \n     But it was a very expensive job, and DoD was paying big rent \n     to GSA and was sort of cash cow. So GSA was reluctant.'' \n     Although the ``rent'' DoD paid GSA to look after the Pentagon \n     injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the Federal \n     Buildings Fund each year, GSA would not finance the sweeping \n     renovations needed. Cooke saw that the only way out of the \n     dispute was to stage a coup.\n       ``Doc went to Congress and asked that the ownership of the \n     Pentagon be transferred to DoD,'' recalls Freeman, ``so we \n     would be, in effect, our own landlord and could do the job \n     ourselves. He set up what became known as a `Horror Board,' \n     and took it with him every time he would go up on the Hill to \n     testify.''\n       The Horror Board was a flat panel to which Doc affixed \n     examples of Pentagon decay. ``There would be pieces of \n     rusting pipe, damaged wiring, pieces of asbestos and all \n     sorts of things that showed the building was falling apart,'' \n     Freeman says. ``New exhibits would appear periodically, and \n     Doc would point to these things and say: `Just look at this. \n     See how bad conditions are.' Finally Congress agreed, and one \n     Member said, `All right, Doc, but you aren't bringing that \n     thing up here again, are you?' ''\n       Now, Freeman points out, the Pentagon Reservation is owned \n     by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and an orderly, \n     12-year renovation project is under way. ``I can't think of \n     anyone else who could have, or would have, done this,'' \n     Freeman says. ``There's even a special Pentagon Renovation \n     Revolving Fund established to pay for the project.'' \n     Estimates put the cost of the Pentagon overhaul at $1.2 \n     billion.\n\n\n                              after hours\n\n       Somewhere in between saving the Pentagon's buildings and \n     planning the never-ending reorganizations of Defense \n     management structures, Cooke has found time to be an active \n     member of good-government groups and a leader of community \n     service projects.\n       He also has played prominent roles in government-wide \n     initiatives. He was, for example, a leader in the President's \n     Council on Management Improvement (PCMI) while that group was \n     active, and he currently chairs the Combined Federal \n     Campaign's Washington-area coordinating committee. For years \n     he's been a supporter of the Public Employee Roundtable--\n     contributing a key staffer through an Intergovernmental \n     Personnel Act assignment--and he often reflects with pride on \n     the Roundtable's success in spreading the annual celebration \n     of Public Service Recognition Week to dozens of communities. \n     Today, if asked, he'll acknowledge with a chuckle the little-\n     known fact that his office provides a good share of the \n     funding for Vice President Gore's National Performance \n     Review.\n       Cooke has been a leader in two professional groups in the \n     field of public administration--the National Academy of \n     Public Administration (NAPA) and the American Society for \n     Public Administration (ASPA).\n       Sometimes, with Cooke's encouragement, these groups combine \n     in support of a single project. This was the case with a 1992 \n     initiative to reach out to students at Anacostia High School \n     in one of Washington's poorest areas. The idea was to set up \n     a Public Service Academy, with the goals of sparking \n     students' interest in public service careers--and in their \n     academic work. NAPA the National Capital Area Chapter of ASPA \n     and the PCMI were among those who offered early support. \n     ``I'm very pleased with that venture,'' Cooke says, beaming. \n     ``There's nothing else like it in the area.''\n       Federal agencies lend three managers to the Academy each \n     year to work with the faculty in establishing curriculum, \n     arranging visits to and internships at government offices, \n     coordinating special events and offering counseling to \n     students and their families.\n       While Anacostia High has a graduation rate of only 55 \n     percent, 90 percent of the Academy's students graduate. Of \n     the 28 seniors who matriculated from the Academy this June, \n     25 were accepted by colleges, and 3 found jobs. ``I think \n     that's pretty good, by just about any standards,'' says \n     Cooke.\n       Cooke also works to secure further education for government \n     workers. Anita Alpern, a distinguished adjunct professor at \n     American University's School of Public Affairs, notes that \n     Cooke has been a strong supporter of the Federal Executive \n     Institute and of American University's Key Executive Program, \n     a master's program in public administration for government \n     employees. ``And,'' she says, ``he does all this as a firm \n     believer that education should not stop after you've got a \n     job, it should continue so you can do that job better.''\n       Cooke explains the volume of his extra curricular \n     commitments: ``I don't think you can do the best job if you \n     just put in your 40 hours and go home. I know that I can do \n     better here in my office because of the extra time I spend \n     networking and learning from others outside my office.''\n\n\n                      They Can Keep the Gold Watch\n\n       For now, Cooke has no plans to retire, which is good news \n     for his friends at the Pentagon. ``I don't know anyone who \n     would not shudder at the thought of Doc retiring,'' says \n     Freeman. ``And why should he? He's doing what's fun for him \n     and good for the country. Why should he turn to something \n     that's not so interesting?''\n       Federal management is still Cooke's passion. ``There are \n     not many higher callings,'' he says. He's passed this belief \n     onto his three children, all of whom have federal careers.\n       Cooke's response to public cynicism about government is to \n     say that, ``on balance, our [governing] system has worked \n     well. There have been enormous innovations, especially at \n     state and local levels. We do face serious problems in our \n     society today, but many of them have little to do with \n     government per se.''\n       Cooke maintains an external optimism. Citing, as he often \n     does, classic philosophical literature, Cooke borrows from \n     Voltaire as he says: ``This is the best of all possible \n     worlds because it is the only possible world. We just have to \n     keep working on it.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          The Leadership Award\n\n       The NCAC/Government Executive Leadership award was \n     established five years ago to recognize distinguished careers \n     in the federal service. The award is cosponsored by the \n     National Capital Area Chapter of the American Society for \n     Public Administration. The roster of winners:\n       1995--David O.

Mr. President, yesterday, I voted for legislation to \nincrease the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour over the next 2 \nyears. Though this is a necessary increase, regrettably, Senators did \nnot have a chance to vote for an ideal package.\n  First, it is essential that employers be given adequate time to \nprepare to implement the proposed increase. For this reason, I voted \nfor the Bond amendment, though I felt delaying the increase to January \n1, 1997, was too long. In my view, a reasonable effective date for the \nincrease would have been September 1, 1996.\n  As passed by the Senate, H.R. 3448 would be effective retroactively \nto July 1, 1996, leaving employers with no adjustment period. This is \nunfortunate, in my view.\n  Second, I also believe a training wage is crucial for those entering \nthe work force, particularly given our efforts to reform the welfare \nsystem. While many of my colleagues contend that increasing the minimum \nwage will encourage welfare recipients to obtain gainful employment, I \nam afraid the increase\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nwill actually reduce the availability of new positions.\n  Congress has spent the better part of 2 years developing and refining \nwelfare reform legislation. All of the major bills include tough work \nparticipation programs. And most would require the States to have 50 \npercent of their welfare recipients off of the rolls in the next 6 \nyears. Even if another 15 to 20 percent are granted hardship \nexceptions, the States will still be hard pressed to find enough jobs \nto meet the strict work requirements imposed by this legislation.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, approximately 20,000 families are now on \npublic assistance. If 20 percent of these families are exempt from the \nwork requirement, that leaves 16,000 families who must find their way \noff of welfare in the next 6 years. Even if Rhode Island must find jobs \nfor only half of these families, we are talking about 8,000 entry-level \njobs. Given the stagnant economy within my State, that could prove a \nvery difficult requirement to meet.\n  Despite the fact that these new workers will undergo intensive job \ntraining and must also learn important life skills, such as being \npunctual for work, most former welfare recipients will qualify for no \nmore than entry-level positions. While there may be a few exceptions, \nmost will have to prove themselves before they will be given greater \nopportunities in the workplace.\n  To retain some incentive for employers to hire and train welfare \nrecipients, I believe a strong and effective training wage at the \ncurrent minimum of $4.25 per hour should be included in H.R. 3448.\n  Despite my concern that the Bond amendment contained a 6-month \ntraining wage, which in my view is too long, I voted for it. In \ncontrast, the Kennedy alternative would have provided only a 30-day \ntraining wage, limited to those under 20 years of age. This provision \nwould not have given employers the needed incentive to take a chance on \nhiring a welfare recipient.\n  As passed by the Senate, the training wage included in H.R. 3448 has \na duration of 3 months, but unfortunately is limited to those under 20 \nyears old. I would have preferred no age limitation on the provision to \nensure its full utility in moving people from welfare to work.\n  Third, in my view, small businesses should have some form of \nexemption from the minimum wage increases proposed in H.R. 3448. Very \nfew employers who own small businesses qualify for the current \nexemption, which is flawed and unworkable.\n  For this reason, I voted for the Bond amendment. This amendment would \nhave enabled employers with gross incomes of less than $500,000 to \ncontinue paying the current minimum wage of $4.25 per hour, while \nlarger businesses would have been required to comply with the increase.\n  Regrettably, as approved by the Senate, the final version of H.R. \n3448 contained no change in current law with respect to the treatment \nof small businesses. And hurting America's small businesses, Mr. \nPresident, places big hurdles on the road to economic recovery.\n  In summary, I am hopeful that some of these problems can be reviewed \nand corrected before H.R. 3448 becomes law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7513-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RIGHT TO WORK FOR LESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate will take up the Right to \nWork Act. This legislation hurts union members by giving nonmembers a \nfree ride to get union-negotiated benefits without contributing their \nfair share--or any money at all--to defray the costs. By repealing \nparts of the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act \nwhich give each State the right to determine whether union security \nagreements should be permissible in that State, this bill would make \nsuch agreements unlawful in all States. Mr. President, this is bad \npublic policy.\n  Currently, the National Labor Relations Act allows States to prohibit \nunion security clauses but does not preempt State law if a State \nchooses to allow such agreements. That permits employers and unions to \nagree, if they wish, that employees will be required to give financial \nsupport to the union. My State of Massachusetts has chosen to permit \nsuch agreements, and workers are the beneficiaries. What the workers in \nmy State of Massachusetts get from this is higher wages, greater \nbenefits which protect them and their families, and a higher standard \nof living.\n  This bill unfairly tilts the playing field in favor of employers and \nagainst labor unions. Under Federal law, the union is responsible for \nrepresenting employees in the bargaining unit even if they pay nothing \ntoward the union's expenses. Under right-to-work legislation, these \nemployees get union-negotiated higher wages and benefits as well as \nunion representation during grievance proceedings without contributing \na dime. Giving nonmembers a free ride to get union-negotiated benefits \nwithout contributing to defray the costs is unfair, and in the long run \nwill weaken the ability of unions to obtain favorable wages and \nbenefits for all workers in a unionized company.\n  Republicans are insisting on preempting State law despite the fact \nthat only 21 States have seen fit to enact right-to-work laws since \nthey were deemed lawful, 18 of these prior to 1959. And just last year \nlegislatures in six States, Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New Hampshire, \nNew Mexico, and Oklahoma, defeated statewide right-to-work bills. It is \nnoteworthy that three of these are Republican-controlled legislatures.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nforce their sense of judgment and propriety on my State of \nMassachusetts and take away a free choice that my State ought to have \nand has always had. Simply speaking, if a State does not want right-to-\nwork laws then these laws should not be imposed on it because some \npeople here in the Senate more greatly value their own judgment on this \nissue than they do the judgment of the people of Massachusetts. I might \npoint out that most of the Senators voting to do this voted against \nraising the minimum wage yesterday. This goes too far, Mr. President.\n  The Republicans' decision to couple the right-to-work bill--which has \nnever been subject to hearings or markup--with the TEAM Act underscores \ntheir true disinterest in helping working Americans. And as they decry \nthe role of big government in the lives of working Americans, the \nRepublicans go ahead and tell the people of Massachusetts that they \nknow better, that they know what the people of Lowell or Lawrence or \nSpringfield or Boston or Hyannis want.\n  Right-to-work laws have not brought economic bonanzas to States that \nhave adopted them. Not 1 of the 21 right-to-work States has a pay level \nabove the national average and not 1 ranks in the top 15 States for \nannual workers' pay. This bill ought to be called the right-to-work-\nfor-less bill.\n  Union security clauses are negotiated by a democratically elected \nunion and the employer. Coming on the heels of Independence Day, \nopposing this bill is the right thing to do for the American worker, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7514-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1745, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1745) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1997 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate has completed many long hours \nof debate on S. 1745, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1997.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, my good\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nfriend Senator Nunn, for his insight, wisdom, and devotion to our \nNation. He and I have always worked to provide our Armed Forces with \nthe direction and resources they need to carry out their difficult \nresponsibilities. Our future collective efforts will be diminished by \nhis absence.\n  Senator Nunn was named chairman of the ad hoc Subcommittee on \nManpower and Personnel in 1974 and he served in that capacity until \n1981. In 1983, he became the ranking minority member and in 1987 he \nbecame the chairman of the committee. He served with distinction in \nthat capacity for 8 years, and earned the respect of leaders around the \nglobe for his wisdom, statesmanship, and insight. A hallmark of his \ntenure, and a basis for his effectiveness, was the trustworthy and \nbipartisan manner in which he conducted the committee's business. Our \nNation owes Senator Nunn its deepest appreciation for his truly \ndistinguished service.\n  I would also like to recognize the outstanding contributions of \nSenators Cohen and Exon, who are departing the Senate. They have worked \nand fought hard to preserve our national security, and provide for the \nwell-being of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deep appreciation also to the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, who has been most helpful \nin every way in bringing this bill to final passage. He is a fine and \nable leader of whom the Senate can be proud.\n  I also want to thank all the members from both sides of the \ncommittee, and particularly Senator Warner and Senator McCain, for \ntheir leadership and assistance on the floor.\n  In addition, I would like to commend the entire staff of the \nCommittee on Armed Services for their dedication and support. I would \nlike to recognize each of them individually for their effort on this \nbill. I will soon ask unanimous consent that a list of the committee \nstaff be printed in the Record.\n  I also want to recognize and thank Greg Scott and Charlie Armstrong, \nthe legislative counsels who crafted the language of this bill.\n  We have achieved a number of important successes in this bill, and I \ncommend my colleagues for their good judgment. Among these successes \nare:\n  Increasing the budget request by $11.2 billion to revitalize the \nprocurement, and research and development accounts, which form the core \nof future readiness;\n  Significantly improving quality of life programs for our troops and \ntheir families, including funds for housing, facilities, and real \nproperty maintenance;\n  Authorizing a 3-percent pay raise for military members and a 4-\npercent increase in the basic allowance for quarters, to arrest part of \nthe decline in compensation;\n  Establishing a dental health care insurance program for military \nretirees and their families, to keep faith with those who have kept \nfaith with our Nation;\n  Increasing the level of funding requested in the President's budget \nfor Department of Defense counternarcotics activities, to combat the \nflow of illegal drugs;\n  Authorizing increases for the Space and Missile Tracking System, \ncruise missile defense programs, and ballistic missile defense advanced \ntechnologies;\n  Accelerating the Department of Energy's phased approach to tritium \nproduction, and upgrading tritium recycling facilities; and\n  Providing funding for essential equipment for the Active, Guard, and \nReserve components.\n  These are important achievements that reflect significant bipartisan \neffort, both within the committee and on the Senate floor. I urge my \ncolleagues to endorse this bill with a solid vote of approval, to \nsupport our men and women in uniform who go in harm's way every day to \nprotect our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of staff I referred to earlier \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     Armed Services Committee Staff\n\n\n                                Majority\n\n       Les Brownlee, Staff Director.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Thurmond very much for his \ngracious remarks concerning my participation in this bill and also my \nparticipation over the last 24 years in the Defense authorization \nprocess and matters affecting our national security.\n  I also say to my friend from South Carolina that I identify with and \ncompletely support his remarks about two outstanding members of our \ncommittee, Senator Exon on the Democratic side and Senator Cohen on the \nRepublican side. These two individuals have made truly enormous \ncontributions to our Nation's security.\n  I have worked with Senator Exon on many different matters over the \nyears. He has been a stalwart on strategic matters, and really has made \nimmense contributions to our overall security.\n  Senator Cohen and I have joined together time after time in working \non matters of great importance, including the special operating forces \nwhere he truly has been an expert and a leader. Senator Cohen is an \nexpert on Asia and also has all sorts of legislative interests beyond \nthe Defense Committee. But he has made tremendous contributions to the \nmen and women who serve our Nation and to the taxpayers of our Nation. \nThese two individuals, Senator Cohen and Senator Exon, truly will be \nmissed.\n  In the brief time allotted to us today, I will defer my detailed \nexpression of appreciation to members of the committee and staff for \ntheir dedicated service in securing passage of this legislation until \nwe act on the conference report.\n  But I would like to summarize my thoughts at this time.\n  First and foremost, I would like to thank our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Thurmond. Through his leadership, his strength, and his \nsteadfast and dedicated commitment to the national defense, this bill \nis about to pass. It is my honor and privilege to work with him on all \nof the committee matters, and indeed have had the great pleasure of \nworking with him over the years. I know that his service will continue \nwith the strength and leadership that he has had in the past.\n  I am also grateful to all of the other committee members on both \nsides of the aisle who have dedicated themselves to this important \nbill. Our subcommittee staff have done yeomen service on this bill. \nThey deserve much credit for the passage of the bill. We brought a \nsound, good defense bill to the floor.\n  There were a number of concerns that have now been ironed out. I \nthink of such as demarcation, as in the ballistic missile and theater \nmissile defense area, and also regarding the ABM Treaty; the \nmultilateral provision that was in the bill. Both of those have been \ngreatly improved on the floor. It is my strong impression that this \nbill will be acceptable to the administration.\n  We have a real challenge in the House-Senate conference because there \nare a number of provisions that clearly would not be acceptable to the \nadministration. In the House bill, we have to prevail upon those issues \nif we are going to have a Defense bill signed into law this year.\n  The Senate also adopted a provision sponsored by Senator Lugar, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nDomenici, and myself to bolster our defenses against weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, both \nat home and abroad. We need no reminder that we are in an era of \nterrorism now. We spent all day yesterday in the hearing regarding the \ntragedy that took place in Saudi Arabia. Of course, our heart goes out \nto all of the families and to the men and women involved in that who \nwere serving our Nation.\n\n  The provision that passed the Senate in this bill improved existing \nprograms, such as the Nunn-Lugar program designed to stop proliferation \nof nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons at its source, primarily \nthe former Soviet Union. But the primary new threat is on domestic \npreparedness against terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction, such \nas chemical, biological, and nuclear.\n  It is very, very clear by the hearings that we have had in the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, as well as other hearings, \nthat we are not prepared as a nation to deal with chemical or \nbiological attack. We have a long way to go in the overall area of \ngetting our policemen, our firemen, and our health officials able to \nhandle one of these threats, if it ever comes. But primarily our effort \nmust continue to be to stop the sources of this proliferation at the \nvery beginning before they leave the country where the weapons are, \nwhere the scientists are, and where the technology is; and also to make \nsure, if that does happen, that we stop those weapons at our own \nborders before we have to deal with the attacks. But we have to have a \ntiered defense against this growing threat.\n  I think we will have an even stronger bill in conference since the \nSenate has taken action on the floor. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important defense measure.\n  The cooperation and help exhibited by all Senators, floor staff, \nparliamentarians, clerks, the Reporters of Debates, attorneys, and the \nLegislative Counsel's Office is very much appreciated by this manager \nof the bill. I am sure the chairman feels likewise.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have to express my appreciation to the \nsuperb committee staff on both sides of the aisle, and to our two staff \ndirectors, Les Brownlee with the majority and Arnold Punaro with the \nminority. They have done a magnificent job of managing and motivating \nin order to keep this bill on track and moving.\n  I particularly want to express my appreciation to Les Brownlee, who \nhas just become the staff director, although he has been a stalwart \nboth in his service to our Nation in the Army as well as his service on \nthis committee. But he has truly done a tremendous job as staff \ndirector on this bill. We have enjoyed very much working with him in \nhis new capacity, as we did in his former capacity.\n  I appreciate the hard work of both of the staffs. I will have more to \nsay about them when we get the conference report back. They are not \nthrough working yet. So I do not want to overcongratulate them until we \nget through with the bill and we actually have it ready for conference.\n  I thank the chairman for his dedication.\n  I thank all of the members of our staff for their sacrifices which \nthey have endured, and their families, in order to bring this bill to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, as we conclude the debate on the national Defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1997 I would like to take a moment \nto bring to the Senate's attention recent remarks made by a former \nSenate colleague and a valued friend, Alan Dixon.\n  Last year, Alan Dixon had the difficult task of chairing the 1995 \nBase Closure Commission. While some may not agree with various aspects \nof the Commission's findings, the Commission, under the tremendous \nleadership of Alan Dixon, fulfilled its obligation to make fair \nassessments of Department of Defense recommendations for base closures \nand realignments, to review additional closure and realignment options, \nand to make final recommendations to the President on ways in which the \nDepartment of Defense must reduce its excess infrastructure.\n  DOD and the military services are executing these final BRAC \ndecisions and affected local communities are making, plans for reuse \nand economic development. Mr. President, there is no easy part to base \nclosure--the final recommendations were not easy for the Commission, \nimplementation of the final decisions by the services is not easy, and \nbase reuse by local communities is not easy. Not easy, but a necessary \npart of the Department's ability to afford modernization and readiness \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, Alan Dixon made a speech before the American Logistics \nAssociation Conference on June 18 where he summarized the 1995 Base \nClosure Commission's actions and commented on what should be considered \nin terms of a future round of base closure. In his remarks, he pointed \nout, as senior military and civilian defense leaders have also \nindicated, that excess capacity and infrastructure will remain even \nafter all base realignment and closure actions from the 1988, 1991, \n1993, and 1995 rounds have been completed. In order to address this \nexcess infrastructure using the same Commission-type framework, Senator \nDixon recommends that Congress authorize another Commission. I believe \nit is important that Alan Dixon's remarks be made part of the Record \nfor all to read and consider.\n  Mr. President, I commend our former colleague, Alan Dixon, on his \nleadership and dedicated service on issues of great importance to our \nnational security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dixon's remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Perspective on Future Base Closings\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to speak to your convention \n     today. Throughout my career of public service I was a strong \n     advocate for the readiness of our military services and the \n     quality of life for our military members and their families, \n     so it is a real pleasure for me to be addressing a group that \n     contributes so much to these important goals.\n       Today I am going to talk a little bit about the base \n     closure process--both the work of the 1995 Base Closure \n     Commission which I chaired and what I see as the future of \n     the base closure process.\n       Let me start just by giving a quick summary of the work of \n     the 1995 Commission.\n       The 1995 Commission was actually the fourth--and under \n     current law--the final round of base closing authorized by \n     the Congress to operate under special expedited procedures. \n     The first base closing round was in 1988. In my view this \n     first round was seriously flawed from a procedural point of \n     view. I was one of the principal authors of the 1990 Base \n     Closure legislation that set up the succeeding three base \n     closure rounds, and I think we corrected most of the \n     procedural shortcomings of the 1988 rounds.\n       Altogether, the 1995 Commission recommended the closure of \n     79 military installations; the realignment of 26 others; and \n     approved 27 requests from the Defense Department to change \n     recommendations of previous Commissions.\n       The 1995 Commission rejected only 19 of the 146 closures or \n     realignments proposed by DOD, and we closed or realigned 9 \n     installations not requested by the Pentagon.\n       Like previous Commissions, the 1995 Commission made changes \n     to the list of closures and realignments proposed by DOD only \n     in those cases where we found that the Secretary of Defense \n     deviated substantially from the force structure plan or the \n     selection criteria. Of the 147 recommendations on Secretary's \n     original list, we approved 123, or 84 percent. This is almost \n     identical to previous Commissions. The 1993 Commission \n     accepted 83 percent of DOD's recommendations, and the 1991 \n     Commission accepted 83 percent.\n       The 1990 Base Closure Act anticipated that the Commission \n     would give great deference to the Secretary of Defenses's \n     recommendations, and you can see that all three Commissions \n     did that.\n       I am particularly proud of the fact that the estimated 20-\n     year savings from the 1995 Commission recommendations of just \n     over $19.3 billion were $323 million higher than the revised \n     savings baseline of $19.0 billion projected by DOD. This was \n     the only time in the three closure rounds that the Commission \n     achieved greater savings than contemplated by the Defense \n     Department.\n       The 1995 Commission also included in our report a set of 20 \n     recommendations for the President, Congress and local \n     communities that suggested ways to improve the process of \n     helping local communities recover from the economic \n     consequences of a base closure.\n       Finally, and we will talk a little more about this in a \n     moment, the 1995 Commission recommended that Congress \n     authorize another round of base closures in the year 2001.\n       I think most of you are aware that President Clinton was a \n     little upset with a couple of our recommendations--\n     particularly the ones to close the Air Force Logistics \n     Centers in Sacramento, California and San Antonio, Texas--but \n     ultimately forwarded our recommendations to the Congress.\n       The Resolution of Disapproval introduced in the House of \n     Representatives was defeated by a vote of 343 to 75 on last \n     September 8.\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\n   After four separate base closure rounds, do we need to close more \n                                 bases?\n\n       In my view, the answer is yes.\n       In the last 10 years, the defense budget has declined in \n     real terms by almost 40 percent, and current plans call for \n     the defense budget to remain essentially stable through the \n     end of the century. Overall, DOD has reduced the size of the \n     military services by about 30 percent--and some are saying \n     that further reductions in force levels are likely before the \n     end of the decade.\n       The cumulative reduction in our domestic base structure \n     from the 4 base closures rounds is approximately 21 percent.\n       I am not saying that there should be a direct correlation \n     between reductions in force levels and reductions in basing \n     structure, but I think we can and should reduce more base \n     structure.\n       The senior DOD leadership also thinks we need to close more \n     bases.\n       Secretary of Defense Bill Perry told the Commission last \n     year that DOD would still have excess infrastructure after \n     the 1995 round, and suggested the need for an additional \n     round of closures and realignments in 3 to 4 years.\n       General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \n     agreed with Secretary Perry on the need for additional base \n     closing authority in the future. He told us that \n     opportunities remain in DOD to increase cross-servicing, \n     particularly in the area of joint-use bases and training \n     facilities.\n       Josh Gotbaum, who at the time was Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Economic Security and oversaw the base closure \n     process for OSD, told the Commission that ``Even after BRAC \n     95 has been implemented we will continue to have excess \n     infrastructure. Future base closure authority will be \n     necessary.''\n\n\n   How many additional bases should be closed, and in which military \n                               services?\n\n       It was painful enough last year to vote to close specific \n     bases, so I am not about to get in the business of suggesting \n     which ones ought to be closed in a future round. Those \n     decisions can only be made after a thorough review and \n     analysis by the military services and some future Commission.\n       I will suggest some functional areas that should be looked \n     at, based on the work that the 1995 Commission did.\n       In general, I would put a premium on retaining operational \n     bases that have unique strategic value or that have good \n     training ranges and airspace that provide opportunities for \n     realistic training. One of the keys to maintaining our \n     qualitative edge over future potential adversaries is to \n     provide our forces frequent, realistic opportunities to train \n     as they would have to fight. So where we have large bases \n     with operational units with access to good training airspace \n     or extensive land for training ground forces, we should think \n     long and hard before closing them.\n       I think the greatest opportunities for future closures lie \n     in the support infrastructure.\n       The Defense Department's industrial facilities represent \n     one area where I think further reductions are possible.\n       Secretary of the Army Togo West told the Commission last \n     year that ``our analysis tells us that the Department of \n     Defense is bleeding depot money. We are just spending money \n     on capacity that we simply do not need now.''\n       The Commission on Roles and Missions, chaired by my friend \n     John White who subsequently became the Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense, reached the same conclusion. Their Report in May of \n     last year said that ``With proper oversight, private \n     contractors could provide essentially all of the depot-level \n     maintenance services now conducted in government facilities \n     within the United States. . . . We recommend that the \n     Department make the transition to a depot maintenance system \n     relying mostly on the private sector. DOD should \n     retain organic depot capability only where private-sector \n     alternatives are not available and cannot be developed \n     reasonably.''\n       So I think the military services can look at their \n     industrial activities for more closures.\n       We also found in the 1995 Commission that there was a great \n     deal of overlap and duplication in the area of R labs and \n     test and evaluation facilities. In preparing the 1995 \n     recommendations, OSD set up 6 cross-service groups to look at \n     functions across the military services, and we heard \n     testimony from the directors of each of those cross service \n     groups. The leaders of the Labs and Test and Evaluation \n     Facilities Cross Service Group told us that they were \n     frustrated by their inability to achieve any meaningful cross \n     servicing in this area and felt that much more could be done.\n       Military medical facilities are another area where I think \n     the military services can make some savings without \n     compromising care to military members and their families or \n     to military retirees. Some of the members of the 1995 \n     Commission looked into this, and the Commission concluded in \n     our Report that many opportunities remain for consolidating \n     military medical facilities across service lines and with \n     civilian sector medical resources.\n\n\n          what should a future base closure process look like?\n\n       I have never seen a process that can't be improved on, but \n     the fact is that the base closure process set up under the \n     1990 Base Closure Act worked pretty well. My friend Jim \n     Courter, who chaired the 1991 and 1993 Commissions, deserves \n     a lot of credit for putting in place the policies and \n     procedures that ensured that the process was open, fair and \n     objective.\n       Communities might disagree with the final recommendations \n     of the Commission, but I don't think any community ever said \n     that they were not given an opportunity to make their case \n     and did not receive a fair hearing.\n       By the end of the 1995 process, President Clinton was not a \n     big fan of the base closure process, but he said in a letter \n     to me that ``The BRAC process is the only way that the \n     Congress and the executive branch have found to make closure \n     decisions with reasonable objectivity and finality.'' I \n     think the President was right.\n       Our Commission recommended that Congress authorize another \n     Base Closure Commission for the year 2001 similar to the \n     1991, 1993 and 1995 Commissions--after the Presidential \n     election in the year 2000. We realized that the Defense \n     Department would have a lot of work to do to implement the \n     closures from the 1995 and prior Commissions through the end \n     of this decade. Since the 1990 Base Closure Act gives DOD 6 \n     years to complete closures, the closures from the 1995 round \n     will not be completed until 2001.\n\n\nis congress likely to enact legislation setting up another base closure \n                                 round?\n\n       When I was Deputy Majority Whip of the United States Senate \n     I had a hard time predicting from one day to the next whether \n     I would be able to have dinner that night with my wife, so I \n     hesitate to predict what Congress is likely to do on this \n     sensitive subject.\n       There are some who say that Congress will not set up \n     another Base Closure Commission because it is too painful a \n     process to go through. There is no doubt that it was a \n     painful process for members of Congress. We wrote the 1990 \n     Base Closure Act to insulate the process from political and \n     parochial influences as much as possible, and I think we \n     succeeded to a large extent. Our 1995 Commission listened \n     carefully to the view of members of Congress, but these \n     members did not have any more influence on the votes of our \n     Commission and the outcome of the process than the state and \n     local officials and even the individual citizens in the \n     communities affected by our decisions.\n       I was a member of the United States Senate for 12 years, \n     and I know that members of Congress don't like to be put in \n     the position that reduces their influence over the outcome of \n     a process that could affect the economic well-being of their \n     constituents. In this case, however, I think history shows \n     that the process of closing bases is so politically charged \n     that it has to be put in the hands of an independent \n     Commission that is insulated as much as possible from \n     partisan and parochial influences.\n       In my view, the defense budget is not likely to get much \n     larger in the next five years, and we still have a \n     requirement to maintain a ready, capable military. I am still \n     convinced that closing military bases is one of the keys to \n     the future readiness and modernization of our military \n     forces.\n       Ultimately, I think members of Congress realize this. As \n     painful as it is, we need to close more military bases, and I \n     think and hope that Congress will realize this and authorize \n     another Base Closure Commission in the future.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I know Senator Pell is on the floor. I \nbelieve Senator Helms is on the floor. So at this point I yield and \nreserve any time I have remaining.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I share with the chairman of the Committee \non Foreign Relations, the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], and \nthe Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] concerns with regard to \nsection 1005 of the Defense authorization bill. Senator Helms and I had \nplanned to offer an amendment to delete that section, but, as recess \napproached, were not able to find an opportunity to do so.\n  This section of the bill would authorize spending under the Military-\nto-Military Program for military education and training for military \npersonnel of foreign countries. The program would be in addition to the \nInternational Military Education and Training Program now in operation \nand overseen by the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \nAppropriations, and their appropriate subcommittees. This new program \nwould not have the same congressional oversight.\n  Oversight of the International Military Education and Training [IMET] \nProgram has proved generally valuable in ensuring that the Congress is \ncomfortable with the activities undertaken pursuant to the program. \nJust this year, for instance, the Department of Defense proposed a \nprogram for a troubled country that was not consistent with its needs. \nIn consultation with two members of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nI requested that the Defense Security Assistance Agency modify the \nprogram. They were quite prepared to consider our views and to\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nmeet our request that the program be modified. I would point out that, \nin that particular case, there has been a continuing and productive \ndialog to ensure that the program for that nation does not conflict \nwith congressional concerns, but meets the reasonable objectives of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  There is no reason to conclude that the IMET Program is not supported \nby the committees of jurisdiction. I would point out that the foreign \noperations appropriations bill just reported by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee provides a full $40 million for the \nIMET Program in the next fiscal year. This sum represents an increase \nin funding and reflects congressional willingness to back that well-\nestablished program.\n\n  It makes no sense to create a duplicative military education and \ntraining program under the Military-to-Military Contacts Program. The \nIMET Program and the contacts program have different purposes and \ngoals. The Congress has been very careful to separate the programs to \nensure that the Military-to-Military Contacts Program would not be used \nto circumvent the restrictions of the IMET Program and to prevent \nduplication and overlaps.\n  Three provisions were added to prohibit funding for the Military-to-\nMilitary Program from being used in countries that are ineligible for \nIMET to require coordination with the Secretary of State and to prevent \nthe authorities from being used to transfer weapons. It is not at all \nin the interests of the Congress or the country for the distinction \nbetween these two programs to be blurred.\n  Mr. President, it is not at all clear why this provision is being \nsought. It was not requested by the Department of Defense and it is \nopposed by the Department of Defense and it is opposed by the \nDepartment of State.\n  I believe very much that section 1005 has no place in this bill. I \nhope that, with an eye both to comity and to good sense, it will be \ndropped in conference.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe there are 7\\1/2\\ minutes set \naside for me. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. We are supposed to begin voting at 12?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. How many votes in tandem, three?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have a series of five votes beginning \nat 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been around this place for almost 24 years now, \nand I have never participated in the occasional turf battles that \noccur, and I do not particularly enjoy making the comments I am about \nto make but I feel obliged to make them for the record.\n  Mr. President, S. 1745, as introduced and reported by the Armed \nServices Committee, contains, in my judgment, several significant \nprovisions falling clearly within the primary jurisdiction of the \nForeign Relations Committee. And I have disclosed now my interest in \nthat because I am chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I do not \nthink there can be a clearer case of imposing upon the jurisdiction of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee than section 1005 of the bill, entitled \n``Use of Military-to-Military Contacts Funds for Professional Military \nEducation and Training.''\n  That is a lot of gobbledygook perhaps, but it is a provision that \nrepresents an obvious effort by some to commandeer a longstanding \nforeign policy instrument of the Department of State, that being the \nInternational Military Education and Training program known familiarly \nas IMET.\n  Section 1005 of this bill does not even pretend to differ \nsubstantively from the existing IMET program. The proposed authority \nwould allow the Department of Defense to engage in a back-door foreign \nassistance program without the supervision of the State Department or \nthe oversight of the Foreign Relations Committee by conducting \n``military education and training for military and civilian personnel \nof foreign countries.''\n  Mr. President, why should the United States establish this \nduplicative program as identical authority already exists under chapter \n5 of the Foreign Assistance Act which authorizes the President of the \nUnited States to furnish ``military education and training to military \nand related civilian personnel of foreign countries.''\n  Now, again, I am not going to get into any fight about the turf, but \nI must point out that this is the second year that an attempt has been \nmade to seize foreign policy tools belonging solely to the Secretary of \nState. At a time when we should be considering consolidating the \nforeign affairs apparatus of the of the United States into the \nDepartment of State, it makes no sense to me to proliferate the number \nof foreign assistance programs outside the control of the Secretary of \nState. It makes even less sense in light of the drastic budget cuts \nundergone by the Department of Defense to pay for foreign aid in the \ndefense budget and from defense funds. The result will be more \nnondefense spending in the 050 account.\n  This authority--and I have checked on this--was not requested by the \nadministration. It has not been agreed to in the administration's \ninteragency process, and I daresay that it likely is not supported by \nthe Secretary of State. However, I have not talked with or to Warren \nChristopher about that. Because this provision falls within the \njurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee, I respectfully request \nthat this provision be removed from the bill during conference. That \naction I believe would recognize appropriately the jurisdictional \nresponsibilities of both of our committees.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Rhode Island yield \nme the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. PELL. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. HELMS. And if I have any time I yield it to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join in the concerns expressed by \nChairman Helms and by the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Pell, about section 1005 of this bill. This section \nwould have the effect of creating a second IMET Program, a new aid \nprogram for foreign militaries.\n  IMET, the International Military Education and Training Program, \nfunds tuition for foreign military officers in U.S. professional \nmilitary training courses, and related activities. It has traditionally \nbeen funded through the foreign aid bill.\n  In fact, the foreign operations appropriations bill reported by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee provides a full $40 million for IMET in \nfiscal year 1997. It is one of the only programs in the entire foreign \naid budget that is slated to get more money in fiscal year 1997 than in \nfiscal year 1996 or 1995.\n  When the Military-to-Military Contacts Program was established in the \nDefense Department, the justification was used that this would not--\nwould not--be another IMET Program. It was to be something entirely \nseparate. It was not going to duplicate IMET activities.\n  For that reason it was spelled out exactly what the new Military-to-\nMilitary Contact Program was going to be. In the law, there are listed \neight specific activities, such as exchanges of personnel, \ntransportation for contact and liaison teams, seminars and conferences, \nand distribution of publications, all distinct from the IMET \nactivities.\n  To further ensure that the new Military-to-Military Program would not \nbe used to circumvent the restrictions of the IMET Program, several \nconditions were added to ensure coordination and prevent overlap.\n  Because of concerns about the potential for duplication in the two \nprograms, the fiscal year 1995 foreign operations appropriations bill \nrequired a report from the Secretary of Defense addressing the future \nof military training of foreign armed forces. In that report, which was \nissued with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Defense \nDepartment concluded:\n\n       The IMET Program and the traditional CINC military-to-\n     military activities are distinct efforts contributing to the \n     achievement\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n     of common goals. From the beginning, both programs have \n     commanded close coordination between the Defense and State \n     Departments. Coordination between both departments ensures \n     program uniqueness and the effective utilization of scarce \n     resources in support of broad U.S. foreign policy and \n     national security goals.\n\n  Unfortunately, what the bill now before us would do is eliminate all \ndistinctions between the two programs. It would create, in effect, a \nsecond IMET Program under different jurisdiction and separate funding.\n  The Military-to-Military Contacts Program is expected to receive \nfunding of $60 million in each of the fiscal years 1996 and 1997, out \nof the Services' operations and maintenance accounts. That is on top of \nthe $40 million already going to IMET.\n  I wish to stress, as have my colleagues, that this authority was not \nrequested by the Defense Department. It is not something they believe \nis needed. Furthermore, it is opposed by the State Department as well \nas by the committees of jurisdiction over foreign aid funding.\n  I very much regret that section 1005 has not been stricken from the \nbill. I make the observation that it plants the seeds for continuing \ncontroversy, which I think is something that is highly undesirable. I \nvery strongly urge that it be dropped in conference.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am puzzled concerning the objections to \nthe use of Military-to-Military Contacts Program funds for \ninternational military education and training [IMET].\n  The Armed Services Committee is told each year by the commanders in \nchief of the combatant commands that IMET is the United States' most \ncost effective program in terms of fostering friendly relations with \nthe foreign militaries. The combatant commanders routinely point out \nthat foreign military officers who have received IMET training come to \nappreciate American values and the American way of life and that these \nforeign officers often rise to assume senior positions of leadership \nwithin their military and civilian hierarchies.\n  Pursuant to this testimony, the Armed Services Committee in the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 \nspecifically authorized the creation of a CINC Initiative Fund to carry \nout eight types of activities, including military education and \ntraining to military and related civilian personnel of foreign \ncountries. The CINC Initiative Fund is designed to provide funding for \nactivities that were not foreseen when the budget request was submitted \nto Congress and that would enhance the war fighting capability, \nreadiness, and sustainability of the forces assigned to the commander \nrequesting the funds. In the years since this authority was created, \nthe CINC Initiative Fund has only been used to provide IMET on a few \noccasions. Incidentally, the use of this authority for IMET is limited \nto $2 million per fiscal year.\n  The committee's initiative this year seeks to build upon an existing \nprogram--the Military-to-Military Contacts Program which is designed to \nencourage a democratic orientation of defense establishments and \nmilitary forces of other countries. Under existing law, this program is \nprimarily aimed at in-theater activities and generally involves the \nestablishment of military liaison teams and traveling contact teams in \nengaging democracies to seek to identify those countries' needs and \nthen seek to design programs that are carried out by visiting experts, \nseminars, conferences, or exchanges of personnel. When a larger need is \nidentified that would exceed the limited funding for this program, the \nin-country liaison teams seek to identify programs under the Foreign \nAssistance Act that can satisfy the need. When it comes to IMET, \nhowever, we have found that existing funding for the IMET Program has \nalready been programmed and the traditional IMET Program is unable to \nmeet the need. We have also found that the needs of emerging \ndemocracies in Eastern Europe have caused legitimate IMET needs of \ncountries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to go unfunded. Thus, by \nadding IMET as one of the activities that can be carried out under the \nMilitary-to-Military Contacts Program, we are merely seeking to provide \na modest supplement to the traditional IMET Program when a truly \npressing need arises. We are, of course, amenable to put funding limits \non the use of the military-to-military contacts programs for IMET and \nthat has been communicated to the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I hasten to point out that the Secretary of State must approve the \nconduct of any activity--not just IMET--authorized under this program \nand that funds cannot be provided for any country that is not eligible \nfor assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this is a very modest supplement to the \ntraditional IMET Program, it has a precedent in prior congressional \naction relating to the CINC Initiative Fund, and we are amenable to \nincluding reasonable funding limitations to its use for IMET. I urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 1745.\n  Mr. President, I would simply say that the IMET Program is one of the \nhighest priorities of the commanders in chief we hear from every year \naround the world. The newly emerging democracies in the former Soviet \nUnion and Eastern Europe have consumed a great deal of those funds, \nleaving almost nothing for Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\n  We also take note of the fact that these IMET funds have been cut \neach and every year, so they do not seem to have a high priority by the \nForeign Relations Committee but they do have an enormous priority for \nour military. So we will be glad to work with our friends on the \nForeign Relations Committee to iron out jurisdictional problems with \nthe hope that we can unite behind one of the most important programs we \nhave to have contacts and influence all over the world through \nmilitary-to-military contacts that can end up bringing peace in areas \nthat otherwise would be in conflict.\n  So I would take into account what my colleagues have said, but we do \nhave a very high priority on this program and that has been exemplified \nin testimony year after year after year by all of our military \ncommanders.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I regret that the Senate again has produced \na bill that is gravely flawed. It suffers from many of the defects \nassociated with last year's bill. I voted to favorably report the bill \nout of committee in the hope that the bill would be improved when it \nwas considered on the floor. While agreement was reached to eliminate \nunacceptable missile defense provisions from the bill, the bill remains \nfundamentally flawed. As a consequence, I will vote against its final \npassage.\n  With respect to missile defense, I am pleased with the agreement \nannounced by the majority leader on June 28th to drop sections 231 and \n232 from the bill. These sections related to U.S. compliance policy for \nthe development, testing, and deployment of theater missile defense \nsystems, and to the demarcation between theater and strategic missile \nsystems. I am also grateful to see that the language in the bill in \nsection 233 with respect to the mutilateralization of the ABM Treaty \nhas been dropped and converted into a sense of the Senate.\n  I understand full well, however, that we will soon be back on the \nfloor debating many of these same ill-advised proposals placed in \nanother bill. I intend to speak in more detail about those proposals at \nthe appropriate time. For now, I would just like to restate my \nconviction that it would ill serve the interests of our country--and \nsurely not the interests of our taxpayers--to follow the misguided \nmissile defense plan that the majority appears determined to pursue in \nthe weeks ahead. As far as I am concerned, the missile defense language \nI cited above would have made for bad law if enacted on this bill--\nsimply moving this language into another bill will not change this \nbasic quality of the proposal.\n  The bill contains more than $11 billion in unrequested funding with \nhuge increases in the procurement and research and development \naccounts. For the most part, these additions are based on the Services' \nso-called wish list--lists of programs the Services would like to see \nfunded if additional funding were made available. I agree with some of \nthe spending decisions, but I do not support this approach to defense \nbudgeting. It undermines the objectives of Goldwater-Nichols by \nencouraging the submission of separate\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nspending priorities for each service that are set without regard to our \nunified command structure's warfighting needs. Moreover, I cannot \nsupport the magnitude of the increase in funding especially when we are \nspending billions of dollars on programs we do not need now and some we \nmay not need ever.\n  The additions in procurement include $750 million for the DDG-51 \ndestroyer program, $701 million for the new attack submarine program, \n$351 million for the V-22 program, $249 million for the C-17 program, \n$240 million for the E8-B program, $234 million for the F/A-18 C/D \nprogram, $204 million for the C-130J program, $183 million for the \nApache longbow program, $158.4 million for the Kiowa warrior program, \n$147 million for the MLRS program and $107 million for the F-16 \nprogram.\n\n  The additions in research and development include the $885 million \nfor missile defense programs to which I already alluded, $100 million \nplus-ups for the Comanche Program and Army Force XXI, $305 million for \nthe national defense sealift fund, $147 million for the Arsenal Ship \nand $116 for advanced submarine technology.\n  The bill contains more than $600 million in unrequested military \nconstruction projects, an annual temptation that Members cannot seem to \nresist, even though there is no compelling reason to move these \nprojects forward. I think it is particularly damning that at least $200 \nmillion of these projects not only did not make the initial cut of the \nbudget request but also did not make the second cut of the services' \nwish lists. We are authorizing an additional $600 million in military \nconstruction projects just so Members can say that they have brought \nhome the bacon.\n  Another rite of spring, the addition of hundreds of millions of \ndollars in Guard and Reserve equipment warrants mention. Some progress \nhas been made in avoiding the earmarking problem we had last year. Only \nabout $485 million of the $760 million in funding is earmarked. \nUnfortunately, no real progress has been made in eliciting a realistic \nbudget request from the Defense Department for Guard and Reserve \nequipment. This failure invites earmarking funds for programs in \nMembers' districts and as a consequence, the funding decisions that \nbecome law only bear relation to the Guard and Reserves' requirements \nby happenstance. We should not be spending the taxpayers' money in this \nway.\n  Several amendments to eliminate some or all of this unrequested \nfunding were offered. Unfortunately, Mr. President, these efforts were \ndefeated.\n  On other matters, I am concerned about the criteria used in \nallocating an additional $200 million for DOE's environmental \nrestoration and waste management program. I could support, and, fact, \nhave long advocated increased funding for this program. However, rather \nthan accept the recommendations provided by the Department of Energy \nwhich listed projects that, if given increased funding in the near \nterm, could save substantial dollars in the out-years, the bill factors \nin additional criteria concerning site employment. I have grave \nconcerns that the credibility of the entire DOE cleanup operation will \nbe undermined if it is treated merely as a jobs program. A number of \nfactors should be assessed when deciding to increase funding for \ncleanup projects such as: reducing the risk to the public, workers and \nthe environment, lessening the long term mortgage costs of the program; \nmandates and the environment; lessening the long term mortgage costs of \nthe program; mandates from Federal and State laws; and stakeholder \ninput. I do not believe that the effect on a given site's employment \nshould be among these factors.\n  I disagree with the committee's report language concerning the \nexternal regulation of the Department of Energy. I believe Secretary \nO'Leary's Advisory Committee on External Regulation established \ncredible reasons for moving to external regulation, and I believe that \nthis goal can be accomplished without significant increased costs to \nthe taxpayer and without any detrimental impact on our Nation's \nsecurity. In my view, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will \ncontinue to play a key role in ensuring the safe operation of the \ndefense nuclear facilities. Since January of this year, the Department \nhas been carefully reviewing the options available for transitioning to \nexternal regulation. A preferred option should be presented to the \nSecretary within the next several weeks. I believe that the Department \nshould continue planning to move to external regulation for nuclear \nsafety. It is my hope that the plan presented to the Secretary will \noutline the steps necessary for such a transition, recognizing that \nsuch a transition may take several years.\n\n  During consideration on the floor, the committee accepted an \namendment I offered regarding worker safety and health at DOE's Mound. \nFor too long Congress has done too little to ensure that the workers in \nour nuclear weapons complex were adequately protected from the many \nhazards they face on a daily basis. While the situation has improved at \nmany sites, it is unfortunately the case that the Mound facility is \nstill not up to the standards of other DOE facilities, not to mention \ncommercial nuclear facilities. This amendment requires DOE to report to \nCongress on progress to improve worker health and safety at the \nfacility.\n  On June 21, 1996, I received a letter from DOE Under Secretary Tom \nGrumbly. This letter clearly establishes the Department's intent and \ncommitment to seriously and forthrightly address worker safety issues \nat Mound. The letter lists a series of discrete program improvements \nthat will be taken at the mound site beginning immediately and \ncontinuing through 1997. These important upgrades should begin at the \nearliest possible opportunity. I remain concerned though that we may be \nforcing a trade off between worker safety and health improvements and \nthe pace of cleanup at the Mound site. In order to avoid such a trade \noff, it may be necessary to seek an authorization for these activities \nduring conference.\n  Finally, I would like to mention a special retirement provision for \nFederal employees who happen to work at military bases where the work \nwill be privatized as part of base closure. The Committee on Armed \nServices voted 11 to 9 to add nongermane legislation to the bill that \nappropriately is in the jurisdiction of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. This amendment also was recently introduced as a bill, S. \n1686, which is pending before the Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil \nService of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Its stated purpose is to make privatization more likely to succeed by \ngiving employees an incentive to stay at the base when a private \nemployer takes over the workload. Under the terms of the amendment, 30 \npercent of the Federal civilian employees at two DOD bases, one in \nIndianapolis and one in Louisville, would enjoy civil service \nretirement system [CSRS] benefits that no other Federal employee enjoys \ntoday. I believe the authors of the amendment intended for it to apply \nto a third base in Newark, OH, but it is unclear whether the workers at \nthe Ohio base will be eligible for the benefit. In addition, it is \nunclear whether bases in Texas and California will also be covered by \nthe amendment.\n  Under the terms of the amendment, additional retirement system \ncredits would be given to employees in the civil service retirement \nsystem [CSRS] whose jobs are being privatized, and who are not eligible \nfor immediate retirement benefits. The amendment would allow these \nemployees to count their time as a private contract employee as \nqualifying service toward meeting the eligibility requirements under \nCSRS. In addition, their current high-3 years of salary would be \nindexed to general increases in Federal salaries. These benefits are \nindependent of additional subsequent retirement benefits earned by the \nemployees following privatization.\n  Under current law, the affected employees would be eligible for a \nCSRS pension at age 62 with the high 3 years based on current \nemployment by the Federal Government. Under the terms of the amendment, \nthese employees could retire at an earlier age and their high-3 years \nof salary would be at a level indexed during the years of \nprivatization. Of course, they would not even be required to contribute \ntoward the cost of these extra benefits, although Federal employees in \nCSRS must contribute toward system costs.\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\n  While the stated purpose of the amendment is to encourage Navy \nemployees to accept contractor employment in Indianapolis and \nLouisville, the proposed retirement incentives do not apply to 70 \npercent of the work force at the two facilities. Nineteen percent of \nthe employees at the two facilities are now eligible to retire under \nCSRS and therefore, are ineligible for the proposed retirement \nincentives. Fifty-one percent of the employees are covered under the \nFederal employees retirement system [FERS] and therefore, are also \nineligible for the proposed retirement incentives. Therefore, in terms \nof increasing their Federal retirement benefits, it would be to the \nadvantage of 70 percent of the work force at the two facilities, to \nrelocate and seek other Federal employment.\n  Newark Air Force Base in Ohio is privatizing in the same way that the \nbases in Louisville and Indianapolis are scheduled to proceed, although \nit is not clear from the legislation whether the employees at Newark \nwould be included in the pilot program. The privatization at Newark has \nbeen working because employees want to remain employed and many want to \nstay in the Newark area. Based upon Newark's experience, it is my view \nthat the amendment, offered by Senator Coats, proposes a solution to a \nproblem that does not really exist. Regrettably, given the nature of \nthe proposed solution, I believe that this legislation will create a \nhost of problems. Problems of equity and fairness that will fall \nstraight into the lap of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the \ncommittee with jurisdiction over Federal employment benefits.\n  We are in the process of downsizing the Federal Government. I note \nthat through the efforts of the Armed Services and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the administration, we have 240,000 fewer Federal \nemployees than when President Clinton took office. Many Federal jobs \nare being privatized in place. Numerous Federal jobs are also being \neliminated. One Ohio constituent recently wrote to me and explained \nthat his job was being eliminated in July. He said that if we could \nprovide him with 4 additional months of service credit, he could apply \nand be eligible for early retirement under the civil service retirement \nsystem. I cannot explain to this constituent why he should not be \neligible for an additional 4 months of credit if we are providing years \nof service credit to other employees who are not even losing their \njobs. They have the opportunity to continue working. They will be \neligible to accrue private employer pension benefits in addition to the \nFederal benefits they will have already earned.\n  Perhaps, the Congress should consider retirement inducements for all \nemployees affected by privatization and downsizing. However, if this is \nto be done, it should be done in a studied fashion. Changing a system \nof universal retirement benefits--where everyone previously had \nparticipated under the same benefit rules--should be the subject of \nhearings in a bright light, where we understand exactly what equity \nproblems are created as well as the long-term cost of providing such \nretirement credits.\n  My problem with the amendment adopted by the Armed Service Committee \nis that it is not generous enough to discourage employees from seeking \nother Federal employment and this is the purported purpose of the \nlegislation. The assumption that a majority of these employees will \nmove onto other Federal employment also assumes that these employees \nwill want to relocate and that they will find jobs through the priority \nplacement program. These are two assumptions that I question. To \nrepeat, the amendment is not generous enough to fulfill its stated \npurpose, while at the same time it is too generous when one considers \nthat the Government is proposing to do nothing along these lines for \nother employees being separated from Government employment. It is these \nsorts of contradictions which should be the subject of congressional \nhearings before we act.\n\n\n                     western kentucky training site\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1997 Department of Defense \nauthorization bill we will pass today contains $10.8 million in \nauthorized funding for phase 3 construction of the Western Kentucky \nTraining Site in Muhlenburg County, KY.\n  I appreciated the willingness of my colleagues to secure this funding \nfor phase 3 construction at the site and wanted to share with them a \nrecent articles from Soldiers magazine.\n  This article gives an excellent review of the center's training \nactivities and its importance to our Nation's defense, calling it the \ntraining site of choice of units stationed in the Eastern United \nStates.\n  Again, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support of this \nmilitary site, and I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Soldiers magazine, July 1996]\n\n                          Kentucky's NTC East\n\n                         (By SSgt. David Altom)\n\n       Camouflaged soldiers bustle around the airstrip while, in \n     the distance, a formation of helicopters moves slowly across \n     the overcast sky, slingloads of vehicles and equipment \n     swinging beneath them.\n       A C-130H Hercules transport lands and kicks up a cloud of \n     dust as it taxis to the end of the strip. Turning around in \n     preparation for takeoff, the aircraft is immediately \n     surrounded by a team of soldiers emerging from the nearby \n     tree line.\n       A Humvee pulling a trailer is quickly off-loaded, the \n     soldiers move back into the woods. The C-130 stirs up another \n     dust storm as it roars back down the runway toward home base. \n     The entire operation take less than five minutes.\n       Welcome to the Western Kentucky Training Site.\n       Owned and operated by the Kentucky National Guard, the \n     WKYTS is proving popular with active and Reserve soldiers and \n     airmen, making it the training site of choice for units \n     stationed in the eastern United States.\n       The greatest appeal of the training site is the open \n     terrain. Occupying more than 700,000 acres of reclaimed strip \n     mine property near the western tip of Kentucky, the facility \n     has enough flat and rolling land to give commanders plenty of \n     training options. While nearby Fort Campbell and Fort Knox \n     have live-fire ranges, accommodating everything from M1 \n     Abrams main battle tanks to Multiple Launch Rocket System, \n     the WKYTS has shown itself to be ideal for movement-to-\n     contact exercises and large-scale maneuvers.\n       The expanse of the WKYTS is a tanker's dream come true, \n     said Lt. Col. Norman Arflack, commander of the Kentucky Army \n     Guard's 1st Battalion, 123rd Armor.\n       ``As a maneuver unit we need to conduct force-on-force \n     training, especially when we go to battalion-on-company \n     tactics,'' he said. ``That's hard to do unless you go some \n     place like Fort Hood. We feel fortunate to have a facility \n     like this so close, especially with training dollars so \n     tight.''\n       Arflack cited last summer's Advanced Warfighter Experiment \n     as an example of the value of the WKYTS. Called Focused \n     Dispatch, the experiment employed the latest developments in \n     satellite communications, global positioning systems and \n     computer technology to link armored vehicles at the Kentucky \n     site to simulations in Fort Knox, Ky., Fort Rucker, Ala., and \n     Fort Bliss, Texas. The result was a series of battles \n     involving both real and simulated tanks, attack helicopters \n     and air defense units.\n       ``This was a great experience for us,'' said Arflack, whose \n     unit acted as the opposition force during the experiment. \n     ``In addition to movement-to-contact missions, we found we \n     were able to complete a tank crew proficiency course during \n     our training period without having to leave the compound. I \n     saw our battalion grow in experience, and we didn't have to \n     travel a great distance or worry about overextending our \n     training budget.''\n       Col. Pat Ritter, director of the Fort Knox Battle Lab, \n     which oversaw Focused Dispatch, held a similar opinion. ``If \n     this isn't NTC east,'' he said, referring to the National \n     Training Center in California. ``I don't know what is.''\n       Following the pattern of modernization established at the \n     WKYTS is the recent addition of a new moving target system \n     using a laser interface device, similar to the familiar MILES \n     systems that most crews are already trained to use. Along \n     with various stationary popup targets and a wash rack \n     designed to accommodate the largest military hardware, the \n     training center possesses features of a fully equipped battle \n     training site.\n       There are plans to station a battalion of M1s at the site \n     this summer for year-round use. Visiting units will have \n     access to this equipment, making it unnecessary to ship their \n     own tanks, increasing training cost-effectiveness.\n       CWO 4 Joe Wilkins, WKYTS manager, is especially proud of \n     the expansion taking place at the site. Most recent is a $6.5 \n     million project that will house 175 soldiers. Included is a \n     400-seat dining hall, a drill hall and classrooms for \n     simulator training. Future construction will include \n     additional administration and storage buildings, a physical \n     fitness center and a dispensary.\n       ``It's our goal to create the best military training \n     facility possible,'' said Wilkins, ``not just for the \n     Kentucky Guard, but for anyone who has a need for quality \n     training. We don't like to think of ourselves as being \n     limited in our vision.''\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\n       The versatility of the WKYTS already pays off. Last fall's \n     Operation Mega Gold, for example, brought together elements \n     of the 101st Airborne Division with assets of the Kentucky \n     Air National Guard's 123rd Airlift Wing. More than 5,000 \n     soldiers and airmen took part in the two-week exercise, \n     culminating in the simulated capture of an airfield behind \n     enemy lines.\n       Teamwork and high technology are also playing an important \n     part in preserving the ecological stance of the WKYTS. In \n     addition to implementing Army's Integrated Training Area \n     Management Program, site managers have begun working with \n     local universities in creating a comprehensive database \n     listing complete inventories of everything from endangered \n     species to the different types of soils. The goal is to \n     create a complete picture of the natural resources of the \n     WKYTS and, in turn, ensure more efficient management of the \n     site's training environment.\n       ``We want our soldiers to train in a natural environment, \n     not a wasteland,'' said Faith Fiene, state environmental \n     manager for the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs. \n     ``With better identification of training areas and areas of \n     avoidance by our soldiers today, we intend to preserve this \n     training area for future soldiers as well.''\n       In 1994 the site received the Kentucky Governor's \n     Environmental Excellence Awards in Soil Conservation. And an \n     agreement with the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife \n     Resources promises to dramatically expand the training assets \n     that will be available to the military, as well as the \n     recreational assets available to the public.\n       With its beginnings in 1969 as a 29-acre weekend training \n     site, the WKYTS has grown considerably during its development \n     into what many in the Kentucky Guard hope will prove to be \n     the state-of-the-art battle training center for the 21st \n     century.\n       Just as the nature of battle is one of constant change, the \n     WKYTS is constantly improving itself, mixing computer \n     simulation technology, satellite positioning systems, and \n     targeting with the mud and the dust of field training--all to \n     prepare today's soldier for tomorrow.\n\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n1997 Defense authorization bill. Through the able guidance of the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Thurmond, the committee has worked out \na strong bill, which not only ensures the readiness of our forces \ntoday, but also, through the addition of funds for the procurement and \nresearch and development accounts, takes significant steps toward \nensuring the future readiness of our military.\n  The bill currently before us represents the second straight year of \nRepublican leadership on defense--commonsense conservatism correcting \nthe drastic cuts to our defenses imposed by the current administration. \nHad we simply rubberstamped the administrations request, we would have \nagain placed our military on the path back to a hollow force. Once \nagain, the Republican led congress has taken the leadership in \nmaintaining our Armed Forces preeminence. With additional funding in \nthe so-called investment accounts, increased funding for military \nconstruction, and the fully funded pay raise, the Senate has taken \nsteps which will ensure that the men and women of the U.S. military are \nnot only the best trained and equipped, but also that they are provided \nwith an adequate quality of life.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the bill contains a number of \nprovisions which are important to my State of Kansas. Whether in \nWichita, Parsons, or Junction City, this bill has great effects on \nKansas. For example, the bill includes funding for construction \nprojects at Fort Riley, McConnell AFB, and the Kansas National Guard. \nAdditionally, it also ensures the efficient procurement of the joint \nprimary aircraft training system, manufactured in Wichita, and the \nsensor fuzed weapons, a program important to the Kansas Army Ammunition \nplant.\n  In closing, Mr. President, as the newest member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference \nto craft a bill which will pass both Chambers and be presented to the \nPresident for his signature. In so doing, we will invite the President \nto join with us in restoring the U.S. military and ensuring their \nfuture preparedness.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, after much thought and careful \nconsideration of our military obligations and needs, I have, \nreluctantly, to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act. My \ndecision has been made all the more difficult because the bill two \namendments--protection of a woman's marital property rights if a spouse \nrolls the military pension into a civil service pension and the \ncontinuation of funding for the Computer Aided Education and Training \nInstitute --which I authored. This fact notwithstanding, I cannot, in \ngood conscience, vote in favor of the fiscal year 1997 National Defense \nAuthorization Act as reported out by the Armed Services Committee and \namended by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, my reasons for voting against S. 1745 are threefold.\n  First, and most important, the present bill still exceeds the \nPresident and Pentagon's request by $11.3 billion. This includes $7.1 \nbillion for unrequested procurement items--for some unexplained reason, \nthe bill does not provide $1.2 billion for requested procurement \nprojects--and $3.3 billion for weapons and weapon systems that are not \na part of the Department of Defense's long-range modernization plans.\n  Second, the bill includes $3.4 billion for unrequested research and \ndevelopment items, while failing to provide $900 million for research \nand development projects requested by the President.\n  These unrequested increases add to the budget deficit and our \nnational debt.\n  Third, many of the requested weapons and weapons systems, at best, \nonly marginally add to the national security of our Nation. In any \ncase, their cost do not justify their manufacture and implementation.\n  Mr. President, I believe in a strong defense. I also believe that \ndefense expenditures must be consistent with our military need and \nobligations and that whatever we purchase it must be affordable. Sadly, \nthe fiscal year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act does not meet \neither of those criteria.\n\n\n                                 usuhs\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nprovisions in this legislation which ensure that our Nation's only \nmilitary medical school, the Uniformed Services University of the \nHealth Sciences [USUHS] will continue its important military medicine \ntraining programs into the 21st century.\n  Since it was established in 1972, USUHS has played a vital role in \nproviding top-quality medical care to the men and women of our armed \nservices. The institution has consistently produced first-rate career \nmedical officers who excel in meeting the needs of military medicine \nand military readiness.\n  USUHS provides a unique curriculum that contributes greatly to our \nmilitary preparedness by providing knowledge that is vastly different \nfrom that taught in a civilian medical practice. This training includes \nsuch areas as trauma, mass casualties, combat surgery, medical \nlogistics, nuclear medicine, tropical infectious diseases, and medical \nresponses to terrorism.\n  Over the years, the university's graduates have consistently \ndemonstrated a high level of performance during their various \ndeployments in combat areas and in support missions from Desert Storm \nto Bosnia and Somalia. This performance based upon their extensive \nmilitary training has been validated by three Surgeons General, the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the American Medical \nAssociation and the Military Coalition, the Retired Officers \nAssociation, the National Association for Uniformed Services and the \nAmerican Legion, among others. I ask that letters from these \norganizations attesting to the critical importance of the university be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. I also want to underscore the long-term commitment made \nby the majority of USUHS graduates to our armed services. Although \nUSUHS graduates are required to serve 7 years of active duty beyond the \ntime they devote to internships and residencies, the average time they \nserve is actually 18.5 years. Of the 2,304 USUHS graduates-to-date, \nmore than 94 percent are still serving in the Air Force, the Army, the \nNavy, or the Public Health Service. Even more incredible is the fact \nthat, even those who have completed their required obligation and could \nleave for private practice, 85 percent continue to serve our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the continued operation of the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences remains\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\ncritical to our ability to provide a continuous, experienced cadre of \nmilitary physicians to meet our Nation's special needs of military \nmedicine and medical readiness in the future. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' continued support and commitment in this very important \nmatter.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) is writing to request that the Senate oppose Senator \n     Feingold's anticipated amendment to the FY 1997 Department of \n     Defense Authorization bill (S. 1745) which would phase out \n     the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences \n     (USUHS). We urge you to join with your colleagues in the \n     House of Representatives who, on May 15, voted overwhelmingly \n     (343-82) not to close the USUHS.\n       Our Nation's only military medical school is a national \n     asset which contributes greatly to our military preparedness \n     as a cost effective source of physicians for the Uniformed \n     Services. Military physicians require special training to \n     equip them in handling peace and war time situations that are \n     not taught in traditional medical schools. For example, \n     during recent military deployments in Bosnia, Somalia and the \n     Gulf, the effects of modern weapons, the stress of continuous \n     operations, as well as the noise, toxins and other \n     battlefield hazards were adroitly handled by USUHS-trained \n     physicians. The knowledge imparted to these highly-equipped \n     physicians is vastly different from that taught in a civilian \n     medical practice.\n       Many are unaware that the USUHS not only educates its own \n     graduates, it also provides special continuing medical \n     education courses for other physicians. Such education \n     includes courses in combat casualty care, tropical medicine, \n     combat stress, disaster medicine, and medical responses to \n     terrorism--courses not available through civilian medical \n     schools.\n       A 1995 GAO study concluded that the USUHS is cost effective \n     to the federal government by producing medical graduates who \n     consistently meet the special needs of military medicine. \n     This same study acknowledged another telling advantage of \n     USUHS-trained physicians: 43 out of 44 commanders of major \n     military medical units perceived that physicians from the \n     USUHS have a greater overall understanding of the military, \n     greater commitment to the military, better preparation for \n     operational assignments, and better preparation for \n     leadership roles.\n       The AMA believes that the USUHS's mission and goals are \n     consistent with our national interests and should be allowed \n     to continue. It exemplifies the best in the federal \n     government, and should be identified for recognition and \n     support rather than closure.\n       We thank you for your consideration of the truly notable \n     contributions that USUHS makes to our military and ultimately \n     to our Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               P. John Seward, MD.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The American Legion urges opposition to any \n     efforts to eliminate the Uniformed Services University of the \n     Health Sciences (USUHS).\n       This very special institution continues to serve as a \n     valuable source of military physicians for the armed forces \n     of the United States and the Public Health Service. It \n     provides the military with a corps of dedicated career \n     medical officers instilled with a unique degree of commitment \n     and selflessness found in doctors who are trained and skilled \n     in providing combat casualty care. This facility offers a \n     full range of instruction and care in those maladies \n     typically suffered primarily by military personnel. These \n     include tropical, epidemiological and parasitic ailments.\n       A recent GAO report concluded the total monetary cost for \n     USUHS compared to the Armed Forces Health Professional \n     Scholarship Program (AFHPSP) for civilian institutions are \n     merely identical. However, unlike civilian medical programs, \n     the USUHS provides military doctors well trained in primary \n     care medicine, as well as combat casualty care, tropical \n     medicine, combat stress and other conditions unique to \n     military deployments and combat conditions. According to DoD, \n     the retention rate in the armed forces is eighty-six percent \n     for USUHS graduates compared to fourteen percent for AFHPSP.\n       Military medical officers serve beside and in support of \n     U.S. service personnel when forces are deployed to a \n     conflict. This environment is harsh, chaotic and demanding. \n     The graduates of USUHS are trained to deal with these \n     extremes and difficult conditions and in fact, work and \n     improvise in some of the most deplorable circumstances where \n     U.S. military forces are stationed.\n       To eliminate USUHS would be a great disservice to the men \n     and women in the armed forces. We must do everything we can \n     to provide the armed forces with the best health and battle \n     casualty services available.\n       Once again, The American Legion urges you to oppose any \n     efforts, especially in the FY 1997 DoD Authorization bill, \n     which would eliminate the USUHS. We appreciate your continued \n     support and commitment on important veterans' issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steve A. Robertson,\n                        Director, National Legislative Commission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                           Uniformed Services,\n\n                                   Springfield, VA, June 17, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: As a result of misleading and incomplete \n     information several attempts have been made to close the \n     Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). \n     The National Association for Uniformed Services once again \n     urges you to support USUHS.\n       The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently confirmed what \n     we and other military associations have been asserting during \n     the past four consecutive attempts at closure . . . there is \n     NO DIFFERENCE to the federal government in the cost per year \n     of service between USUHS and the scholarship physicians (GAO/\n     HEHS-95-244, page 33 . . . $181,575/USUHS vs. $181,169/\n     Scholarship).\n       Further, there is a difference between medicine practiced \n     in civilian and military settings. During military \n     deployments to Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti and the Gulf, the \n     effects of modern weapons, the stress of continuous \n     operations, and the noise, toxins, and other hazards of the \n     battlefield were encountered and anticipated. Military \n     physicians had to deal with realities of risk assessment, \n     prevention, medical evacuation, and the clinical management \n     of diseases and injuries; the outstanding performance of \n     deployed USUHS physicians has been recognized and verified by \n     the Surgeons General during Congressional Hearings and by the \n     medical commanders in response to the GAO. It is a fact that \n     ``the militarily unique courses provided by USUHS are NOT \n     available through civilian medical schools'' (American \n     Medical Association letter of endorsement to the Congress \n     dated May 14, 1996).\n       USUHS has consistently met, or exceeded, its mission. This \n     excellence in service was recognized in the House of \n     Representatives on May 15, 1996, with 343 votes for the \n     retention of USUHS vs. 82 votes for closure.\n       We believe that the Senate should reaffirm its decision for \n     the continuation of USUHS as a cost effective source of \n     militarily trained physicians for the Armed Forces. We \n     believe that we owe it to those who serve our Nation in the \n     Uniformed Services to provide them with the best medical \n     support that is available.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              J.C. Pennington,\n\n                                      Major General, USA, Retired,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to draw the attention of my \nfellow Members to a significant nonproliferation amendment now in the \ndefense authorization bill. I am pleased to have joined with the \nSenator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] in the provision that would withhold for \na period of 1 year Export-Import Bank credits for any entity that \nknowingly assists a nonnuclear-weapon state to acquire a nuclear \nexplosive device or the special nuclear materials for such a device. I \nam pleased that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] is joining \nus as a cosponsor.\n  This amendment, which has been adopted, represents a significant \nadvance in our efforts to target companies that are profiting from \nnuclear proliferation. It will strengthen the President's hand in \nshowing U.S. determination to do all that it can to prevent illicit \ntrafficking in nuclear weapons and the materials needed to make them.\n  Under current law, and subject to a national interest waiver, \nEximbank credits are denied to: First, any country that has violated an \ninternational nuclear safeguards agreement; second, any country that \nhas violated an agreement for nuclear cooperation with the United \nStates; third, any nonnuclear weapons state that has detonated a \nnuclear weapon, or fourth, any country that has willfully aided or \nabetted a nonnuclear weapons state to get nuclear weapons.\n  This amendment requires the President to apply sanctions against \npersons, including government-owned entities operating as commercial \nenterprises, that knowingly aid or abet efforts by a country to acquire \na nuclear explosive device or the nuclear material for such a device. \nThe amendment also authorizes the President to terminate sanctions upon \nreceipt of reliable assurances that the effort to aid or abet has \nceased and that such country or person will not in the future aid or \nabet any nonnuclear-weapons state in efforts to acquire nuclear \nexplosives or unsafeguarded materials.\n  Mr. President, in May the State Department announced that a firm \nowned by the Chinese Government--CNEIC,\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nChina Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation--had sent ring magnets to an \nunsafeguarded Pakistani nuclear enrichment facility and it had engaged \nin other undisclosed nuclear cooperation. The law provides for \nsanctions in such a case against China if the transfer was the result \nof a willful action by the Government of China. Under this amendment, \nCNEIC could be sanctioned specifically for its activities for a period \nof 1 year. With this amendment the United States would move away from a \nsituation in which Exim financing denial must be applied against a \nwhole country, or not at all, which has presented very difficult \nchoices. With this amendment, the denial of Exim financing can be \nfocused on the wrongdoer. This will help us avoid charades in which we \ndesperately avoid facing up to proliferation problems. As a result, \ncompanies and countries tempted to misbehave in the proliferation area \nwill know that there is a much more real prospect of penalties that are \nboth painful and appropriate.\n  This amendment represents a further refinement of an expanding array \nof sanctions legislation that is steadily evolving in order to make it \na more effective instrument of U.S. foreign policy in a bipartisan \neffort to end the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  This has included the Glenn and Symington amendments of the mid-\n1970's, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, and the \nNuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 as well as a number of \nother legislative initiatives.\n  The Senate has been in the lead of efforts to develop a coherent and \neffective nonproliferation policy for the United States. At times, \nthose of us most involved have worked closely with the executive \nbranch. At other times we have been at odds, but we have been able to \nreach reasonable compromises. As a result, the United States has set an \nexample for the rest of the world and has brought other nations along \nwith us. In addition, some of the nations most concerned about \nproliferation have taken their own initiatives and the result is a \nworld steadily more attuned to the problems posed by nonproliferation \nand better willing and able to deal with those problems.\n\n\n                           doe nuclear safety\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the distinguished Senator from the State of Idaho \ncare to engage me in a colloquy concerning the Department of Energy's \ncompliance with its nuclear safety regulations?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would be delighted to. The Idaho National \nEngineering Laboratory is a key DOE facility located in my State, and I \nam very concerned that it be operated in as safe a manner as possible \nwith regard to nuclear safety. As a fellow member of the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee who has DOE facilities in his own State, I know \nthat the Senator from Ohio shares these concerns.\n  Mr. GLENN. I certainly do. As the Senator knows, DOE has recently \nissued regulations pursuant to the Price Anderson Act/Atomic Energy \nAct. These regulations are entitled Nuclear Safety Management, 10 CFR \n830, and Occupational Radiation Protection, 10 CFR 835. A primary \npurpose of these regulations is to strengthen line management \naccountability for nuclear safety. These regulations are enforceable \nwith sanctions, such as fines and penalties, as appropriate. The \nstrength of the regulations is enhanced by public accountability, \nprimarily of the DOE contractors, through self-reporting, as well as \nthrough DOE inspections. Does the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nagree that these regulations will enhance the DOE's goal of improving \nnuclear safety?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Absolutely. A key factor in improving nuclear safety \nat DOE defense nuclear facilities is line management accountability. \nThe Secretary of Energy and Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board \nhave repeatedly highlighted this point. In order for Congress to be \nassured that such accountability is occurring, we should encourage the \nDepartment of Energy to provide Congress with regular briefings on the \nstatus of its compliance with the important nuclear safety regulations \nwhich we have discussed here today.\n  Mr. GLENN. I agree. Such briefings could include: First, a list of \ndefense nuclear facilities evaluated and a discussion of progress made \nin meeting the compliance requirements set forth in the Price Anderson \nnuclear safety regulations; second, a list of noncompliance events and \nviolations of the regulations identified by line management and \nheadquarters oversight; third, improvements in public safety and worker \nprotection as a result of these regulations; and fourth, any other \ninformation which the Department deems important.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I believe this is important information for Congress \nto have as it carries out its responsibilities. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Senator from Ohio on this important issue.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator and congratulate him on his leadership \non these issues on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, although I support many provisions of the \nbill, I will vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of \n1997.\n  This bill authorizes more than $10 billion above the funding level \nrequested by the administration and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This \nlevel of funding is simply unwarranted.\n  The United States spends more on its military than the next five \ncountries combined, most of which are our NATO allies. The Soviet Union \nis no more and the cold war has been won. Our military must focus on \nthe very real threats of today, not the ghost of the Warsaw Pact.\n  Furthermore, more than $2 billion of the congressional add-on is \nearmarked for programs that are not in the Pentagon's 5-year defense \nplan. These are programs that the Pentagon says it does not need now \nand will not need for the foreseeable future. Funneling billions of \ndollars into programs the military has made clear it does not need is \nbad policy in the extreme.\n  I am pleased that the managers have agreed to remove objectionable \nlanguage concerning the ABM Treaty from the bill. While the removal of \nthese legislative riders improves the bill, it still includes an \nunjustifiable authorization level for ballistic missile defense \nprograms. I vigorously support funding for theater missile defense \nsystems, but oppose the shift in emphasis contained to national missile \ndefense systems. To deploy a national missile defense system as \nenvisioned by the sponsors of this bill could cost up to $60 billion \nwhile contributing little to our national security.\n  The bill contains three amendments that I offered. An amendment \noffered by Senator Grassley and myself would cap the amount of \nreimbursable compensation for government contractors at $200,000. This \namendment will put an end to the multimillion dollar bonuses that \ndefense executives regularly pay themselves, and then pass the bill to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Another amendment I offered would make it easier for civilians to \ntake advantage of the tremendous resources available at the Defense \nLanguage Institute. Also, the managers accepted an amendment I offered \nto extend a pilot program for the purchase of municipal services at the \nclosing Fort Ord. I hope that the managers will work to retain these \namendments in conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nask a question of the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I, too, have an amendment that I would \nlike considered in this bill. I have discussed it with the staff and \nwith the principals. Because they do not want to go back to second \nreading, they did not want to do it at the present time. But in an \namendment which Senator Murray and I sponsored with relation to USTF's \nand medical care, we have a portion of section 722 that the two of us \nwould like deleted. I simply wanted the assurances, which I am sure are \nthere, of the Senators that they will work to do the job right for \nSeattle and the State of Washington in the course of the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I assure the Senator we will be glad to discuss this \nmatter in conference.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I respond to our friend from Washington that \nwe will be glad to work with him in conference to look at this. We have \njust not had time to completely diagnose\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\nand understand the effects of the amendment at this point, but we will \nbe glad to work with him in conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \nremaining votes following the vote on passage of the DOD appropriations \nbill be limited to 10 minutes in length, and there be 1 minute for \nexplanation to be provided prior to the votes with respect to the \nDorgan amendment and the Kassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, going back to the defense bill, I just \nwant to take this opportunity, although I have had printed the name of \nevery staff member of the Armed Services Committee following my earlier \nremarks in the Record--they all did a fine job--I just want to \nespecially commend the director, Les Brownlee, for the outstanding job \nhe has done. He has done one of the best jobs since I have been in the \nSenate in connection with a defense bill.\n  I also would like to commend Arnold Punaro, the director on the \nminority side, for doing such a fine job. He has been in the Senate \nsince 1973. We have been very fortunate to have Les Brownlee and Arnold \nPunaro to work with us on this defense bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the passage of S. \n1745, as amended.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

DESALTING TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Access to scarce fresh water is likely to be a cause of \n     future military conflicts in the Middle East and has a direct \n     impact on stability and security in the region.\n       (2) The Middle East is an area of vital and strategic \n     importance to the United States.\n       (3) The United States has played a military role in the \n     Middle East, most recently in the Persian Gulf War, and may \n     likely be called upon again to deter aggression in the \n     region.\n       (4) United States troops have used desalting technologies \n     to guarantee the availability of fresh water in past \n     deployments in the Middle East.\n       (5) Adequate, efficient, and cheap access to high-quality \n     fresh water will be vital to maintaining the readiness and \n     sustainability of United States troops, and those of our \n     allies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, \n     as improved access to fresh water will be an important factor \n     in helping prevent future conflicts in the Middle East, the \n     United States should, in cooperation with its allies, promote \n     and invest in technologies to reduce the costs of converting \n     saline water into fresh water.\n       (c) Funding for Research and Development.--Of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated by this title, the Secretary \n     shall place greater emphasis on making funds available for \n     research and development into efficient and economical \n     processes and methods for converting saline water into fresh \n     water.\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\n             Subtitle E--National Oceanographic Partnership\n\n     SEC. 251.

CONTRACT OPTIONS FOR LMSR VESSELS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress reaffirms the findings set forth in \n     section 1013(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 422), and \n     makes the following modifications and supplemental findings:\n       (1) Since the findings set forth in section 1013(a) of such \n     Act were originally formulated, the Secretary of the Navy has \n     exercised options for the acquisition of two of the six \n     additional large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) \n     vessels that may be acquired by exercise of options provided \n     for under contracts covering the acquisition of a total of 17 \n     LMSR vessels.\n       (2) Therefore, under those contracts, the Secretary has \n     placed orders for the acquisition of 13 LMSR vessels and has \n     remaining options for the acquisition of four more LMSR \n     vessels, all of which would be new construction vessels.\n       (3) The remaining options allow the Secretary to place \n     orders for one vessel to be constructed at each of two \n     shipyards for award before December 31, 1996, and December \n     31, 1997, respectively.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress also reaffirms its \n     declaration of the sense of Congress, as set forth in section \n     1013(b) of Public Law 104-106, that the Secretary of the Navy \n     should plan for, and budget to provide for, the acquisition \n     as soon as possible of a total of 19 large, medium-speed, \n     roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels (the number determined to be \n     required in the report entitled ``Mobility Requirements Study \n     Bottom-Up Review Update'', submitted by the Secretary of \n     Defense to Congress in April 1995), rather than only 17 such \n     vessels (which is the number of vessels under contract as of \n     April 1996).\n       (c) Additional New Construction Contract Option.--The \n     Secretary of the Navy should negotiate with each of the two \n     shipyards holding new construction contracts referred to in \n     subsection (a)(1) (Department of the Navy contracts numbered \n     N00024-93-C-2203 and N00024-93-C-2205) for an option under \n     each such contract for construction of one additional such \n     LMSR vessel, with such option to be available to the \n     Secretary for exercise not earlier than fiscal year 1998, \n     subject to the availability of funds authorized and \n     appropriated for such purpose. Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to preclude the Secretary of the Navy from \n     competing the award of the two options between the two \n     shipyards holding new construction contracts referred to in \n     subsection (a)(1).\n       (d) Report.--The Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees, by March 31, 1997, a report \n     stating the intentions of the Secretary regarding the \n     acquisition of options for the construction of two additional \n     LMSR vessels as described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Repeal of Superseded Provision.--Section 1013 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat 422) is amended by striking out \n     subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 1025. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING USS LCS 102 (LSSL \n                   102).\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should use existing authorities in law to seek the \n     expeditious return, upon completion of service, of the former \n     USS LCS 102 (LSSL 102) from the Government of Thailand in \n     order for the ship to be transferred to the United States \n     Shipbuilding Museum in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n                  Subtitle C--Counter-Drug Activities\n\n     SEC. 1031.

DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States continues to spend billions of \n     dollars to promote regional security and to make preparations \n     for regional contingencies.\n       (2) United States defense expenditures promote United \n     States national security interests; however, they also \n     significantly contribute to the defense of our allies.\n       (3) In 1993, the gross domestic product of the United \n     States equaled $6,300,000,000,000, while the gross domestic \n     product of other NATO member countries totaled \n     $7,200,000,000,000.\n       (4) Over the course of 1993, the United States spent 4.7 \n     percent of its gross domestic product on defense, while other \n     NATO members collectively spent 2.5 percent of their gross \n     domestic product on defense.\n       (5) In addition to military spending, foreign assistance \n     plays a vital role in the establishment and maintenance of \n     stability in other nations and in implementing the United \n     States national security strategy.\n       (6) This assistance has often prevented the outbreak of \n     conflicts which otherwise would have required costly military \n     interventions by the United States and our allies.\n       (7) From 1990-1993, the United States spent $59,000,000,000 \n     in foreign assistance, a sum which represents an amount \n     greater than any other nation in the world.\n       (8) In 1995, the United States spent over $10,000,000,000 \n     to promote European security, while European NATO nations \n     only contributed $2,000,000,000 toward this effort.\n       (9) With a smaller gross domestic product and a larger \n     defense budget than its European NATO allies, the United \n     States shoulders an unfair share of the burden of the common \n     defense.\n       (10) Japan now pays over 75 percent of the nonpersonnel \n     costs incurred by United States military forces permanently \n     assigned there, while our European allies pay for less than \n     25 percent of these same costs. Japan signed a new Special \n     Measures Agreement this year which will increase Japan's \n     contribution toward the cost of stationing United States \n     troops in Japan by approximately $30,000,000 a year over the \n     next five years.\n       (11) These increased contributions help to rectify the \n     imbalance in the burden shouldered by the United States for \n     the common defense.\n       (12) The relative share of the burden of the common defense \n     still falls too heavily on the United States, and our allies \n     should dedicate more of their own resources to defending \n     themselves.\n       (b) Efforts To Increase Allied Burdensharing.--The \n     President shall seek to have each nation that has cooperative \n     military relations with the United States (including security \n     agreements, basing arrangements, or mutual participation in \n     multinational military organizations or operations) take one \n     or more of the following actions:\n       (1) Increase its financial contributions to the payment of \n     the nonpersonnel costs incurred by the United States \n     Government for stationing United States military personnel in \n     that nation, with a goal of achieving the following \n     percentages of such costs:\n       (A) By September 30, 1997, 37.5 percent.\n       (B) By September 30, 1998, 50 percent.\n       (C) By September 30, 1999, 62.5 percent.\n       (D) By September 30, 2000, 75 percent.\n\n     An increase in financial contributions by any nation under \n     this paragraph may include the elimination of taxes, fees, or \n     other charges levied on United States military personnel, \n     equipment, or facilities stationed in that nation.\n       (2) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for national \n     defense as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 10 \n     percent or at least to a level commensurate to that of the \n     United States by September 30, 1997.\n       (3) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for foreign \n     assistance (to promote democratization, economic \n     stabilization, transparency arrangements, defense economic\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n     conversion, respect for the rule of law, and internationally \n     recognized human rights) by 10 percent or at least to a level \n     commensurate to that of the United States by September 30, \n     1997.\n       (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including \n     personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) \n     that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to \n     multinational military activities worldwide.\n       (c) Authorities to Encourage Actions by United States \n     Allies.--In seeking the actions described in subsection (b) \n     with respect to any nation, or in response to a failure by \n     any nation to undertake one or more of such actions, the \n     President may take any of the following measures:\n       (1) Reduce the end strength level of members of the Armed \n     Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in that nation.\n       (2) Impose on that nation taxes, fees, or other charges \n     similar to those that such nation imposes on United States \n     forces stationed in that nation.\n       (3) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment, or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) the amount the \n     United States contributes to the NATO Civil Budget, Military \n     Budget, or Security Investment Program.\n       (4) Suspend, modify, or terminate any bilateral security \n     agreement the United States has with that nation.\n       (5) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United \n     States bilateral assistance appropriated for that nation.\n       (6) Take any other action the President determines to be \n     appropriate as authorized by law.\n       (d) Report on Progress in Increasing Allied \n     Burdensharing.--Not later than March 1, 1997, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on--\n       (1) steps taken by other nations to complete the actions \n     described in subsection (b);\n       (2) all measures taken by the President, including those \n     authorized in subsection (c), to achieve the actions \n     described in subsection (b); and\n       (3) the budgetary savings to the United States that are \n     expected to accrue as a result of the steps described under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (e) Report on National Security Bases for Forward \n     Deployment and Burdensharing Relationships.--(1) In order to \n     ensure the best allocation of budgetary resources, the \n     President shall undertake a review of the status of elements \n     of the United States Armed Forces that are permanently \n     stationed outside the United States. The review shall include \n     an assessment of the following:\n       (A) The alliance requirements that are to be found in \n     agreements between the United States and other countries.\n       (B) The national security interests that support \n     permanently stationing elements of the United States Armed \n     Forces outside the United States.\n       (C) The stationing costs associated with the forward \n     deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (D) The alternatives available to forward deployment (such \n     as material prepositioning, enhanced airlift and sealift, or \n     joint training operations) to meet such alliance requirements \n     or national security interests, with such alternatives \n     identified and described in detail.\n       (E) The costs and force structure configurations associated \n     with such alternatives to forward deployment.\n       (F) The financial contributions that allies of the United \n     States make to common defense efforts (to promote \n     democratization, economic stabilization, transparency \n     arrangements, defense economic conversion, respect for the \n     rule of law, and internationally recognized human rights).\n       (G) The contributions that allies of the United States make \n     to meeting the stationing costs associated with the forward \n     deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (H) The annual expenditures of the United States and its \n     allies on national defense, and the relative percentages of \n     each nation's gross domestic product constituted by those \n     expenditures.\n       (2) The President shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     review under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not \n     later than March 1, 1997, in classified and unclassified \n     form.\n\n     SEC. 1046. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING EXPORT CONTROLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Export controls are a part of a comprehensive response \n     to national security threats. United States exports should be \n     restricted where those threats exist to national security, \n     nonproliferation, and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The export of certain commodities and technology may \n     adversely affect the national security and foreign policy of \n     the United States by making a significant contribution to the \n     military potential of individual countries or by \n     disseminating the capability to design, develop, test, \n     produce, stockpile, or use weapons of mass destruction, \n     missile delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. Therefore, the administration of export \n     controls should emphasize the control of these exports.\n       (3) The acquisition of sensitive commodities and \n     technologies by those countries and end users whose actions \n     or policies run counter to United States national security or \n     foreign policy interests may enhance the military \n     capabilities of those countries, particularly their ability \n     to design, develop, test, produce, stockpile, use, and \n     deliver nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, missile \n     delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. This enhancement threatens the security of the \n     United States and its allies. The availability to countries \n     and end users of items that contribute to military \n     capabilities or the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction is a fundamental concern of the United States and \n     should be eliminated through deterrence, negotiations, and \n     other appropriate means whenever possible.\n       (4) The national security of the United States depends not \n     only on wise foreign policies and a strong defense, but also \n     a vibrant national economy. To be truly effective, export \n     controls should be applied uniformly by all suppliers.\n       (5) On November 5, 1995, President William J. Clinton \n     extended Executive Order No. 12938 regarding ``Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction'', and ``declared a national emergency with \n     respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n     national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \n     States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and \n     chemical weapons and the means of delivering such weapons''.\n       (6) A successor regime to COCOM (the Coordinating \n     Commission on Multilateral Controls) has not been \n     established. Currently, each nation is determining \n     independently which dual-use military items, if any, will be \n     controlled for export.\n       (7) The United States should play a leading role in \n     promoting transparency and responsibility with regard to the \n     transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) establishing an international export control regime, \n     empowered to control exports of dual-use technology, is \n     critically important and should become a top priority for the \n     United States; and\n       (2) the United States should strongly encourage its allies \n     and friends to--\n       (A) adopt a commodity control list which governs the same \n     or similar items as are controlled by the United States \n     Commodity Control list;\n       (B) strengthen enforcement activities; and\n       (C) explore the use of unilateral export controls where the \n     possibility exists that an export could contribute to \n     proliferation.\n\n     SEC. 1047. REPORT ON NATO ENLARGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than December 1, 1996, the President \n     shall transmit a report on NATO enlargement to the Committee \n     on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.

NAMING OF BUILDING AT THE UNIFORMED SERVICES \n                   UNIVERSITY OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should name Building A at the Uniformed Services University \n     of the Health Sciences as the ``David Packard Building''.\n\n     SEC. 1072. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES-\n                   JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important \n     bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was \n     reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.\n       (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over \n     the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer \n     possible for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to \n     use exports as the sole engine of economic growth, but that \n     the Government of Japan must promote deregulation of its \n     domestic economy in order to increase economic growth.\n       (3) Deregulation of the Japanese economy requires \n     government attention to the removal of barriers to imports of \n     manufactured goods.\n       (4) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has begun the process of deregulation in the semiconductor \n     sector and is opening the Japanese market to competitive \n     foreign products.\n       (5) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has put in place both government-to-government and industry-\n     to-industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in \n     allowing cooperation to replace conflict in this important \n     high technology sector.\n       (6) The mechanisms include joint calculation of foreign \n     market share, deterrence of dumping, and promotion of \n     industrial cooperation in the design of foreign semiconductor \n     devices.\n       (7) Because of these actions under the United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement, the United States and Japan \n     today enjoy trade in semiconductors which is mutually \n     beneficial, harmonious, and free from the friction that once \n     characterized the semiconductor industry.\n       (8) Because of structural barriers in Japan, a gap still \n     remains between the share of the world market for \n     semiconductor products outside Japan that the United States \n     and other foreign semiconductor sources are able to capture \n     through competitiveness and the share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market that the United States and those other \n     sources are able to capture through competitiveness, and that \n     gap is consistent across the full range of semiconductor \n     products as well as a full range of end-use applications.\n       (9) The competitiveness and health of the United States \n     semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the \n     overall economic well-being and high technology defense \n     capabilities of the United States.\n       (10) The economic interests of both the United States and \n     Japan are best served by well functioning, open markets, \n     deterrence of dumping, and continuing good cooperative \n     relationships in all sectors, including semiconductors.\n       (11) A strong and healthy and military and political \n     alliance between the United States and Japan requires \n     continuation of the industrial and economic cooperation \n     promoted by the United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade \n     Agreement.\n       (12) President Clinton has called on the Government of \n     Japan to agree to a continuation of a United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond the current agreement's \n     expiration on July 31, 1996.\n       (13) The Government of Japan has opposed any continuation \n     of a government-to-government agreement to promote \n     cooperation in United States-Japan semiconductor trade.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Government of Japan has \n     refused to consider continuation of a government-to-\n     government agreement to ensure that cooperation continues in \n     the semiconductor sector beyond the expiration of the \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement on July 31, 1996; and\n       (2) the President should take all necessary and appropriate \n     actions to ensure the continuation of a government-to-\n     government United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     before the current agreement expires on that date.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United \n     States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement'' refers to the \n     agreement between the United States and Japan concerning \n     trade in semiconductor products, with arrangement, done by \n     exchange of letters at Washington on June 11, 1991.\n\n     SEC. 1073.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Armed Forces Force \n     Structures Review Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1092. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the \n     United States has conducted two substantial assessments of \n     the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet \n     United States defense requirements.\n       (2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the \n     ``Base Force'' assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton \n     Administration (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were \n     intended to reassess the force structure of the Armed Forces \n     in light of the changing realities of the post-Cold War \n     world.\n       (3) Both assessments served an important purpose in \n     focusing attention on the need to reevaluate the military \n     posture of the United States, but the pace of global change \n     necessitates a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces required to meet the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several \n     points, including--\n       (A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of planning to \n     fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional \n     conflicts;\n       (B) the force levels recommended to carry out that \n     strategy; and\n       (C) the funding proposed for such recommended force levels.\n       (5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on \n     Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of \n     Defense endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial \n     review of the defense program at the beginning of each newly \n     elected Presidential administration, and the Secretary \n     intends to complete the first such review in 1997.\n       (6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of \n     defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, \n     and reserve components, force modernization plans, \n     infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and \n     policies in order to determine and express the defense \n     strategy of the United States and to establish a revised \n     defense program through the year 2005.\n       (7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the \n     national security interests of the United States in the 21st \n     century, to assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the \n     review referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the \n     appropriate force structure of the Armed Forces through the \n     year 2010 and beyond (if practicable), it is important to \n     provide for the conduct of an independent, non-partisan \n     review of the force structure that is more comprehensive than \n     prior assessments of the force structure, extends beyond the \n     quadrennial defense review, and explores innovative and \n     forward-thinking ways of meeting such challenges.\n\n     SEC. 1093. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Requirement in 1997.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     shall complete in 1997 a review of the defense program of the \n     United States intended to satisfy the requirements for a \n     Quadrennial Defense Review as identified in the \n     recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of \n     the Armed Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive \n     examination of the defense strategy, force structure, force \n     modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of \n     the defense program and policies with a view toward \n     determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United \n     States and establishing a revised defense program through the \n     year 2005.\n       (b) Involvement of National Defense Panel.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall apprise the National Defense Panel \n     established under section 1084, on an on-going basis, of the \n     work undertaken in the conduct of the review.\n       (2) Not later than March 14, 1997, the Chairman of the \n     National Defense Panel shall submit to the Secretary the \n     Panel's assessment of work undertaken in the conduct of the \n     review as of that date and shall include in the assessment \n     the recommendations of the Panel for improvements to the \n     review, including recommendations for additional matters to \n     be covered in the review.\n       (c) Assessments of Review.--Upon completion of the review, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of \n     the National Defense Panel shall each prepare and submit to \n     the Secretary such chairman's assessment of the review in \n     time for the inclusion of the assessment in its entirety in \n     the report under subsection (d).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives a comprehensive report on the review. The \n     report shall include the following:\n       (1) The results of the review, including a comprehensive \n     discussion of the defense strategy of the United States and \n     the force structure best suited to implement the strategy.\n       (2) The threats examined for purposes of the review and the \n     scenarios developed in the examination of such threats.\n       (3) The assumptions used in the review, including \n     assumptions relating to the cooperation of allies and \n     mission-sharing, levels of acceptable risk, warning times, \n     and intensity and duration of conflict.\n       (4) The effect on the force structure of preparations for \n     and participation in peace operations and military operations \n     other than war.\n       (5) The effect on the force structure of the utilization by \n     the Armed Forces of technologies anticipated to be available \n     by the year 2005, including precision guided munitions, \n     stealth, night vision, digitization, and communications, and \n     the changes in doctrine and operational concepts that would \n     result from the utilization of such technologies.\n       (6) The manpower and sustainment policies required under \n     the defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts \n     lasting more than 120 days.\n       (7) The anticipated roles and missions of the reserve \n     components in the defense strategy and the strength, \n     capabilities, and equipment necessary to assure that the \n     reserve components can capably discharge such roles and \n     missions.\n       (8) The appropriate ratio of combat forces to support \n     forces (commonly referred to as the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio) \n     under the defense strategy, including, in particular, the \n     appropriate number and size of headquarter units and Defense \n     Agencies for that purpose.\n       (9) The air-lift and sea-lift capabilities required to \n     support the defense strategy.\n       (10) The forward presence, pre-positioning, and other \n     anticipatory deployments necessary under the defense strategy \n     for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to \n     anticipated conflicts.\n       (11) The extent to which resources must be shifted among \n     two or more theaters under the defense strategy in the event \n     of conflict in such theaters.\n       (12) The advisability of revisions to the Unified Command \n     Plan as a result of the defense strategy.\n\n     SEC. 1094. NATIONAL DEFENSE PANEL.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than December 1, 1996, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall establish a non-partisan, \n     independent panel to be known as the National Defense Panel \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Panel''). The Panel \n     shall have the duties set forth in this section.\n       (b) Membership.--The Panel shall be composed of a chairman \n     and eight other individuals appointed by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Chairman \n     and ranking member of the Committee on National Security of \n     the House of Representatives, from among individuals in the \n     private sector who are recognized experts in matters relating \n     to the national security of the United States.\n       (c) Duties.--The Panel shall--\n       (1) conduct and submit to the Secretary the assessment of \n     the review under section 1083 that is required by subsection \n     (b)(2) of that section;\n       (2) conduct and submit to the Secretary the comprehensive \n     assessment of the review\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n     that is required by subsection (c) of that section upon \n     completion of the review; and\n       (3) conduct the assessment of alternative force structures \n     for the Armed Forces required under subsection (d).\n       (d) Alternative Force Structure Assessment.--(1) The Panel \n     shall submit to the Secretary an independent assessment of a \n     variety of possible force structures of the Armed Forces \n     through the year 2010 and beyond, including the force \n     structure identified in the report on the review under \n     section 1083(d). The purpose of the assessment is to develop \n     proposals for an ``above the line'' force structure of the \n     Armed Forces and to provide the Secretary and Congress \n     recommendations regarding the optimal force structure to meet \n     anticipated threats to the national security of the United \n     States through the time covered by the assessment.\n       (2) In conducting the assessment, the Panel shall examine a \n     variety of potential threats (including near-term threats and \n     long-term threats) to the national security interests of the \n     United States, including the following:\n       (A) Conventional threats across a spectrum of conflicts.\n       (B) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     the means of delivering such weapons, and the illicit \n     transfer of technology relating to such weapons.\n       (C) The vulnerability of United States technology to non-\n     traditional threats, including information warfare.\n       (D) Domestic and international terrorism.\n       (E) The emergence of a major challenger having military \n     capabilities similar to those of the United States.\n       (F) Any other significant threat, or combination of \n     threats, identified by the Panel.\n       (3) For purposes of the assessment, the Panel shall develop \n     a variety of scenarios requiring a military response by the \n     Armed Forces, including the following:\n       (A) Scenarios developed in light of the threats examined \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Scenarios developed in light of a continuum of \n     conflicts ranging from a conflict of lesser magnitude than \n     the conflict described in the Bottom-Up Review to a conflict \n     of greater magnitude than the conflict so described.\n       (4) As part of the assessment, the Panel shall also--\n       (A) develop recommendations regarding a variety of force \n     structures for the Armed Forces that permit the forward \n     deployment of sufficient land- and sea-based forces to \n     provide an effective deterrent to conflict and to permit a \n     military response by the United States to the scenarios \n     developed under paragraph (3);\n       (B) to the extent practicable, estimate the funding \n     required by fiscal year, in constant fiscal year 1997 \n     dollars, to organize, equip, and support the forces \n     contemplated under the force structures assessed in the \n     assessment; and\n       (C) comment on each of the matters also to be included by \n     the Secretary in the report required by section 1083(d).\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than December 1, 1997, the Panel \n     shall submit to the Secretary a report setting forth the \n     activities, findings and recommendations of the Panel under \n     subsection (d), including any recommendations for legislation \n     that the Panel considers appropriate.\n       (2) Not later than December 15, 1997, the Secretary shall, \n     after consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, submit to the committees referred to in subsection \n     (b)(1) a copy of the report under paragraph (1), together \n     with the Secretary's comments on the report.\n       (f) Information from Federal Agencies.--The Panel may \n     secure directly from the Department of Defense and any of its \n     components and from any other Federal department and agency \n     such information as the Panel considers necessary to carry \n     out its duties under this section. The head of the department \n     or agency concerned shall ensure that information requested \n     by the Panel under this subsection is promptly provided.\n       (g) Personnel Matters.--(1) Each member of the Panel shall \n     be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the \n     annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level IV of the \n     Executive Schedule under section 5315 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for each day (including travel time) during \n     which such member is engaged in the performance of the duties \n     of the Panel.\n       (2) The members of the Panel shall be allowed travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, at rates \n     authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter I of \n     chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, while away from \n     their homes or regular places of business in the performance \n     of services for the Panel.\n       (3)(A) The chairman of the Panel may, without regard to the \n     civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an \n     executive director, and a staff of not more than four \n     additional individuals, if the Panel determines that an \n     executive director and staff are necessary in order for the \n     Panel to perform its duties effectively.

and\n       (E) does not withdraw retirement contributions under \n     section 8342 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) A person who, under paragraph (1), would otherwise be \n     eligible for an early deferred annuity under this section \n     shall not be eligible for such benefits if the person \n     received separation pay or severance pay due to a separation \n     described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph unless the \n     person repays the full amount of such pay with interest \n     (computed at a rate determined appropriate by the Director of \n     the Office of Personnel Management) to the Department of \n     Defense before attaining early deferred retirement age.\n       (c) Retirement Benefits of Transferred Employees.--In the \n     case of a transferred employee covered by a pilot program \n     under this section, payment of a deferred annuity for which \n     the transferred employee is eligible under section 8338(a) of \n     title 5, United States Code, shall commence on the first day \n     of the first month that begins after the date on which the \n     transferred employee attains early deferred retirement age, \n     notwithstanding the age requirement under that section.\n       (d) Computation of Average Pay.--(1)(A) This paragraph \n     applies to a transferred employee who was employed in a \n     position classified under the General Schedule immediately \n     before the employee's covered separation from Federal \n     service.\n       (B) Subject to subparagraph (C), for purposes of computing \n     the deferred annuity for a transferred employee referred to \n     in subparagraph (A), the average pay of the transferred \n     employee, computed under section 8331(4) of title 5, United \n     States Code, as of the date of the employee's covered \n     separation from Federal service, shall be adjusted at the \n     same time and by the same percentage that rates of basic pay \n     are increased under section 5303 of such title during the \n     period beginning on that date and ending on the date on which \n     the transferred employee attains early deferred retirement \n     age.\n       (C) The average pay of a transferred employee, as adjusted \n     under subparagraph (B), may not exceed the amount to which an \n     annuity of the transferred employee could be increased under \n     section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, in accordance \n     with the limitation in subsection (g)(1) of such section \n     (relating to maximum pay, final pay, or average pay).\n       (2)(A) This paragraph applies to a transferred employee who \n     was a prevailing rate employee (as defined under section \n     5342(2) of title 5, United States Code) immediately before \n     the employee's covered separation from Federal service.\n       (B) For purposes of computing the deferred annuity for a \n     transferred employee referred to in subparagraph (A), the \n     average pay of the transferred employee, computed under \n     section 8331(4) of title 5, United States Code, as of the \n     date of the employee's covered separation from Federal \n     service, shall be adjusted at the same time and by the same \n     percentage that pay rates for positions that are in the same \n     area as, and are comparable to, the last position the \n     transferred employee held as a prevailing rate employee, are \n     increased under section 5343(a) of such title during the \n     period beginning on that date and ending on the date on which \n     the transferred employee attains early deferred retirement \n     age.\n       (e) Payment of Unfunded Liability.--(1) The military \n     department concerned shall be liable for that portion of any \n     estimated increase in the unfunded liability of the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund established under \n     section 8348 of title 5, United States Code, which is \n     attributable to any benefits payable from such Fund to a \n     transferred employee, and any survivor of a transferred \n     employee, when the increase results from--\n       (A) an increase in the average pay of the transferred \n     employee under subsection (d) upon which such benefits are \n     computed; and\n       (B) the commencement of an early deferred annuity in \n     accordance with this section before the attainment of 62 \n     years of age by the transferred employee.\n       (2) The estimated increase in the unfunded liability for \n     each department referred to in paragraph (1), shall be \n     determined by the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management. In making the determination, the Director shall \n     consider any savings to the Fund as a result of the program \n     established under this section. The Secretary of the military \n     department concerned shall pay the amount so determined to \n     the Director in 10 equal annual installments with interest \n     computed at\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\n     the rate used in the most recent valuation of the Civil \n     Service Retirement System, with the first payment thereof due \n     at the end of the fiscal year in which an increase in average \n     pay under subsection (d) becomes effective.\n       (f) Contractor Service Not Creditable.--Service performed \n     by a transferred employee for a defense contractor after the \n     employee's covered separation from Federal service is not \n     creditable service for purposes of subchapter III of chapter \n     83 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (g) Receipt of Benefits While Employed by a Defense \n     Contractor.--A transferred employee may commence receipt of \n     an early deferred annuity in accordance with this section \n     while continuing to work for a defense contractor.\n       (h) Lump-Sum Credit Payment.--If a transferred employee \n     dies before attaining early deferred retirement age, such \n     employee shall be treated as a former employee who dies not \n     retired for purposes of payment of the lump-sum credit under \n     section 8342(d) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (i) Continued Federal Health Benefits Coverage.--\n     Notwithstanding section 5905a(e)(1)(A) of title 5, United \n     States Code, the continued coverage of a transferred employee \n     for health benefits under chapter 89 of such title by reason \n     of the application of section 8905a of such title to such \n     employee shall terminate 90 days after the date of the \n     employee's covered separation from Federal employment. For \n     the purposes of the preceding sentence, a person who, except \n     for subsection (b)(2), would be a transferred employee shall \n     be considered a transferred employee.\n       (j) Report by GAO.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a study of each pilot program, if any, \n     established under this section and submit a report on the \n     pilot program to Congress not later than two years after the \n     date on which the program is established.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Defense Against Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and \n     technologies are increasingly available from worldwide \n     sources. Technical information relating to such weapons is \n     readily available on the Internet, and raw materials for \n     chemical, biological, and radiological weapons are widely \n     available for legitimate commercial purposes.\n       (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast \n     array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain \n     the facilities, materials, and technologies capable of \n     producing additional quantities of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was \n     accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, \n     deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related \n     materials and technologies, economic hardships, and \n     significant gaps in border control among the states of the \n     former Soviet Union. The problems of organized crime and \n     corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union increase \n     the potential for proliferation of nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons and related materials.\n       (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have \n     substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile \n     nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction and related materials and technologies \n     from within the states of the former Soviet Union and from \n     unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.\n       (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of \n     potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is \n     greater than any time in history.\n       (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, \n     and Libya as hostile states which already possess some \n     weapons of mass destruction and are developing others.\n       (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons \n     of mass destruction is well within the capability of many \n     extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as \n     proxies for foreign states.\n       (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid \n     extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with \n     plausible deniability.\n       (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical \n     attacks against civilian targets in the United States and \n     Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.\n       (11) The potential for the national security of the United \n     States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, \n     or biological terrorism must be taken as seriously as the \n     risk of an attack by long-range ballistic missiles carrying \n     nuclear weapons.\n       (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by \n     weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military \n     targets in the usual sense of the term.\n       (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the \n     United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and \n     chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is \n     significant and growing.\n       (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents \n     involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical \n     materials, even if such materials are not configured as \n     military weapons.\n       (15) Facilities required for production of radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder \n     to detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological, \n     and chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery \n     means that are much harder to detect than long-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (16) Such delivery systems have no assignment of \n     responsibility, unlike ballistic missiles, for which a launch \n     location would be unambiguously known.\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n       (17) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical weapons, which might \n     be preferable to foreign states and nonstate organizations, \n     include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and \n     private vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments \n     routed through multiple destinations.\n       (18) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state \n     efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons \n     production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and \n     controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, \n     unconventional proliferation efforts.\n       (19) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do \n     little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a \n     capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical \n     or biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies \n     and equipment.\n       (20) The United States lacks adequate planning and \n     countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.\n       (21) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear \n     Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear \n     or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to \n     deal with emergencies involving biological, or chemical \n     weapons or related materials.\n       (22) State and local emergency response personnel are not \n     adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.\n       (23) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have \n     revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe \n     problems of coordination.\n       (24) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities \n     for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States \n     requires well-coordinated participation of many Federal \n     agencies, and careful planning by the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments.\n       (25) Training and exercises can significantly improve the \n     preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel \n     for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, \n     or chemical weapons or related materials.\n       (26) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the \n     Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided \n     assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in \n     neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive \n     ordnance, as well as radiological, biological, and chemical \n     materials, can be a vital contribution to the development and \n     deployment of countermeasures against nuclear, biological, \n     and chemical weapons of mass destruction.\n       (27) The United States lacks effective policy coordination \n     regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n\n     SEC. 1303.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REOPENING OF \n                   PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned \n     Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's \n     new capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a \n     bold, ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. \n     Capitol building and the White House, and symbolically the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government.\n       (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as ``America's Main Street''.\n       (3) 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' \n     is host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 15,000,000 annually.\n       (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent \n     location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the \n     People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of \n     freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their \n     government.\n       (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the \n     Department of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to \n     vehicular traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.\n       (6) While the security of the President and visitors to the \n     White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken \n     lightly, the need to assure the President's safety must be \n     balanced with the expectation of freedom inherent in a \n     democracy; the present situation is tilted too heavily toward \n     security at freedom's expense.\n       (7) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon \n     tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local \n     business owners and their customers, the closure of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the \n     government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the \n     former openness of the area surrounding the White House with \n     barricades, additional security checkpoints, and an \n     atmosphere of fear and distrust.\n       (8) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a significant burden for \n     additional security measures along the Avenue near the White \n     House.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should request the Department of the \n     Treasury and the Secret Service to work with the Government \n     of the District of Columbia to develop a plan for the \n     permanent reopening to vehicular traffic of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue in front of the White House in order to restore the \n     Avenue to its original state and return it to the people: \n     Provided, That the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret \n     Service certify that the plan protects the security of the \n     people who live and work in the White House.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). Under the previous order, the \nSenate now proceeds en bloc to the consideration of S. 1762, S. 1763, \nand S. 1764.

All after the enacting clause is stricken, \nand the text of S. 1745, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof. The \nbill is read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nthe vote on passage is laid upon the table.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate insists on its amendment, and \nrequests a conference with the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby) appointed Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Cohen, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coats, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kempthorne, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Frahm, Mr. Nunn, Mr. \nExon, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Bryan, conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7514-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7612-S7614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND RAILWAY LABOR ACT AMENDMENT--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Bennett, Hank Brown, Phil Gramm, \n           Strom Thurmond, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Richard Shelby, \n           Bob Smith\n\n  .Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nfor 1 minute of debate, and the time be divided equally between those \nin support of cloture and those opposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill has a simple message. It would \ngive people the benefits of collective bargaining without having to pay \ntheir\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nfair share. It ought to be called the national freeloaders bill. We \nhave no business telling the States that we know better than they how \nthey should manage their affairs. This is a direct attack on the \nability of working people to protect their economic interests. I urge \nthat the Senate reject cloture and protect the rights of working \nfamilies in State after State, in order to protect their economic \ninterests.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there is no issue that better defines the \ndifferences that exist between the two parties than the issue that is \nnow before the Senate. It is a simple, straightforward issue that many \nMembers of the Senate hope the public does not understand. Should a man \nor a woman in the greatest and freest country in the history of the \nworld be forced to join a union in order to have the right to work? \nThat is the issue.\n  If, in order to exercise one of our basic rights--the right to \ncontract our labor--we are forced to pay an institution that we do not \nwish to join, are we free, or is our freedom abridged? That is the \nquestion that is before the Senate, and I think the American people \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is set to vote on a motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1788, the National Right \nto Work Act. This measure was introduced on May 21 of this year, and it \nis my understanding that there have been no committee hearings or \nreports on the bill in the Senate. In addition, we are now preparing to \nvote to limit debate before having begun to debate this measure on the \nSenate floor. This does not convey a sense of responsible legislating.\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to federal right-to-work legislation. Let \nme first say that right-to-work is a concept that is often believed to \nmean ``equal opportunity,'' when it really does not extend to anyone a \n``right'' that he or she does not already have. The National Labor \nRelations Act of 1935 set forth a worker's right to belong to a union \nof his or her choice, as determined by democratic balloting. Under this \narrangement, unions and management were free to negotiate collective \nbargaining agreements which included a security clause. Essentially, \nthese clauses, which could not be approved without the consent of both \nlabor and management, required all employees of a unionized company to \npay dues to cover the costs of their representation. However, in 1947, \nthe Congress approved the Taft-Hartley Act, which gave each State the \noption to make its own determination on the so-called right-to-work \nissue. Currently, 21 States have approved right-to-work legislation, \neffectively outlawing union security clauses. Workers in these States \nare not required to pay dues toward the cost of their union's \nrepresentation. However, 29 States continue to have free collective \nbargaining. If we approve this legislation, we will be imposing a \nFederal mandate on those States, including my home State of West \nVirginia, that have chosen not to restrict union security clauses.\n  Mr. President, the right-to-work issue has become an emotional \ndebate, and this is the wrong debate. We should focus on the economics \nof the issue. There is no evidence that supports the argument that \nright-to-work will improve the wages, benefits, and working conditions \nof our Nation's workers. A report issued just last week by the \nCongressional Research Service concluded that right-to-work States have \na mean manufacturing wage of $10.91, compared to $12.56 for non-right-\nto-work States. Approving this legislation now will not demonstrably \nimprove the conditions of workers in those States that currently \nprotect free collective bargaining, and it may in fact lower their \nwages. This will not help workers in my State of West Virginia. Right-\nto-work is not a panacea for declining real wages for workers. In fact, \nthe evidence suggests that it may be a contributor to lower wages \nbecause it undermines organized labor's ability to bargain effectively \non behalf of its workers. While organized labor has made mistakes, it \nhas also accomplished a great deal for all working people, union and \nnon-union. What my State needs in order to create a favorable economic \nclimate and higher wages is to foster positive labor-management \nrelations--not to restrict labor and management from freely entering \ninto collective bargaining contracts. As such, I cannot support the \nproposal before us today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on legislation \nwhich undermines the basic principles of State rights and workplace \ndemocracy. S. 1788 would require all States to permit workers to \nreceive the benefits of collective bargaining without sharing in the \ncost of union representation.\n  Under current Federal law, States decide for themselves whether or \nnot to require all workers in unionized workplaces to share in the \ncosts of union representation. My State of North Dakota is one of 21 \nStates that have enacted so-called right-to-work statutes permitting \nworkers to elect not to pay union dues.\n  In the remaining 29 States with no similar statutes, unions and \nemployers negotiate to determine whether all workers will be required \nto share the costs of union representation. There is no general \nrequirement, even in these States, that all workers must pay union \ndues.\n  I support the ability of States to choose whether to enact laws \npermitting workers to opt out of paying union dues, or whether to \npermit workers and employers to negotiate freely on this issue during \nthe collective bargaining process. I do not support the legislation \nbefore us, which preempts the State's role in this important policy \ndecision.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition \nto the National Right-to-Work Act.\n  Today's legislation, coming on the heels of yesterday's unsuccessful \neffort to eviscerate the minimum wage, is simply one more example of \nthe Republican Party's systematic and unremitting attack on America's \nlabor unions.\n  Yesterday, my Republican colleagues fought against giving working \nAmericans a much needed helping hand, with a minimum wage increase. \nToday, they've brought to the floor a bill that would fundamentally \nundermine union efforts to genuinely represent and assist working \nfamilies.\n  At a time when we have many vital issues before this body, including \ngenuine health insurance reform--which remains mired in partisan \nconflict--the last thing the Senate should be doing is spending our \ntime debating this hasty and blatantly antiunion legislation.\n  Now, this bill was neither marked up nor reported out of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee. In fact, I wonder how many of my \ncolleagues have even had the opportunity to thoroughly understand this \nlegislation.\n  We've heard no testimony and we've held no hearings on this bill, \neven though it represents a major override of the laws in 29 States--\nincluding my home State of Connecticut--which reject right-to-work \nlegislation.\n  Now, since 1959, only three States have seen the need to enact right-\nto-work laws. In fact, over the past year, six State legislatures \nrejected such forms of right-to-work legislation.\n  But, at a time when I constantly hear talk from my colleagues across \nthe aisle about the need to shift responsibility to the States, this \nlegislation would fundamentally change numerous State laws governing \nlabor relations--laws that have remained largely unchanged over the \npast 37 years.\n  It would undermine our time-honored system of free collective \nbargaining by imposing unnecessary Government interference in the \nrights of labor and management to negotiate fair and agreed-upon \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  But, this bill is more than just a usurpation of State's rights. It \nwould also outlaw any form of collectively bargained union security \nprovisions. These are commonsense provisions that require nonunion \nworkers to pay their fair share for the costs of union representation.\n  It would say to nonunion members: ``You can receive the benefits of \nunion representation without having to foot the bill.''\n  In my view, these provisions are antiunion, anti-worker, and frankly \nantidemocratic. When it comes to the question of union benefits, no \nAmerican deserves something for nothing. But, that's exactly what this \nbill would do.\n  These provisions undermine the fundamental rights of employees who \nhave\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nvoted to unionize their workplace and I urge all my colleagues to \nreject this legislation and vote against cloture.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Senate votes on cloture on my \nmotion to proceed to S. 1788, the National Right to Work Act, I want to \ngive credit where due.\n  This bill represents the determination of Senator Lauch Faircloth to \nbring to the national agenda a critically important issue. That issue \nis the question of whether an American worker can be compelled to join \na union and pay dues to it.\n  The right to join a union is secured by law, as indeed it should be. \nThe right not to join is another matter.\n  Language to that effect in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 \nwas vitiated in the same legislation by a provision permitting union \nofficials to secure contracts requiring union membership as a condition \nof employment.\n  It is long past time for us to rectify that mistake.\n  I emphasize that this is not a matter of being pro-union or anti-\nunion. My father was a union pipefitter in a Mississippi shipyard, and \nI can personally appreciate the importance of union membership to \nmillions of our fellow Americans.\n  But the American people do not like compulsion, whether it is \ndirected against them or against their neighbors. Although we are a \nnation of joiners, we like to join groups and organizations of our own \nvolition, not because someone in authority tells us to do so.\n  That principle is especially important when it comes to earning a \nliving for yourself and your family. We should not tolerate efforts to \nhinder any American from that goal.\n  Twenty-one States have now enshrined that principle in their own \nlaws, to protect workers from compulsory unionism. In the remaining \nStates, entrenched interests have thus far staved off reform efforts.\n  I believe it is time to give all American workers the same right, \nwhether they live in 1 of those 21 States or in a State without a \nright-to-work law.\n  So I urge a vote for cloture on the pending motion to proceed, so \nthat the Senate can at last reconsider the issue of compulsory \nunionism, and vote on it, and do right by the working men and women of \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7612-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CALL OF THE ROLL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 295, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 295) to permit labor management cooperative \n     efforts that improve America's economic competitiveness to \n     continue to thrive, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dorgan modified amendment No. 4437, of a perfecting nature.\n       Kassebaum amendment No. 4438, of a perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have many times made statements about my \nlong interest in developing improved avenues of communication between \nemployees and their bosses, often referred to as codetermination. My \nstatement therefore, will be brief today.\n  When employees and employers decide to enter into workplace \ncommittees to discuss workplace-related issues, both sides must place a \ngreat amount of trust and faith in the other. But society has instilled \nin workers the idea that employers are not allies but adversaries. \nEmployers, who must be concerned about the health of the company, often \nview their employees in a similarly skeptical fashion.\n  For that reason, labor and management should always be commended when \nthey join together in sincere cooperation for the benefit of all \nconcerned. It is, however, important that the two be really interested \nin cooperating with the other and that the cooperation be sincere. Both \nemployees and employers must trust the other and be sure that their \nviews matter to the other.\n  While I do not see the need to create a strict framework for these \nconversations to take place, I do believe it is vital that employees \nfeel confident they will not be punished for sharing their honest views \nwith their employer. Workers must also feel that their views and \nthoughts are honestly being represented by those employee members of a \nworkplace committee.\n  For that reason, I strongly oppose S. 295. Workers cannot be expected \nto take part in any committee under the total control of their boss. In \nany competitive job market, what right-minded worker would take the \nrisk of sharing unpopular views about his workplace when the boss has \ncomplete control of the work committee?\n  During the 103d Congress, I introduced legislation outlining my views \non this issue. During Labor Committee consideration of S. 295, I worked \nto develop compromise legislation to allow employees to select their \nrepresentatives for workplace committees, to ensure that committee \nagendas are open to amendment by both labor and management and to \nprohibit unilateral termination of a workplace committee.\n  Teamwork is important on the playing field or in the workplace. As a \nold Princeton rugby player, I know you don't win the scrum unless you \nand your teammates have confidence in each other and work for the \nbenefit of all.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of teams and \nyet, must voice my concerns with the proposed TEAM Act. It is very \ndifficult not to support the initial goals of S. 295.\n  Who doesn't want cooperation between employees and their managers? I \nhave met with countless companies from across Washington State who have \nboasted of increased productivity and efficiency from these teams. \nTheir results have been impressive and have encouraged initiative and \nemployee participation.\n  However, these cooperative partnerships are currently in place and \nfunctioning without disruption. Teams today, throughout my State and \nacross American are succeeding and thriving. In fact, 96 percent of \nlarge employers and 75 percent of all employers report using such teams \nand employee involvement programs. These facts lead to my confusion \nover the need for additional legislation.\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\n  Employee committees, work teams, and quality circles that discuss \nquestions of efficiency, productivity, quality, and work practices are \ncurrently allowed. Nothing prevents these teams from existing today and \ntheir growing popularity in corporations everywhere is proof of their \nstrong existence.\n  I am most concerned about the delicate balance between management and \nemployees established by the National Labor Relations Act and enforced \nby the National Labor Relations Board. This board has been charged with \ninvestigating possible section 8(a)(2) violations which have averaged \njust three violations per year for the last 22 years. In fact 20 years \nago, the NLRB ruled against 29 section 8(a)(2) violations. Last year, \nthe NLRB ruled against just 24 violations. There is no growing trend to \nstop these partnerships. There are no attempts by the NLRB to seek out \nand prevent these law-abiding employee-employer teams.\n  These cases can be compared to the 7,478 cases in 1995 which forced \nemployers to hire back unlawfully discharged employees and the 8,987 \ncases last year in which employers had to provide employees back pay.\n  I wholeheartedly support the cooperation fostered through teams in \ncompanies both large and small. Washington State has witnessed enormous \nbenefits from these employee committees that discuss issued from \nefficiency to quality of life. Let's continue this cooperation without \ntipping the scale and sacrificing workplace democracy.\n  If the employer chooses committee representatives to discuss issues \nof wages and hours, we will lose the entire management-employee \nbalance. Mr. President, I have spoken with Secretary Reich about this \nissue after several meetings with concerned Washington State companies. \nI am confident that the teams now in place will remain in place and \ncontinue to prosper.\n  Let's maintain this current system, which is working, without \njeopardizing these critical relationships.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nTeamwork for Employees and Management Act, S. 295, better known as the \nTEAM Act. I firmly believe that to be competitive in today's \nmarketplace managers and employees need to have open lines of \ncommunication. The TEAM Act would amend the National Labor Relations \nAct [NLRA] to clarify that an employer may establish and participate in \nworker-management organization to address matters of mutual interest; \nquality, productivity, and efficiency. In addition, the bill would not \nallow the entity to negotiate or enter into collective-bargaining \nagreements.\n  Many American businesses have discovered that including their \nemployees in workplace decisionmaking has increased their productivity. \nUnfortunately, a series of rulings by the National Labor Relations \nBoard [NLRB] has prohibited employers from meeting with employees to \ndiscuss issues such as productivity, safety, and quality. While the \nNLRB made a decision based upon a fair interpretation which takes into \naccount current law, this law was written at a time when company unions \nwere commonly used to avoid unionization. However, I do point to the \nNLRA's failure to account for today's work force situations where there \nis an honest effort to increase productivity, safety, and quality among \nemployees and employers.\n  Mr. President, in my home State of Oregon we have seen tremendous \ngrowth and development, much of it attributed to the influence of the \nelectronics industry. To be competitive in today's international \nelectronics market, employees must act in partnership with management. \nThese partnerships succeed in a cooperative rather than an adversarial \nenvironment. However, under the specter of litigation, companies are \nfearful of implementing employee involvement programs [EI] or have \nstopped them altogether. Under the current National Labor Relations \nBoard interpretation of the law, the definitions are so broad as to \nprohibit or restrict implementing these employee involvement programs. \nAgain, many of our Federal labor laws were written in the 1930's, at \ntime when employers used company unions or sham unions to avoid \nnegotiating with representatives of employee selected unions. Labor \nlaws such as Davis-Bacon were written in the 1930's and we know that it \nis in dire need of reform. These laws need to be updated and employers \nmust be able to discuss the workplace environment without the fear of \nlitigation or violating the National Labor Relations Act.\n  I believe that the TEAM Act will update and improve existing law to \naddress the issue of legitimate company efforts to include employee \ninput and increase competition in the marketplace. As written, S. 295 \nonly amends the section of the NLRA which prohibits employer-dominated \nlabor organizations and specifically provides that all other rights \nunder the NLRA remain intact. Organizations do not have the authority \nto enter into or negotiate collective-bargaining agreements or to amend \nexisting agreements and the TEAM Act certainly does not affect an \nemployee's right to choose union representation. If workers choose to \nwork through union representation, the employer must recognize and then \narbitrate with the union.\n  Mr. President, my father was a longshoreman and I am an advocate for \nthe common worker. Yet, I support the TEAM Act. It is not a \ncontradiction to support labor and management when both mutually agree \nto improve work force efficiency, safety, and productivity; benefiting \nall those involved in the process. Give credit to today's workers who \nknow their options and know when they are being treated fairly or \nunfairly. The TEAM Act secures an innovative opportunity for workers to \ncontribute to the success of their companies. Let us ensure that \nworkers have that option by passing the TEAM Act.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nTEAM Act.\n  The future prosperity of the United States depends, in no small part, \non fostering a cooperative partnership between labor and management, so \nthat we can continue to produce the best products, provide the best \nservices, and develop the best work force in the world. This \npartnership is built on the principal of equality.\n  The United States is founded on this principal of equality. We, as a \nNation, have a strong sense of fair play and of the importance of a \nlevel playing field. Allowing workers a real opportunity to unionize, \nto elect representation, and to bargain collectively is an important \nand basic part of these values.\n  In the 1920's and 1930's companies routinely used company unions or \nemployee representation plans, as they were called to rebuff attempts \nby legitimate unions to organize and seek election by the workers \nwithin the company.\n  These company unions were created and controlled by management and \ncould be disbanded or disregarded at the convenience of the company. \nThe employee representatives were hand-picked so that workers would not \ndemocratically elect their own representatives.\n  The company unions ended with the enactment of section 8(a)(2) of the \nNational Labor Relations Act in 1935. Section 8(a)(2) was enacted to \nprovide workers with the opportunity to be represented by someone who \nwas not selected by the company, but rather someone who was \ndemocratically elected. The TEAM Act erodes that essential protection, \nand therefore represents a step back toward the days of company unions.\n  Current law does not prevent any worker from discussing any subject \nwith management. The law merely prohibits a worker or workers from \nacting as the representative of the employees, in an employer dominated \ncommittee, to make decisions regarding wages, hours, and conditions of \nemployment. Workers can meet individually, in small groups, or as a \nwhole with management to talk, express opinions, or give suggestions.\n  What Section 8(2)(a) prohibits is employer creation and domination of \nemployee groups where terms and conditions of employment are worked \nout. This falls under the prohibition that a company may not dominate \nor interfere with the formation or administration of any labor \norganization.\n\n  The fear of a return to company unions as a means of preventing union \nrepresentation is very real. In fact, a company called Executive \nEnterprises is holding conferences across the country this summer \nentitled, ``How to Stay Union-Free Into the 21st Century.'' At a \nsession called ``What Your Company Can Do Now to Preserve its\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nUnion-Free Status Before Organizing Starts,'' the brochure tells \nparticipants they will learn--how your employee participation and \nempowerment programs can be successfully modified to avoid unfair labor \npractices and aid in union avoidance. The intent could not be more \nclear, nor could a better argument be made against this legislation.\n  The legislation we are considering today was written based on the \nfalse premise that the protections provided to workers under section \n8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act prevent cooperation in the \nworkplace. Proponents argue that the National Labor Relations Act does \nnot allow modern management to work with employees in a cooperative \nmanner or in teams within the workplace.\n  In fact, section 8(a)(2) does not need to be weakened in order for \nthis cooperation or these teams to exist. Under the current protections \nprovided for in the National Labor Relations Act teams are flourishing \nthroughout the country.\n  There are teams operating in companies across my State of Illinois. I \nhave had the pleasure of talking with CEO's of Illinois companies who \nhighlighted the excellent results of having workers come together on \nteams to address production problems and quality problems.\n  Under current law, companies are allowed to delegate significant \nmanagerial responsibilities to employee work teams. Employers can put \ntogether employee committees to consider quality, efficiency, and \nproductivity. Employers can use employee expertise to help them create \nbetter, higher quality products in less time and with less cost, so \nthat American goods are better, cheaper, and more competitive in \noverseas markets.\n  Thirty thousand companies across the Nation have some form of \nemployee teams operating in their factories and shops; 96 percent of \nlarge employers have employee involvement programs and 75 percent of \nall workplaces have such programs. The numbers speak for themselves.\n\n  This legislation goes far beyond allowing cooperative teams designed \nto increase quality, efficiency, and productivity. This bill would \nallow employer chosen teams to engage in give-and-take regarding wages, \nhours, and other conditions of employment. Unelected employees would \nhave the ability to make decisions about the basic working conditions \nof their fellow workers.\n  One of the key arguments many companies have made is that they are \nconcerned that the teams operating in their shops may be found to \nviolate section 8(a)(2) in some way. The Electromation case has been \nheld up as an example of teams being ruled illegal by the National \nLabor Relations Board.\n  The background on this case is instructive. The employees at \nElectromation were unhappy over a series of changes the employer had \nmade to compensation and work rules. The employer responded by \nimplementing action committees. When the employees nonetheless turned \nto an outside union for representation, the employer suspended the \ncommittees and blamed the union for the suspension. The action \ncommittees were a vehicle to prevent union representation. A Bush \nadministration appointed NLRB found that, in the Electromation case, \nthe company had violated the law.\n  This case illustrates exactly the reason section 8(a)(2) exists, to \nprotect against abuse. Under current law, employee teams are legal and \nthey exist. As long as employers do not control the proceedings, \nemployers can talk with employees about any issue they choose. \nCooperation between employees and employers is vital to any successful \nbusiness and the law in no way prevents this cooperation. The law \nmerely prevents abuse.\n  Let us support a strong partnership between innovative employers and \ncreative employees, and continue to let this section 8(a)(2) of the \nNational Labor Relations Act protect the precious balance between the \nrights of employees and employers. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe TEAM Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong \nopposition of S. 295, the teamwork for employees and management bill. \nThis bill, the so-called TEAM bill, is part of the continuing \nRepublican assault on working families. It would virtually nullify \nsection 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, which forms the \nbasis for collective bargaining procedures in the United States, and \nprohibits employers from dominating or interfering with the formation \nof labor organizations. Labor organizations, as defined by the NLRA, \nare composed of employee participants and exist for the purpose of \ndealing with employers regarding grievances, labor disputes, wages, \nrates of pay, hours of employment, or working conditions.\n  The TEAM Act would gut section 8(a)(2). In the name of promoting \ncollaboration and communication between workers and managers, this bill \nwould allow companies to dictate the membership and agenda of workplace \nteams. These teams would make recommendations to management on issues \nof quality, efficiency, and productivity, but could also discuss \nbroader issues related to wages, hours, and working conditions.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I have no problem with \nthe concept of employers and employees working together in crosscutting \ngroups to develop innovative ways to improve quality or increase \nefficiency in the workplace. I have visited workplaces in my State that \nhave implemented quality circles and labor-management committees, and \nhave been impressed with their results.\n  An example is Master Lock, Inc., which I toured several summers ago. \nThis leading Wisconsin company is a shining example of how employer-\nemployee cooperation has led to improved working relationships and \nincreased competitiveness. The company's joint labor and management \ncoalition, comprised of various committees which address issues such as \nhealth and safety and ergonomics, has the support of the union and has \nresulted in improved employee morale and productivity.\n  Indeed, there has been a vast proliferation of such committees, or \nteams, in recent years. These organizations are useful, and legal, as \nlong as they do not interfere with the collective bargaining process. \nCurrent law allows employee involvement, which I wholeheartedly \nsupport.\n  What I do object to is the notion that companies should appoint all \nmembers of workplace teams, particularly in cases in which teams are \ngiven broad reign to discuss issues that have been the domain of \ncollective bargaining for the last 60 years. Under this bill, employers \nwould have the right not only to select who belongs to teams, but would \nalso be able to remove those members at any time, for any reason. \nManagement could set the agenda, including discussion of wages, hours, \nand working conditions, as long as the employee members did not make \nofficial recommendations on behalf of their colleagues on these issues. \nThis, I am convinced, would undermine the collective bargaining \nprocess.\n  Senator Robert Wagner, the original sponsor of the NLRA, recognized \nthat employees are empowered only when they select their own \nrepresentatives in a democratic process. More than 60 years ago, he \nsaid, ``[only] representatives who are not subservient to the employer \nwith whom they deal can act freely in the interest of employees. Simple \ncommon sense tells us that a man does not possess this freedom when he \nbargains with those who control his source of livelihood.'' And yet, \nthe TEAM Act threatens to take precisely that freedom away from \nAmerica's workers. Allowing companies to select all worker \nrepresentatives and dominate team activities would be a significant \nstep backward in workplace democracy. It would take us back to the days \nof company unions.\n\n  Supporters of the TEAM Act are quick to point out that the language \nof the bill specifically prohibits teams from engaging in collective \nbargaining with management. But in fact, employees who serve on \nmanagement-selected teams will represent their coworkers. That is a \nlabor organization, and that is precisely what Congress intended to \nprevent when it passed the NLRA. In fact, Congress has repeatedly \nrejected the notion of company-dominated labor organizations--in the \n1930's, and again in 1947 during debate on the Taft-Hartley Act.\n  This bill threatens real, democratically elected worker \nrepresentation. Even though the bill says that management-dominated \nteams would not be allowed to negotiate with employers\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\nabout wages, benefits, or working conditions, teams can still discuss \nall these issues, as long as they don't make recommendations to \nmanagement on behalf of workers. It is not difficult to imagine \nsituations in which managers who prefer dealing with self-selected \nteams would place more weight on the ideas of teams than on the \nproposals of unions. In this way, the bill threatens the viability of \nunions.\n  Labor experts agree. The bipartisan Dunlop Commission, made up of \nleading business, union, and academic representatives, conducted an in-\ndepth analysis of labor-management relations in 1993 and 1994. One of \ntheir recommendations, upon completion of the study, was: ``The law \nshould continue to make it illegal to set up or operate company-\ndominated forms of employee representation.'' Members of the Dunlop \nCommission, including four former Cabinet Secretaries, the CEO of \nXerox, a representative from the small business community, and several \nacademics, unanimously oppose the TEAM Act. I'm sure all of my \ncolleagues have also read the letter signed by more than 400 of the \nNation's labor law and industrial relations professors opposing this \nbill. They say in their letter, ``we are persuaded that passage of the \nTEAM Act would quickly lead to the return of the kind of employer-\ndominated employee organization and employee representation plans which \nexisted in the 1920's and 1930's.''\n  And in fact, that is the real goal of the TEAM Act. Management-\ndominated teams are antidemocratic mechanisms for companies to fight \nreal worker-selected representative labor organizations. They are anti-\nunion tools. Research has shown that employers who establish teams, or \nemployee involvement plans, after union organizing campaigns are more \nlikely to defeat unions than those who do not. Without exception, \nmanagers surveyed in a 1989 Harvard Business School study agreed that \nemployee representation plans were ``a valuable and proven \ndefense against unionization.''\n\n  Edward Miller, a former chairman of the NLRB and a current \nmanagement-side labor lawyer, testified in 1993 before the Dunlop \nCommission, ``While I represent management, I do not kid myself. If \nsection 8(a)(2) were repealed, I have no doubt that in not too many \nmonths or years sham company unions would again recur.''\n  There are many misconceptions among my colleagues about current labor \nlaw, and about what this bill would do. Fred Feinstein, the general \ncounsel of the NLRB, investigates possible violations of the NLRA and \nprosecutes meritorious claims. Mr. Feinstein recently responded to a \nletter from the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, to \nclarify what in his opinion were some inaccurate statements about the \nNLRA and the TEAM Act, made last week on the Senate floor. In his \nletter, Mr. Feinstein explained that, under current law, it is not \nillegal for employers to supply office supplies and meeting space to \nemployee organizations, or to talk to employees or seek suggestions. It \nis not illegal for employers to discuss flexible work schedules with \nemployees, or to seek input from them about improving productivity, or \nto talk to them about tornado warning procedures. Despite assertions to \nthe contrary made by my colleagues last week, none of these procedures \nis illegal.\n  The bottom line, according to the general counsel of the NLRB, is \nthat ``employees can provide information or ideas without engaging in \ndealing under the NLRA. Further, employees can make proposals through \nan organization, to which the employer may respond, where the employees \nhave control of the structure and function of the organization.''\n  If this Congress really wanted to empower workers and encourage \nemployee involvement and communication with management, it would allow \nworkers to select their own representatives to teams, so that they \nwould be accountable only to their fellow employees. More importantly, \nit would empower the NLRB to impose more powerful sanctions on \ncompanies that unlawfully discharge employees involved in union \norganizing. According to the Dunlop Commission, union supporters are \nfired illegally in one out of four elections. This rate is five times \nhigher than it was in the 1950's, and remedies often take place several \nyears after the event.\n  The real purpose of this bill is to undermine workplace democracy, \nand to bash on unions, not to empower employees. I am pleased that \nPresident Clinton has taken a stand on behalf of working men and women \nby pledging to veto this unwise and destructive bill. But I hope the \nbill never reaches his desk. I urge my colleagues to support \nrepresentative democracy in the workplace, and to oppose the TEAM Act. \nLet's respect the right of employees to select their own \nrepresentation, just as we have insisted on the right of citizens to \nselect their own representatives to this body for over 200 years.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to speak in \nfavor of the TEAM Act, S. 295. I want to commend our able chairman of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, for her \nvision and tenacity in shepherding this bill to the floor.\n  I have closely examined the arguments made by both labor and \nmanagement on the issue of teaming, and the state of current law in \nthis area.\n  In my view, Congress has a responsibility to provide an unambiguous \nsafe harbor for employers to utilize employee participation groups, \nquality circles, and other team concepts to advance the competitiveness \nof U.S. industry. The health of our economy and the jobs on which we \nall depend are at stake in this struggle.\n  The National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] has been left with the \ndifficult task of administering a 61-year-old statute which has changed \nlittle since its enactment in 1935. The state of labor management \nrelations was very different in those days, with unions struggling to \nsecure their place in our industrial fabric.\n  The National Labor Relations Act [NLRA] was a logical response to \nthis turbulent period in our labor management history. The provision of \nthe NLRA aimed at preventing employers from creating sham unions, \nsection 8(a)(2), was a direct response to this challenging period.\n  It is this very provision and how it is being interpreted today by \nthe NLRB that is the cause for this debate and the legislation now \nbefore the Senate.\n  Most labor management strife faded from the industrial landscape long \nago. In contrast, today, American businesses and their employees are in \nthe fight of their lives to remain competitive in this global \nmarketplace. We have lost tens of thousands of high-paying \nmanufacturing jobs over this past decade to foreign competition. \nUnfortunately, I can identify countless casualties in my own State of \nRhode Island.\n  This troubling circumstance has forced American industry to produce \nbetter products, to become more efficient and to increase productivity. \nThis painful, but necessary reexamination has placed an absolute \npremium on labor-management cooperation.\n  Those firms that have been able to succeed and adapt to this new \nenvironment have increasingly relied upon employee participation \ngroups, quality circles, and other team concepts to strengthen \nproductivity, weed out inefficiency, and respond rapidly to changing \nconsumer attitudes and demands.\n  Mr. President, enactment of the TEAM Act would simply conform labor \nlaw with what is already occurring on shop floors throughout America. \nThe fact is, employee involvement committees, quality circles and other \nteam concepts exist in some 30,000 workplaces across the country. All \nbut a small percentage of our largest employers stake their very \nsurvival on the ability to form team mechanisms and employee \nparticipation groups.\n\n  Here is the problem in a nutshell. Section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA \nprohibits employers from interfering with the formation and/or \norganization of any ``labor organization,'' or from contributing \nfinancial support to such entities. On the surface that seems \nreasonable.\n  However, the definition of ``labor organization'' makes illegal most \nof the employee involvement committees in operation today, since it \nstipulates that any organization which deals with hours of employment \nor conditions of work is a ``labor organization.''\n  The fact is that in today's complex workplace conditions of \nemployment can be very broadly construed to apply\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\nto how an assembly line is configured, to the kind of protective gear \nemployees must wear, or even to attendance policies.\n  Faced with this ambiguous situation, employers need to have a safe \nharbor within which such employee involvement committees can operate \nwithout fear of NLRB intervention.\n  The Team Act is that safe harbor. It would authorize the use of \nemployee participation teams to help strengthen the competitiveness of \nAmerican firms, while making clear that such mechanisms cannot be used \nto subvert or replace the collective bargaining process, or an \nemployee's right to union representation.\n  Employers and employees must be empowered with the necessary tools to \ncompete in a global economy. S. 295 is a logical, balanced response, \nwhich contains the necessary safeguards to protect unions and workers, \nwhile at the same time strengthening needed employer-employee \ncooperation.\n  I am hopeful President Clinton will reconsider his staunch opposition \nto this critical legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4437\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment 4437 offered \nby the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. There will be 1 minute \nof debate on the amendment equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is not a disagreement in this \nChamber about whether there ought to be teamwork in the workplace. We \nbelieve there ought to be opportunities for management and workers--\nthose who own businesses and those who work in the businesses--to get \ntogether and establish conditions to work together to become more \nefficient and to find ways to do things in a better way.\n  There is a lack of clarity as a result of NLRB decisions. I have \noffered an amendment that tries to establish additional clarity that \npermits workplace cooperation. There is a right way to do this and a \nwrong way to do this.\n  The amendment that I have offered, I think, is the right way to \nenhance teamwork in the workplace to achieve those goals. I believe the \nunderlying legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate does much \nmore than that in a negative way.\n  So I ask the Chamber to support the amendment that I have offered and \nto oppose the proposal that is brought to the floor of the Senate in \nthe underlying piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, regarding the Dorgan amendment, I \nwould just say that I think we are better off the way things are than \nto try to develop a rigidity that I think would occur in the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota. It requires a committee \nstructure that is very rigid and lacks the flexibility that we were \ntrying to address. I do not believe it in any way answers the concerns \nand the questions that have been raised by the actions of the NLRB \nregarding a lack of understanding on how employees get together under \nthe National Labor Relations Act. That was the purpose of the \nlegislation before in the TEAM Act, and I will address my amendment \nlater.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The question is on agreeing to \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. \nCochran] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4438\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 4438 offered by the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassebaum]. There will now be 1 minute of debate on the amendment \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum].\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, my amendment is identical with the \nHouse-passed language. I want to make a couple of points about why I \nbelieve the TEAM Act is important. One, it applies only to nonunion \nsettings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold her comments until \nwe can get order in the Chamber.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. This applies only to nonunion settings.\n  It has been misrepresented by some as applying to union companies as \nwell.\n  Second, the purpose for this is in order to say to employers that \nthey should be free to discuss with employees those issues of concern \nto both. It is to address an environment in the workplace that will \nhelp us meet the new reality of our competition and our productivity \ntoday that is important for good communication. It is a bill that only \nrepresents common sense. It is not in any way designed to be a \ndestroyer of the unions, and I urge support for my amendment and the \nTEAM legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  May we have order in the Senate, please.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a cosmetic change to the \nunderlying bad bill. Effectively, the TEAM Act would apply to 90 \npercent of American businesses. The fact is 30,000 companies now have \nthese joint, cooperative programs in workplaces across the country. \nThey cover 75 percent of all the employers, 96 percent of the Nation's \nbiggest employers. There have been 224 cases that have been brought \nover the period of the last 4 years. There have only been 15 cases \ndecided by the NLRB--only 15 cases; 30,000 incidents of cooperation and \nonly 15 cases in the last 4 years.\n  This is a solution to a problem that does not exist. Basically, what \nyou are doing with it is opening up the very real possibilities of \ncompanies being able to dictate who will speak for the employees on \nworking conditions and all other matters that concern them in the \nworkplace. It puts management in control of both sides of the \nbargaining table. It means management will be talking to itself instead \nof talking honestly with workers, and it does not deserve to pass. It \ndeserves the veto that it will receive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teamwork for Employees and \n     Managers Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of employers in the United \n     States to make dramatic changes in workplace and employer-\n     employee relationships;\n       (2) such changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``Employee \n     Involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) Employee Involvement programs, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and nonunionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers in the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of businesses in the United States, Employee \n     Involvement programs have had a positive impact on the lives \n     of such employees, better enabling them to reach their \n     potential in the workforce;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized Employee Involvement techniques, the Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful Employee Involvement \n     programs in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate Employee \n     Involvement programs have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930's when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) Employee Involvement is currently threatened by legal \n     interpretations of the prohibition against employer-dominated \n     ``company unions''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to protect legitimate Employee Involvement programs \n     against government interference;\n       (2) to preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) to allow legitimate Employee Involvement programs, in \n     which workers may discuss issues involving terms and \n     conditions of employment, to continue to evolve and \n     proliferate.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMPLOYER EXCEPTION.\n\n       Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act is \n     amended by striking the semicolon and inserting the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That it shall not constitute \n     or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under this \n     paragraph for an employer to establish, assist, maintain, or \n     participate in any organization or entity of any kind, in \n     which employees who participate to at least the same extent \n     practicable as representatives of management participate, to \n     address matters of mutual interest, including, but not \n     limited to, issues of quality, productivity, efficiency, and \n     safety and health, and which does not have, claim, or seek \n     authority to be the exclusive bargaining representative of \n     the employees or to negotiate or enter into collective \n     bargaining agreements with the employer or to amend existing \n     collective bargaining agreements between the employer and any \n     labor organization, except that in a case in which a labor \n     organization is the representative of such employees as \n     provided in section 9(a), this proviso shall not apply;''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

My \ncolleague, Senator Reid from Nevada, will address a number of the \ntopics, and our colleague, Senator Boxer from California, will address \na number of them. We will similarly have a discussion tomorrow about \nthe same issues.\n  The reason we wanted to do this, it is easy to be against things. It \ndoes not take any skill or any great intelligence to be opposed to \nthings. I think it was Mark Twain who once, when asked if he would \nparticipate in a debate, said, ``Fine, provided that I can be on the \nopposing side.'' They said, ``Why?'' And he said, ``That will take no \npreparation.''\n  It takes no skill, time, or preparation to oppose. Those who oppose \ncan do it immediately and quickly without much thought.\n  The question is not what are we opposed to. The question in Congress \nis, what do we stand for? Why are we here? What are we doing? What do \nwe want for this country?\n  I begin by saying, in the end and in the final analysis, the question \nof whether we are on the right track in this country, whether we are \nheaded in the right direction, is not measured by any myriad of \nstatistics put out by the Federal Reserve Board or the Treasury \nDepartment or the Census Bureau or any organization in this town or \nelsewhere; it is, finally, measured when people sit down at the supper \ntable at home at night and ask themselves, how are we doing? Is our \nstandard of living improving? Are we moving ahead? Are we able to find \ngood jobs, keep good jobs? Are our children able to find good jobs? Are \nwe secure? Is there crime in the street that threatens us? Do our kids \nhave an opportunity to go to good schools? Are our roads in good shape?\n  A whole range of questions like that relate to the determination of \nwhether individual families are doing better. In shorthand, the way of \nsaying it is, if at the end of the day the standard of living in this \ncountry is not increasing, then we are not moving in the right \ndirection. The question is, what kind of choices, what menu of \nopportunities exist for us to make decisions in this country in both \nthe private sector and the public sector that increase the standard of \nliving, keep us moving forward?\n  As a society, if you read the history of our country, you will \ndiscover that we have always had a circumstance where, generally \nspeaking, parents believed things work better for their children and \nthey were willing to do things to make life better for their children--\ninvesting in schools, for example, so that we would have the best \neducation in the world. Those are the kinds of things that created a \ncircumstance where our economy has been a remarkable economy, producing \njobs and opportunities, so that standards of living increased in our \ncountry routinely and regularly.\n\n  We have now reached a period where we are more challenged in those \nareas. We now have what is called a global economy in which 2 or 3 \nbillion workers around the world now compete with about two-thirds of \nthe American work force, and many of those other people around the \nworld work for very low wages. It is not unusual to hear the stories of \n10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 20- or 40-year-olds working for 10 cents an \nhour, 20 cents an hour or $1 an hour, for 10 hours or 15 hours a day in \nother parts of world. The product of that work shows up in Pittsburgh \nor Denver or New York or Fargo, to be sold on the shelf and purchased \nby the American consumer.\n  It all relates to this question: Are we doing the things necessary in \nthe public sector and the private sector to improve life in America and \nto increase the standard of living in our country?\n  About a year ago, Senator Daschle, the minority leader, asked Senator \nReid and myself to engage in an effort with other members of our \ncaucus, a fairly substantial group of the Democratic caucus, to put \ntogether an analysis of what is it that represents our positive agenda, \nwhat kind of things do we want to see accomplished in Congress, what \nkind of ideas exist that we think will improve life in America. We held \nmeeting after meeting and tried to get the best ideas that existed \namong those from the Democratic side of the aisle here in Congress in \norder to develop an agenda. The Senator from Nevada was very active in \nthat with me, and the Senator from California, Senator Boxer was very \nactive. We developed an agenda and worked with the Democratic caucus on \nthat agenda.\n  Following that, we took that as a starting point and then worked with \nthe members of the Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives \nand with President Clinton and others and synthesized this and \ndeveloped this into a fairly common agenda that says: Here is what we \nare for, here is why we are here, here is what we want to have happen \nthat we think will improve life in America.\n  Let me give you some examples. The agenda talks about ``families \nfirst.'' This is families first. I talk about it in the context of \njobs, kids, and values. That is what people who sit around the dinner \ntable talk about. What kind of jobs do we have? What kind of \nopportunity do we have? What kind of security do we have? What about \nour kids; how are the schools? What about crime? What about values? \nWhat are they seeing on television? A whole series of issues \nsurrounding families, American families.\n  We talk about it in the context of responsibility and security. \nFirst, we say we believe that we ought to have a balanced Federal \nbudget. We believe it is possible, we believe it is achievable, and we \nbelieve it ought to be done. It ought to be done the right way.\n  There are some who would balance the budget with all the wrong \npriorities. Last year I spoke at length about those who would say, \n``Let us cut the Star Schools Program by 40 percent and increase the \nstar wars program by 100 percent.''\n  Now, that is a wrongheaded approach, but we should balance the \nFederal budget. The era of big government is over. Our agenda does not \nsuggest that Government can, should, or will solve all of the problems \nof this country. But we can contribute in the right way. So we say we \nought to balance the Federal budget. That is part of the democratic \nagenda.\n  We ought to help small businesses, medium-sized businesses, and \nothers in this country thrive, survive, and create jobs and compete. \nThere are a series of ways to do that, and we talk about that in the \nagenda.\n  We ought to also reinvest in our communities and infrastructure. We \nought to make sure that the basic things that deal with everyday life--\nroads, bridges, rail systems, and others--are up to date and are not \ndecaying.\n  Then we talk about individual responsibility and a welfare system \nthat works. We call it work first. That is what we stand for--work \nfirst. We say, especially in this proposal for welfare, that we ought \nto get tough with deadbeat parents. Why on earth should other taxpayers \nbe stuck paying tens of billions of dollars that is owed especially by \nfathers who have left their families and decided they are not going to \npay a cent for the welfare of their children, so those deadbeats say to \nthe rest of the taxpayers, ``You pick up the tab of something I will \nnot pay for,'' which is basic care for their children. We say that has \nto stop. That is part of welfare reform as well.\n  A national crusade to end this burgeoning teenage pregnancy in this \ncountry is part of our agenda. That, of course, starts at home, in the \nhome, in the community. But we believe that is an important element of \nwhat we ought to be doing to try to improve life in this country.\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  On the issue of security and crime, we think the President's proposal \nto put more cops on the street, on the beat, to have more community \npolicing, makes eminent good sense. We support that and would increase \nit. We believe that there are initiatives to keep kids off the street \nand out of gangs that ought to be employed. Communities know best how \nto do that, and we can help those communities with programs and \nresources.\n  We believe that we ought to make an even greater effort to clean the \ndrugs out of our schools. We ought to say to everybody in this country \nwho is on probation or on parole that you are going to be drug tested \nwhile you are on probation or parole.\n  Our agenda talks about retirement security. We say those who would \ndip into employee pension funds and leave the pension funds vulnerable \nare doing a disservice to the people who work in this country. Stiffer \npenalties for the abuse of pension funds and a crackdown on companies \nwho have taken the money that you have earned and that you have saved \nin that pension funds is part of our agenda.\n  Making pensions portable, to move from one job to another, \nencouraging companies to make pensions available. Half of the American \nwork force does not have a pension.\n  The issue of health care. We have already passed a health care bill \nthat we have pushed hard for, which makes health care insurance \nportable and eliminates, in many instances, the pre-existing-condition \nrequirement.\n  Those are the kinds of things that are in our agenda. With respect to \nthe issue of jobs, we believe that it is time to say to American \ncorporations, and to all companies, that we want you to create jobs in \nthis country, not move jobs overseas. Our agenda says we are going to \ntake the first baby step--and it is only a baby step, but we are going \nto force it to be taken--to shut down this idiotic and perverse tax \nbenefit that says you can close your American plant, move your jobs \noverseas, and the taxpayers will give you a benefit. There is $2.2 \nbillion of reward in our Tax Code to go to companies who close American \nplants and shut off jobs here and move overseas. We say in this agenda \nthat, if you cannot take that first baby step, we do not have a chance \nof solving the jobs problem in this country.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, the families first agenda is not a big \ngovernment solution to what ails our country. This is a wonderful, \nremarkable country filled with strength, filled with, I think, hope and \noptimism, a country that needs to be led by people with a vision and \nagenda that says here are the practical steps that we can take to make \nthis a better country, to provide for opportunity and to provide for \nhope for all Americans. That is why we constructed an agenda. Is it \nperfect? No. Does it move us in the right direction? Yes.\n  This is not about appealing to special interests. It is not, as so \noften happens in this town, responding to the needs of the powerful. \nBut it is about putting the families first, trying to understand that \nwhen all the dust settles and the day is ended, the standard by which \nwe measure whether America has progressed is one in which we ask \nourselves: Have we improved life in this country for working families?\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to my colleague from Nevada, Senator \nReid, who cochaired the effort with me in the Senate caucus, and \nSenator Reid will continue to discuss part of this agenda. He will be \nfollowed by Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair advise the Senator how much time is left \nunder the control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 27 minutes \n35 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise the Senator when I have used 10 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as Senator Dorgan indicated, we were asked \nby the minority leader to be cochairs of a Democratic task force to \ncome up with an agenda for the Democrats. We were cochairs, and we had \na number of people who worked on the task force. The Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, was one that attended, I think, every \nmeeting that we held of the task force. I also think it is important, \nMr. President, to note that we did not do any polling to determine how \nwe should stand on issues. We had people come in and talk to us. We \ncame up with an agenda not based on opinion polls, but based on our \ngut, what we felt was the right thing to do for this country.\n  After having made that decision, Mr. President, we presented our task \nforce results to the Democratic minority, the leadership here, and they \naccepted, with some revisions, what we did. We then asked every member \nof the caucus to make some remarks, to go over what we had done, and to \nget back to us with the changes they thought should be made in our \nagenda. A significant number of Senators told us what they felt should \nbe changed. Many of those we were able to incorporate in the final \nproduct.\n  After that, Mr. President, we went to the ranking members and made a \npresentation to them of what we had come up with. They approved of what \nwe did. After that, we again took it to the entire caucus. They \naccepted what we did. At that time, the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, started a series of meetings with Representative Gephardt, the \nminority leader in the House of Representatives. After several weeks of \nconsultations and meetings, there was an agreement on refining what we \nhad done here in the Senate. Following that, the presentation was made \nto the President, the executive branch of Government, and they approved \nof it. Then there was a final roll-out of this product. We are very \nproud of what we have done. We believe that this agenda gives Democrats \nacross the Nation a view of how we stand on issues.\n  The agenda is designed to do some good for American families, instead \nof what we believe is a misguided scheme to reshape America, which has \nbeen offered this past year and a half.\n  This new agenda features realistic, moderate, achievable ways to help \nevery hard-working American family. It is the families first agenda, \nMr. President. It is an important program because we, first of all, \ntalk about security. There are all kinds of different securities that \nwe must be concerned with. A healthy, safe family certainly is a start. \nBefore you can discuss any of the security issues, you have to \nunderstand that we believe American families deserve economic and \npersonal security, paycheck security, health care security, retirement \nsecurity, and personal security.\n  Let us first talk about personal security. Never in the history of \nthis country have we had such difficult problems with security for \nkids. I am a father of five children, and it was a big occasion for us \nwhen our kids started school because the kids were getting into a new \nenvironment. It was a big occasion in our life when we would take the \nkids to school the first day. But basically after that the kids were \nsafe. They either went on a bus or lived close enough that they walked. \nKids did not have to worry about being beaten up or shot on the way to \nschool. But now they do. I can remember a real trauma in the life of \none of my children. They had been sprayed with a water gun on the way \nhome. Not anymore. Kids are sprayed with bullets from real guns. They \nare injured, maimed, and killed. These days we have to be concerned \nabout a world where we have this violence. All across America violence \nfrom drugs and gangs is creeping into the halls of our schools and \nstreets in neighborhoods all over America.\n\n  The Presiding Officer is from the beautiful State of Colorado. Mr. \nPresident, Colorado has gang problems. Colorado has drug problems. That \nwould have been unheard of to talk about 10 or 15 years ago. But not \nanymore. It is that way all over America. You cannot escape random \nviolence and problems.\n  Parents across this Nation in cities, suburbs, and small towns alike \nare increasingly worried about their children's safety. No one will \never come up with a single magic solution for the crime problem. But we \ncan take a strong step to fight crime by giving our police and \ncommunity leaders the tools they need to tackle violence and combat the \ninfluence of this pernicious drug problem.\n  We want to make sure we have enough police on our streets, and we \nwill work to keep our promise of 100,000 new police officers for local \ncommunities. We are about 40 percent of the way there.\n  I can speak being a Senator from Nevada. These police officers have \nhelped. Even in Nevada, the tourist mecca of\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nthe world, violent crime by adults is going down. We have problems with \nviolent crime by kids as we do all over America. But we are making \nprogress all over America. We are making progress because we have come \nto the realization that it is a small number of criminals--about 8 \npercent of the criminals--that contribute to over 70 percent of the \nviolent crime in America, and we are taking steps to make sure that we \ndo something with that 8 percent.\n  We have to be concerned--that we not only have to do something about \ncrimes being committed, but law enforcement must be involved in \nprograms to give them greater power to intervene with kids before they \ncommit crimes. That is before it is too late.\n  We want to help local community groups offer supervised places where \nkids can go after school to stay out of trouble. We spend these huge \namounts of money on capital construction for schools, and after 3 or 4 \no'clock in the afternoon the fences are put up, the lights are turned \noff, and they are not used. We believe they should be used.\n  The families first agenda calls for putting more cops on the beat, \nkeeping kids off the streets and out of gangs, cleaning drugs out of \nschools, and testing drug offenders.\n  Mr. President, security covers a lot. Safer families--we talked about \nmore cops on the beat. We talked about keeping kids out of gangs and \noff the streets.\n  But we also have to be concerned about paycheck security. Mr. \nPresident, paycheck security is something that we talk a lot about. But \nwe do not do a lot about it sometimes. It used to be when people went \nto work they stayed on the job a lifetime. Now the average life of a \njob is a little over 6 years. People are continually afraid of losing \ntheir jobs. We are concerned about that also. We believe that if we are \ngoing to have paycheck security there are certain minimums we must \nhave.\n  First, affordable child care--if we are going to get women off \nwelfare because--the vast majority of people who get aid to families \nwith dependent children are women. If we are going to get women into \nthe job market, we are going to have to do something about child care. \nThere is no other way.\n  We have to ban imports using child labor. And we have to have fair \npay for women; that is, we do not shy away from it.\n  This is a specific plank of the Democrats' families first agenda--\nfair pay for women. We just passed yesterday the minimum wage bill. \nMost people think the minimum wage bill is for teenagers at McDonald's \nflipping hamburgers--not true. Sixty percent of the people who draw the \nminimum wage are women. For 40 percent of the women it is the only \nmoney they get for themselves, and their families. We believe we have \nto have fair pay for women, and we did it a little bit yesterday--a \nsmall step by making sure that we increase the minimum wage.\n\n  Retirement security--many Americans cannot afford to worry about a \nsecure retirement until it is far too late because they are preoccupied \npaying the bills, keeping their kids clothed, fed, and in school.\n  Many parents do not realize the limits of their pension plans until \nthey are ready to retire, and there is nothing more they can do. \nRetirement security can also be easily thrown into jeopardy.\n  For elderly couples, their fixed-income pensions are dramatically cut \nbecause of a company bankruptcy, or one of the mergers that is taking \nplace in the last 10 years. Merger mania has run rampant in American \nbusiness.\n  Middle-aged workers are forced to change jobs, and they lose years of \nequity in their pension plans, and sometimes totally lose their pension \nplans. Women learn after it is too late that their husband unwittingly \nsigned away their survivor's benefits.\n  We want to make people's pensions more secure and more flexible. We \nwant to give more people access to pensions, including employees with \nsmall businesses. We want to let people take their pensions when they \nleave a job--portability.\n  We want to give families flexibility to use their IRA to buy a home \nfor the first time, or maybe even pay for college tuition. We want to \nprotect widows from unethical insurance companies who try to mislead \nthem into signing away their survivor's benefits.\n  Most importantly, we want to stop companies from raiding employee \npensions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Snowe). The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have 17 minutes remaining. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The families first agenda calls for pension reform, making \npensions portable, and protecting women's pension benefits.\n  Madam President, it is important, if we are going to have retirement, \nthat it be dependable. And that is why we talk about protecting the \npension savings to include Social Security and Medicare--better access \nand protection for women of the pension plans that they should be able \nto have at the right time.\n  We want an opportunity for a better future, to create jobs at home, \nboost small businesses, invest in our communities.\n  Education--we want educational opportunities.\n  One of a parent's proudest moments--and we have all been to them--is \nwhen they get a diploma. It does not have to be a diploma from Harvard \nor Yale or UCLA. It can be a diploma from a trade school. A parent is \njust as proud.\n  We have to make sure that a person's ability to go to college is not \ndependent on how much money their parents have.\n  That is what our families first agenda talks about.\n  For parents lucky enough to get children through school, the most \ncommon graduation present is thousands of dollars in student loan debt, \nand that applies whether the student goes to Harvard or Yale or a trade \nschool. Parents have to borrow the same.\n  Education is the key to opportunity. We want to offer families a \nhelping hand--a way to make sure their kids get to college or to a \ntrade school without busting the family budget. We want to make sure \nthat all children have the opportunity to advance educationally.\n  That is why we will offer some new scholarships to children who make \ngood grades and stay away from drugs--a new tax deduction making \ncollege and vocational school tuition tax deductible to help families \nafford education and job training. Our families first agenda calls for \na $10,000 tax deduction for college and job training--2 years of \ncollege for kids with good grades. And this includes trade schools.\n  We need affordable education. We have to make sure that our young \npeople can advance to the best of their ability. This requires \nresponsibility from all of us.\n  That is why we have supported a balanced budget without destroying \nSocial Security and Medicare. We want to make sure that we do what we \ncan to have corporations with a conscience.\n  We want to make sure that corporations have a conscience, and we feel \nthat must be done legislatively. They have to have environmental \nresponsibility. And certainly, can we not do away with giving tax \nbreaks to companies that move overseas and take jobs with them? The \nanswer is yes. We need personal responsibility. That has to be part of \nthe program, and that is why we have called for welfare reform that \nrequires work. We want to crack down on deadbeat parents, and we want \nto do what we can to attack teenage pregnancy. It is not enough to say \nwhat we stand for. We have a responsibility to tell America what a \nDemocratic Congress would stand for, and that is what the families \nfirst agenda does--tells the American public what we stand for.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would appreciate it if you would \ninform me when I have used 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I am very proud to be here today speaking on behalf \nof the Democrats' families first agenda. I thank my colleagues, Byron \nDorgan and Harry Reid, who preceded me today. We think it is important, \nas Senator Reid has said, the American\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\npeople know what Democrats stand for. We have been fighting for a lot \nof things this year. Sometimes we have won those battles. We have \nturned back the deepest cuts ever offered in Medicare. We have turned \nback the deepest cuts ever offered in Medicaid. We have turned back \nsome of the most outrageous attacks on our environment.\n  We have not won every battle at all. If one looks at the budget that \npassed this Republican Congress, it still calls for huge cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthiest. So those \nbattles are still out there. But we Democrats believe it is important \nfor us to tell the American people not only that we are going to fight \nagainst these misplaced priorities but also that we have a positive \nagenda that addresses the needs of America's families, wherever they \nlive in this great Nation of ours.\n  Why was it that we also felt we needed a Democratic agenda? Quite \nclearly, the voters sent us a message in 1994 when they said, \nDemocrats, you are not going to control Congress anymore. We are going \nto put the Republicans in control of the Congress.\n  Frankly, many of us were very stunned by that, but when I looked back \non it, I realized that what happened was we did not do a good job of \nletting the people know what we believed in. We assumed they knew. We \nassumed they knew we were fighting for families. We assumed they knew \nwe were fighting for children. We assumed they knew we were fighting \nfor the environment. We assumed they knew we were fighting for choice, \na woman's right to choose, individual rights, and for a budget that \nmoved toward balance but reflected our shared values.\n  Well, we were wrong. We were wrong. People did not really know that. \nTherefore, we decided to put together an agenda that spoke to the \nAmerican people. We have had many, many meetings, as Senator Dorgan has \nstated, and I was very glad to be at some of those meetings to put \ntogether this agenda that we bring to you.\n  In this agenda, we make clear our priorities. Yesterday, for example, \nwe tried to make sure that the minimum wage went to all of the workers \nat the bottom of the ladder. I was very appreciative that three or four \nRepublicans crossed over the line, and we defeated a Republican \nleadership amendment that actually would have deprived half the people \non the minimum wage of the increase they deserve.\n  So I really do think that it makes a difference who is here, and \nalthough we turned back the most egregious of the amendments, we still \nhave a policy where the people who are tipped employees are frozen at \n$2.13 an hour in this year, 1996, when it is hard to make it. It is \nhard to make it even on a salary that is far greater than that.\n  The Democratic agenda stems from three ideas.\n  One is security. There are various aspects of feeling secure in your \nlife. Certainly paycheck security is a part of it. It is very \nimportant. We need to know that we can pay for a roof over our family's \nheads. We need to know that we can put food on the table; we can pay \nfor health care bills; we can pay for college education, or at least \nafford to pay back the loans. So that is very important.\n\n  We need to know that we are safe in our streets. That is why we \nDemocrats applaud what President Clinton has done to put thousands and \nthousands of police in our communities. We applaud him for his courage \nin getting assault weapons out of the hands of gangs. We applaud him \nfor signing the Brady bill, where thousands of people with criminal \nrecords have been denied applications for guns. This has made America \nsafer.\n  We have more to do. We Democrats want to put more cops on the beat. \nThat is part of our security agenda.\n  We also do not want to see pensions taken away from people.\n  There was an extraordinary story on the front page of the Wall Street \nJournal about the employees of a company called Color Tile working day \nin and day out, putting aside for their pension. Do you know what \nhappened to their pension? The boss put it in the company, and when the \ncompany went bankrupt they not only lost their jobs, they also lost \ntheir pensions.\n  That is wrong, and we Democrats are going to fight for pension \nprotection. That is just one example of it. There are many, many more.\n  We read also in the area of pensions where people with 401(k)'s, \nagain employer-controlled plans, they buy antique cars and decorate \ntheir offices with paintings. This should not be allowed. We need more \nprotection for those pensions. People count on those pensions, and, in \nmany cases, women suffer the most when a working spouse dies and they \nare not treated fairly.\n  I think we can really move forward on security--paycheck security, \npension security, security from crime. These are the things that we are \ntalking about.\n  We talk about providing kids, all of our kids, with health care. It \nis a travesty to see a situation where little kids cannot get health \ncare, and then they wind up with serious problems, go to the emergency \nroom, and it costs a fortune for society to pick up the tab when we \nshould have provided, at a minimal cost, basic quality health care for \nthose children.\n  So we have a lot to do, and I think we can deliver.\n  Opportunity is the second idea. That is security. This is \nopportunity. Educational opportunity. I am an example of someone who \nwent to public schools all her life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Educational opportunity. I got a public education all the way from \nkindergarten through college. I serve in the U.S. Senate and I go toe \nto toe with some folks here who have gone to the best private colleges. \nThat is America. We give our young people the educational opportunity, \nregardless of their income. That is what separates us out from so many \nother countries. It is what makes us great. It is what has built the \ngreat middle class. We need to make sure all of our young people have a \nchance to go to college, and we Democrats say that is what we will do. \nEveryone will have a chance to go to college under our opportunity \nagenda, which will provide tax deductions for college and job training. \nFor children with good grades and no drug records we have proposed a \n$1,500 tax credit for the first 2 years of college in HOPE \nscholarships. The student has to maintain a B average and be drug free.\n  Economic opportunity. We are talking about making sure if you have a \nfamily business, you do not get taxed to death when it is passed to the \nnext generations. We are talking about a special program called State \ninfrastructure banks, where States can leverage small amounts of \ntaxpayer dollars to build the physical infrastructure to make sure that \nwe have safe highways and transit, to make sure we have a safe water \nsupply.\n  We must take care of our air and water. Here in Washington, a water \nalert has just been issued. We ought to make sure around here that \nthose who pollute our water are held responsible. We ought to make sure \nwe invest in systems that work, that will provide that clean water. \nThat is something else that we Democrats stand for.\n  We also stand for responsibility, not only on the part of the \nGovernment, but on the part of individuals. Yes, we call for a balanced \nbudget. I voted for three different ones--every one of them I was proud \nto vote for, certified by the CBO to balance and did not hurt Medicare. \nYou do not have to hurt Medicare, you do not have to hurt Medicaid, you \ndo not have to cut education, you do not have to cut environmental \nprotection to balance the budget. But the Republican plan, because of \nhuge tax cuts to those who are doing just fine, makes unconscionable \ncuts in those important programs.\n  We Democrats stand in opposition to that. We want to bring everybody \nalong. We do not want to give special deals to the people who earn over \n$250,000 a year. They are doing just great. They are doing just fine. \nWe need to make sure that average Americans can make it.

Madam President, we wanted to visit just a little bit \nabout the program that has been set up by our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. I am delighted that there has been some kind of effort to \nput together an agenda. I think it goes to indicate a little bit about \nthe differences that we have, in terms of solving problems for this \ncountry; differences that we have in terms of how we see the role of \nthe Federal Government in our lives and, really, an issue about this \nwhole matter of the end of big Government.\n  It is interesting. The Prime Minister this morning quoted the \nPresident and so on, saying ``The era of big Government is over,'' yet \nour friends on the other side bring out an agenda that describes all \nthe things that the Government is going to do. I have to tell you, I am \na little impressed with the notion that it is a matter of some spinning \nfor political purposes, rather than talking about what we really want \nto do.\n  The Democrats come out with an agenda to do something at the same \ntime they are keeping from happening all the things practically that we \ndecided to do this year. It seems to me it is a transparent kind of an \nidea of talking about it but not doing. Walking the walk? No. Talking \nthe talk? Of course. And that is where we are.\n  So I really think we ought to challenge our friends over there to \nreally take a look at what is happening here, and if they are talking, \nreally wanting to do what they are saying, let us do it. Let us talk \nabout health care. My friends on that side have not even allowed us to \nappoint conferees, to do something with the health care program that is \nthere and ready to be passed.\n  Our friends talk about balancing the budget. The Democrats were in \ncharge of this place and the House for 25 years and never balanced the \nbudget. Now the agenda is: Balance the budget.\n  Madam President, when you and I were in the House, we had a budget \ncalled ``Putting Families First.'' That budget included a $500 per \nchild tax credit, it included anticrime initiatives, it included \nwelfare reform, it included market-based health care reform, indexed \ncapital gains. Our friends opposed it. They said, ``We can't do that.''\n  That budget would have been putting families first, giving an \nopportunity for families to do the things for themselves that we think \nthey ought to do--putting families first. I guess all I can say is I am \nreally getting exasperated with this process of ours where the idea is \nto see how much you can spin and how much you can talk and how much you \ncan say but not do anything about causing it to happen.\n  It is almost cynical that we have now the most technical, greatest \nopportunities to communicate so people can have input into their own \nGovernment and, at the same time, it is more and more difficult to \nreally understand what people are for. And as this election comes up, \nthat is what we ought to be deciding: What direction do we want this \ncountry to take, not what people are going to say but, in fact, what \nthey have done.\n  The records do not match this kind of rhetoric. President Clinton \nopposed the balanced budget amendment. Those folks all voted against a \nbalanced budget amendment, practically all. The President vetoed the \nfirst balanced budget in a generation. That is the walk, that is not \nthe talk. We have had that this year.\n  Most of us came to the Senate and said voters told us very clearly, \n``We have too much Federal Government, it costs too much and we're \noverregulated,'' and we have tried to change that.\n  Frankly, the Democrats have done all they can do this whole year to \nkeep things from happening. We had an opportunity and we still have an \nopportunity: the first balanced budget in a generation to reduce the \nsize of Government, telecommunications reform happened this year, line-\nitem veto happened this year. It never happened before. Congressional \naccountability, product liability. We have done those things, and we \nwere able to achieve some of these goals, understanding that Washington \nis part of the problem, not, indeed, part of the solution.\n  So, Madam President, I have been very impatient with this idea of \ngetting up and making all these great speeches about things we are for, \nand then when we have an opportunity to do it, we have an opportunity \nto put it into place, then all we find is opposition, all we find is, \n``Well, I'm for a balanced budget, but I can't be for this one.''\n\n  ``I'm for welfare reform, but I can't be for this one.''\n  ``I'm for sending Medicaid back to the States some more, but I can't \nbe for this one.''\n  That is what we have heard the entire year, and continue to hear \nthat.\n  Now they come forth with the families first agenda, promoting most of \nthe things they have opposed throughout the year.\n  Madam President, I just find it frustrating, as you can probably \ntell. It is time that we begin to measure performance rather than \nmeasure rhetoric. We have an opportunity to do the things that we set \nout to do this year. We still have an opportunity to do it. We have an \nopportunity to have medical reform, we have an opportunity to have some \nwelfare reform, we have an opportunity to balance the budget, we have \nan opportunity to reduce the size of Government, we have the \nopportunity to have some tax relief.\n  Which of those things have been supported on the other side of the \naisle? None. But then they have an agenda, an agenda because that is \nwhat the polls say, and that is what it sounds good to say to people. \nIt does not matter that it is not going to happen. It does not matter \nthat they are not walking the walk, it is just talk the talk.\n  I suppose this is fairly harsh stuff, but I can tell you, I have \nwatched this go on now for some time, and it continues. Of course, as \nwe get toward an election year, it becomes more and more heightened in \nterms of the rhetoric that is there.\n  So I hope that as we make some of the changes that need to be made in \nthis Government, a government of the people and people deciding, making \ndecisions--that is what elections are about, talking about what \ndirection this country will take, and we have an opportunity to really \nmeasure performance, not rhetoric, and that is what we have an \nopportunity to do.\n  Madam President, let me yield to my associate from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7624-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7624-S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WORKING FAMILIES DESERVE SOLUTIONS, NOT SLOGANS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, we have heard a lot of talk from \nWashington recently about the hardships that are facing working \nAmericans. Tax rates are up, job opportunities are down, interest rates \nare rising while paychecks are shrinking and take-home pay is not going \nanywhere at all. But the families trapped on this economic seesaw are \nfeeling anxious and unsure about the future, and they are looking to \nthe Federal Government for some change.\n  Most everyone agrees that a fundamental responsibility of Congress \nand the President is to try to help ensure greater opportunities for \nworking Americans, so men and women can seek better jobs that will lift \ntheir standard of living, and the real debate going on in Washington \ntoday centers around just how that should be accomplished.\n  The Democrats in Congress are saying the answer is to simply raise \nthe minimum wage. But that is a political\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\nsmokescreen that flies in the face of reality, an attempt to mask a 40-\nyear record of voting for policies that have actually lowered family \nincomes.\n  The truth is that most minimum wage positions are either part-time \njobs that are held by students, entry-level jobs for young people who \nare just trying to get into the work force, or second jobs held by men \nor women whose spouse is the primary breadwinner.\n\n  Raising the cost of doing business by raising the minimum wage is \nprobably going to mean even fewer of those jobs. Some statistics say as \nmany as 600,000 of those jobs will be lost, killing work opportunities \nfor young people and those families who depend on that second income.\n  Besides artificially inflating salaries by hiking the minimum wage, \nit ignores the real concerns of many working Americans, working \nMinnesotans. Yes, they want better jobs that pay better salaries, but \nthey have told me repeatedly that what matters most is not how much you \nearn but how much of your own paycheck you are allowed to keep after \nthe Federal Government has deducted its taxes.\n  We have debated the issue and put the issue of minimum wage to rest \nby passing that legislation yesterday. Yet, the issue of tax relief for \nfamilies has been virtually ignored in the Democrats' ideas recently in \ntheir recently released blueprint for their 1996 campaign season that \nthey have entitled ``Families First.''\n  They are billing their plan as a roadmap for the future of their \nparty. Congressional Democrats have not created an agenda for change \nbut have instead produced a byproduct of some ambitious political \npolling. They say that they are in favor of education, in support of \nwelfare recipients working, and helping families and helping children. \nIn other words, if a majority of Americans told the pollsters they \nliked it, then according to the Democrats, they like it, too. ``Some \npeople say it is a tiny agenda, it is too modest or too bland * * * and \nmy answer is that whatever it is, it is what people told us is their \nconcern now.'' And these are the words of House Minority Leader Richard \nGephardt, in what really was a surprisingly forthright nod to the power \nof election-year polls.\n  Let me say again what Richard Gephardt said. He said, ``Some people \nsay it's a tiny agenda, it's too modest or too bland * * *'' Mr. \nGephardt went on to say, ``and my answer is that whatever it is, it's \nwhat people told us is their concern now.''\n  Again, the results of their polling.\n  This tiny agenda, however, comes with a massive price tag. Paying for \nthe families-first promises could cost American taxpayers an additional \n$500 billion over the next 6 years. While the document is so \nintentionally vague that computing a precise cost estimate is next to \nimpossible, it is clear that the cost would be enormous, especially if \nyou add that new cost onto the $265 billion tax hike imposed by \nPresident Clinton and the Democrat-controlled Congress in 1993.\n  If the families first title sounds familiar, well, it ought to \nbecause back in 1994, Republicans in the U.S. House championed a \nproposal we called ``Putting Families First,'' which I introduced along \nwith Congressman Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas.\n  We introduced the families-first bill in 1993; and in 1994 it became \nthe Republican alternative; and in 1995 we worked it into our first \nbalanced budget that we sent to the President last year. So the \nfamilies first title is not new.\n  Unlike the Democrats' families first, however, it was not a political \nstatement, it was not a statement that we conjured up to coax voters in \nan election year. Our plan, our families-first version, was a well-\nreasoned alternative budget proposal that was specifically crafted to \ncreate new opportunities for working Americans, to give them those job \nopportunities and the better pay that they are talking about.\n  The heart of our plan was a $500 per-child tax credit that would \nbenefit 529,000 Minnesota families. Nearly $50 million a year in tax \nsavings would go just to the residents in my State of Minnesota. That \nis far more than the 12,000 heads of households in Minnesota who would \nbe eligible for the boost in the minimum wage, according to data \ncompiled by the Joint Economic Committee.\n  So what would have done more good? It would have been better to pass \nsome of the tax relief that we have advocated and called for rather \nthan a smokescreen of just a small portion in the minimum wage. Putting \nfamilies first sought to further strengthen families by reforming the \nbroken welfare system, combating crime through new get-tough \ninitiatives, by offering sensible health care reform while reducing the \ndeficit by $150 billion. Republicans in both the House and the Senate \nembraced it as our alternative to the big taxing, big spending budgets \nof the past.\n  As a potent prescription for dramatic change, putting families first \noffered a strong defense of the American family. The Democrats' version \nof families first is a placebo, a lackluster concoction that will \nmasquerade as some new medicine, but in reality it offers no cures.\n  Republicans followed through on putting families first by passing \nbudgets in 1995 and 1996, balanced budgets, that built on that strong \nfoundation. We have pledged to continue to fight for the $500 per-child \ntax credit, for additional tax relief to make it easier for businesses \nto be able to create those better paying jobs, and a balanced budget \nthat will reduce interest rates and the amount that a family has to pay \non their mortgage, on their car loans and student loans.\n  Minnesota families deserve solutions, not a lot of empty slogans. If \nthe Democrats are serious, if they are serious about trying to ease the \ntremendous burden faced by American workers, then they will drop the \ncampaign theatrics and they will help join the Republicans in truly \nputting families first by turning our promises into law. I think they \ndeserve nothing less than that.\n  I thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor. If there are no \nother speakers, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, I wanted to call attention to the fact \nthat yesterday, as we passed the important piece of legislation dealing \nwith minimum wage, one of the issues that I do not think got the kind \nof attention that I had hoped it would receive, and really deserves, \nhas to do with pensions and has to do with the significant new \ncontribution we made to pension reform in the package of amendments \nthat we added to the minimum wage bill.\n  That legislation dealing with pensions has several categories, one of \nwhich is an issue which a number of our colleagues have expressed a \ngreat deal of concern about and are prepared to support in a series of \namendments dealing with women's pension equity. There is a significant \ndisparity among working people, between men and women, with regard to \npension equity.\n  Senator Boxer and Senator Moseley-Braun, in particular, added \namendments to this package which would begin to address that disparity, \nwhich would begin to close the gap, the chasm, really, between men and \nwomen when it comes to pensions. I want to publicly commend them for \ntheir leadership and their willingness to work with all of us to find a \nway with which to begin making the effort to close that gap and to \nprovide the kind of equity that I know all of our colleagues would like \nto achieve. Senator Boxer's provision will make it more likely that \nsurviving spouses--typically women--will be able to avoid significant \ncutbacks in the level of retirement income provided while their spouses \nwere alive. Senator Moseley-Braun's provisions\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nwill remove roadblocks that can prevent surviving spouses and former \nspouses from getting the benefits they are entitled to from both \nprivate sector pension plans and Federal retirement programs.\n  Beyond women's equity, we also dealt with the issue of pension \nportability. We have a very significant problem in this country that \nexists every time someone wants to leave their job to go to another \njob. Pension portability is almost as serious a problem as health care \nportability. We need to find ways with which our workers can take \npensions with them and keep increasing retirement savings without \nobstacles or cutbacks as they move from one job to the next. This bill \nwill expand the PBGC's missing participant program to help ensure that \nretirees who have lost touch with their former employer never find \ntheir benefits unexpectedly forfeited when the pension plan terminates. \nIt will also make it easier for new employees to enter their employers' \n401k plan immediately, rather than waiting to benefit.\n  Finally, there are a number of issues relating directly to pension \nsecurity that have to be addressed. Security for pensions is something \nthat increases in urgency for workers as they get closer to that date \nwhen they will retire. There is a pervasive sense of insecurity about \npensions in retirement today. Working people, men and women, are very \nconcerned about whether or not they will have the capacity to deal with \nthe problems that they know they will confront with regard to their own \nincome viability, their own ability to ensure some confidence that they \nwill have the necessary means to live in some security and comfort \nduring retirement. The way that we are going to be able to address that \neffectively is to put the kind of priority and attention on pension \nsecurity that it deserves. We took an important step yesterday by \nincreasing the guaranteed benefit provided to retirees from \nmultiemployer pension plans that become insolvent.\n  Several months ago, we laid out our desire to see an action agenda \naddressed. That action agenda has four components. The first was \npersonal security and the need to ensure that people are safe in their \nneighborhoods. The second was paycheck security and the real desire \nthat working people have to earn more income. The third was health \nsecurity. And the fourth is pension security.\n\n  Madam President, we are now at a point where we have been able to \naddress all four of those security questions. We have been able to \nprotect the cops on the beat program. We have made a downpayment in \nproviding better personal security out on the street than we had \nbefore. Yesterday, we passed the minimum wage bill.\n  We are working on both sides of the aisle, hopefully, to resolve our \ndifferences in the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation. I hope we can, at \nsome point, put that bill back before the Senate in an effort to \nresolve what remaining differences there are, in an effort to move it \nforward and to have a Presidential signature and, at long last, declare \nour victory with regard to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill.\n  Health insurance portability is something we all ought to support, \nand, in fact, have supported. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill passed by a \nvote of 100 to 0. There is no reason whatever that we cannot finish \nthat legislation this month. I hope we can continue to keep our eye on \nthe ball. Our eye on the ball in this case is clearly portability for \nhealth insurance.\n  All the other issues, as important as they may be, can be resolved, \nas well. But the important issue, the one matter that unites us all, is \nthe need to have that portability. We ought to use this legislation to \nget that job done.\n  Now, finally, pension portability and pension security--it is \ncritical we get that legislation passed. I am hopeful with the action \ntaken yesterday that will happen.\n  This is part of a larger agenda the Democrats have laid out, having \nthree components--security, which I have addressed, opportunity, and \nresponsibility. We will have a lot more to say about those three \ncomponents in the weeks and months ahead. I know that we are now \nprepared to go to the pending matter. For that, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7625-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have now completed the process that was \nlaboriously worked out to take up and consider the small business tax \nrelief package, the House-passed package that included minimum wage and \nsome tax considerations. Then we added to it the Finance Committee's \nwork and the managers' bill. We completed that whole process yesterday, \nand we have now taken up and considered amendments to the TEAM Act. We \nhave passed the TEAM Act.\n  In connection with all of that, earlier, we had caught up in that \nmaze the taxpayers bill of rights II. I tried yesterday to clear that \nfor unanimous consent because I believe there is overwhelming support \nfor the taxpayers bill of rights bill. I know one of the principal \narchitects of that legislation is Senator Pryor from Arkansas. But \nthere was objection heard to it because I understood maybe there were \namendments that were being considered to be offered to that bill. I \nunderstand now that maybe that is not true. I know that Senator Pryor, \nSenator Ford, and I think maybe Senator Grassley, and others, are \nworking to see if we can get agreement on that. That is something that \nwe clearly should do to give the American people some further rights \nwith regard to how they are dealt with by the Internal Revenue Service. \nThat is something we should do, and it is long overdue. But there was \nobjection.\n  Now, today, also caught up in the small business tax relief, minimum \nwage, TEAM Act, and gas tax act was another matter commonly referred to \nas the White House Travel Office. So I wish to seek unanimous consent \nthat we could get that legislation taken up and acted on because, once \nagain, it is clearly something that involves equity for the people \ninvolved. I thought that once we got all these other issues dealt with, \nthis would be something we could move.\n  So I am going to continue to try to move bills that are pending \nbefore the Senate. Some have been pending for a long time. It is my \nintent to try to clear for a unanimous consent agreement the bill \ndealing with the Gaming Commission, which is not something I am \nparticularly excited about, but there is a lot of interest in it, \nagain, on this side from Senator Lugar and Senator Coats of Indiana. I \nknow that Senator Simon is interested in that. My intent is to try to \nget it up and have it considered and deal with it, vote it up or down, \nbut stop holding things up.\n  I am trying to develop a pattern here of moving legislation, \ncertainly legislation that is not controversial, such as the taxpayers \nbill of rights, the White House Travel Office, and the Gaming \nCommission--although that could get to be controversial. If I find out \nthat there will be a lot of amendments beyond what were agreed to in \nthe committee, after consultation with the Democratic leader, we might \ndecide not to bring that up if we are going to have protracted debate \non that. We have work we need to do, such as the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. The two managers are here and are ready to go. We \nneed to get on with that. If we are going to have objections, then I \nguess we will not be able to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7626-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7626-S7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2937\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 380, H.R. 2937, \nrelating to the White House Travel Office. This provides for the \nreimbursement of attorney's fees and costs incurred by former employees \nof the White House Travel Office with respect to the termination of \ntheir employment in that office on May 19, 1993; further, that a \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, offered by Senator Hatch, \nbe offered and agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third time and \npassed, as amended, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. We have \nnot seen this amendment, to my knowledge. I do not know that anyone has \nshared it with us. I have not seen it. But I say that, beyond the issue \nof the Hatch amendment, there are Members\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\non this side who believe that it is important that we have a good \ndebate about this bill and about this issue. They have amendments that \nthey may be interested in offering. They want the opportunity to offer \nthose amendments, or to at least have the right to offer them at some \npoint.\n  So we would not be in a position to agree today to pass this piece of \nlegislation. We would need to look at the Hatch amendment. We need the \nopportunity, at least, to offer amendments. I think it is important \nthat that be done.\n  So, on that basis, we object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the manager of this legislation, and just note that \nthis was brought up and debated for a period of time. I was under the \nimpression that the Hatch amendment was available. I have a copy. I \nknow the other side does have it now. I would like to hear from Senator \nHatch on this matter. If, after review, perhaps they find that they \ncould then agree, then we would be prepared to ask for unanimous \nconsent later today to get this matter taken up and considered.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the minority has had this amendment for a \nlong time. Frankly, all it does is it takes the House bill, which would \nreimburse Billy Dale for his attorney's fees incurred in the criminal \nmatter. Our amendment makes it clear that we are only reimbursing him \nfor those attorney's fees, not for any congressional appearances; nor \nare we reimbursing anybody else for any congressional appearances. It \nclarifies and, I think, refines the bill so that it can be sent back to \nthe House. I believe they will take that in an instant because there is \na terrific injustice here. It is time to solve it. It got embroiled \nwithin the minimum wage debate. This is one of the reasons why many of \nus on our side agreed to go ahead with the minimum wage, which I \nbelieve the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and others on that \nside believe was a victory for them yesterday. I thought that once the \nminimum wage problem was solved, there would be absolutely nobody in \nthis Chamber who would not want to resolve what is really a tremendous \ninjustice to a person who has been treated very badly. I do not believe \nthere is anybody here who would really object to this bill.\n  Let me just say this. In the wake of this FBI matter, Mr. Dale and \nhis colleagues have found themselves in the news once again. After \ntrying to put the circumstances of their firings behind them, it was \ndiscovered that Mr. Dale's FBI file was requested by the White House \nSecurity Office after--let me repeat, after--he was fired--7 months \nafter--and right before he was indicted. It appears that the Travel \nOffice seven were not only fired unjustifiably, but in some cases their \npersonal and private FBI background investigation files, or file \nsummaries, were inappropriately requested and possibly reviewed.\n  I find it outrageous--as I think most others do on both sides of the \naisle--that the Clinton White House would have fired these public \nservants in such an insensitive and unfair manner and then improperly \naccess private information on some of them--especially Mr. Dale. That \nis how this whole Filegate thing has arisen. When they found that long \nafter they fired this man, and had done so inappropriately, and then \nintended to indict and prosecute him unjustly, they got these special \nsecret files from the FBI on Billy Dale.\n  Now, this just simply demonstrates the arrogance of power of some in \nthe White House with regard to this matter. To hold this up any \nfurther, even for amendments, it seems to me is something that really \nanybody has to think about, because previous attempts to pass this \nmeasure were stalled by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \neven though many of them told me they support the measure, including \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, who was the one \nwho spoke up when we first brought this bill to the floor.\n  First, Members on that side wanted to offer the GATT amendment. That \nwas Senator Pryor. Then there was the minimum wage amendment. I thought \nonce we solved the minimum wage issue, we would surely be able to bring \nthis up and get it done. Now the Senate has dealt with both the GATT \nprogram and the minimum wage. And now I understand, if I heard \ncorrectly my colleague from South Dakota, that some of his colleagues \nhave a desire to bring up additional unspecified amendments. Indeed, I \nhave to say it was requested at the staff level that the Senate delay \nconsideration of this legislation until Mr. Dale responds to some \nquestions submitted to him at the Filegate hearing.\n  Give me a break. It is beginning to look like some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle want to kill this bill more than \nanything else. I do not know of anybody who is willing to stand up and \nsay that. But that is what it looks like.\n  If there are legitimate germane amendments to the Billy Dale bill, I \nencourage my colleagues to produce them. Let us review them.\n  My hope would be to work something out and pass this bill today. And \nI am willing to work with my colleagues and accommodate it. This is a \nbill with the support of both Republicans and Democrats alike in the \nHouse.\n  Frankly, I fail to see any reason for holding up a measure that would \nsimply remedy the injustice resulting from the Travel Office firings. \nThroughout the lengthy debate on this bill, we must not forget that the \nbill is about Billy Dale and the other Travel Office employees. It is a \nbill that would reimburse their legal expenses for defending themselves \nagainst an unjust criminal investigation and prosecution.\n  Let me again explain unbelievable circumstances for their \nterminations.\n  After years of faithful service to the Government, Mr. Dale and other \nTravel Office employees were fired on May 19, 1993. In an attempt to \njustify the firings of these loyal public servants who worked for both \nDemocrats and Republicans in the White House, the current White House \nmet with and urged the FBI to investigate the Travel Office. The \nallegations brought against the Travel Office employees were conducted \nby those who had a vested interest in running the office themselves. If \nbeing fired was not tragic enough, the Department of Justice launched a \nFederal criminal investigation against the Travel Office employees.\n  As I have said, Mr. Dale was subsequently indicted, and despite the \nweakness of the case against him and after only 2 hours of jury \ndeliberations he was acquitted. Because of this questionable use of the \nFederal criminal justice system, Mr. Dale was forced to spend $500,000 \nin legal fees. The other Travel Office employees collectively spent \n$200,000 in legal fees for their defense. And aside from the crushing \nfinancial burdens on these people, these individuals were also burdened \nand continue to be burdened with defending their reputations.\n  The targeting of these dedicated public servants because they held \npositions coveted by political profiteers, I think, demands an \nappropriate response by this institution. And, although we can do \nabsolutely nothing to restore their reputations, their dignity, and \ntheir faith in the White House, it is only just that the Congress do \nwhat it can do to rectify this wrong.\n  By providing attorneys' fees we can at least financially make these \nGovernment employees whole--these innocent Government employees whole.\n  That is why we are here. That is why we would like to do it. This \nbill will be a mere statement by Congress that there was clearly an \narrogant abuse of power by White House officials against seven innocent \nemployees in favor of some close to the President who stood to gain \nfinancially.\n  It is one thing for the President to exercise his prerogative and \ndismiss them, it is another to do so and then concoct an investigation \nto justify dismissing them.\n  And we should all be embarrassed by the way our Government treated \nthese seven Travel Office employees, and we should make up for it by \npassing this measure today.\n  One last thing: The President himself indicated that he would sign \nthis bill. He knows that it was an injustice. I give him credit for \nthat. And, frankly, it was his White House that caused these tragedies. \nAnd he is willing to sign the bill.\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\n  There are other bills that the amendments can be added to that are \nnongermane. If there is something that is germane to this bill, bring \nit up. We will bring it up now. We will solve those problems. But we \nwill right this tremendous injustice and wrong. And this is the time to \ndo it.\n  I am hoping that my colleague, the distinguished minority leader of \nthe Senate, will recognize this. I hope that he can get the folks on \nhis side to cooperate and get this measure passed once and for all and \nthen let us go to battle on these other future issues at a later time.\n  On this one I do not think there is that much opposition among \nanybody on the Senate floor. At least I have never heard one ounce of \nopposition to this bill to right these wrongs.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Utah \nraises a couple of points that I wish to take just a moment to respond \nto. I know there are others on the floor who want to go to the DOD \nbill.\n  The Senator from Utah indicated that there are those who are asking \nquestions from Dale in particular with regard to his legal fees, and \nthat we were using that as the reason for holding this bill up. We are \nnot using that as the reason. We have not said that until we get that \ninformation we are going to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. \nThat is not our desire necessarily. But there are reports that Mr. Dale \nhad a fee arrangement with his attorneys, and that fee arrangement was \njust a fraction of what this bill would provide with regard to \nreimbursement for legal fees. If that is the case, then to provide a \nfee or a reimbursement many times what the fee may have been for Mr. \nDale it seems to us to be inappropriate.\n  The second issue is how unprecedented the nature of this legislation \nreally is. It is virtually unprecedented. I will not ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah today if he can give me a list of all \nof those occasions when we have done this in the past. But I think he \nwould be hard pressed to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it is unprecedented. Talk about unprecedented. It \nis unprecedented for the White House to order the investigation, which \nis what happened here.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take back the floor. Let me just say \nthat is not the case. And the Senator from Utah certainly knows is not \nthe case. That is not what happened, and I hope we could make sure that \nthe Record at least would be accurate as we address the circumstances \ninvolving this matter.\n  But the issue is are we willing to establish a new precedent here; \nthat every time somebody is investigated, every time somebody is found \nto be innocent of some charges, the Government then automatically \nreimburses that person for whatever legal fees they have incurred. If \nwe are prepared to do that, I think this side would have a very \nsignificant list of people that we may want to address. Shall we do \nthat for Congress as well? Where does it stop?\n  I think all of this needs to be considered much more carefully than \nwe have done thus far.\n  We have amendments we want to talk about. We think a good debate may \nbe in order before we set this precedent. Before we are asked to put \nour names on the line and vote affirmatively or negatively on this \nissue, ultimately I think a much better understanding of the facts and \na far better understanding of the complications regarding the \nunprecedented nature of this legislation ought to be considered.\n\n  So for those reasons, we are not prepared to go to the bill today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The minority leader is my friend. He knows that. I care \nfor him. He is a very fine person. I have to tell you that I do not \nthink anybody can come to the floor and say the White House in this \ninstance did not do an injustice here; that they did not try to use the \nforce of Government, the FBI, the Justice Department, and others to \ntake apart a very, very good person, and others working with him who \nhave worked for both Republican and Democrat administrations and to do \nit to take care of their own people.\n  I have to correct the record with regard to that. I do not think \nanybody doubts that. It is pretty much admitted. Even the President \nsaid he would sign this bill. That was not easy for him because he was \nin essence saying that he recognized that this is terrifically wrong \nand that his people in the White House did it.\n  This is what happened, on May 19, 1993 the White House fired all \nseven of these people. At least two of the individuals learned of their \ndismissal in the evening news that night. That is how they learned \nabout it.\n  The White House first stated that the firings came as a result of an \ninternal audit revealing financial irregularities in the office. \nSeveral months of independent review and oversight hearings uncovered \nthe actual motivation for the firings. Certain people in the White \nHouse and outside of the White House --friends of this President hoping \nto advance their own financial interests--attempted to destroy the \nreputations of the Travel Office employees and take over the Travel \nOffice business.\n  This issue is not going away nor am I going to let it go away. It \nought to be resolved. I am willing to say that the President has done \nwhat is right here in saying he will sign this bill. These same persons \nwho did this to these seven Travel Office people used the White House \nstaff members to initiate a baseless criminal investigation by the FBI. \nThat is outrageous.\n  If somebody in a Republican White House had done that, the fuss and \nfuror would never end.\n  We have tried just to resolve this problem in a dignified, reasonable \nway, and do it by paying their attorneys' fees that they incurred just \nfor this unjust criminal investigation and trial.\n  According to the congressional investigation, certain individuals in \nthe White House and outside of the White House were responsible for \nthese firings. Catherine Cornelius, a cousin of the President, employed \nat the White House, Harry Thomason, a personal friend of the President \nand First Lady, Darnell Martens, Mr. Thomason's business partner, and \nDavid Watkins, again--how often does he surface--assistant to the \nPresident for management and administration, these are the people who \nshoved it to these time-honored employees.\n  In December 1992, discussions took place between Miss Cornelius and \nWorld Wide Travel--a very appropriate name--the agency that served the \nClinton-Gore campaign, about the eventual takeover of the White House \nTravel Office business.\n  In January 1993, Watkins hired Miss Cornelius--keep in mind, that is \nthe cousin of the President--and soon thereafter, after he hired Miss \nCornelius, the Travel Office began taking calls for Miss Cornelius as \nthe new head of the Travel Office.\n  In February 1993, Miss Cornelius provided Watkins with a proposal \nthat would make her, the President's cousin, codirector of the White \nHouse Travel Office and would hire World Wide Travel, the Clinton-Gore \ncampaign travel group, as the outside travel specialists.\n  In April and May of 1993, Cornelius began to focus on the Travel \nOffice and, with Harry Thomason, claimed that there were allegations of \ncorruption within the office. During this time, Miss Cornelius and Mr. \nThomason pushed that World Wide Travel take over the Travel Office \nbusiness of the White House and other offices in Government.\n  In mid-May 1993, employees of the White House counsel's office, Miss \nCornelius and others, met with the FBI regarding the Travel Office. \nAlthough the FBI was unsure that there was any evidence, or certainly \nenough evidence in existence to warrant a criminal investigation, \nWilliam Kennedy, whose name constantly surfaces, former law partner of \nthe First Lady's at the Rose Law Firm, who was then at the White House \ncounsel's office, informed FBI bureau agents that a request for an FBI \nevaluation came from the highest levels of the White House.\n  At this time, they determined that Peat Marwick and Mitchell, the \naccounting firm, would be asked to perform an audit of the Travel \nOffice.\n  On May 14, Peat Marwick's management consultants made their first \ntrip to the White House.\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\n  On May 17, Mr. Watkins and Mr. McLarty decided to fire the Travel \nOffice staff. Although Mr. Dale offered to retire, Mr. Watkins told him \nto wait until the review was complete.\n  On May 19, Patsy Thomasson informed Mr. Kennedy that a decision had \nbeen made to fire the Travel Office workers and employees. Kennedy \ninformed the FBI, who warned him that the firings could interfere with \ntheir criminal investigation, Kennedy informed the bureau that the \nfirings would go ahead anyway.\n  That same day, before the bodies were even cold, Mr. Martens called a \nfriend from Air Advantage to have her arrange the Presidential press \ncharters. Meanwhile, Mr. Kennedy then instructed Mr. Watkins to delete \nany reference to the FBI investigation from talking points on the \nfirings. At 10 a.m. that morning, that very same morning, Watkins \ninformed the Travel Office employees that they were fired because a \nreview revealed gross mismanagement in the office. They were initially \ntold that after all these years of service to this country, service to \nthe White House, both Democrat and Republican administrations, that \nthey had 2 hours to pack up their desks and leave.\n  Watkins learned that Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers had publicly \ndisclosed existence of the FBI investigation as well as the Peat \nMarwick review. Later that same day, Myers gave another press briefing \nin which she denied that an FBI investigation had taken place. She had \nbeen warned. She knew that what they had done was wrong. She claimed \nthat the firings were based on the Peat Marwick review.\n  Interestingly, the Peat Marwick review was not finalized until May \n21, 1993, 2 days after the firings. The report was dated on the 17th, \nhowever. So you can see what we are dealing with here. The report gave \nno assurances as to either its completeness or its accuracy. In any \nevent, while the report found certain accounting irregularities, it \nfound no--none--evidence of fraud.\n  In May 1994, the General Accounting Office reported to Congress that \nwhile the White House claimed the terminations were based on ``findings \nof serious financial management weaknesses, we noted that the \nindividuals who had personal and business interests in the Travel \nOffice created the momentum that ultimately led to the examination of \nthe Travel Office operations.''\n  The General Accounting Office further noted that ``the public \nacknowledgement of the criminal investigation had the effect of \ntarnishing the employees' ''--that is s apostrophe-- ``reputations and \nthe existence of the criminal investigation caused the employees to \nretain legal counsel, reportedly at considerable expense.''\n  Of course, as everybody in this body knows, Mr. Dale was the only \nTravel Office employee to be indicted, and it took a jury only 2 hours \nto acquit Mr. Dale after a lengthy 13-day trial.\n  Mr. President, I sat on the Whitewater Committee. I have to say I was \nabsolutely amazed at the improprieties and the wrongdoing and the other \nthings that were really brought out. It was just a layer all across \nthat event. Even so, it was very difficult to understand because there \nwas just one thing after another, and I think people in this country \nare very mixed up about the Whitewater matter. They feel something is \nwrong, but it is so convoluted and complex, so filled with what some \npeople call ``the sleaze factor'' that it is very difficult to point to \nany particular huge bubble in that sleaze. But one thing everybody in \nthis country does understand and one thing that is not going to go \naway, certainly not until these people are reimbursed for their legal \nfees, will be the Billy Dale and the White House Travel Office matter.\n  In all honesty, I do not think anybody knows that there was a \ntremendous arrogance of power in the White House that really brought \nabout this improper action and these unjustified actions, what really \nwere offensive actions in misusing the FBI and other forces of law \nenforcement to indict and prosecute a really fine man that everybody \ntoday feels somewhat guilty about.\n  Let me tell you something. This is an appropriate case and one of the \nfew that I can cite in the history of the country where the right thing \nto do is to reimburse these people for these reasonable costs. In all \nhonesty, they have had even more legal fees because they have had to \nappear up here on Capitol Hill. My amendment however, would just \ncorrect the matter and make it very clear that the only reimbursement \nfor attorneys fees that they can get through this legislation, the only \nreimbursement will be for what happened in that limited period of time \nwhen they were criminally prosecuted and unjustly persecuted, and I am \nusing that word selectively, unjustly persecuted because of White House \nactions.\n  I do not care whether it is a Republican White House or a Democrat \nWhite House; we ought to all be concerned about doing what is right for \nthese people. In this case, it was a Democrat White House.\n  This issue is not going to go away. We are still searching to get to \nthe bottom of it. That is how the whole Filegate thing has come to \npass. That is how we now find two political operatives, people who \nthroughout their political careers have done opposition research, have \nspent their time trying to even sling mud at their own Democrat \nPresidential candidates--who were entrusted with the most sensitive, \nsecret, FBI files pertaining to people who had patriotically served the \nWhite House for years and years, young people who no longer are going \nto go back, or certainly nobody expected them to go back but who \nbelieve to this day now that somebody, somewhere, especially since the \nreports of Mr. Marceca taking computer disks home with Filegate \ninformation on people, they are concerned that someday, sometime in the \nfuture when they want to serve the Government again some of these \nsecret things that were in those files will be brought forth to smear \nthem and their lives.\n  I happen to know a lot about FBI files because, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, somebody who has been on that committee for 20 \nyears, we review these judgeship files all the time. Some of the best \njudges on the bench today during their younger years did things that \nwere not quite right. Some of them abused drugs. Some of them had \nproblems with alcohol. Some of them did things that, really, you would \nfind reprehensible today and would stop them from holding these \npositions. But they, in the intervening years, straightened out their \nlives, repented, did the things that were right, and we confirmed them \nbecause it is what they are today that counts.\n  But if somebody got hold of these files, which contain written down--\na bit like Mr. Aldrich's book--everything that is said, whether it is \ntrue or not, by people who have axes to grind, by people who are \ndishonest, by people who hate the nominee, by people who just plain are \nmisinformed, if some of those matters came out, they could destroy the \nlives of some of these eminent people today who are doing terrific \njobs, deserve our acclaim, deserve our support, and who, literally, are \namong the greatest people in our society today.\n  All of us are sinners in the sense that all of us fall short of the \nglory of God. These files show that in many ways.\n  Frankly, nobody to this day knows just what was taken out of those \nsensitive files. What we do know is that two people who had absolutely \nno qualifications, no credentials whatsoever, no training whatsoever, \nwho were known to do opposition research--which is what politicians do, \nsometimes, to find out all they can about the other side; generally, it \nis called dirt digging--these people who were known to do this were \nplaced in charge of that office, and one of them ordered up all these \nfiles that now are approaching almost 900 files. People thought it was \nonly 307 at first, but now it is up to 900 files, and it may be more \nthan that. We have no absolute way of knowing.\n  We do not know what was taken out of those files, but we do know \nthere were pink slips put in some of the files that indicate the guts \nhad been taken out and been used somewhere in the White House, and then \nthe testimony was they put the guts back in and pulled the pink slip \nout. So we do not know how many of those files were copied. We do not \nknow how many of them were on Mr. Marceca's computer disk that he took \nhome from the office, this low-level employee. We do not know any of \nthat.\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\n  What we do know is this. Senator DeConcini, at a very appropriate \ntime here, was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His top \nstaffer in charge of security on that committee, and thus one of the \ntop experts in the whole country on how you keep these files secure, \nconducted an investigation of the White House Security Office and found \nits operations seriously inadequate. Senator DeConcini wrote to the \nWhite House, telling them they better fix up this problem of security \nat the White House over FBI files and recommended they get somebody \nother than Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Marceca to take care of these \nmatters and to get some people there who are trained in that area.\n  As I understand it, Lloyd Cutler--for whom I have a lot of respect, \nwho is certainly a brilliant White House counsel--agreed with the \nletter 2 years before all this surfaced, and still nothing was done.\n  Now, we do not know who in the world hired Mr. Livingstone and Mr. \nMarceca, other than Mr. Stephanopoulos said, ``Well, it was Vincent \nFoster.'' Vincent Foster is no longer with us, tragically; tragically, \nnow deceased. It is easy to blame somebody who is deceased, who cannot \nspeak for himself. But we know there are others there who had something \nto do with hiring these two yo-yos and putting them in charge of these \nsensitive files.\n  That is what is involved here. The only way all of that came out was \nbecause when the excellent chairman of the House Government Reform and \nOversight Committee, Congressman Clinger, demanded papers that the \nWhite House refused to give, throwing up executive privilege. They \nrefused to give those papers. Finally he forced them into giving 1,000 \nof 3,000 pages that clearly were not covered by executive privilege. \nThe White House tried to hold back on him. And, lo and behold, looming \nup out of all of those names was the name of Billy Dale, that for which \nthey were looking, to see how badly treated this man and his associates \nwere.\n\n  Frankly, that is how this has all arisen. But it is not only Billy \nDale, but all kinds of other former White House heavyweight \nRepublicans, as well as many others who were not.\n  People all over the country are now asking, when is this all going to \nend? When is the Federal Government going to quit being the all-seeing \neye into the backgrounds and personal matters of its citizens? How can \nwe protect ourselves from a ``1984''-type government that noses into \neverything that we do or have done? All of that came out of the Billy \nDale matter.\n  To my colleagues on the other side, I am going to give them just a \nlittle bit of advice. I am not used to giving them advice, but I will. \nThis is one you would not want to play around with. This is one that, \nit seems to me, would be well to pass. Do what is right and get rid of \nit. I think the White House, my friends on the other side and everybody \nelse will be much better off if we do.\n  If this is not resolved and resolved quite soon, I have to admit, \nthis is never going to end, because it is a mess. It is wrong. I, for \none, am very, very upset about it. I hope my friends on the other side \nwill see the clarity of getting rid of this matter and going on to the \nbusiness of the U.S. Senate.\n  I hope we will not have any more desires to have nongermane \namendments after we have gone through this fiasco of the minimum wage, \nwhich was ostensibly the reason for holding up the Billy Dale matter. \nIf they have germane amendments, let us face them. Bring them out here, \nwe will debate them, we will vote on them, and whoever wins, wins; \nwhoever loses, loses. And we will pass this bill and do what is right, \nand, hopefully, when the President signs it, it will put it to bed. \nThat is what I would like to do.\n  I know I have taken a little longer than I care to take on this, but \nthis is something I feel very deeply about. I have gotten acquainted \nwith Billy Dale through the hearing process and so forth. He is a very \nfine man. He did not deserve what happened to him. We should do what is \nright in rectifying this wrong that started in the White House, which \nmisused the criminal process to abuse and persecute and, ultimately, \nprosecute this man at a huge cost, probably the cost of losing his \nwhole estate under the circumstances.\n  So I apologize to my colleagues for taking so much time. I do feel \ndeeply about this. I know my friend from Hawaii and others have \nimportant business to go ahead with.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first, let me commend my colleague from \nUtah. I think he made a very able, very cogent presentation with \nrespect to the merits of reimbursing someone who found himself in a \nsituation, through no fault of his own, having to spend hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. I certainly think we should move with speed to \ndeal with that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7626-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7630-S7631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SEVERE ECONOMIC CONSE-QUENCES TO NEW YORK UTILITY RATEPAYERS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to speak on another issue. \nYesterday, the Senate gave overwhelming passage to H.R. 3448. Among \nother things, H.R. 3448 contained the Small Business Job Protection \nAct. That bill did a lot of good things for many Americans. For \nexample, it extended the employer-provided education expenses for \nundergraduates and graduate students, something that had been allowed \nto run out.\n  It helped provide volunteer firefighters with their service awards--\nhundreds of thousands throughout this Nation. It brought about spousal \nIRA's for nonworking spouses, which is long overdue. Both Republicans \nand Democrats talked about this. And the tax provisions were provisions \nwhich were unanimously supported by the Finance Committee. Indeed, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York, my colleague and ranking \nmember of the committee, and I both supported this bill.\n  But, Mr. President, we supported it with a caveat, as it came up for \nmarkup--before the markup. We pointed out to the committee and to the \nchairman and to the staff that there was a provision that would bring \nabout very severe economic consequences to the State of New York and to \nthe ratepayers, the utility ratepayers, because in this bill there was \na provision that would require those utility companies, namely Brooklyn \nUnion Gas, Long Island Lighting Co., and Con Edison to redeem their \ntax-exempt bonds within a period of 6 months. Let me tell you what that \nwould mean, and let me tell you how much in the way of bonds that we \nhave.\n  We have outstanding $3.3 billion worth of tax-exempt bonds. Con \nEdison has $1.7 billion; LILCO, $950 million; Brooklyn Union Gas, $650 \nmillion. If these utilities were required to redeem their tax-exempt \nbonds with ordinary bonds, it would mean that the taxpayers and \nratepayers of Long Island, Westchester, and New York City would pay an \nadditional $65 million a year over the life of those bonds. We are \ntalking about $1.6 billion--more than $1.6 billion.\n  Let me say, we already pay the highest electric rates in the Nation. \nThis would cost Long Islanders alone more than $35 million a year.\n  That is just unconscionable. Let me say here and now, we are not \ngoing to stand still for this. This Senator is not going to agree to \nconferees being appointed until or unless this onerous, ridiculous, \nconfiscatory provision is dropped from the bill.\n  Now, we were assured that it would be dropped from the bill, it would \nbe dealt with, that technically they would take care of it. ``Don't \nworry,'' in between the time of the markup and bringing this bill to \nthe floor and passage, ``don't worry about it. It will be taken care \nof.''\n  We are not looking to disadvantage anybody. If my State and the \ntaxpayers of my State have to pay $65 million a year more in order to \nsave $80 million over a 10-year period of time, somebody's arithmetic \ndoes not add up, and it does not make sense. I am not going to stand by \nand have our ratepayers get hit with this unconscionable kind of \nnonsensical--nonsensical --legal gymnastics. It does not make sense.\n  Understand, the Treasury will pick up $80 million--approximately $80 \nmillion--over a 10-year period of time, but it will wind up costing the \nNew York ratepayers and taxpayers and those\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\nwho pay their utility bills, because those costs will be passed on from \nthe utility to the ratepayers, $65 million a year more. Over a 25-year \nlife--and it is a minimum of 25 years--it is $1.6 billion.\n  Let me tell you, Long Island already has the highest energy cost in \nthe Nation. We are going to add another $30 to $35 million a year to \nthat? We have jobs that are fleeing, industries that cannot compete, \npeople who cannot use their air-conditioning in the summer because the \nrates are so high, the highest rates in the Nation.\n  So it was not an idle threat when this Senator and my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, indicated to the committee and to the \nchairman that this provision was not one that was acceptable. As a \nmatter of fact, I assumed, given the promises that were made to us that \nit was taken care of, that it was dealt with in a way that would not \ncreate that burden, and that is what we were promised. That is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my distinguished friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. He used the word ``threat,'' but then said ``promise.'' \nThe point here is that we had an understanding. Would he not agree we \nhad an understanding?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would he not agree that this can be changed, but that \nif the bill is to go to conference, since we cannot bring it back up, \nit is possible for it to go to conference with an understanding on the \npart of the conferees that they will not return without a correction \nhaving been made?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe that would be the only way in which we could \nhandle this matter.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We would not be able to agree to conferees.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We have two here.\n  Mr. REID. Whichever New York Senator has the floor. It appears this \nis a bipartisan statement. I want to make sure it is a nonregional \nstatement, and covers the whole United States. We in Nevada have \nutilities extremely hindered by the result of what we did to you \nyesterday.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We would welcome associates and--I do not presume to \nspeak for my colleague, I just think I can say that we would like to be \nof help to anybody on this question.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me assure my colleague from Nevada that it would not \nbe my intent to have this deal just with New York. Indeed, all of those \nutilities that would be impaired and the ratepayers should not suffer \nregardless of what State they are in.\n  Indeed, if your utilities have used tax-exempt bonds--and I imagine \nthey have--they would find themselves in a similar position we find \nourselves in.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the answer of the Senator. Nevada Power is the \nutility that handles the power generation for 67 percent of the people \nin the State of Nevada and is affected very badly. Therefore, we stand \nby the New York delegation to assist you in whatever way we can.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may just say, with one last question, does the \nSenator agree we should speak with our distinguished friend, the \nchairman of the committee, and see if we cannot work out instructions \nto the conferees at the time they are appointed?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I agree with my colleague and friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator and ranking member of the committee. That is why I have \na great deal of confidence in the Senator's suggestion that this would \nbe a way in which we could work it out.\n  I am sorry that we had to come to the floor. Let me say, this matter \nis now one that has been outstanding for approximately a week--more \nthan a week--in which we have been attempting at the staff level to \nwork it out. Then when we find that it has not been done, it gives me \ngreat cause for concern, because unless we can get that agreement prior \nto going to conference, I think we would be foolish to move to \nconference.\n  So I hope we can get this agreement worked out. But, failing that, \nnotwithstanding there are some magnificent provisions in this bill--\njust take a look: giving to employers the educational expenses that my \ncolleague and I have worked to restore, and I am very proud of the fact \nwe worked to restore that. Our graduate students, our nurses who are \nrequired to get additional education, right now if the hospitals \nreimburse them, they have to pay income tax on their tuition. That is \nsilly. We want to encourage education.\n  The spousal IRA is a wonderful thing. We want nonworking spouses to \nbe able to contribute to an IRA.\n  Having said that, I do not believe that it is fair to the ratepayers \nof New York to be stuck with this onerous provision that does little in \nthe way of raising revenue but creates a $1.6 billion hit on our \nratepayers.\n  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for joining with \nme, and I certainly hope we can resolve this matter, because I think \nthe legislation is good, it is important, I want to see it passed, and \nI certainly hope we can work this out before this matter goes to \nconference.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the brief \nstatement that I made will not consist of a second speech on the same \nissue. I am going to talk now on the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7630-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7631-S7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I advised my colleagues, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye, that I have been very patient here, but I think it \nwould be to their interest if they went back to their offices and spent \nthe afternoon doing something more profitable. I am going to talk here \nfor as long as I am able to do so, which may take 4 or 5 hours. I may \nget tired after that.\n  But I have been over here. I told my friends I would not object to \nthe defense appropriations bill being brought up, which I will not do. \nBut I have been listening to what has gone on here this afternoon, and \nI think that we should talk about things that are important to talk \nabout.\n  I have had the good fortune, since I came to the Senate, to be able \nto serve on the Appropriations Committee with my friend from Alaska, \nthe senior Senator from Alaska, and the senior Senator from Hawaii. I \nhave only the greatest respect for them and the work that they have \ndone all the time I have served with them on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I think they have rendered great service to the country in the way \nthat they have handled the appropriations bills every year that I have \nbeen on the committee. I am sure that will be the same this year. I am \nsure when the appropriations bill comes up, that I will support that \nappropriations bill. I am not on the subcommittee, but I have watched \nwith interest and sometimes in awe at the way they have handled the \nbill.\n  But, Mr. President, there comes a time in the life of a Senator when \nyou have to talk about principle. Even though I have the deepest \nrespect for Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, I am going to have to \ntake a little time with my colleague, Senator Bryan, and talk about \nwhat is happening to the State of Nevada.\n  We have heard some lectures here this afternoon about moving to \nimportant things. We talked about something dealing with the Travelgate \nand Billy Dale. I am sure that is important, and I think we should \nspend some time debating that issue. I am willing to do that at the \nright time.\n  Mr. President, we have a matter that we have been told is going to be \nbrought up, S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, which is a \nfancy name for putting, without any regulation or control or \nsafeguards, nuclear waste in Nevada. In effect, what they will do is \npour a cement pad and start dumping nuclear waste on top of the ground. \nThat is about it. We cannot allow that to happen without putting up a \nfight.\n  I regret that the Senate has decided to take its limited and valuable \ntime\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nto consider this needless and reckless bill. That is what it is. It is \nneedless because the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, said \nhe is going to veto the bill. He said so in writing and he said so \npublicly. The last time he said it publicly was in Las Vegas, NV. But \nwe are in some political season here where chits are being exchanged or \nwhatever.\n  Give me a reason why you would bring up a nuclear waste bill that the \nPresident said he is going to veto when we have 12 appropriations bills \nto do? According to an hour-long speech I have listened to here today, \nwe have Billy Dale we are concerned about. We have not done anything \nwith health care reform, and should do that sometime, should take a \ncouple days debating that.\n  Mr. President, we have more important issues that deserve our \nattention. I wish we would spend a little time here debating organ \ntransplantation. I wish we would take a day here and tell the American \npublic how important that is. The Chair understands how important it \nis. I was in the House of Representatives, served on the Science and \nTechnology Committee. Al Gore, now the Vice President of the United \nStates, was a Member of the House from Tennessee, and he was chairman \nof the subcommittee called Investigations and Oversight.\n\n  We held a hearing that lasted several days on organ transplantation. \nI will never forget as long as I live a little girl by the name of \nJamie Fiske, a girl that came to see us. She was yellow. Her color was \nso bad because she needed a liver. As a result of the publicity from \nthat hearing, Jamie Fiske was a lucky little girl. She got a new liver. \nAs a result of that, her color changed. She became a healthy little \ngirl.\n  We have not traveled that far since those hearings 12 years ago. I \nwould like to be here debating what this body can do about organ \ntransplantation. We do not have to spend the fortunes of the United \nStates to do that. We just have to make it easier for people to do \nthat.\n  I carry in my wallet, Mr. President, in case something happens to me, \nattached to the back of my driver's license, an organ donor card, it \nreads, ``Pursuant to the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, I hereby give, \neffective on my death, any needed organs, tissues, eyes, parts for \nmedical research.'' And, Mr. President, they can have anything they \nwant.\n  I wish we would spend a little time talking about that, rather than a \nbill that is going nowhere except take up time here and embarrass the \nSenators from Nevada and take up our time and that of the President. \nThere will have to be a conference if, in fact, it passes.\n  S. 1936 is being offered as a replacement for the 1982 Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, as amended. The 1982 act says that the State that gets the \npermanent repository is not going to jump with joy, but the thought was \nwe will go through some scientific observations and experimentations \nand determine if it is safe to have a permanent repository in a State.\n  In 1986, the law was changed where previously we were going to have \nthree sites that would be chosen; the first site, second site, and \nthird site. The President would be able to observe these three sites, \nand when it came time to put nuclear waste in one of these containment \nareas, he would choose between the three. It would not be as political. \nIf one proved not to be scientifically proper, he would still have two \nothers.\n  In 1986, for a lot of reasons, most of which were political--everyone \nacknowledges that now--two sites were eliminated. Texas was eliminated \nand the State of Washington was eliminated. Nevada now is the State. \nThe law said--and was not changed in 1986--it said you cannot have the \npermanent repository and the temporary repository in the same State. It \nseems fair. But what this bill is going to do is take away what limited \nfairness we have. It is going to say you can put them both in Nevada.\n  It is a replacement. S. 1936 is a replacement that guts the existing \nlaw of its environmental and safety provisions and forces the \nGovernment to take responsibility for the waste and liabilities of the \nnuclear power industry.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to the Senator for a question, with the \nunderstanding that it would not violate the two-speech rule and when \nthe Senator's question is asked and answered I would retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. As I understand what the Senator is indicating, in the \n1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we would have an attempt to find a \nsuitable location, we would canvass America. We would look for the best \nlocation, wherever it would be, whether the formation would be granite \nin the Northeast or the salt dome formations in the South, or whether \nit would be tuff in Nevada, and that after that search was made, that \nthere would be three sites that would be studied and referred to the \nPresident of the United States, and that one of those sites would \nultimately be chosen.\n  If I understand what the Senator from Nevada is saying, that the \n1986, 1987 changes to the law in effect said no longer do we search the \ncountry for the best site. Forget those criteria. We will just study, \nin terms of a permanent repository, the State of Nevada, and that at \nthat time we had some assurance and some protection in the sense of \nequity or fairness that a State could not be studied for a permanent \nsite, as I understood the Senator to say, that No. 1, you could not \nlocate a temporary facility until after the permanent site was sited, \nand that, second, a State could not be both a permanent and a temporary \nsite. I believe that is what I understood the Senator to say. The \nSenator can perhaps enlighten me if I misstated that case.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. No one in this world who \nknows the nuclear waste issue has worked harder on the issue for the \npeople of the State of Nevada in this country than the former Governor \nof Nevada and the present junior Senator from Nevada. He is a wealth of \nwisdom and knowledge on this issue, and he understands as much, if not \nmore, than anyone else how the State of Nevada has been put upon.\n  Now, we do not like it, but we have accepted the characterization of \ngoing forward with the permanent repository. There is a tunnel, Mr. \nPresident, that is in that mountain, as large as this room and 2 miles \ndeep, right into the side of a mountain, dug with a machine like a \nlarge auger. Now, we do not like it, but they are doing it. It is being \ndone scientifically.\n  Now, I do not especially like how the DOE has conducted itself, but \nthe truth of the matter is the Department of Energy has gotten all \nkinds of mixed signals from the Congress. We cannot blame it all on \nthem.\n  As it will be developed during my remarks here this evening, Mr. \nPresident, you cannot fix important problems when you do not give \nindividuals, organizations, and institutions enough time to fix them.\n  This proposal in S. 1936 is corporate welfare at its worst. It will \nneedlessly expose people across the America--not Nevada, but across \nAmerica--to the risk of nuclear accidents, I say in the plural. It is a \nreplacement that guts existing law of its environmental and safety \nprovisions and forces the Government to take responsibility for the \nwaste and liability of the nuclear power industry.\n  Now, we are trying to get Government out of things. But not here; we \nare putting Government back in things. The existing Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act need not be changed or replaced.\n  As I have indicated, Mr. President, we do not like the permanent \nrepository going forward in Nevada, but it is going forward. But not \nfast enough for the corporate giants. They want it to happen yesterday. \nThey want it to happen without adequate safety, environmental, and \nscience checks. Let it go forward and do not short-circuit it with this \ninterim storage fiasco.\n  The present law is providing an adequate framework for the current \nprogram plan. It is being implemented by the Department of Energy to \nprovide for the long-term disposition of nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated, progress is being made on the \nscientific investigation of a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. \nThe exploratory tunnel is already, as I indicated, miles into the \nmountain.\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\n  Our Nation's nuclear powerplants are operating and have the \ncapability to manage their spent fuel for many decades. There is no \nemergency, and there will be no interim storage problem for decades.\n  The current law has health, safety, and environmental safeguards to \nprotect our citizenry from the risks involved in moving and disposing \nof a high-level nuclear waste. S. 1936 would effectively end the work \non a permanent repository and abandon the health, safety, and \nenvironmental protection the citizens of Nevada and this country \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, as we talk about this today, we are going to find it \nis not only Nevada citizens that should be concerned, but they are \ngoing to be transporting tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste \nacross this country. They are going to be transporting the most \npoisonous substance known to man. How are they going to transport it? \nOn trucks and railroad cars.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield as long as there is an agreement it would not \nviolate the two-speech rule, and that I would retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have been following this issue with some interest and \nnote the strong interest of the Senator and his colleague, Senator \nBryan, with respect to this issue. Obviously, you have a very strong \nState interest.\n  I have been attempting to understand the full dimensions of this \ncontroversy. I notice on my schedule that I have individuals from the \nutility in my region coming in to see me tomorrow or the day thereafter \nwith respect to this question. I wanted to have the opportunity to be \nable to ask a few questions in preparation for that meeting, if you do \nnot mind.\n  The issue, as I understand it, is the question of an immediate \nstorage capacity, and the question of whether or not you take the steps \nnow to have that capacity located in the State of Nevada. Is that \nbasically the question before the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is absolutely the case. I say to my friend from \nNorth Dakota, I have only been to North Dakota once in my life. That \nwas to meet with a number of people in North Dakota. Some of the people \nwith whom I met were people from the power industry. I was very \nimpressed with the State of North Dakota and how it helped supply power \nfor much more than the State of North Dakota. It was quite impressive, \nto be quite frank.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, and I hope he would convey this \nto the people that he is going to meet with tomorrow, having said that, \nI have been to North Dakota, been to Beulah. Right outside Beulah, they \nhave this large power-generating facility. We in Nevada are not happy \nthat they are putting the permanent repository there. They are \ncharacterizing it. But we have come to accept that. It is going \nforward. They are characterizing it.\n  What I say to the people from the power interests that are coming to \nsee the Senator, why do they not let that move ahead, move ahead the \nway it is scheduled, not try to rush things? That is what has messed up \nthis whole program. Everyone is trying to put science behind time \nschedules. You cannot do that.\n  As I have indicated, they have a hole as large as this room, 2 miles \ninto the side of the mountain. They moved a great way in making \nprogress, but let me ask my friend from North Dakota to explain to \nthose people that they are going to ruin everything that they have \nworked for by trying to short-circuit this.\n  The President of the United States, who has no dog in this fight, \nsaid he will veto this bill. This is unfair to do it to a State, any \nState, but particularly Nevada, because we have the permanent \nrepository.\n  Also, with the permanent repository, there are certain scientific \nguidelines that have been established. I say to my friend from North \nDakota, let me show my friend what this bill does. Radiation exposure \nunder this bill, anything you look at in millirems per year, are real \nlow. Safe drinking water is way down here at 4; low-level nuclear \nwaste, 25; also EPA and independent spent nuclear fuel storage--until \nwe get to interim storage--100 millirems per year, four times what \nanybody else is asked to bear.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can I ask the Senator if there are any scientific bases \nfor that 100-millirem provision in this equation?\n  Mr. REID. I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. President, when the Senator from Nevada is asked a question, is \nit necessary, as I already have received unanimous consent on one \noccasion, that I would not violate the two-speech rule by answering the \nquestion, and I retain the floor following the question to be answered? \nDo I need to repeat that each time that a question is asked?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). That request is not necessary \nso long as you yield only for the question.\n  Mr. REID. As long as I yield only for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I stipulate for the Record that I would like to engage \nthe Senator from Nevada in a series of questions and responses, and we \nwould stipulate that they would yield a response to questions. Is that \nappropriate, so that we do not have any question that these are \nquestions that are being posed by the Senator from North Dakota to the \nSenator from Nevada?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that we just have an understanding that these \nbe all understood to be questions posed by the Senator from North \nDakota to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  So long as they are questions, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. As I indicated before, I am going to \nhave this meeting, and I want to be certain that I understand this \nissue very well before I have that meeting. I want to thank my \ncolleague from Nevada for indulging the Senator from North Dakota so I \ncan get these questions answered.\n  Is there any scientific basis to this 100-millirem level that is \nprovided for in this legislation?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely none. There has been no evidence produced at \nhearings that this is adequate. There have been no scientific documents \nsubmitted. Everything is quite to the contrary. But I do not know \nanyone in the scientific community that would ever suggest that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So we do not have anything from the National Academy of \nSciences, for example, or anything from the National Institutes of \nHealth? We do not have anything from any of the relevant agencies or \ndepartments that would say to us that this 100-millirem standard is one \nthat meets some scientific test; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely true. During the time that the Senator was \nasking the question, I wanted to make sure that I was confident that \nthe answer was correct. So I leaned over my shoulder to my colleague \nfrom Nevada, and he nodded that I was absolutely right. I have never \nseen anything to suggest that 100 millirems is appropriate in any way.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might further inquire, do either of the Senators \nfrom Nevada--the Senator who currently has the floor--know what would \nthe cost be of this interim storage facility?\n  Mr. REID. This is interesting. Each site--and we have a little over \n100 nuclear waste generating facilities in the United States--it would \ncost about $6 million per site to store nuclear waste where it now \nexists.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be a dry cask storage?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Now, the dry cask storage container would cost--in \naddition to making that acceptable for temporary storage, but as I will \ndevelop during my remarks, you do not have the transportation problems. \nI also say to my friend that the National Academy of Sciences \nrecommends for this 10 to 30 millirems, which is right here on the \nchart.\n  Mr. CONRAD. They have made a specific recommendation with respect to \nthe potential risk, and they have asserted that a 10- to 30-millirem \nstandard is appropriate. But this legislation has a 100-millirem \nstandard; is that right?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. The \nanswer is still the same. Nobody ever suggested that 100 is \nappropriate. The National Academy of Sciences has suggested 10 to 30 \nmillirems.\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I would like to go back to the question of cost, \nif I could, because I think that is an important consideration in \nanything we do around here to anybody who appreciates, as the Senator \nfrom Nevada does, the intense budget pressure that we are under. The \nfirst question I always ask my staff on any legislation that is brought \nto me is, ``What does it cost?'' Could the Senator from Nevada tell me \nwhat the estimated cost is of this temporary storage facility?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to. The operating cost for on-site dry cask \nstorage amounts to about $1 million per year per site. It is $6 million \nto establish it and, after that, $1 million per year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So that would be the sites that would be at some 100 \nlocations where we have nuclear power facilities around the country; is \nthat correct?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes, in cooling ponds. Some of them are saying, ` `We are \ngetting to capacity, so what should we do?'' What we and the scientists \nsay is, ``If you want to leave it on-site, you can establish a site for \ndry cask storage containment for $6 million, and after you get it in \nthe cask, it will cost $1 million a year to keep an eye on it.''\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then the question is, what is the alternative? If we go \nto a temporary storage in the State of Nevada, what would the cost of \nthat approach be? Do you have an estimate of that?\n  Mr. REID. We do not have an estimate. The reason is that the cost of \ntransportation is significant. We have here another chart. This is a \nsign of nuclear--do you understand what I am saying?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If we eliminate those, we have to transport these, probably \nnow about 50-some-odd thousand metric tons of nuclear waste. This is \nhow we would transport it. The cost is very significant, because what \nthey have decided is that they would have to move most of it by rail. \nBut to get it to rail, they have to go by trucks to get it to some of \nthe rail sites. My staff just tells me that the information we have \nbeen given is that the interim site would cost $1.3 billion, plus the \ntransportation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would cost $1.3 billion for the interim site itself?\n  Mr. REID. That is right, plus transportation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The transportation would be in addition. So it would cost \n$1.3 billion, and the alternative, as you have outlined, would be $6 \nmillion per site, plus $1 million a year.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, do we have any estimate of once you have \nestablished this site--which would cost $1.3 billion initially, and \nhave on top of that the transportation cost--what the annual operating \ncost of that facility would be?\n  Mr. REID. It would be around $30 million a year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. About $30 million a year. We are talking about, \nobviously, a very substantial expenditure. Is this an expenditure by \nthe Federal Government, out of the Federal coffers, the $1.3 billion?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, because they have asked the Federal Government to take \nover the project. Up to this time, much of the expense has been borne \nby ratepayers at so much per kilowatt per electricity into this fund. \nThe fund has been used to repair the nuclear repository. I tell the \nSenator some interesting statistics. This will make the people shudder, \nand the Senator from North Dakota is one of our budget experts here, so \nhe probably will not shudder as much because he has gotten used to \nthings like this.\n  When the 1982 act passed, everyone was told that characterization \nwould cost about $200 million.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is with an ``M,'' not a ``B''?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. But now the estimate is about $7 billion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So it is loaded by a factor of 35.\n  Mr. REID. They were a little off. They are now approaching $3 billion \nfor what they have done at Yucca Mountain. I say, without placing all \nthe blame on the Department of Energy, a lot of it has been, I repeat, \ntrying to put time ahead of science. They get mixed signals to do this \nand do that. It has made it an impossible situation. But its move \nforward has been two steps forward and one step back. But they have \nmade tremendous progress in the deserts of Nevada to determine if Yucca \nMountain is scientifically proper for geological burial of nuclear \nwaste.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The question that I have is this. The Federal Government \nis going to take on this expenditure, the $1.3 billion; is that \nfinanced by the ratepayers, or does this come out of the Federal \nTreasury, the $1.3 billion?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is a debatable issue. There are some \nwho say that the ratepayers should continue and it should not be \nappropriated money of the United States. But there are others who are \nsaying we are going to sue you, the Federal Government, because you do \nnot have a place to put nuclear waste like you told us you would. So we \nare going to sue you and make the Federal taxpayers pay for it because \nthe timeline for having a repository first in Washington, Texas, and \nNevada has slipped.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So what we may have here is another lawsuit, or series of \nlawsuits, endless litigation no doubt with respect to the question of \nwho pays?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I also say to my friend from North Dakota that there \nare many who say that there is no problem the way things now stand. The \nNuclear Waste Technical Reviewing Board clearly stated:\n\n       The board sees no compelling technical or safety reason to \n     move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility for the \n     next few years.\n\n  This a statement they just made:\n\n       The methods now used to store spent fuel at reactor sites \n     are safe and will remain safe for decades to come.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me ask this question. We do not have any nuclear \nfacility in North Dakota. We have some customers in North Dakota who \nare part of the NSP. NSP has a nuclear plant in Minnesota. So some of \nour customers in North Dakota have been paying into a fund for some \nperiod of time to handle their spent fuel. But as I am hearing the \nSenator, we could have here a transfer of costs to other taxpayers in \nNorth Dakota to take on what would be a Federal facility. In other \nwords, the taxpayers of North Dakota, most of whom have not been \nbenefited by nuclear power, would be asked to pay as Federal taxpayers \nthe Federal share of this facility that would be located in Nevada.\n  So would I be correct in assuming that North Dakota taxpayers would \nbe asked to take on this burden which has been created by an industry \nthat has been benefiting folks largely not in the State of North \nDakota?\n  Mr. REID. I believe that is absolutely true. I say also to my friend \nthat, first of all, everyone acknowledges that the Federal Government \nshould pay for defense wastes. And the nuclear waste fund--the money we \nget from the ratepayers--is supposed to take care of the permanent \nrepository. But there are even some who say that is underfunded; that \nthe taxpayers will have to accept responsibility for that.\n  Finally, I respond to my friend that there is no reason for any of \nthis. I repeat for the third time here today. I do not like the \npermanent repository in Nevada. It is unpopular. Any place Senator \nBryan or Senator Reid goes in the State of Nevada, the seventh-largest \nState in America, any place we go, whether it is in Elko in northern \nNevada, in the far northeast, or Nelson, in the far south, wherever you \ngo the first thing people talk about is nuclear waste.\n  I am saying there is no need to have this problem. We do not like the \npermanent repository. But there is no need to compound the problem, not \nonly for the people of Nevada but for the whole country.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, these are not figures that I \ncame up with. These are from the Department of Transportation and the \nDepartment of Energy. These are 43 States at risk. This is where the \nnuclear waste is going to have to go.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is North Dakota on that list?\n  Mr. REID. North Dakota is not on that list.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am relieved to find that out.\n  Mr. REID. You are one of the seven. You are very fortunate. But North \nDakota is located in the perimeter of this State. As we have learned, \nNorth Dakota produces a lot of things. But one\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nthing it produces is very good students. We have heard Senator Moynihan \nlecture about that. For whatever reason, people from North Dakota do \nvery well in school.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Do especially well in math, I might add.\n  Mr. REID. I know one Senator from North Dakota who does well in math.\n  But we have 43 States, and they are at risk because of the \ntruckloads--Arizona, 6,173 truckloads of nuclear waste; 783 trainloads \nof nuclear waste.\n  We would go through the list. When you get to Missouri, it has almost \n8,000 trainloads. This is unnecessary. We do not need to fill a single \ntruck or a single train with nuclear waste.\n  Do what the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board says: Leave it where \nit is until we get the permanent repository, and then you move it once.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could just wrap up, I appreciate very much the \npatience of my colleague. Tomorrow or the day thereafter when the \npeople from the utility in my region of the country--not directly from \nNorth Dakota--come to see me, I presume that their key message will be, \n``Senator, we have a problem developing because our pools are filling \nwith this waste, and we have to move it somewhere. We have to do \nsomething with it.'' What would the Senator's answer be to those folks \nif they presented him with that question?\n  Mr. REID. I would say that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, \nwhich has no interest in this other than to do the right scientific \nthing, says: ``The board sees no compelling technical or safety reason \nto move the spent fuel to a centralized storage facility.''\n  Mr. CONRAD. Their judgment is that it ought to be left in the \nlocations where it is today, and to the extent that the ponds that are \nthe current repository are filling that they move those quantities to \ndry cask storage.\n  Is that the essence of their recommendation?\n  Mr. REID. That is the statement of the Senator. I have read verbatim \nwhat they have said. I feel very confident in stating that the board \nknows--I am talking about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--\nthat of the more than 100 operating nuclear power reactors at 75 sites \nin 34 States, 23 will require additional storage space probably before \nthe turn of the century. They are saying those 23, just leave them like \nthey are. They have seen them, studied them, do not worry about them. \nThe cooling ponds are fine. But if you have to move them to dry cask \nstorage then do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then that would be their recommendation. In those places \nwhere the ponds have reached their capacity, or about to reach their \ncapacity, those quantities be moved to dry cask storage on the spot, \nnot be transported to an interim facility, but wait for the long-term \nrepository.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could just finish by asking my colleague, what is \nthe schedule for the creation and development of a permanent \nrepository? Is that something that is anticipated to be done in 10 \nyears or 20 years?\n  Mr. REID. We expect a final decision to be made probably in the year \n2009.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be a decision made.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. But that is when they start moving. That is when they \ndeclare the site scientifically safe.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At that point would it be operational?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The dates slip a little bit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thirteen or fourteen years from now.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Nevada for this chance to get \nsome of my questions answered. I appreciate very much the efforts that \nhe and his colleagues have put into this thing.\n  I must say I have rarely seen two colleagues more determined on an \nissue than Senator Reid and Senator Bryan. I think it speaks volumes to \nour colleagues. It speaks volumes to this Senator about the seriousness \nwith which they regard this issue; the time they have taken in our \ncaucus; the time they have taken on the floor; the time they have taken \nindividually to alert colleagues as to the critical nature of this \nissue for their State.\n  If I resided in Nevada I would be very proud to have two Senators \nlike Senators Reid and Bryan representing me because one thing you \nwant, whoever you send here, when there is a time to fight for your \nState that somebody is going to stand up and fight.\n  I must say I have not reached a conclusion on this issue. I have more \nto learn. I want to hear from both sides before I reach a conclusion. \nBut if there are ever two men who are fighting for their State, I must \nsay it is Senators Reid and Bryan.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that I admire and respect the \neffort that you are making on behalf of the citizens of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the penetrating questions of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  I only respond that I have been in this body as long as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. We came at the same time. I think it is important to \nremind the people of America that the Senator from North Dakota, as far \nas this Senator is concerned, speaks volumes of what integrity is all \nabout.\n  I will remind people--and I am sure it is embarrassing to the \nSenator, but I will say it while he is on the floor--the Senator came \nto Washington at the same time I came to the Senate, and he said that \nhe felt the No. 1 responsibility was to reduce the deficit. When the \ndeficit was not reduced as much as he thought it should be, he decided \nnot to run for office, and he did not.\n  I also say that the Senator has been very complimentary to the two \nSenators from Nevada about the issue about which I address the Senate \ntoday, but I say to the people of North Dakota, I have learned a great \ndeal in the 10 years I have served in the Senate with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, because in North Dakota anything dealing with agriculture \nis a burning issue, and I have watched the Senator, since my colleague \nhas come to the Senate, devour the rest of the Senate on agricultural \nissues. So I appreciate the nice remarks, but certainly it is mutual \nadmiration.\n  Mr. President, as I have spoken, we have a lot to do in this body. As \nI indicated, my good friend from the neighbor State of Utah has spoken \nabout an issue, and he has spoken very fervently. The chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has stated that he feels we should do something \nabout the Billy Dale matter, attorney's fees and cost reimbursement.\n  I think there are some issues that we need to talk about. I would \nlike to talk about some of those issues. That is why I am talking here \ntoday. We should be talking about issues that the President has said, \n``I am not going to veto that.'' You heard the Senator from Utah; he \nsaid that the President would accept a Billy Dale bill. He has said, on \nthe matter about which I speak, S. 1936, he will veto it. He has not \nsaid it once. He said it many times.\n  You will note that Senator Dole did not bring up this matter. Why did \nhe not bring it up? I would think that he probably has a pretty good \nidea about Presidential politics. I think he knows that in Nevada, \nthere are a lot of important issues, but there is nothing that is at \nthe top of people's lists like nuclear waste. He said he is going to \nveto it. He has said it in Washington. He has said it in Nevada. And he \nwill veto it.\n  If there is anybody who believes that Clinton will not sweep the \nState of Nevada if he vetoes this, they have got another think coming. \nHe carried the State 4 years ago. Right now, the polls show Clinton \nahead a little bit in Nevada. But if he vetoes this bill, he will be a \nlong ways ahead in Nevada. That is why Senator Dole did not bring it \nup, because he knew that when November comes, this election is going to \nbe pretty close, even though Nevada is not a real populated State--we \nnow only have two congressional representatives--in the next census, we \nwill probably have three or four, but right now we only have two, \nmeaning we have four electoral votes, and that could make the \ndifference in this election. That is why Senator Dole did not bring up \nthis issue.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that our colleague from \nIndiana is present, and that he wishes to recess for a short time so \nthat he can introduce a parliamentary delegation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I not lose any privileges of the floor, \nthat I retain the floor as soon as the 10-minute recess is ended, that \nI lose no rights, privileges, or other matters\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\nthat may be at my disposal as a result of this brief 10-minute recess.\n  Is there agreement to that, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would therefore on those conditions yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Indiana for the introductions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7631-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY GROUP\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada for his cooperation. Likewise, I'd like to thank all Senators \nwho are with us, and staff.\n  It is my privilege and honor to have the opportunity to welcome on \nbehalf of the entire Senate a distinguished delegation from the \nEuropean Parliamentary Group who are here for the 44th European \nParliament and U.S. Congress Interparliamentary Meeting. This \ndelegation, which is led by Mr. Alan Donnelly, from the United Kingdom, \nand Mrs. Karla Peijs, from the Netherlands, is here to meet with \nMembers of the Congress and other American officials to discuss a wide \nrange of issues of mutual concern.\n  The European Parliament plays an increasingly important role in \nshaping the new Europe. Parliament's authority has been expanded \nrecently. It will continue to play a central role in the many \nchallenges and opportunities facing Europe as European nations build \nupon free market economics, as they deepen the roots of democracy, as \nthey define their relationships with Russia and the former Warsaw Pact \ncountries and reach out to the rest of the world to forge viable \neconomic, political, and security linkages.\n  Continued contact with and strong relations between the European \nParliament and the U.S. Congress are essential in developing better \neconomic relations with Europe and in reinforcing the many common goals \nwhich bring us together.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in welcoming individually, by \ngreeting them by hand, each of the distinguished parliamentarians who \nare here today from the European Parliament.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all of the \ndelegation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n European Parliament Delegation for Relations With the United States, \n                               July 1996\n\n\n                         Socialist Group (PSE)\n\n       Alan Donnelly (U.K.) Chairman.\n       Jean Pierre Cot (France).\n       Mrs. Ilona Graenitz (Austria).\n       Ms. Irini Lambraki (Greece).\n       Mrs. Bernie Malone (Ireland).\n       Gerhard Schmid (Germany).\n       Erhard Meier (Austria).\n\n\n           European People's Party (PPE--Christian Democrats)\n\n       Mrs. Karla Peijs (Netherlands) Vice Chairman.\n       Ms. Mary Banotti (Ireland).\n       Bryan Cassidy (U.K.).\n       Reinhard Rack (Austria).\n       Elmar Brok (Germany).\n       Giampaolo D'Andrea (Italy).\n       Paul Rubig (Austria).\n\n\n                         Union For Europe Group\n\n       Raul Miguel Rosado Fernandes (Portugal).\n       Franco E.

Mr. President, as we were discussing before the senior \nSenator from Indiana asked for a recess for the European \nParliamentarians, we have a lot to do in this body. I hope we can do a \nwelfare reform bill. It is part of the Democratic families first \nagenda. It is something my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave said that they want to pass, and I believe that.\n  I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I have \nresponsibilities with my friend from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne. I am \nthe ranking member of a subcommittee, and we passed out of this body, \nwith bipartisan support, a safe drinking water bill. That conference is \nnow ready to meet. We should get a bill back here and debate that \nconference report and pass, for the people of this country, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.\n  Health care reform: Health care is important. There is no way that we \nare going to be able to do all that needs to be done with health care, \nbut we need to do what is possible to go with health care. Can we not \ndo the portability of insurance? Can we not handle preexisting \ndisability? We need to finish that important issue.\n  The only appropriations bill that we have passed is one that is \nchaired by the junior Senator from Montana, and I am the ranking member \nof that subcommittee, military construction. It was a bill that passed \nhere on a bipartisan basis. We had very good debate on the underlying \nissues when the defense authorization bill came up. We had fully \nexhausted talking about those military construction matters when the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill came up. When it came up, it \npassed out of here without a contrary vote.\n  There are many things that we need to do here that are doable, but \nthe more time we waste on issues like nuclear waste, an issue that the \nPresident has said he is going to veto--interim storage--we are taking \naway from the important matters at hand.\n  I repeat, we were lectured today by my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, about the situation with the White House Travel Office. \nListening to my friend from Utah, I think that is an issue that needs \nto be debated at length, because there are two sides to every story. \nMaybe Billy Dale is entitled to be compensated for all of his \nattorney's fees, but that would set a kind of strange precedent in this \nbody that any time a Federal prosecution goes awry, we reimburse the \ndefendant, who is acquitted, for his attorney's fees? Think about that \none as a precedent-setting matter.\n  I have also seen a letter that was written on Billy Dale's behalf to \nthe Justice Department that he would agree to plead guilty to a felony. \nI have also seen that one of the reasons that criminal prosecution was \nconsidered is he used to take part of the money home with him every \nnight--I do not know about every night--but he would take cash home \nwith him, kept it in his home. I think that would raise some suspicions \nin some people's minds.\n  Maybe Billy Dale is entitled to be reimbursed for his expenses. Maybe \nthere are some overwhelming merits on his behalf of which I am not \naware. But it is not a slam dunk, as the Senator from Utah would lead \nus to believe.\n  So, should that not be something we talk about here? The President \nhas not said he is going to veto that. But, no, what we are being told \nis we are going to go to S. 1936, a bill that the President of the \nUnited States, Bill Clinton, has said he is going to veto. It will take \nup time of this body and take up time of the other body in conference.\n  The President said he is going to veto it. Why should he not veto it? \nIt is one of the most irresponsible pieces of legislation that I can \neven imagine. I am sure there are more, but I do not know what they \nwould be.\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\n  Remember, the 1982 act said that you could not put the permanent \nrepository and the temporary repository in the same State. What S. 1936 \ntries to do is it says we are going to set that longstanding policy \naside and site both the temporary storage and permanent storage in the \nsame State. Is it any wonder that the President said, ``This is unfair, \nand I'm going to veto it?''\n\n  Our Nation's nuclear powerplants are operating and have the \ncapability to manage the spent fuel for many decades. There is no \nemergency. There will be no interim storage problem for decades. I have \nheard every year that I have been in this body that there is an \nemergency. They have cried wolf so many times. To this Senator they \nhave cried wolf 13 or 14 times. There is just no reason that we \ncontinually hear these cries: ``Please help us, we have no alternative. \nYou've got to help us.''\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question under the preceding \nrequest that is outstanding that I not lose my right to the floor if it \nis a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Apropos to the Senator's comment that we have heard time \nand time again that there is a crisis that is unfolding, does the \nSenator recall back in the early 1980's when a program that was \nreferred to as the away-from-reactor-storage concept, which is similar \nto the interim storage that we are dealing with, that the nuclear \nutilities in America came forward and indicated that if they did not \nhave away-from-reactor-storage capability--this was in the early \neighties--that by 1983 there may be brownouts across the country, that \nnuclear utilities would be forced to close with all kinds of electrical \ndistribution crises appearing in cities across the country?\n  And if the Senator recalls that, does this not seem like a familiar \nrefrain of the old cry of wolf again and again and again because, in \npoint of fact, as I understand it--and I invite the Senator to respond \nto my question--there really is no crisis? There is no reason for us to \nbe on an issue such as the S. 1936 bill, as the Senator mentions.\n\n  Does the Senator recall that history? The Senator has been in this \nChamber longer than I have. But this is such a familiar refrain to this \nSenator.\n  Mr. REID. I remember very clearly that plea for mercy. ``We have to \ndo it or we can't survive.'' The Senator is absolutely right. They said \nthere would be parts of the United States that would have no power, \nthere would be brownouts. Of course, there have been some brownouts, \nbut those had nothing to do with nuclear power.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I believe, if the Senator would yield for a further \nquestion----\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I believe that the state of the record will bear this out, \nthat no nuclear utility in America has ever been required to close or \ncease generation of power because of the absence of storage.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. It is very clear that the \ncooling ponds are sufficient. But one of the interesting things that my \ncolleagues should understand is, since 1982, the scientific community \nhas been working on a number of scientific endeavors relating to \nnuclear waste.\n  One of the things they have worked on is, if we are going to \ntransport nuclear waste, we have to do it safely. How can we do it? You \njust cannot throw it in the back of a truck. You cannot just throw it \nin one of the boxcars. So they have worked and they have come up with \nsomething called a dry cask storage container. With a dry cask storage \ncontainer, they said, you know, I think we can transport this stuff \nsafely.\n  I will talk a little later how probably--not probably; there are \nstill some safety problems in transporting. But all the scientists say \nyou can store nuclear waste on site in a dry cask storage container and \nthat will be perfectly safe because you do not have the problems with \ntrain wrecks and truck wrecks and fires on-site.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator would yield for a further question.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It is my understanding of the state of the record that in \npoint of fact some nuclear utilities today are storing their high-level \nnuclear waste on-site in the facilities which the Senator has just \ndescribed, dry cask storage. So as I understand it, we are not talking \nabout some theoretical or technical possibility. We are talking about \ntechnology off the shelf, currently available, being used by many \nutilities and available currently today.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator's question is directly to the point. It is \nabsolutely true. It is now beyond the planning stage. Dry cask storage \ncontainers work. They work better when you leave them on-site. Then you \ndo not encounter the problems, as I indicated, with train wrecks and \ntruck wrecks and firings and those kinds of things. So the Senator is \nabsolutely right. The current law has health, safety and environmental \nsafeguards to protect our citizenry from risks involved in moving and \ndisposing of high-level nuclear waste.\n  S. 1936 would effectively end the work on a permanent repository and \nabandon the health, safety and environmental protection our citizens \ndeserve. I am not talking about just Nevada citizens; I am talking \nabout citizens of this country. It would create an unneeded and costly \ninterim storage facility. It would expose the Government and its \ncitizens to needless financial risk.\n  So, Mr. President, why are we here addressing this issue instead of \nissues that need attention, actions that will improve the condition of \nthe average American, instead of this bill, which will only improve the \nbottom line of the nuclear power industry, at best?\n  We are here because the nuclear industry wants to transfer their \nrisks, their responsibilities, and their legitimate business expenses \nto the American taxpayer. This has been their agenda for almost two \ndecades. They think that now is the time to close the deal. They want \nthe nuclear waste out of their backyard and into someone else's \nbackyard. They do not care what the risks are.\n\n  The bill is not in the best interest of the people of this country. \nIt should not become law. Because of Bill Clinton, it will not become \nlaw. The President will veto this. If we do not have the foresight, Mr. \nPresident, to kill it here and now, the President will veto it.\n  S. 1936 is not just bad, it is dangerous legislation. It tramples due \nprocess and it gives the lie to the claims of support for self-\ndetermination and local control, made with great piety by some of our \nmembership. It legislates technical guidelines for public health and \nsafety, arrogantly assuming the mantle of ``the Government knows \nbest,'' when in actual fact this branch of Government knows virtually \nnothing about these technical issues. It mandates a level of risk to \ncitizens of this country and the citizens of Nevada that is at least \nfour times the level permissible at any other radioactive waste \nfacility.\n  Mr. President, let me go over this chart again that I did with my \ncolleague from North Dakota. There is no exposure level--there is no \nexposure level--any place in the country, anyplace in the world, that \nhas laws like this.\n  The EPA safe drinking water, 4 millirems per year; NRC Low-Level \nNuclear Waste Site, 25 millirems per year; the EPA WIPP facility in New \nMexico, 15 millirems per year; the Independent Spent Nuclear Fuel \nStorage Facility, 25 millirems; the International Exposure Range, 10 to \n30.\n  What do we have in S. 1936? One hundred millirems. I mean, look at \nit. Why would we allow radiation exposure levels to individuals that \nhave anything to do with nuclear waste in Nevada 4 times, 10 times, 20 \ntimes what it is in other places, other agencies? It just simply is \nwrong.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I understand what the Senator is saying, this is \nabsolutely astounding. Is the Senator suggesting that the EPA has said, \nas a safe drinking standard for America, 4 millirems? That is per year?\n  Mr. REID. Four millirems is the correct answer.\n  Mr. BRYAN. As the Senator well knows, the WIPP is a facility in New \nMexico designed to receive transuranic nuclear waste. Is the Senator \nindicating for the good citizens of New Mexico, 15 millirems?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And that the citizens in the State of Nevada--we were \nadmitted to the Union, if I recall, before the\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\ngood State of New Mexico--but somehow for the rest of America, they \nhave a 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water, at another nuclear \nstorage area in our country they are proposing 15 millirems, but in the \nState of Nevada from a sole source, a single source, they are \nsuggesting that Nevadans would have to accept a standard of 100 \nmillirems from one source on an annual basis? Is that what they are \nsuggesting?\n  Mr. REID. My colleague is absolutely right, absolutely right. In \nNevada they are saying, ``We're going to pour this cement pad and dump \nthis out. If it leads to 100 millirems exposure, that is OK.'' That is \nwhat they are saying.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I must say, it prompts the question in this Senator's \nmind. There must be more to this than we understand. Somehow, in a \ndeliberative chamber, that there would be a suggestion made that health \nand safety standards, which presumably are legislated for the Nation, \nand with each of us entitled to equal protection under the law, and \npresumably I would think we would be entitled to equal protection in \nterms of health and safety standards, that a Congress which purports to \nbe interested and concerned with the rights and sovereignty of States, \nindividual States, would suggest that one State out of the Nation, and \none State alone, would have a standard applied to that State that is 25 \ntimes the safe standard for safe drinking water and would be more than \n6 times the standard that the citizens of our southwestern State, New \nMexico, would be subjected to for the transuranic, that somehow we have \na standard of 100 millirems.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The answer is yes. As the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, in questions to this Senator earlier in the day \nasked, is there any reason for that? No. There is no scientific basis. \nThere is no scientific theory. There are only people who want to jam \nthis down the throats of the people in Nevada saying, ``Don't worry \nabout it. It will be OK.''\n  Mr. BRYAN. I must say, the thought occurs to this Senator, and the \nquestion arises in this Senator's mind, that why would any legislative \nbody seek to impose a standard on a single State that no other Member \nof this body would be willing to accept for his or her State, when what \nwe are talking about is health and safety? We are talking about \npotential dangers from the standpoint of cancer, genetic health \nproblems, all of which, as I recall, we experience currently as a \nresult of some of the atmospheric experiences in Nevada State in the \n1950's and 1960's.\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada, the question is absolutely \npertinent. The answer is, we do not know why that standard is set. \nThere is no scientific basis. There is none whatever.\n  It goes to show how maybe the two Senators from Nevada were not such \ngreat advocates after all to get the President of the United States to \nagree to veto this. For Heaven's sake, why would we? On this basis \nalone, the President should veto this legislation. On this basis alone, \nhe should veto this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that they are \ntrying to change the substantive law in effect since 1982, that you \ncould not have a permanent site and a temporary site in the same State. \nThe President of the United States has many, many reasons to veto this \nbill. That is why he has said he will veto the bill.\n  Yet, what are we doing? We have 34 legislative days left until we \nadjourn in October. I think it is 34 or 35 days. We are here talking \nabout nuclear waste. We should be talking about health care, welfare \nreform, teenage pregnancy. We have a lot of things to do with pensions \nthat we need to do work on. We have 12 appropriations bills we could \nbetter spend our time on. We have reconciliation. We have numerous \nconferences we could be completing and here debating. But what are we \ndoing? We are going to spend days on a bill that the President has said \nhe is going to veto.\n  Now, the State of Nevada, I say to my friend, the Presiding Officer, \nunlike his State, which is a very populous State, we are a small State. \nFor many, many years we were the least populated State in the Union. We \nare used to having people say, ``Well, Nevada is not much. It is just a \nbig desert, so we will give you anything we want.'' I think they have \ncarried it too far in this instance. The President of the United States \nacknowledges it has been carried too far.\n  We have sacrificed a great deal for this country, and we have been \nwilling to do it, the citizens of the State of Nevada. We have had \nnumerous military installations in the State of Nevada. We still have a \nnumber. We have the most important airplane fighter training facility \nin the world, one for the Navy at Fallon--the best. If you want to be a \nNavy pilot and you want to be the best Navy pilot, you will train in \nFallon. If you are in the Air Force and you fly fighter planes, if you \nwant the Ph.D. of flying, you go to Nellis. Forty percent of the State \nof Nevada airspace is restricted to the military. If you want to fly to \nNevada, you avoid 40 percent of the airspace in Nevada because this is \nrestricted. We have given a lot. We have been willing to do that.\n  There have been almost 1,000 atomic devices set off in Nevada, some \nof them above ground, causing sickness and injury to people in Nevada \nand wherever the clouds went--lots of people upwind, including some in \nUtah. We sacrificed that.\n  There comes a time when the line has to be drawn. It has been drawn, \nMr. President. We are wasting our time on this bill. As long as this \nbill is going to be brought before this body--there is no one that can \nsay the President will not veto it--we are wasting our time.\n  We are going to talk about this bill at great length. That is why we \nhave the Senate of the United States. That is why two Senators from \nNevada, a sparsely populated State, have as much right, as much \nauthority in this body, as Senators from very populated States like \nMichigan, New York, Florida, Texas, and California.\n  The two Senators from Nevada, although we are a State now of about \n1.6 or 1.7 million--small by most standards--we have as much right to \ndo whatever a Senator can do as our sister State of California, which \nhas 32 million people. We are here exercising our rights that were set \nup in the Constitution of the United States. I carry one in my pocket, \na Constitution of the United States. It gives us the rights we have on \nthis floor.\n\n  We will do what we can to protect the State of Nevada. That is why we \nare here. This is not some unique thing that a couple of Senators from \nNevada dreamed up. This is something that the Founding Fathers dreamed \nup over 200 years ago. We will use the Constitution that has \nestablished the Senate of the United States to protect the rights of \nthe people of the State of Nevada, and we believe in the rights of the \npeople of this country who are being misled and misguided by this very \ndangerous law that is being proposed.\n  Mr. President, S. 1936 is not just bad, it is dangerous. It tramples \ndue process. I repeat, it makes light of the claims of support for \nself-determination made with great piety by some of our membership. It \nlegislates technical guidelines for public health and safety, \narrogantly assuming the mantle that Government knows best, when, in \nactual fact, as I have stated before, the Government knows virtually \nnothing about these technical issues.\n  I repeat, because it is worth repeating, it mandates a level of risk \nto Nevada citizens that is 25 times the level permissible at other \nradioactive standards. Radioactive exposure levels deemed safe by the \nsponsors of this bill are 25 times the level permitted by this Nation's \nSafe Drinking Water Act.\n  This bill prohibits the timely application of Federal, State and \nlocal environmental regulation activities that deal with some of the \nmost hazardous materials known to man. I do not qualify that: It deals \nwith the most hazardous substance known to man. I defy anyone to tell \nme anything that is more dangerous and more potent that plutonium.\n  Why would the sponsors abandon these protections? Could it be because \nthis material is so hazardous that regulators of public health and \nsafety might interfere with this rush to move waste out of the \nsponsors' and generators' backyards? Or could it be because there are \nserious uncertainties about how much contamination is safe, so that \nmoving it around and storing it safely is a time-consuming and \ncomplicated process? Could it be possible that the desire to make this \nwaste\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\nsomeone else's problem is so intense that the proponents of this bill \nand the generators of this poison have abandoned all pretense of caring \nfor our environment or caring for the health, safety, and prosperity of \nour fellow citizens?\n  I say, Mr. President, look at this chart: 25 times the level of safe \ndrinking water, 4 times independent spent-nuclear-fuel storage; over 6 \ntimes more than the WIPP facility setup in New Mexico.\n  By denying the protections of environmental regulation, this bill \nmakes a mockery of significant advances this Nation has made in \npromoting wise and prudent care for our increasingly fragile \nenvironment. But the sponsors do not care because it will be someone \nelse's problem or at least that is what they think.\n  If they can do this to Nevada, what is next? Take, for example, a \nState that borders on Nevada--Idaho. Idaho is a beautiful State. I have \nfloated down the Snake River. I have stayed at Sun Valley. It is a \nbeautiful State, sparsely settled. But assume that California or assume \none of the other States who have all the problems with landfills, solid \nwaste, they decide they want to bring their mountains of garbage, of \nrefuge that are accumulating in California or some other densely \nsettled Eastern State, where usable landfill space is rapidly \ndisappearing, and imagine the reaction if Idaho were made a garbage \ndump by prohibiting applicable environmental law, by denying judicial \nreview of dangerous and intrusive activities and by legislative \ndefinition of unacceptable health and safety standards. What would the \nreaction be of the people of the State of Idaho, that beautiful State \nof Idaho, which suddenly was told that they are going to be the \nrepository for mountains of garbage-- every kind of garbage? They will \njust take it and pick a spot in Idaho and start dumping it. What would \ntheir reaction be?\n\n  Idaho did not generate the garbage. Idaho did not benefit from the \nproducts that generated this garbage. Their economy did not gain a \nsingle cent from the sale of products that generated this garbage. \nIdaho is just conveniently rural and is outnumbered by those who do \ngenerate it, those who did benefit and enrich themselves through the \ngeneration of the garbage. Could Idaho stop such a blatant, inexcusable \nabuse of power in their own home State, or of its environment, or of \nits future freedom to develop, occupy, or use its land? Could Idaho at \nleast take action to ensure the health and safety of its residents and \ntheir children and their children's children in countless generations? \nWell, could they?\n  Before the introduction of this bill, I would say, sure they could. \nBut if this bill is allowed to pass, that will not be the case. After \nall, that is what this Government is all about, protecting the rights \nof each and every one of us--our health, and protecting the security of \nour homes, protecting the rights of each of us in the pursuit of \nprosperity, assuring each of us the enjoyment of the freedoms of this \ngreat land.\n  Mr. President, I am not so sure that we could not start dumping \ngarbage in Idaho. I am not so sure anymore because this bill proposes \nto deny the appeal to legal authority that has assured these rights to \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, this bill denies due process and the rights of States \nto protect its citizens. It denies due process by legislating against \nlegal injunctions against intrusive activity.\n  Mr. President, you, the occupant of the chair, are relatively new to \nthis body, but you came with the reputation of being a legal scholar, \nreally understanding the law. You are a graduate of one of the finest, \nif not the finest, law schools in America. You did very well there \nacademically. I invite you to read this bill--you, as a person who \nunderstands the law and what the law is meant to be. This law stops the \nState of Nevada from going to court. How do you like that? That is what \nit does.\n  The sponsors say: Well, you will get your day in court sometime. Mr. \nPresident, I have tried about 100 jury trials. I always prided myself--\nwhen I talked to the jury, I said, ``You know, a lot of things have \nchanged since we became a country. We no longer ride horses, we ride \ncars, which was something that people never thought about. We have \nairplanes, and we have gone to the Moon.'' I went through the process \nof how things have changed. But I said, ``You know, one thing has not \nchanged since King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215. He gave those \nbarons a right to a trial by a jury of their peers. That was carried \nacross the ocean in the common law, and we have that right now--a trial \nby jury.''\n  I was very proud to be a lawyer and representing people who had \nproblems that I thought I could help with. I also, on occasion, went to \ncourt for injunctive relief. Well, I say to those people who know a \nlittle bit about the law, read this bill. This changes the process of \nthe legal system in our country. The bill says that you can sue, but \nyou must wait a long time, and wait until there are a lot of actions \nthat take place--in fact, until there is a done deal before you can \neven apply to court. It reverses the Nation's progress toward assuring \nour offspring a safe and nurturing environment. It does it by delaying \nassessments of environmental conferences until much of the groundwork, \nif not all of it, has been done. The sponsors will say, ``But we have \nnot started construction yet.'' But the bill mandates land withdrawal, \nacquisitions of rights of way, and development of rail and roadway \nsystems prior to the development of an environmental impact statement. \nThat is an unusual theory of the law. Of course, the damage has already \nbeen done to the communities. Rights of way have been withdrawn. We \nhave had Federal land withdrawals. We have had the development of rail \nand roadway systems prior to the development of an environmental impact \nstatement.\n\n  These abuses of legislative power to relieve the nuclear power \ngenerating industry of its serious responsibility to manage and fund \nits business affairs are outrageous, Mr. President. They are \noutrageous, if not scandalous. It is more outrageous that this bill \nwould mandate radioactive exposure risks to the people in Nevada--\nremember, we have millions and millions of visitors every year. It \nwould mandate radioactive exposure risks for citizens far above that \npermissible in any other State--or foreign land, for that matter.\n  Did the sponsors single out Nevada residents for punishment? How can \nthis bill be seen as equal protection of the law when it is so \nobviously not equitable, so clearly not protective of the Nevada \nresidents? Do the sponsors think they know so much that they can decide \nwhat is OK for Nevada, but not OK for New Mexico? Why would the WIPP \nfacility have a 15 millirem standard and Nevada have a 100 millirem \nstandard?\n  If they think that they can decide what is OK for Nevada, how do they \nexplain that the permissible exposure level at the generator sites is \nonly one-fourth the level they say is OK for Nevada? The States in \nwhich this waste is generated and presently stored--remember, there is \nnone generated in Nevada--and the businesses that profit from this \ngeneration say that their residents and employees have four times the \nprotection they say is OK for Nevada.\n  I am trying to deal with this bill using the formal and really \ncourteous traditions of this great institution. But, Mr. President, I \nam really upset. I am disgusted. I think this is wrong. I say that on \nbehalf of the people of the State of Nevada. The people in Nevada are \nthe first people whose health and safety, whose freedom to prosper and \nrights to equal protection under the law are being attacked by the \nnuclear power industry and the sponsors of this legislation. But they \nmay not be the last to experience this kind of treatment by their own \nGovernment. If this bill is passed, it sets a dangerous precedent. The \nbig utilities are in control here.\n  Interim storage. S. 1936 explores new regions of outlandish \nlegislation by needlessly, and with great cost, requiring the \nestablishment of a temporary interim storage facility. This interim \nstorage facility is only a temporary facility, because it would be \ndeveloped under S. 1936 at a site that does not meet the permanent \nrepository requirements. So if Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable as a \ndisposal site, under S. 1936 an interim storage facility would have to \nbe developed somewhere else.\n  So, Mr. President, let us not play games here. In short, the reason \nfor\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\nthis legislation is to do away with the permanent repository. That is \nwhat it is all about. They want to go on the cheap. They want to avoid \nall the environmental standards that have been set by law, and they \nwant to shortcut it, because everyone knows that interim storage will \nbe permanent storage. It will not be buried geologically. It will be \ndumped on top of the ground. But if it were only a Nevada problem and \nit would somehow miraculously appear in Nevada, I can understand why \nother States would not be concerned. But the fact of the matter is, Mr. \nPresident, this is not only the concern of Nevada. It is a concern of, \nand should be the concern of, States all over this country, because the \nnuclear waste will be transported all over this country.\n  We know that we have had a few train accidents lately. In the last 10 \nyears, we have had over 26,000 train accidents. We average about 2,500 \ntrain accidents per year.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to again look at this chart that shows how \na lot of this activity is going to take place. Of course, we have a \npicture here of a train wreck which is all too familiar. We recently \nhad one near the California border with Nevada, and the very, very \nheavily traveled freeway between Las Vegas and Los Angeles was actually \nclosed because of a train wreck. The highway was about a mile from \nwhere the railroad wreck occurred, but the materials in the train were \nso caustic that they had to close the highway.\n  We have seen pictures of train accidents all too frequently. We also \nhad one in Arizona that is believed by all authorities--local, State \nand Federal--to have been an act of terrorism. People are killed in \nthese accidents, and tremendous property damage is done. We know of one \ntrain accident during this past year that burned for 4 days because of \nthe materials.\n  I have talked about train accidents. That does not take into \nconsideration the rail crossing accidents. Of course, in rail \ncrossings, we know how many people are killed. We all have in our \nmind's eye the event that took place last year where the train took off \nthe back of a school bus, killing those children.\n  Rail crossing accidents--during the past 10 years, we have had almost \n61,000 train accidents, about 6,000 a year. We have hazardous material \naccidents averaging more than two a month on trains. We have hazardous \nmaterial accidents averaging more than two a month.\n  So this is not a problem only of the State of Nevada. It is a problem \nof the people of this country, because the people of this country are \ngoing to be exposed to thousands of trainloads and truckloads--I should \nsay, tens of thousands of trainloads and truckloads of the most \npoisonous substances known to man. Arizona: 6,100 truckloads, 783 \ntrainloads. California: 44 truckloads, 1,242 trainloads.\n  The other interesting thing--we will talk about this later--is where \ntrains go. Take through the Rocky Mountains. Colorado is a State that \nis going to be heavily impacted with trucks and trains; 1,347 trucks \nloaded, 180 trains.\n  I have never ridden a train through the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. \nThat is something I would like to do. I understand it is a beautiful, \nvery picturesque ride. But if an accident happens there like happened \nin California, where it wrecked over the river and dumped all of the \nchemicals into the river, it is very difficult to get to. It is very \ndifficult to get accident crews in to take care of the trains or the \ntruck. But not only do we have a problem with location, but we also \nknow that there are no train people to take care of these accidents.\n  Interestingly, we just received an evaluation of emergency-response \ncapability along the waste routes in Nevada. It would apply to any \nplace in the United States.\n  A study was done to assist the Western Governors Association in \nplanning for the onset of the U.S. Department of Energy's transuranic \nwaste shipments to the WIPP facility in Carlsbad, NM. As a result of \nthis, it was learned that there are some significant problems with \ntransporting nuclear waste. Remember, the quantity of nuclear waste \ngoing to the WIPP facility pales in comparison to the waste that goes \nto these other waste facilities. Contractors surveyed personnel from \nfire departments, law enforcement officers, hospitals, ambulance \nservices, emergency management offices, State, Federal, and travel \nagencies.\n  In short, in this report, which is entitled ``Evaluation of Emergency \nResponse Capabilities Along Potential WIPP Waste Routes,'' prepared for \nthe Western Governors Association, you find that there is no \npreparation. There are no people that are trained to take care of these \npotential accidents.\n  The study described four potential waste routes in detail, and it \nasked questions. Is the current level of training and equipment \nadequate for safety and to identify the hazard, isolate the \nscene, notify the authorities in incidents involving the WIPP shipments \nalone or in conjunction with other hazardous materials? The answer is \n``No.''\n\n  Is there an emergency plan? Do these plans address the response to \nradiological incidents in local jurisdictions? The answer is ``No.''\n  Do respondents feel that they are able to handle radiological \nincidents? The answer is ``No.''\n  What other factors require emergency response near the jurisdiction? \nThey list numerous factors.\n  Mr. President, this brings me back to the point that we addressed \nearly on. Why are we doing this? Not only is it unnecessary to haul \nthese truckloads of nuclear waste all over the United States, haul them \npartly in trains and ship them even farther, but why are we doing that, \nespecially when we can avoid the potential for accidents by just \nleaving it on site, as we are told we should do? Why are we doing that? \nTo satisfy a few big utility companies that are afraid they will be \nembarrassed because they have spent so much money on permanent \ngeological storage. They are unwilling to let the process go forward to \nsee what science will come up with. They want to short-circuit the \nsystem. They want to trample on the rights of people in Nevada and all \nover this country, and expose the people of this country to dangers \nthat certainly are unnecessary.\n  Interim storage is not necessary. For now, let me deal simply with \nthe fact that interim storage facility sites are not needed. We talked \nabout it a little bit. We will talk about it some more.\n  In accordance with its charter, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard this year--I answered this question for the Senator from North \nDakota earlier today. The one thing I failed to add for him is that the \ndecision they made is not stagnant, not stale. The decision they made \nwas made this year, 1996. They reported to Congress that it found ``no \ncompelling safety or technical reason to accelerate the centralization \nof spent nuclear fuel. The board knows that of the more than 100 \noperating nuclear power reactors on 75 sites in 34 States, 23 will \nrequire additional storage by the year 1998.'' Twenty-three will \nrequire additional storage by 1998, and the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board knows that. It may be the year 2000, but we can say 1998.\n  The board also notes that implementation of dry cask storage at \ngenerating sites is feasible and cheap. I told the Senator from North \nDakota how inexpensive it is to set up a dry cask storage facility, and \nhow cheap it is to monitor. In fact, the dry cask storage, if it is \nproperly implemented on site, the investment will double its return by \nstoring the material in certified, multipurpose transportation \ncanisters so the material is ready for shipment once the permanent \nrepository is designated. That could be in 5 years, 25 years, 50 years, \nor 100 years.\n  Operating costs for on-site dry cask storage amounts only to $1 \nmillion per year per site; capital costs for on-site storage in \npreparation of an replacement site and cannisterization of this spent \nfuel. Storing spent fuel in multipurpose canisters means that the \nmarginal on-site capitalization costs only a few million dollars \ncompared to more than $1 billion with interim storage. Implementing on-\nsite storage at all sites claiming a need for additional storage space \nwould require less than $60 million for capitalization and less than \n$30 million per year for open operations.\n  So on-site storage could be maintained for 40 years at least before \nequalling the construction costs of interim storage at Yucca Mountain \nas estimated by the sponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. President, the marginal expense of on-site storage of spent fuel \nis very\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\ncheap when compared to the unnecessary and redundant transportation \ncosts and risks of a premature interim storage facility.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator may be aware of this. The Senator was making a \nvery telling point, when the Senator was pointing out to our colleagues \nand to the listening audience in America, that 43 States are impacted \nand the number of shipments. The Senator may not be aware of the fact \nthat as you look across this chart--here we have 50 million Americans \nwho are within a mile of either the rail or highway shipment routes, so \nfor people who are watching the floor of the Senate tonight who may \nthink it is just the two Senators from Nevada that would be impacted by \nthis, my question to the Senator is, this has a national impact, does \nit not?\n  Mr. REID. It certainly does. As the Senator has pointed out, within a \nmile of these routes are 50 million Americans.\n  Now, the Senator will recall--it happened within the past year, but I \njust mention it briefly--within a mile of the freeway between Los \nAngeles and Las Vegas a train wreck occurred. They closed that route. \nThat wreck did not involve the most dangerous substance known to man. \nIt had some cars loaded with chemicals, but it did not have nuclear \nwaste.\n  It is difficult to imagine how long that road would have been blocked \noff had there been nuclear waste involved.\n  As I pointed out to the Senator and the rest of the people within the \nsound of my voice, we do not have people trained to deal with nuclear \nwaste accidents. We do not have people trained to deal with nuclear \nwaste at all as indicated by the report that I just received today on \nthe ``Evaluation of the Emergency Response Capabilities Along Potential \nWaste Routes.''\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think the Senator's point is that in New York, with over \n7 million people; in Los Angeles with over 5.5 million; Chicago, with \n2.7 million; Houston, TX, 1.6 million; Dallas, over a million; San \nAntonio, nearly a million; Baltimore, 736,000; Jacksonville City, \n635,000; Columbus, 632,000; Milwaukee, 628,000; the Nation's Capital, \n606,000; El Paso, 515,000; Cleveland, 555,000; New Orleans, 496,000; \nNashville-Davidson, 488,000; Denver, 467,000 people; Fort Worth, TX, \n447,000; Portland, OR, 437,000; Kansas City, MO, 435,000; Tucson, \n405,000; St. Louis, 396,000; Charlotte, NC, 396,000, and Atlanta, site \nof the Olympics, 394,000; Albuquerque, 384,000; Pittsburgh, 369,000; \nSacramento, 369,000; Minneapolis, 368,000; Fresno, 354,000; Omaha, \n335,000; Toledo, 332,000; Buffalo, 328,000; Santa Ana, CA, 293,000; \nColorado Springs, 281,000; St. Paul, 272,000; Louisville, 269,000; \nAnaheim, 266,000; Birmingham, 265,000; Arlington, TX, 261,000; our own \nhome city of Las Vegas, 258,000; Rochester, 231,000; Jersey City, \n228,000; Riverside, CA, 226,000; Akron, 223,000; Baton Rouge, 219,000; \nStockton, 210,000; Richmond, 203,000; Shreveport, 198,000; Mobile, \n196,000; Des Moines, 193,000; Lakeland, FL, 188,000; Hialeah, 187,000; \nMontgomery, 186,000; Lubbock, 180,000; Glendale, CA, 180,000; Columbus \nCity, 178,000; Little Rock, 175,000; Bakersfield, 174,000; Fort Wayne, \nIN, 173,000; Newport News, VA, 170,000; Worcester, MA, 169,000, and I \ncould go on and on, but I believe the Senator's point, if I understand \nhim--and this is my question--is that this is not just a fight that \njust concerns the citizens of Nevada?\n  What the Senator is suggesting, for those who may be watching the \nfloor of the Senate tonight, is that it is not just two Nevada Senators \nwho are fighting for the health and safety of their States, but there \nare people in these communities who do not think they have a stake in \nthis fight who ought to be sharing their concerns with our colleagues \nand saying, look, we are affected, we are within a mile of these \ntransportation routes and thousands of shipments of nuclear waste may \nbe coming through our communities. I believe that is the Senator's \npoint that he is trying to make, if I understand the Senator correctly.\n\n  Mr. REID. In answer to my friend's question, I was not aware of these \nnumbers, but having had the Senator read them to me, I must say that, \nif anything, these numbers are small because we can look at Las Vegas \nas an example. If you look at Las Vegas, you will know that the greater \nLas Vegas area is about 2.1 million people and most of those people \nwould be affected because it is down in that basin. If something \nhappened, it would spread like wildfire, and I would bet the same \napplies to other cities. These are very conservative, very unrealistic \nnumbers, and it would probably involve more than 50 million people.\n  I should also say in response to my friend's question, let us look, \nfor example, at Chicago, 2,673,000 people. If I were a resident of the \nState of Illinois and particularly a resident of the city of Chicago, I \nwould not want--they produce a lot of nuclear power in Illinois--I \npersonally would not want this nuclear waste taken from where it is in \nIllinois.\n  I think it would be much safer, if I were a Chicago resident--I am \ngoing there at the convention this summer--it would be much safer for \nthe people of Chicago if they put these materials in dry cask storage \ncontainers or leave them in the cooling ponds because, if they do not, \nthey are going to have thousands and thousands of trainloads of nuclear \nwaste being shipped right through that main railhead, which is \nChicago--not only the Chicago nuclear waste, not only the Illinois \nnuclear waste, but nuclear waste from all over the eastern and southern \nparts of the United States. That is a main railhead just like Omaha, \nNE, is.\n  So I appreciate very much the question of my colleague from Nevada. \nIt is very enlightening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have printed in the Record these \ncities with these very conservative, modest numbers. We, of course, for \nthe Record will reduce this to letter size.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Major population centers affected by proposed nuclear transportation \n                                 routes\n\n\n        City and State                                       Population\nNew York,

A further question of the Senator, if the Senator will \nyield.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think the Senator's point was that the population \nnumbers that I read of part of those cities represents the corporate \ncity limits, and I believe the Senator's point, if I understood him \ncorrectly, is that each of these communities are part of a metropolitan \narea. As the Senator pointed out, in our hometown of Las Vegas, there \nare roughly a million people in the metropolitan area who would be \ndirectly and adversely impacted by a rail or highway accident. Yet, Las \nVegas is listed for purposes of population as 258,000. I believe, if I \nunderstood the Senator's point, in addition to the population indicated \nhere, there are suburban communities that would be populated as well, \nperhaps even greater.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator's question is appropriate, pertinent, and in \nfact very enlightening. The city of Las Vegas is part of a metropolitan \narea, and it is just like most areas in the United States. You have a \ncity surrounded by suburbs, and that is, in effect, what we have in Las \nVegas. Of course, the numbers that were brought forth by my colleague \nfrom Nevada are staggering even if you do not take into consideration \nthe fact that these are only the incorporated areas.\n  If you elaborate on that and indicate that the population of nearly \nevery place we talked about is much greater than almost every place we \ntalked about on the chart, it involves more than 50 million people. The \nexample we talked about, with Chicago, is certainly in point. Chicago \nwould not only be responsible for, in effect, gathering up its nuclear \nwaste and transporting it, but they would be responsible also, being \nthe major railhead that it is, for other people's nuclear waste. The \npeople of Illinois should tell the nuclear power industry, ``Don't do \nus any favors. Leave it here. You will not only save the ratepayers and \ntaxpayers huge amounts of money, but it will be safer to leave it where \nit is either in the cooling ponds or in the dry cask storage \ncontainers.''\n  There is simply no need, certainly no compelling need, to rush to a \ncentralized interim storage before a permanent repository site has been \ndesignated.\n  I say again, the statement I just made is not a statement developed \nby the Governor of the State of Nevada or the Nevada State Legislature \nor the Chamber of Commerce of Las Vegas. In accordance with its \ncharter, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board just this year \nreported to the Congress that it ``found no compelling safety or \ntechnical reason to accelerate the centralization of spent nuclear \nfuel.'' In effect what they are saying is give the process an \nopportunity to work.\n  I said before and I will say again, the President has stated he will \nveto this bill since it would designate interim storage at a specific \nsite before the viability of a permanent repository has been \ndetermined. Both the Department of Energy and the Environmental \nProtection Agency have taken strong positions in opposition to this \nbill.\n  Here we are at 6 o'clock at night. It is Wednesday. At my home in the \nsuburbs here it is garbage night, which I will miss--taking the garbage \nout. We should be debating welfare reform or the 12 appropriations \nbills. We should be talking about matters that need to be addressed. We \nshould not be wasting time on a bill the President has said he is going \nto veto. The Secretary of the Department of Energy said she does not \nlike it. The director of the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDirector of that has stated she is opposed to it.\n  As the administration points out, personally through the President of \nthe United States and through its agency heads and Cabinet-level \nofficers, they have a plan which is making significant progress and \nprovides appropriate protection to the environment of our citizens. The \nPresident of the United States, the first time I ever met the man--\nSenator Bryan who was Governor then, was with him and knew him, I did \nnot know the man--he was running for President 4 years or so ago. I met \nhim at National Airport. Four years ago one of the issues we talked \nabout--we only talked about two or three issues. We had a 40-minute \nmeeting with him. He was very busy, but he gave us 40 minutes--was \nnuclear waste. As we told him at the time it is a very important issue \nfor the State of Nevada. We told him then the scientific community had \nalmost perfected a dry cask storage container, and that we wanted him \nto take a look at that, as far as storage goes. He told us at the time: \nWe have nuclear waste in the State of Arkansas. I understand what you \nare trying to do. I think it is a good idea. And he has never wavered \nfrom that. This is an issue he understands. This is not something he \nsuddenly decided that he wanted to do because Nevada was important in a \nPresidential election. The President of the United States has been with \nus from the first time I met him. He has been with us this whole time.\n  The President of the United States has not said I am opposed to \npermanent storage in Nevada. He has not said that. But what he has \nsaid, unequivocally, without hesitation, to anyone who will listen, is \nit is unfair what you are trying to do to Nevada with bills like S. \n1936. Do not do it. Because if you do, I will veto it. And he should. \nBut we are wasting our time here at 6 o'clock at night when we should \nbe doing important amendments on the defense appropriations bill. I am \na member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  My colleagues have to understand that we are protecting our rights, \nthe rights of the people of the State of Nevada and the rights of the \npeople of this country. It is wrong what is being done. It is being \ndriven by big business, and it is wrong. If there were ever a time that \nthe rules of the U.S. Senate become important, to me it is when you are \ntrying to protect the interests of the people of the State of Nevada. I \nam doing no more than what the Presiding Officer of this body would do. \nI am doing no more than what any Senator from these United States would \ndo.\n  It would be as if there was legislation offered in the State of \nMaryland to do away with Chesapeake Bay. It would be like telling the \nStates that surround the Great Lakes: We are going to take one of the \nlakes away from you. Would you fight? Sure you would fight. You would \nuse all the rules at your disposal, and we are going to do that.\n  I expect the two Senators from Idaho, if they were suddenly told that \nwe were going to start hauling thousands of tons of garbage into their \nState--I would think they should have some rights, minimal rights, the \nrights equal to other States in this Nation, that we should not allow \ngarbage to be dumped in Idaho. That is what we are doing here to \nNevada.\n  We are saying: In Nevada, you are not only going to get permanent \nrepository, you are going to get a temporary repository and the \ntemporary repository is worse than the permanent because we are setting \nthe safety standards so low, and the exposure levels so high.\n  The President stated he will veto the bill. He is doing the right \nthing. Technical review boards, commissioned by the Government, have \nconsistently found there is no immediate or anticipated risk with \ncontinuing dry cask\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\nstorage for several decades. What I am saying is there is no reason for \nthis legislation. The administration acknowledges that. The technical \nreview bodies have also found the environmental and safety standards \nshould be retained or strengthened, rather than weakened as this bill \ncalls for.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator just made the point there is really no need \nfor this legislation. I call to the attention of the Senator, and I ask \nhim if he recalls that in the Congressional Record on July 28, 1980, in \nthe context of a debate on the away-from-reactor proposal, a statement \nwas made on the floor by one of our colleagues that this bill--\nreferring to this away-from-reactor storage, which is a progenitor, if \nyou will, of this temporary storage facility that we are dealing with \nin our discussion this evening--it was said, the date again, July 28, \n1980:\n\n       This bill deals comprehensively with the problem of \n     civilian nuclear waste. It is an urgent problem, Mr. \n     President, for this Nation. It is urgent first because we are \n     running out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of \n     the fuel and if we do not build what we call away-from-\n     reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin shutting \n     down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as soon as \n     1983.\n\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend to repeat the date of that \nCongressional Record?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Responding to my colleague, this is kind of a deja vu. \nThis is in the Congressional Record, on July 28, 1980. That is almost \n16 years ago, in which, on the floor of the Senate it was asserted \nthat, if this particular legislation, this away-from-reactor storage \nwas not obtained, that by 1983--that is 13 years ago--that civilian \nnuclear reactors in this country would shut down.\n  I do not know if my colleague from Nevada is aware of this but, upon \nmy propounding the question to him--was he aware that among those \nutilities that were claiming they would be shut down was Alabama Power \nCo., the J. Farly Reactor, Arkansas Power & Light Co., Arkansas Nuclear \n1 and 2, Boston Edison Co., Pilgrim 1, Carolina Power & Light Co., \nBrunswick 1, Brunswick 2, Robinson 2, Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co., \nZimmer No. 1, Commonwealth Edison Co., La Salle 1 and 2, Consumers' \nDairy Co., Palisades, Duke Power Co., Maguire No. 1, Maguire No. 2, \nOkonee No. 1, Okonee 2 and 3; Florida Power & Light, St. Lucy 1, St. \nLucy 2, Turkey Point 3, Turkey Point 4, General Public Utilities, \nOyster Creek, Northeast Nuclear Energy Co., Millstone 1, Millstone 2, \nNorthern States Power Co., Monticello, Omaha Power District, Fort \nCalhoun, Power Authority of the State of New York, J.A. Fitzpatric, \nIndian Point No. 3, Philadelphia Electric Co., Peach Bottom 2 and 3, \nRochester Gas and Electric, R.E. Genna facility, Virginia Electric & \nPower Co., North Anna No. 1, North Anna No. 2, Surrey 1, Surrey 2, and \nthe Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Co., Vermont Yankee.\n  I ask unanimous consent the material from the Congressional Record of \n1980 be printed in today's Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Excerpt From the Congressional Record, July 28, 1980\n\n       Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n       Mr. President, this bill deals comprehensively with the \n     problem of civilian nuclear waste. It is an urgent problem. \n     Mr. President, for this Nation. It is urgent, first, because \n     we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the \n     storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call \n     away-from-reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin \n     shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as \n     soon as 1983, those predictions coming from the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy.\n       It is essential that we set a predictable policy for \n     utilities to operate on so that they know if they begin \n     either to run a reactor, or if they are making a decision now \n     as to whether to build one, that they have some policy to \n     which they can refer that is predictable and certain for the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. My question is that we were told in 1980 that if that \naway-from-reactor legislation that was on the floor being debated on \nJuly 28 was not enacted, that these utilities would have to close by \n1983.\n  My question to the Senator is, Is he aware of any of these facilities \never closing as a result of the lack of storage, as was suggested to \nus, in the crisis-ridden prediction?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in response to the question, I had \nforgotten about this. I appreciate very much the Senator bringing it to \nmy attention.\n  The Senator knows during the past 10 years, we have heard in this \nbody, and other places, dire pleas for emergency help; that you have to \ndo something tomorrow. These are the perennial crying-wolf stories.\n  That is why the technical review boards have said, ``Cool it.'' I \nguess they are saying leave it in the coolers, leave it in the cooling \nponds. There is no reason to rush into this. The technical review \nboards commissioned by the Government consistently found there is no \nimmediate reason for continuing with these continual cries for help. \nThey are saying, slow down. There is no need or excuse for this bill. \nIt threatens the health and safety of all Americans and is a reckless \nand unnecessary expense.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of this bill say one thing, and what I \nsay to them is, if you really think there is a need for interim storage \nin the near term, then let's put this bill in committee and have a good \nhearing and try to make a determination why we are doing this. There is \nno reason for it. It is not fair, and certainly if you are going to do \nthis on a fair basis to find the best site, we should remove from this \nlegislation the site specificity. We must restore the environmental and \nsafety provisions of the current law. We must observe the same rights \nof Nevada residents to health and prosperity as the citizens of any \nother State, and we must be assured that a search for a permanent \nsolution is not sidetracked by short-term business or political agenda.\n  We have talked several times today about the transportation risks, \nand they are significant. One of the greatest risks of this bill is \nthat it will force vast amounts of dangerous nuclear waste to be \ntransported cross country. But it is unnecessary, and it is certainly \npremature. If this is to be done, should we not wait until the \npermanent repository is completed?\n  In the past, we have had roughly 100 shipments per year of nuclear \nwaste, and most of these shipments were relatively short hauls in the \nEast between nuclear power plants and reprocessing facilities. This \nbill will increase the shipment rate into thousands and thousands of \nshipments per year and send them on cross-country journeys through \nroutes in our most populated cities in America. The pressure to start \nshipments as soon as possible and to move as much as possible can only \nincrease the risk of an accident. Safety last rather than safety first \nis the hallmark of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have here a map that shows the routes the nuclear \nwaste will travel. I ask those who are looking at this map, are any of \nthese routes in your backyard? Are any of these routes in cities where \nyour family lives or your kid is going to college? If it is, you should \nbe concerned.\n  Most of the waste, of course, is produced in the Eastern part of the \nUnited States. Is it not interesting that we are going to ship the \nwaste 3,000 miles, in some instances, for no reason? If you live in the \nheartland of America, ask, why should all the Eastern nuclear waste be \nshipped through your State, perhaps your town, when we do not yet know \nwhere the final repository will be?\n  If you live in Wyoming, Utah, or Colorado, you should note that you \nare on the main line for these shipments. S. 1936 mandates shipment of \nnuclear waste crosscountry by 1999, regardless of technical problems or \nrisks involved.\n  There is no need for these shipments at this time. There may never be \na need for these shipments. If and when they are needed, we should take \nour time to do it right and not force this issue as it is being done \ntoday.\n\n  The industry and the sponsors of this bill would like you to believe \nthat this transportation is risk free. Well, it is not. There have been \ntruck and train accidents involving nuclear waste, and there will \ncontinue to be accidents involving nuclear waste and other hazardous \nsubstances.\n  I am reminded of a friend of mine who I went to high school with. He \nwas a police officer in a town in east-central Nevada, a town called \nEly, \n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nE-l-y. Kennecott had a big mine there at one time. He was, as I \nindicated, a police officer, and he told me:\n\n       Harry, one of the things that I do that gives me as much \n     concern as anything else is we get notices every day of \n     hazardous substances that are being driven through our town.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It would be better if they didn't even tell us about it, \n     because if something happened with one of those vehicles with \n     the hazardous substance in it, there is nothing we can do \n     about it anyway. We have no equipment. None of our personnel, \n     police or fire, are trained to handle these hazardous \n     substances. Our equipment is certainly inadequate.\n\n  Multiply this thousands and thousands of times all over America. We \nare going to ship nuclear waste on trucks and trains. There will be \naccidents. There have been accidents. We have already had seven nuclear \nwaste accidents. They have not been significantly harmful, but there \nhave been accidents.\n  The industry and the sponsors of this bill, as I have indicated, \nwould have you believe, would like you to believe that this \ntransportation is risk free. Well, it is not. There have been truck and \ntrain accidents involving nuclear waste, and there will continue to be \naccidents involving nuclear waste. There will be many more accidents \nbecause there will be many more shipments.\n  The industry and the sponsors of this bill will tell you that the \nprobability of an accident resulting in a large radioactive release is \nvery small; that, in fact, we have never had a significant release. \nWell, probabilities have inevitable results, that if you push them long \nand hard enough, the adverse outcome will occur.\n  The day before Chernobyl, the probability of such an accident was \nvery, very low. But the day after the accident, the consequences were \nenormous, and the probabilities of other such accidents increased \nsignificantly.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of us who have been concerned about \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. In working on these \nissues, I came to realize that there have been numerous accidents \ninvolving nuclear weapons. We have been so fortunate. We have been so \nlucky that there has not been death and destruction as a result of \nthose accidents. In North Dakota, a B-52 caught fire loaded with \nnuclear weapons. The wind usually blew in one direction, but during the \ncourse of this fire on the airplane, it blew in the other direction \nand, as a result of that, there was no danger as a result of nuclear \nweaponry.\n  We know that there has been an accident in Canada of an airplane with \nnuclear weapons on it. Again, it was found and everything worked out \nfine. But these accidents will happen. The day before Chernobyl, the \nprobability of such an accident was very low. But the accident \nhappened. And the consequences were enormous. The same potential exists \nhere.\n  Mr. President, again, I would like to draw your attention to the \nchart that shows the number of trucks and trains that will be used to \ntransport this very high-level nuclear waste. I, of course, highlighted \nthe States with the biggest risks. It is in bold print: Illinois, \nNebraska, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. There are others that are close to \nthat. But I just highlighted those.\n  It is significant, because we are talking about over 12,000 shipments \nthrough Illinois alone; over 11,000 shipments through Nebraska and \nWyoming; over 14,000 through Utah; over 15,000 for Nevada. These are \nsome of the States.\n  As I have indicated, we have already had seven nuclear waste \ntransportation accidents. The average has been 1 accident for every 300 \nshipments of nuclear waste. Well, we do not know for sure how many new \ntrains and trucks will be required because of S. 1936. But we know it \nwill be magnified significantly. So we can expect at least 150 or 200 \naccidents if this S. 1936 is implemented.\n  Where will the accidents take place? Omaha? Chicago? New York? \nAtlanta? I do not know. No one knows, just like no one knew that this \ninferno would occur at Chernobyl. We should not be ready to take that \nrisk, because it is unnecessary. Why would we want to take the risk? To \nhelp the nuclear industry reduce its costs and risk exposure? It is a \ntautology that accidents are unpredictable; but that an accident will \nhappen is certain.\n  Based on studies done for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at least \none serious radioactive accident with leakage and contamination will \nhappen sometime, somewhere along the transportation route. That is a \nvery modest estimate. We cannot know where it will happen before it \nhappens. We cannot know when it will happen before it happens.\n  So, Mr. President, today we could not respond effectively or rapidly \nto accident sites because we have not taken the time, the trouble or \ngone to the expense to equip and train emergency responders along the \nroutes that the waste will take. We have not made the investments \nnecessary to assure capable response to remote, inaccessible areas \nwhere the accidents could happen.\n  Mr. President, we simply could not respond. But how long would it \ntake to get trained and equipped emergency crews to a railway accident \nsite somewhere in the mountains, like the Rocky Mountains I talked \nabout earlier, like the Sierra Nevada Mountains between California and \nNevada? What about the Wasatch Range in Utah? What about the mountains \nof Arizona? It makes a big difference how well and how rapidly we can \nrespond. Let me give some illustrations.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that transportation \ncontainers survive a 30-minute exposure to a fire environment of 1,475 \ndegrees Fahrenheit temperature. Sounds very strong and protective--30-\nminute exposure to a fire environment of 1,475 degrees.\n  Yet diesel fuel fire temperatures can exceed 3,200 degrees and their \naverage temperatures are about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. So a diesel \nfuel fire--and most trucks use diesel fuel, most trains use diesel \nfuel--the average temperature of a diesel fuel fire is 1,800 degrees, \n325 degrees higher than what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires \nthese containers to survive. And these are exposed for only 30 minutes.\n\n  I indicated earlier today we all read in the newspaper about a fire \nthat occurred on a train this year that lasted 4 days, not 30 minutes, \nbut 4 days. One recent train wreck, as I have indicated, burned with \nits hazardous chemical cargo for 4 days. The firefighters could not \neven get access to the wreck for 4 days. It was so hot, so caustic that \nthey could not get close to it for 4 days.\n  Transportation canisters are meant to contain the waste material in \nfires or collisions. The nuclear regulatory certification requirements \nfor thermal survivability are no guarantee against fire-disbursed \nradioactive debris. The collision survival criteria appear just as \ninadequate.\n  We have talked about the fire exposure. We know that for a diesel \nfire--these are all diesel trucks here--the average temperature of a \nfire in a diesel vehicle is 325 degrees higher than what the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission has set.\n  That is for fire. What about collisions? The collision survival \ncriteria appear just as inadequate. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nrequires that a canister survive a 30-mile-per-hour collision. I was \ndriving this weekend in Las Vegas, from Boulder City to Las Vegas, on \nan expressway. I was going 75 miles an hour, and I was passed by two \nheavily loaded trucks, big semis. I was going 75. They were going 80. I \nsay to my friend from Nevada--he knows the area--as you are coming down \nHenderson, going toward the Henderson plants, that downhill grade \nthere, trucks were going 80 miles an hour. They passed me. I remember \nit because it was frightening.\n  The NRC has set these canisters to survive a collision at 30 miles \nper hour. I do not know of many trucks that go 30 miles an hour. The \ncollisions are going to take place at much higher speeds than that most \nof the time.\n  The NRC also requires that the 30-mile-per-hour collision be with a \nrigid flat surface. Most collisions are not going to be with a rigid \nflat surface. It is going to be with a pile of rocks alongside the \nroad, going to be hitting another truck, another car. So that is why it \nis beyond the ability to comprehend why you would want to move these \npoisonous, spent fuel rods from where they are now located so that they \nare exposed potentially to fire or potentially to collisions.\n  My question I ask to the world is, Would it not be much safer to \nleave them on-site in these dry cask storage containers than to take \nthe uncertain\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nroute in a train or truck, knowing that there is going to be an \naccident, only wondering when and where it will occur? Well, I ask the \nworld, but the world must respond that the only logical thing to do is \nto leave it where it is--leave it where it is. By leaving it where it \nis, you avoid totally the danger of an accident. You also avoid not \nonly the fire but the collision. I say ``also,'' Mr. President.\n\n  One of the things I have not talked about that we should be doing \nhere, we should be clearing judges. We have 23 judges that should be \ncleared. We have not cleared a single one of them. The last year that \nwe were in power, the Democrats were in power, we cleared 60-some-odd \njudges. We have not cleared a single judge this year. There are 23 that \nneed to be cleared.\n  While we are talking about the court, I see the Presiding Officer \nhere, one of the things we need to get done is to get a study of the \ncircuits so we can make determinations on how we should realign the \ncircuits. Anyone that has practiced law in the Federal court system \nknows we probably need to do some realigning of the Federal appeals \ncourt. We should get that done. I hope we can get it done right away so \nthat the questions that have been raised by the Senator from Montana, \nthe junior Senator from Montana and others, about some of the appellate \ncourts, we can get those resolved. That is one thing we can do.\n  There is no good reason that we cannot leave the nuclear waste where \nit is to avoid collisions, to avoid fires.\n  Certainly, what we should be doing is talking about welfare reform. I \nsee walking off the floor the junior Senator from Louisiana who has \nspent weeks of his time, weeks of his time working on welfare reform. \nAs a result of the work that he and Senator Mikulski did, we came up \nwith a proposal here that we passed by over 80 votes. It went to \nconference, fell apart, was vetoed. I hope we would use his good work \nin building another welfare reform bill.\n  Many Senators are concerned about judges, whether there should be \napproval of judges. I hope we can do that, rather than wasting our time \non a bill the President has said he will veto.\n  I repeat, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said if there is a \nfire, one of these canisters must withstand temperatures of 1475 \ndegrees; diesel, when it burns, is 1800 degrees. We know, also, that \ncollisions are survivable under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nstandards only at 30 miles an hour. That is inadequate. We do not need \nto expose these canisters to collisions or to fire. All we need to do \nis put dry cask storage containers on site, and as a result of doing \nthat, we could avoid all the concerns that the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has.\n  As we know, most accidents will exceed the criteria set by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission on highway and rail accidents. The NRC \ncertification requirement for spent-fuel transportation containers are \nnot insurance against the consequences of a remote inaccessible \naccident, but the consequence of an accident will not observe the \nboundaries of the accident. Just because the accident might be remote \nis no basis for comfort. Radioactive waste will burn and disperse many \ntens of miles that will contaminate far distant territory.\n  So, along the transportation routes, within a mile, include at least \n50 million residents being at risk. Are we going to warn this at-risk \npopulation to stay tuned to some emergency frequency just in case \nsomething unexpected happens? If we do that, what are we going to tell \nthem to do if an accident does happen?\n  Mr. President, as my colleague pointed out, and the chart has been \nprinted in the Record, at least 50 million people are within a mile of \nthe routes that we have pointed out time and time again today, the \ntrain travels and the truck travels. Are we going to warn this at-risk \npopulation to stay tuned to some emergency frequency just in case \nsomething unexpected happens? If we do that, what are we going to tell \nthem to do if an accident does happen? Who will help? We do not have \npeople trained. When will they get help? We do not know. Who will be \nliable?\n  The term Mobile Chernobyl has been coined for this legislation. That \nis what it is. ``Mobile Chernobyl'' has been coined for S. 1936. A \ntrainload of waste may not contain the potential for disaster that \nChernobyl supplied, but the result will be little different for those \naffected by this inevitable accident.\n  Mr. President, I submit that we are not prepared to implement the \ntransportation of this hazardous material--not today and not tomorrow. \nThe risk is real, and we are responsible for assuring readiness and \npreparation to reduce it to minimal levels for both probability and \nconsequence. It does not make sense to double that risk by premature \nand unnecessary transportation to an interim storage site that has not \nbeen determined to be the final disposition site.\n  Mr. President, one thing we need to talk about is terrorism, \nvandalism, and protests generally. There are unforeseeable accidents, \nbut accidents are only one kind of a problem that we may be dealing \nwith. Much has been spoken of America's vulnerability to both domestic \nand foreign terrorist attacks.\n  It saddens me, Mr. President, to agree that some of America's enemies \ntoday are not people from outside its borders but American citizens. \nMisguided they may be, enemies they certainly are. We know from this \npast weekend in Arizona, a sister State to Nevada, a large group of \nterrorists were arrested. They were luckily infiltrated by some \npatriotic person. There were films of explosions that they set, \nconversations of how they would kill anyone that turned against them. \nThey are out there.\n  There are vipers all over, Mr. President. There are also known \nforeign enemies of America, and the values that America stands for they \ndo not like. There are known foreign enemies of America in our open \nsociety, which is our national heritage and the essence of America. We \ncannot deny our enemies many of the same freedoms we enjoy ourselves.\n  There are, as well, many foreign interests, some clandestine, that \nwill want to promote and publicize their existence and goals through \noutrageous acts of blatant terrorism and destruction. We know that they \noccur not only in Saudi Arabia but in Oklahoma City, New York City, and \neven in the city of Reno, NV, where we had, recently, an act of \nterrorism that failed. They tried to blow up the Internal Revenue \nbuilding. The bomb was a dud.\n  Terrorists have had, on a smaller scale, success in Nevada, blowing \nthe roof off of a BLM building. They twice attacked a forest ranger, \nonce blowing up the office, another time blowing up a device in his \ndriveway at his home.\n  There are evil people in America, Mr. President. I do not say that \nwith pride, but it is a fact. What better stage could be set for these \nenemies than a trainload or a truckload of the most hazardous substance \nknown to man, clearly and predictably moving through our free and open \nsociety.\n  We face a fraction of this kind of risk every day in our cities, at \nour airports, and around our centers of local, State and Federal \ngovernments. But the opportunity to inflict widespread contamination, \nterror, and horror, to engender real health risks to millions of \nAmericans, to encumber our treasury with hundreds of millions of \ndollars in cleanup costs, to further reduce the confidence of all \nAmericans in our treasured freedoms will be irresistible to our \nenemies.\n  Why would we want to transport nuclear waste when we do not have to? \nI go back to what has been stated time and time again, Mr. President, \nby the people that we have assigned to determine what should be done \nwith nuclear waste--that is, the technical review board, which has said \nconsistently that there is no immediate or anticipated risk in \ncontinuing using either cooling ponds or dry cask storage containers \non-site. So there is no need to do that.\n  Mr. President, we have had a number of problems in America in the \nlast few years that we are not proud of in dealing with terrorists. We \nlook for ways to avoid terrorist activity. Some of it is somewhat \npainful, like closing off Pennsylvania Avenue and closing off the ways \ninto the Capitol Building. I consented to that, even though I did not \nhave a lot of control over it.\n  When I was chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Ford, and others who serve on the Rules Committee, \nindicated that was the right thing to do. So\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nI went out of my way to make sure that the Capitol Police had enough \nmoney to do the things that it would require because of these terrorist \nactivities in our Nation's Capital. Why do we not avoid those \nactivities even more? We can do that, Mr. President. We can do it by \nsimply not hauling nuclear waste. Just do what the technical review \nboard said we should do and leave it on-site. We avoid all these \nproblems.\n  We must prepare for such realities as terrorism, vandalism, and \nprotests. We must prepare for such realities that accompany the massive \ntransportation campaign that will be required to consolidate nuclear \nwaste at a repository site. They do not want to be bothered by reality. \nThey ask that we not confuse them with facts. The old saying is that \n``haste makes waste.''\n  That takes on a whole new dimension in the context of S. 1936, \nbecause the waste that we are talking about is the most poisonous \nsubstance known to man. Mr. President, we also, of course, must be \nconcerned about vandalism, such as graffiti sprayed on walls, and \nwindows knocked out of buildings, and buildings that are completely \ndestroyed for no good reason. ``Vandalism'' is a word that came as a \nresult of the invasion of the Vandals. They came and destroyed for no \ngood reason. They destroyed just to be destroying.\n  Protests. In Nevada, it has become very standard that we have people \nwho come there to protest. They come there to protest at the Nevada \nTest Site. Some of them protest because they think there are aliens out \nthere, secret storage facilities for aliens from outer space. We have \npeople that come there and protest because they believe at the test \nsite they are doing things dealing with atomic devices, which they \nshould not be doing. They lay down in the streets. They stop people \nfrom coming to and going from work. They are going to do the same with \ntransporting nuclear waste. There is no reason that we should give \nthese people the opportunity to cause mischief. I am not saying that \nthe people who believe that there are alien test sites are mischievous. \nI am sure they believe they are there. I am sure they are people of \ngood will, who picket the test site and do those kinds of things.\n  But I say, why should we allow terrorism activity to take place? Why \nshould we allow the opportunity for vandals at these nuclear storage \nfacilities transportation when it is unnecessary? Why would we want to \ndo that? Why do we need the protests? Why do we not simply leave the \nspent fuel on-site, where the technical review board said it should be \nleft until we get a permanent repository or determine there cannot be \none, which is not very likely.\n  We have talked about the exposure risks a little bit. But S. 1936 \nwill certainly gut our environmental laws and expose Americans to \nunreasonable risks. S. 1936 removes the Environmental Protection \nAgency's authority to set environmental standards. This runs directly \ncounter to the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences' \nrecommendations, which were asked for by Congress. S. 1936 mandates a \nradiation exposure safety limit that is inconsistent.\n  Mr. President, I will yield to the two leaders, who are on the floor. \nI ask that until some agreement is reached, I not lose my opportunity \nto maintain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7636-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Shouldn't more attention be paid \nto this perilous situation in light of the June 25 bombing which killed \n19 American servicemen in Saudi Arabia?

Mr. President, on March 28, 1996, the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 39, the Sustainable \nFisheries Act. A report on the bill was filed on May 23, 1996. At that \ntime, the committee was unable to provide a cost estimate for the bill \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. On July 8, 1996, the accompanying \nletter was received from the Congressional Budget Office, and I now \nmake it available to the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter from CBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 1996.\n     Hon.

Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to \n     the bill. S. 39 contains several new private-sector mandates \n     (see the enclosed mandates statement), but it does not \n     contain any intergovernmental mandates as defined in Public \n     Law 104-4.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L.

Bill title: The Sustainable Fisheries Act.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation on May 23, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 39 would amend the Magnuson Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (the Magnuson Act), which \n     governs federal regulation of commercial and recreational \n     fishing within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the \n     United States. The bill also would amend other marine fishery \n     and maritime laws including the Anadromous Fisheries Act, the \n     Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Act \n     of 1956, the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Management Act, the \n     Merchant Marine Act, and the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act. \n     Programs authorized under these acts are managed locally by \n     eight regional fishery councils and\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\n     at the national level by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA).\n     Program authorizations\n       S. 39 would authorize funding through fiscal year 2000 for \n     fisheries conservation and management, information collection \n     and analysis, and state/industry assistance programs. Other \n     provisions of the will would:\n       Reauthorize the Fishing Vessel Obligation Guarantee (FVOG) \n     program and provide for guarantees of up to $40 million in \n     loans annually;\n       Expand the FVOG program to allow refinancing of fishing \n     vessel loans during a fishery recovery effort;\n       Authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary \n     to rebuild failed commercial fisheries and mitigate losses of \n     participants in such fisheries;\n       Make fishing observers federal employees for the purpose of \n     compensation for work injuries under the Federal Employee \n     Compensation Act; and\n       Increase NOAA's flexibility in providing grants to \n     commercial fishermen who have suffered uninsured losses as a \n     direct result of a natural disaster.\n     Revenues and fees\n       The bill also would establish a number of new fees and \n     would affect revenues from existing fees. Major provisions \n     would:\n       Direct the Secretary of Commerce (hereafter referred to as \n     the Secretary) to collect a 3 percent fee on the annual ex-\n     vessel (dockside) value of fish harvested under any \n     individual fishing quota (IFQ) or community development quota \n     (CDQ) program;\n       Direct the Secretary to collect fees on foreign vessels \n     that transport fish products from points within U.S. waters \n     to foreign ports;\n       Authorize the Secretary of State to enter into agreements \n     to authorize foreign fishing within the EEZ adjacent to \n     Pacific Insular Areas (PIAs); such agreements would include \n     an annual determination of fees to be charged foreign \n     vessels;\n       Authorize the Secretary of Commerce to collect a fee equal \n     to one-half of 1 percent of the value of limited access \n     permits;\n       Authorize a 1 percent fee on the annual ex-vessel value of \n     bycatch (incidental catch of nontarget fish) targeted for \n     conservation in the North Pacific;\n       In the case of American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern \n     Marina Islands, require that amounts received by the \n     Secretary from fines and penalties imposed under the Magnuson \n     Act be transferred to the treasury of the PIA adjacent to the \n     exclusive economic zone in which the violation occurred and \n     be available for spending by the Governor of that area for \n     any purposes; in the case of other PIAs, require that such \n     amounts be deposited in a newly created Western Pacific \n     Sustainable Fisheries Fund in the U.S. Treasury and spent \n     without appropriation on conservation and management \n     measures; and\n       Authorize the Secretary of State to enter into \n     international agreements to reduce bycatch. The Secretary of \n     the Treasury would be required to impose trade sanctions on \n     fish and fish products from those nations that fail to enter \n     into agreements.\n       Titles I and III of S. 39 would authorize NOAA to institute \n     fishing capacity reduction programs (FCRPs) to ameliorate \n     overfishing in certain areas. Such programs would enable the \n     agency to reduce permanently the number of fishing concerns \n     operating in eligible fisheries by purchasing fishing vessels \n     or federal permits from voluntary sellers or by guaranteeing \n     debt obligations issued by approved entities for that \n     purpose. NOAA would conduct the FCRP regardless of whether \n     the agency guarantees such debt obligations or provides \n     direct funding to owners of fishing vessels or permits.\n       Section 118 of the bill would provide for several possible \n     funding sources for the FCRPs, including: (1) grants from the \n     Promote and Develop Fisheries Fund, (2) amounts appropriated \n     for fisheries disasters, (3) grants from any state or other \n     public source and private or nonprofit organizations, and (4) \n     industry fees paid by participants in the fishery. In \n     addition, section 302 would provide for financing of private \n     buyouts by authorizing NOAA to guarantee bonds to eligible \n     entities under Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. \n     Such guarantees would be subject to the appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts to cover the estimated subsidy cost as \n     defined by the Federal Credit Reform Act.\n       Under the bill, guarantees could only be made if the \n     participants of a fishery approve an industry fee to be used \n     to repay any debt issued. The unpaid principal outstanding at \n     any time could not exceed $100 million for each participating \n     fishery. Amounts from sources other than subsidy \n     appropriations would be deposited to individual fishing \n     capacity reduction funds. Such amounts would be available \n     without appropriation to pay program costs, including \n     payments to financial institutions for guaranteed debt \n     obligations incurred by entities to finance buyouts. Fund \n     balances would be invested in government securities, but the \n     bill makes no provision for the deposit or spending of any \n     interest that may be earned.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that \n     enacting the bill will result in new discretionary spending \n     totaling about $1.4 billion over the 1997-2002 period. \n     Enacting the bill also would result in new direct spending \n     totaling $23 million over the 1997-2002 period, and new \n     revenues totaling about $26 million over the same period. \n     Additional amounts of both direct spending and revenues, each \n     at roughly $6 million a year, would continue for several \n     years after 2002.

Basis of estimate:\n     Spending subject to appropriations\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO has assumed that S. 39 \n     would be enacted by the end of fiscal year 1996 and that the \n     entire amounts authorized or estimated to be necessary would \n     be appropriated for each fiscal year. Outlays have been \n     estimated on the basis of historical spending patterns for \n     ongoing fisheries programs and information provided by NOAA.\n       CBO estimates that S. 39 would authorize appropriations \n     totaling $1,412 million over the 1997-2002 period (see Table \n     2). Of this amount, $1,403 million is from authorizations \n     specified in the bill. Estimates accounting for the remaining \n     $9 million are discussed below.\n       Fishing Vessel Obligation Guarantee Fund (FVOG).--CBO \n     estimates an authorization of $2.4 million (less than \n     $500,000 a year for 1997 through 2002) for appropriations to \n     subsidize the FVOG program. S. 39 would amend the Merchant \n     Marine Act to authorize the FVOG program to guarantee up to \n     $40 million in loans annually. The bill would not change the \n     guarantee fees, which along with the default rates, determine \n     the subsidy rate for the program. Hence, CBO estimates that \n     the current subsidy rate of 1 percent would continue to apply \n     so that the annual loan limitation of $40 million would limit \n     new subsidies to $400,000 a year.\n       Refinancing of Fishing Vessel Loans.--This estimate also \n     includes $4 million for the projected costs of subsidizing \n     the refinancing of certain loans. S. 39 would authorize the \n     Secretary of Commerce to refinance fishing vessel loans for \n     those fishermen that lose revenues as a result of fishery \n     conservation efforts. Because the bill would authorize NOAA \n     to relax underwriting standards, CBO would expect a higher \n     default rate on the refinanced loans than under the current \n     FVOG program. The greater number of defaults would increase \n     the cost of the program to the government. CBO estimates a \n     subsidy rate of nearly 7 percent for the refinancing program, \n     as compared to the rate of 1 percent for the FVOG program. \n     The higher subsidy rate reflects the expected present value \n     of the loans to the federal government. Based on information \n     from NOAA, CBO estimates that FVOG would refinance about $10 \n     million in fishing vessel loans a year or about $60 million \n     over the 1997-2002 period.\n\n   TABLE 2.--Specified and Estimated Authorizations Contained in S. 39  \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS             \n                       (Authorization Levels Only)                      \n                                                                        \nSpecified authorizations: \\1\\                                           \n    Magnuson Act..............    151    160    164    168     --     --\n    Fish and Wildlife Act of                                            \n     1956.....................    103    106    106    106     --     --\n    Interjurisdictional                                                 \n     Fisheries Act............     70     70     70     70     --     --\n    Anadromous Fisheries Act..      8      8      8      8     --     --\n    Atlantic Coastal Fisheries                                          \n     Cooperative Management                                             \n     Act......................      7      7      7      7     --     --\nEstimated authorizations:                                               \n    FVOG......................

This estimate is highly uncertain because it \n     depends on how the program is implemented and on how many \n     fisheries participate. Based on information provided by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service (NFS) and several fisheries \n     councils, CBO expects that the Pacific groundfish fishery \n     would be the only area likely to adopt a program over the \n     next several years. We further\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n     expect that buyouts in this fishery would be made by a \n     fishing association or nonprofit organization that would \n     issue an estimated $20 million in federally guaranteed bonds \n     to finance the purchase of about one-third of the fishery's \n     capacity in 1998.\n       CBO estimates that the subsidy rate for the debt \n     obligations would be about 15 percent, resulting in a cost to \n     the federal government of $3 million in 1998 to guarantee $20 \n     million in debt for the Pacific groundfish fishery. The \n     subsidy rate of 15 percent is comparable to the subsidy rate \n     for a program in which the government guarantees debentures \n     for venture capital firms that invest in small businesses. As \n     with the small business debentures, the repayment of the \n     guaranteed bonds in the fisheries program would be uncertain. \n     The only allowable source of debt repayments would be the \n     industry fees. Because such fees would be based on a \n     percentage of the value of fish caught in the fishery, \n     repayment of the debt would be highly susceptible to market \n     fluctuations, natural disasters, and other unpredictable \n     factors. Moreover, limiting repayments to this source implies \n     that no collateral could be required on any debt.\n       CBO assumes that no other fishery would adopt a capacity \n     reduction program or use this authority to expand existing \n     programs in the near future because industry participants \n     have indicated that they are unwilling to pay for the \n     program.\n       Other Provisions.--The estimated authorization for 1997-\n     2002 does not include any estimate of appropriations to \n     assist in dealing with failures of commercial fisheries \n     pursuant to Title I. Section 118 of this title authorizes \n     such sums as needed to mitigate such failures--through FCRPs \n     or other methods--through 2000. Based on information from \n     NOAA, CBO assumes that funding for dealing with future \n     fisheries failures would more likely be provided under other \n     authorities in the bill (namely, Title III loan subsidies for \n     FCRPs). This estimate also does not include any additional \n     amounts for the provision that makes observers federal \n     employees for the purpose of workers compensation. CBO \n     estimates that any needed amounts--which are likely to \n     average less than $1 million a year--would be paid out of the \n     authorizations specified in the bill.\n     Revenues\n       Enacting S. 39 would result in new revenues totaling about \n     $26 million over the 1997-2002 period and roughly $6 million \n     a year for several years after 2002. This includes about $2 \n     million a year over the 2002-2018 period from fees paid by \n     participants in a capacity reduction program in the Pacific \n     groundfish fishery. Roughly $4 million a year in revenues \n     would continue indefinitely from fees collected pursuant to \n     Pacific Insular Area Fishing Agreements (PIAFAs) and from \n     individuals holding permits and paying fees in limited access \n     fisheries. Table 3 presents the estimated impact of S. 39 on \n     revenues.\n\n             TABLE 3.--ESTIMATED IMPACT OF S. 39 ON REVENUES            \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Changes in Revenues                          \n                                                                        \nEstimated changes in revenues:                                          \n    FCRPs.....................      0      0      2      2      2      2\n    PIAFA Revenues............      0      0      4      4      4      4\n    Limited Access Permits....      1  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)\n                               -----------------------------------------\n      Total estimated revenues                                          \n       \\2\\....................      1  (\\1\\)      6      6      6      6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Less than $500,000.                                                 \n\\2\\ The bill also could raise revenues from fees on bycatch, or reduce  \n  existing revenues from duties on imported fisheries products (which   \n  could be banned if a foreign nation fails to comply with future       \n  international agreements to reduce bycatch), but CBO estimates that   \n  these provisions would have no impact.                                \n\n       Revenues from Fishing Capacity Reduction Programs.--CBO \n     estimates that fees associated with capacity reduction \n     programs would generate additional federal revenues of about \n     $2 million a year beginning in 1999. Section 118 would \n     require NOAA to impose an annual fee on businesses that \n     continue operating in a fishery subject to a capacity \n     reduction program. The fee would have to be approved in a \n     referendum before a buyout program could be implemented. CBO \n     expects that such fees would be imposed on entities fishing \n     for Pacific groundfish and that this would be the only \n     fishery likely to adopt a buyout program in the near future. \n     This estimate is based on a fee equal to 2.5 percent of the \n     estimated annual gross sale proceeds in that fishery (about \n     $80 million), which is the level that would be required to \n     pay the principal and interest on $20 million of bonds over \n     20 years at a rate slightly higher than the federal \n     government's cost of borrowing.\n       PIAFA Revenues.--CBO estimates revenues of about $16 \n     million over the 1997-2002 period from fees that might be \n     included in future PIAFAs. The bill would authorize the \n     Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Secretary of \n     Commerce, the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, and \n     in some cases the Governor of the PIA, to conclude three-year \n     international agreements that would permit foreign fishing in \n     the exclusive economic zone adjacent to PIAs. The agreements \n     would be required to include an annual determination of fees \n     that would be imposed on foreign vessels. Any fees charged \n     would likely be treated as revenues because a permit would \n     be compulsory for fishery participants and the \n     corresponding fees could exceed the administrative costs \n     of issuing permits. Fees collected by the Secretary of \n     Commerce pursuant to PIAFAs for American Samoa, Guam, and \n     the Northern Mariana Islands would be deposited in the \n     Treasury and then transferred to the PIA in which they \n     were collected. Funds would be available for spending by \n     the Governors of each PIA to reimburse the Western Pacific \n     Council and the Secretary of State for the costs of \n     establishing the PIAFA, for conservation and management \n     measures, and for other coastal and marine-relate uses. \n     Fees collected by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to \n     PIAFAs for PIAs other than American Samoa, Guam, and the \n     Northern Mariana Islands would be available without \n     appropriation to the Secretary of the Western Pacific \n     Council to reimburse the Secretary of State for the costs \n     of establishing the PIAFA, for conservation and management \n     measures, and for other coastal and marine-related uses.\n       CBO estimates that, beginning in 1999, about $2 million a \n     year would be collected in and transferred to American Samoa, \n     Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands and an additional $2 \n     million would be collected and spent for other PIAs. This \n     estimate is uncertain because the timing of future agreements \n     will depend on the level of interest of participating nations \n     and the complexity of negotiations. Based on information \n     provided by the Department of State, CBO assumes that PIAFAs \n     would be in place by 1999, and that collections would be \n     consistent with amounts levied by other territories in this \n     region that are currently charging fees.\n       Limited Access Permit Revenues.--CBO estimates revenues of \n     about $1 million in 1997 and less than $0.2 million each year \n     after 1997 from fees on the holders of limited access \n     permits. S. 39 would direct the Secretary of Commerce to \n     collect a fee of up to one-half of 1 percent of the value of \n     limited access permits. Fees would be used to pay for a \n     national registry of permit holders and would be levied at \n     the time an individual's permit is recorded in the registry. \n     Spending of these fees would be subject to appropriations.\n       The estimate of revenues assumes that a fee could be \n     charged almost exclusively in those limited-access fisheries \n     managed by individual transferable quota (ITQ) programs. \n     Because permits in these fisheries are transferable, there is \n     a secondary market that allows permit values to be \n     determined. (A nominal fee based on the administrative cost \n     of issuing permits may be charged in other limited-access \n     fisheries.) Eligible fisheries include those for halibut and \n     sablefish in the North Atlantic and the wreckfish, surf-clam, \n     and ocean quahog in the South Atlantic. The only additional \n     fishery included in our estimate is the Pacific groundfish \n     fishery where--although there is no ITQ program--a \n     secondary market exists for the limited number of permits \n     in the fishery. Information used to estimate permit values \n     was provided by NOAA. CBO assumes that the maximum fee \n     would be levied in all eligible fisheries.\n       Other Provisions.--CBO estimates no additional revenues \n     from proposed fees on bycatch in the North Pacific. Based on \n     information provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service \n     and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, CBO \n     believes that a fee system is unlikely to be proposed by the \n     council in the near future. Rather, the council will consider \n     alternative methods for reducing harvest that do not involve \n     fees. CBO also estimates no decrease in revenues from the \n     provision that would require the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     ban imports of fisheries products from those nations that \n     fail to enter into future international agreements to reduce \n     bycatch. Because few significant measures to reduce bycatch \n     are in place domestically at this time, international \n     agreements on standards comparable to those in the U.S. are \n     unlikely until more extensive domestic measures for bycatch \n     reduction have been implemented.\n     Direct spending\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 39 would result in new \n     direct spending totaling $23 million over the 1997-2002 \n     period and about $6 million a year for several years after \n     2002. The direct spending would be funded by revenues \n     collected pursuant to a capacity reduction program in the \n     Pacific groundfish fishery (about $2 million a year over the \n     1999-2019 period) and from future Pacific Insular Area \n     Fishery Agreements (about $4 million a year beginning in 1999 \n     and continuing indefinitely). Table 4 presents the estimated \n     impact of S. 39 on direct spending.\n       Fishing Capacity Reduction Program (FCRP).--CBO estimates \n     that fees collected pursuant to a capacity reduction in the \n     Pacific groundfish fishery--the only fishery likely to adopt \n     a capacity reduction program in the near future--are likely \n     to total roughly $2 million a year over the 1999-2018 period. \n     The $2 million would be spent each year without further \n     appropriation to pay off bondholders.\n\n         TABLE 4.--ESTIMATED IMPACT OF S. 139 ON DIRECT SPENDING        \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Changes in Direct Spending                       \n                                                                        \nSpending of FCRP revenues:                                              \n    Estimated budget authority  .....  .....      2      2      2      2\n    Estimated outlays.........  .....  .....      2      2      2      2\nIFQ/CDQ offsetting receipts:                                            \n    Estimated budget authority     -5     -6     -6     -8     -8     -8\n    Estimated outlays.........     -5     -6     -6     -8     -8     -8\nSpending from IFQ/CDQ                                                   \n receipts:                                                              \n    Estimated budget authority      5      6      6      8      8      8\n    Estimated outlays.........      4      6      6      8      8      8\nSpending of PIAFA revenues:                                             \n    Estimated budget authority  .....  .....      4      4      4      4\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\n                                                                        \n    Estimated outlays.........  .....  .....      4      4      4      4\nTotal changes in direct                                                 \n spending: \\1\\                                                          \n    Estimated budget authority  .....  .....      6      6      6      6\n    Estimated outlays.........     -1  .....      6      6      6     6 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The bill also could affect spending for disaster assistance to      \n  fishermen and spending from certain fines and penalties, but CBO      \n  estimates that these provisions would have no impact.                 \n\n\n       Fees from Quota Programs.--CBO estimates that the proposed \n     fee on permit holders for fishing under individual fishing \n     quota (IFQ) and community development quota (CDQ) programs \n     would result in a net decrease in outlays of $1 million in \n     1997 and have no net budgetary impact in other years. S. 39 \n     would direct the Secretary of Commerce to collect a fee of up \n     to 3 percent of the annual dockside value of fish harvested \n     under any eligible IFQ or CDQ program. CBO estimates that \n     this provision will result in new receipts totaling about $39 \n     million over the 1997-2002 period. Fees would likely be \n     treated as offsetting receipts and would be available for \n     spending without further appropriation action. Accordingly, \n     the increase in receipts would be offset by additional direct \n     spending and the provision would have no significant \n     net impact on the federal budget, CBO estimates that NOAA \n     would be able to spend most of the receipts collected in \n     each year.\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that individuals \n     holding permits in IFQ and CDQ programs for halibut, \n     sablefish, and pollock begin paying fees in 1997 and that \n     CDQs for North Pacific groundfish, king crab, and tanner crab \n     would be implemented and participants would pay fees by 1998. \n     Individuals holding permits in the wreckfish, surf clam, and \n     ocean quahog CDQ programs would not be required to pay fees \n     until January 1, 2000. CBO assumes that the Secretary would \n     collect the full 3 percent of the annual ex-vessel value of \n     fish caught in fisheries managed by IFQs and that the \n     corresponding rate for fisheries managed by CDQs would be \n     slightly lower--about 2.75 percent--to reflect participants' \n     deductions for higher observer and reporting costs. The \n     estimate of spending from these receipts assumes, pursuant to \n     the bill, that 25 percent of the fees collected pursuant to \n     this provision would subsidize loans for fishermen who \n     purchase IFQs. The remainder would be used to pay for the \n     management and enforcement costs of IFQ and CDQ programs.\n       Spending of PIAFA Revenues.--CBO estimates direct spending \n     of $16 million over the 1997-2002 period from authority to \n     spend without appropriation the revenues collected pursuant \n     to Pacific Insular Area Fishery Agreements.\n       Other Provisions.--CBO estimates that the proposed changes \n     to the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act for fishery relief \n     programs would have no cost because the changes have already \n     been incorporated into current law by Public Law 104-134, the \n     Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of \n     1996. CBO estimates no new direct spending from authority in \n     S. 39 to spend Magnuson Act fines and penalties collected in \n     the EEZ adjacent to Pacific Insular Areas. Penalties and \n     proceeds from asset forfeitures may already be spent without \n     appropriation. The only effect of this provision would be to \n     change the parties that would be eligible to spend the funds.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     direct spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that \n     enacting S. 39 would affect both direct spending and \n     receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to \n     the bill.\n       Direct Spending.--Proposed IFQ and CDQ program fees would \n     result in additional offsetting receipts and spending of \n     those fees. We estimate that spending would lag behind fee \n     collections slightly, resulting in a net reduction in outlays \n     of about $1 million in 1997. Because most receipts would be \n     spent in the year they are collected, CBO estimates that the \n     net impact of this provision on outlays after 1997 would be \n     less than $500,000 a year.\n       S. 39 also would allow spending without appropriation of \n     the fees collected on participants in fishing capacity \n     reduction programs and from PIAFAs. However, CBO estimates \n     that these fees would not be collected or spent until 1999.\n       Revenues.--The bill would raise new revenues from a fee on \n     limited access permits. Revenues from other new fees would \n     accrue after 1998.\n       CBO's estimate of S. 39's pay-as-you-go impact is \n     summarized in the following table:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 1996     1997     1998 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays............................        0       -1        0\nChange in receipts...........................        0        1        0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates \n     as defined in Public Law 104-4, and would impose no direct \n     costs on State, local, or tribal governments. The bill would \n     authorize appropriations of at least $87 million over fiscal \n     years 1997 through 2000 for financial assistance to State and \n     local governments. This assistance would help State and local \n     governments protect and manage fishery resources. If the \n     Secretary of State enters into agreements to allow foreign \n     fishing within the exclusive economic zones adjacent to \n     Pacific Insular Areas, the bill could also result in \n     increased funding for these governments. Such funding would \n     be earmarked for managing and conserving fisheries.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 39 contains \n     several new private-sector mandates, but the direct costs of \n     those mandates are not likely to exceed the $100 million \n     threshold established by Public Law 104-4 (see the attached \n     private-sector mandate statement).\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On July 10, 1995, CBO provided a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 39, the Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Amendments of 1995, as reported by the House \n     Committee on Resources on June 30, 1995. CBO estimated that \n     H.R. 39 would authorize new appropriations totaling $660 \n     million over the 1996-2000 period, including $610 million in \n     specified authorizations and an estimated $50 million for an \n     FCRP for the Northeast. CBO also estimated that H.R. 39 would \n     result in direct spending of less than $0.5 million a year \n     from the collection of fees on foreign vessels that transport \n     fish products from United States waters to foreign ports. \n     Additional receipts of up to $5 million a year would be \n     collected from fees on IFQ permits. However, the fees would \n     be available for spending without appropriation and CBO \n     estimated that the increase in receipts would be offset by \n     additional direct spending. Finally, CBO estimated that H.R. \n     39 would result in $2 million to $4 million a year in new \n     revenues from an annual fee on holders of federal fishing \n     permits who continue operating in the Northeast FCRP. These \n     revenues would be authorized for spending without \n     appropriation for other FCRP programs, but CBO assumed that \n     no other programs would be enacted and that those revenues \n     would not be spent. Differences in CBO estimates for similar \n     provisions of H.R. 39 and S. 39 are attributable to \n     significant differences in the bills and to the availability \n     of new information since last July.\n       11.

Background and Summary\n\n        The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     Congressional employees and employing offices. Section 220 of \n     the CAA concerns the application of chapter 71 of title 5, \n     United States Code (``chapter 71'') relating to Federal \n     service labor-management relations. Section 220(a) of the CAA \n     applies the rights, protections and responsibilities \n     established under sections 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117,\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n     7119 through 7122 and 7131 of title 5, United States Code to \n     employing offices and to covered employees and \n     representatives of those employees.\n        Section 220(d) authorizes the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance (``Board'') to issue regulations to \n     implement section 220 and further states that, except as \n     provided in subsection (e), such regulations ``shall be the \n     same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority [``FLRA''] to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except--\n     (A) to the extent that the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section; or (B) as the Board deems necessary to avoid a \n     conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest.''\n        On March 6, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance (``Office'') issued an Advance Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``ANPR'') that solicited comments from interested \n     parties in order to obtain participation and information \n     early in the rulemaking process. 142 Cong. R. S1547 (daily \n     ed., Mar. 6, 1996).\n        On May 15, 1996, the Board published in the Congressional \n     Record a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') (142 Cong. \n     R. S5070-89, H5153-72 (daily ed., May 15, 1996). In response \n     to the NPR, the Board received three written comments, two of \n     which were from offices of the Congress and one of which was \n     from a labor organization.\n        Parenthetically, it should also be noted that, on May 23, \n     1996, the Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (142 Cong. R. S5552-56, H5563-68 (daily ed., May 23, 1996)) \n     inviting comments from interested parties on proposed \n     regulations under section 220(e). That subsection further \n     authorizes the Board to issue regulations on the manner and \n     extent to which the requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 \n     should apply to covered employees who are employed in certain \n     specified offices, ``except . . . that the Board shall \n     exclude from coverage under [section 220] any covered \n     employees who are employed in [the specified offices] if the \n     Board determines that such exclusion is required because of \n     (i) a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest; or (ii) Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities.'' Final regulations under section 220(e) \n     will be adopted and submitted for Congressional approval \n     separately.\n\n             II. Consideration of Comments and Conclusions\n\n           A. Investigative and adjudicatory responsibilities\n\n        In the NPR, the Board proposed that, like the FLRA , it \n     would decide representation issues, negotiability issues and \n     exceptions to arbitral awards based upon a record developed \n     through direct submissions from the parties and, where \n     necessary, through further investigation by the Board \n     (through the person of the Executive Director). Under the \n     Board's proposed rule, only unfair labor practice issues (and \n     not representation, arbitrability or negotiability issues) \n     would be referred to hearing officers for initial decision \n     under section 405 of the CAA.\n       One commenter expressly approved of this proposal. \n     Conversely, two commenters argued that the proposal violates \n     the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, which they \n     read as requiring the Board to refer all section 220 issues, \n     including representation, arbitrability, and negotiability \n     issues, to hearing officers for initial decision under \n     section 405.\n       Contrary to the argument that the statutory text \n     unambiguously requires referral of representation, \n     arbitrability, and negotiability issues (as well as unfair \n     labor practice issues) to hearing officers for initial \n     decision pursuant to section 405, section 220(c)(1) simply \n     does not define the ``matter[s]'' that must be referred to \n     hearing officers for initial decision under section 405, much \n     less specify that these ``matter[s]'' include disputed issues \n     of representation, negotiability and/or arbitrability. \n     Moreover, contrary to the assumption of the commenters, there \n     is no sound reason to assume that the ``matter[s]'' that the \n     Board must refer to hearing officers for initial decision \n     under section 405 are co-extensive with the ``petition[s], or \n     other submission[s]'' that the Board receives under section \n     220(c)(1). Since Congress did not require the Board to refer \n     to a hearing officer for initial decision ``any petition or \n     other submission'' that it receives under section 220(c)(1), \n     but rather only ``any matter under this paragraph,'' the \n     interpretive presumption in fact must be that the \n     ``matter[s]'' which the Board must refer are not co-extensive \n     with the ``petitions or other submissions'' that it receives \n     under section 220(c)(1) (but, rather, are only a subset of \n     them.) Whether or not this interpretative presumption can be \n     overcome by other relevant interpretive materials, it is \n     plain that, contrary to the assertion of the commenters, the \n     statutory text is in fact seriously ambiguous about whether \n     controversies involving representation, negotiability, and \n     arbitrability issues are ``matter[s]'' within the meaning of \n     section 220(c)(1) that must be referred to a Hearing Officer \n     pursuant to section 405.\n       Moreover, as explained in the NPR, this textual ambiguity \n     is best resolved by interpreting the statutory phrase \n     ``matter'' in section 220(c)(1) to encompass only \n     controversies involving disputed unfair labor practice \n     issues. The term ``matter'' in section 220(c)(1) simply does \n     not appear to refer to representation or other such issues \n     arising out of the Board's ``investigative authorities.'' \n     Indeed, section 220(c)(1) expressly contemplates that the \n     Board may direct the General Counsel (and, a fortiori, not a \n     hearing officer) to carry out these ``investigative \n     authorities,'' which under chapter 71 include the authority, \n     for example, to decide (and not, as one commenter suggests, \n     merely to investigate) disputed representation issues such as \n     whether an individual must be excluded from a unit because he \n     or she is a supervisor.\n       Under chapter 71, only controversies involving unfair labor \n     practice issues are subject to formal adversarial processes \n     like those established by section 405; and nothing in the \n     CAA's legislative history shows that Congress understood \n     itself to be departing from chapter 71 in this respect. In \n     these circumstances, under the CAA, the textual ambiguity \n     must be resolved by reference to the interpretive presumption \n     that Congress has subjected itself to the same rules that the \n     executive branch is subject to under chapter 71.\n       Furthermore, contrary to the suggestion of one commenter, \n     the reference in the last sentence of section 220(c)(2) to \n     initial hearing officer consideration of unfair labor \n     practice complaints does not detract in any way from the \n     Board's construction of the term ``matter'' in section \n     220(c)(1). The Board's construction of the term ``matter'' in \n     section 220(c)(1) simply does not render this reference in \n     section 220(c)(2) to initial hearing officer consideration of \n     unfair labor practice complaints ``redundant and \n     meaningless,'' as the commenter claims; rather, the reference \n     in section 220(c)(2) simply completes the statute's \n     instruction to the General Counsel concerning how he should \n     process a controversy involving an unfair labor practice \n     issue (just as section 220(c)(1) in parallel instructs the \n     Board concerning how it should process a controversy \n     involving an unfair labor practice issue). Indeed, construing \n     the phrase ``matter'' in section 220(c)(1) to encompass more \n     than just controversies involving unfair labor practice \n     issues would not in any way reduce the redundancy and lack of \n     meaning that the commenter perceives (since, in all events, \n     both section 220(c) (1) and (2) would effectively encompass \n     initial hearing officer consideration of unfair labor \n     practice issues).\n       The commenters similarly err in suggesting that the \n     judicial review provisions of section 220(c)(3) demonstrate \n     that the Board must refer more than just unfair labor \n     practice issues to a hearing officer for initial decision \n     under section 405. In making this suggestion, the commenters \n     omit mention of the critical statutory language in section \n     220(c)(3) that only the General Counsel or the respondent to \n     the complaint may seek judicial review of a final Board \n     decision under section 220(c) (1) or (2). This language \n     appears to limit judicial review to cases involving unfair \n     labor practice issues, because it is only in unfair labor \n     practice cases that the parties include either ``the General \n     Counsel or the respondent to the complaint.'' In all events, \n     even if section 220(c)(3) authorized judicial review of more \n     than just unfair labor practice issues, referral of more than \n     controversies involving unfair labor practice issues would \n     not be required: Judicial review does not always require a \n     record created by a formal adversary process, and the Board \n     still has not found a statutory command sufficient to require \n     a formal adversary process where chapter 71 does not do so.\n        Finally, there is simply no foundation for the suggestion \n     that the ``real reason'' for the Board's reading of the \n     statute is that referral of representation, arbitrability, or \n     negotiability issues to a hearing officer for initial \n     decision under section 405 would be ``overly cumbersome.'' It \n     is in fact the judgment of the Board, based on its members' \n     many years of practice and experience in this area, that \n     referral of such issues for formal adversary hearings would \n     be overly cumbersome and would undermine considerably the \n     effective implementation of section 220 of the CAA. Indeed, \n     it is difficult for the Board's members to even conceive of \n     how an election could practicably be conducted in the \n     confidential, adversarial processes contemplated by section \n     405. But, while the Board is in fact entitled in its \n     interpretive process to presume that Congress did not intend \n     to be so impracticable, the ``real reason'' for the Board's \n     construction of section 220 is not this significant practical \n     concern. Rather, the ``real reason'' is the one that is \n     stated in the NPR and here--to wit, that neither the \n     statutory language nor the legislative history contain a \n     sufficiently clear command that, in supposedly subjecting \n     itself to the same labor laws as are applicable to the \n     executive branch, Congress intended to make an exception for \n     itself and require formal adversarial proceedings where they \n     are not required under chapter 71. As the Supreme Court has \n     stated: ` ``In a case where the construction of legislative \n     language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively \n     unorthodox a change as that [suggested] here, [we] think \n     judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the \n     fact that a watch dog did not bark in the night.'' ' Chisom \n     v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 397 (1991), quoting Harrison v. PPG \n     Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 602 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., \n     dissenting).\n\n                 B. Pre-election investigatory hearings\n\n       In the NPR, the Board proposed to add a new subsection \n     2422.18(d) to provide that the parties have an obligation to \n     produce existing documents and witnesses for pre-election\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n     investigatory hearings, in accordance with the instructions \n     of the Board (acting through the person of the Executive \n     Director), and that a willful failure to comply with such \n     instructions could result in an adverse inference being drawn \n     on the issue for which the evidence is sought. The Board \n     noted that section 7132 of chapter 71, which authorizes the \n     issuance of subpoenas by various FLRA officials, was not made \n     applicable by the CAA and that, as pre-election investigatory \n     hearings are not conducted under section 405 of the CAA, \n     subpoenas for documents or witnesses in such pre-election \n     proceedings are not available under the CAA, as they are \n     under chapter 71. The Board thus concluded that there is good \n     cause to modify section 2422.18 of the FLRA's regulations to \n     include subsection (d) because, in order to properly decide \n     disputed representation issues and effectively implement \n     section 220 of the CAA, a complete investigatory record \n     comparable to that developed under chapter 71 is necessary.\n       One commenter asserted, consistent with that commenter's \n     view that pre-election investigatory hearings must be \n     conducted under section 405 of the CAA, that the addition of \n     subsection 2422.18(d) is not necessary. Based upon the same \n     rationale, another commenter suggested (1) that section \n     2422.18(b) be modified to provide that the Federal rules of \n     evidence shall apply in pre-election investigatory hearings, \n     and (2) that the Board ``should make the proposed regulations \n     governing service of subpoenas consistent with its own \n     procedural regulations.'' This same commenter also suggested \n     that the Board specifically not adopt that portion of section \n     2422.18(b) which provides that pre-election investigatory \n     hearings are open to the public, because this provision \n     allegedly ``appears to be included to comply with the \n     Sunshine Act'' which ``does not apply to Congress.''\n       As noted above, the Board continues to be of the view that \n     pre-election investigatory hearings need not and should not \n     be conducted under section 405 of the CAA. Accordingly, since \n     the commenters criticisms of this proposed regulation are \n     based upon a contrary false premise, the Board adheres to its \n     original conclusion that there is good cause to modify \n     section 2422.18 of the FLRA's regulations by including \n     section 2422.18(d). Further, because pre-election \n     investigatory hearings should not be conducted under section \n     405 of the CAA, there is no good cause to modify section \n     2422.18 to require the application of the Federal rules of \n     evidence or to provide for the issuance or service of \n     subpoenas in connection with such investigatory hearings. \n     Finally, contrary to the assertion of one commenter, there is \n     no indication that the ``Sunshine Act'' (Pub. L. 94-409) \n     formed the basis for the section 2422.18(b) requirement that \n     pre-election hearings be open to the public, and there is no \n     basis for not adopting that subsection, as suggested by the \n     commenter.\n\n      C. Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the \n                        negotiability procedure\n\n       In the NPR, the Board determined that there is good cause \n     to delete the concluding sentences of sections 2423.5 and \n     2424.4 of the FLRA's regulations. Specifically, the Board \n     proposed to omit the requirement that a labor organization \n     file a petition for review of a negotiability issue, rather \n     than an unfair labor practice charge, in cases that solely \n     involve an employing office's allegation that the duty to \n     bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed \n     to be bargained and that do not involve actual or \n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment. The Board \n     reasoned that, by eliminating that restriction, a labor \n     organization could choose to seek a Board determination on \n     the issue, as it can with respect to other assertions by \n     employing offices that there is no duty to bargain, through \n     an unfair labor practice proceeding and, if the determination \n     is unfavorable, the labor organization could possibly obtain \n     judicial review by persuading the General Counsel to file a \n     petition for review of the unfavorable Board decision under \n     section 220(c)(3) of the Act. In this regard, the Board \n     stated its view that, unlike chapter 71, the CAA does not \n     provide for direct judicial review of Board decisions and \n     orders on petitions for review of negotiability issues.\n        One commenter expressly and specifically agreed that there \n     is good cause for this proposed modification of the FLRA's \n     regulations. The two other commenters asserted that there is \n     not good cause to delete the pertinent sentences from the \n     FLRA's regulations because of their view that, under section \n     220(c)(3), direct judicial review of Board decisions on \n     petitions for review of negotiability issues is available.\n        The Board has further considered this issue and has \n     concluded, for reasons different than those urged by the \n     commenters, that it should not delete the concluding \n     sentences of the referenced sections of the FLRA's \n     regulations. Under section 7117 of chapter 71, which is \n     incorporated into the CAA, a labor organization is the only \n     party that may file a petition for Board review of a \n     negotiability issue; the labor organization is always the \n     petitioner and never a respondent, and the General Counsel is \n     never a party. Moreover, section 220(c)(3) provides that only \n     ``the General Counsel or the respondent to the complaint, if \n     aggrieved by a final decision of the Board'' may file a \n     petition for judicial review of a Board decision. \n     Accordingly, it is clear that, under the CAA, it was \n     Congress' intent not to accord labor organizations the right \n     to seek direct judicial review of unfavorable decisions on \n     negotiability issues. Further, in the Board's judgment, \n     questions involving the duty to bargain, where there are no \n     actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment, \n     are best resolved through a negotiability determination; \n     procedures for the consideration of petitions for review of \n     negotiability issues are more expeditious and less \n     adversarial than unfair labor practice proceedings, and thus \n     the requirement that labor organizations utilize the \n     negotiability procedures is more effective for the \n     implementation of section 220. Accordingly, the concluding \n     sentences of section 2423.5 and 2424.5 of the FLRA's \n     regulations will be included in the Board's final \n     regulations.\n\n D. Exclusion of certain employing offices from coverage under section \n                                  220\n\n        One commenter urged the Board to exclude certain specific \n     employing offices from coverage under section 220 of the CAA. \n     The commenter reasoned that, since section 7103(a)(3) of \n     chapter 71 specifically defines ``agency'' not to include \n     certain named executive branch agencies, the Board should \n     exempt ``parallel'' employing offices in the House of \n     Representatives from the definition of ``employing office'' \n     in the Board's regulations.\n        The Board declines this suggestion. Just as Congress \n     defined the term ``agency'' under chapter 71, Congress has \n     defined ``employing office'' in the CAA. The Board cannot, as \n     the commentor has requested, redefine ``employing office'' by \n     regulation to exclude employing offices that are encompassed \n     by statutory definition.\n\n E. Exercise of the Board's authority under section 7103(b) of chapter \n                       71, as applied by the CAA\n\n        Under section 220(c)(1) of the CAA, the Board has been \n     granted the authority that the President has under section \n     7103(b) of chapter 71 to ``issue an order excluding any \n     [employing office] or subdivision from coverage under this \n     chapter if the [Board] determines that--\n       (a) the [employing office] or subdivision has as a primary \n     function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or \n     national security work, and\n       (b) the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to \n     that [employing office] or subdivision in a manner consistent \n     with national security requirements and considerations.''\n       Two commenters requested that the Board issue regulations \n     under this authority. In doing so, one commenter named five \n     employing offices that it simply asserted should be excluded \n     because their ``primary function . . . is intelligence \n     investigative or national security work''; the other \n     commenter made no specific suggestions as to appropriate \n     exclusions.\n       While the Board is willing to exercise its authority \n     derived from section 7103(b) of chapter 71 (when and if it \n     receives information that would allow it to do so), the \n     authority that the Board possesses is to exclude employing \n     offices from coverage under section 220 by ``order,'' not by \n     regulation. Congress wisely recognized that sensitive \n     security issues of this type are not properly addressed in a \n     public rulemaking procedure, but rather are better addressed \n     by executive or administrative order.\n\n                  F. Definition of labor organization\n\n       One commenter correctly pointed out that the words \n     ``bylaws, tacit agreement among its members,'' were omitted \n     from the definition of ``labor organization'' in section \n     2421.3(d). The final regulation has been modified to correct \n     this inadvertent omission.\n\n     G. Substitution of the term ``disability'' for ``handicapping \n                              condition''\n\n       The proposed regulations, in sections 2421.3(d)(1) and \n     2421.4(d)(2)(iv), make reference to the term ``handicapping \n     condition''. That term appears in the FLRA regulations and is \n     derived from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In section \n     201(a)(3) of the CAA, the Congress used the term \n     ``disability,'' rather than the term ``handicap'' or \n     ``handicapping condition''. Accordingly, as urged by one \n     commenter, the Board finds good cause to substitute the term \n     ``disability'' for the term ``handicapping condition'' \n     wherever it appears in the regulations.\n\n                      H. Conditions of employment\n\n       One commenter suggested that the Board should modify the \n     definition of the term ``conditions of employment'' in \n     section 2421.3(m)(3) of the proposed regulations to provide \n     that, in addition to ``matters specifically provided for by \n     Federal statute,'' matters specifically provided for by \n     ``resolutions, rules, regulations and other pronouncements of \n     the House of Representatives and/or the Senate having the \n     force and effect of law'' are among the matters excluded from \n     that term. But the definition of ``conditions of employment'' \n     in section 2421.3(m) of the proposed regulations is identical \n     to the statutory definition incorporated by reference into \n     the FLRA's regulations. Moreover, to the extent that \n     resolutions, rules, regulations and pronouncements of the \n     House or Senate have the force and effect of Federal \n     statutes, matters specifically provided for therein are \n     already excluded from ``conditions of employment'' under \n     section 220. The Board thus does not find good cause to \n     change the FLRA's regulation.\n\n                   I. Applicability of certain terms\n\n       1. Government-wide rule or regulation.--The term \n     ``Government-wide rule or regulation'' is found in various \n     contexts in the incorporated provisions of chapter 71 and \n     applicable regulations of the FLRA. One commenter\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\n     asked that the Board clarify that the term includes ``rules \n     or regulations issued by the House or Senate, as \n     appropriate.'' The commenter cited no authority for the \n     requested change.\n       The Board has carefully considered the matter. Its own \n     research reveals that the FLRA has interpreted this term to \n     include only rules or regulations that are generally \n     applicable to the Federal civilian workforce within the \n     executive branch. The Board thus does not find good cause to \n     revise the term to apply to rules or regulations that are not \n     generally applicable to covered employees throughout the \n     entire legislative branch.\n       2. Activity; primary national subdivision.--One commenter \n     asserted that the terms ``activity'' and ``primary national \n     subdivision'' have no applicability in the legislative branch \n     and should be omitted from the regulations. However, there \n     was not sufficient information in the comment to allow the \n     Board to make an informed judgment about the validity of the \n     assertion. The Board therefore does not have good cause to \n     modify the FLRA's regulations by deleting these terms; \n     indeed, if the terms are inapplicable, their inclusion in the \n     regulations will have no substantial consequence.\n\n                         J. Consultation rights\n\n        1. National.--Under section 2426.1(a) of the proposed \n     rules, an employing office shall accord national consultation \n     rights to a labor organization that holds exclusive \n     recognition for 10% or more of the total number of personnel \n     employed by the employing office. In this regard, the Board \n     noted that the FLRA has considered 10% of the employees of an \n     agency or primary national subdivision to be a significant \n     enough proportion of the employee complement to allow for \n     meaningful consultations, no matter the size of the agency or \n     the number of its employees. The Board determined that there \n     is no apparent reason why there should be a different \n     threshold requirement for small legislative branch employing \n     offices from that applicable to small executive branch \n     agencies.\n       One commenter urged that the Board reconsider its \n     determination. The commenter argued that the threshold should \n     be raised, because in a small employing office of 10 \n     employees ``a union could gain consultation rights on the \n     basis of the interest of one employee.''\n       The commenter's concern that one employee's ``interest'' in \n     a 10-employee office could require consultations is \n     unfounded. In order to obtain national consultation rights, a \n     labor organization must hold ``exclusive recognition'' for \n     10% of the employees. Section 2421.4(c) of the Board's \n     proposed rules defines the term ``exclusive recognition'' to \n     mean that ``a labor organization has been selected as the \n     sole representative, in a secret ballot election, by a \n     majority of the employees in an appropriate unit who cast \n     ballots in an election.'' The mere ``interest'' of employees \n     does not constitute ``exclusive recognition.'' Further, \n     exclusive recognition cannot, under applicable precedent, be \n     granted for a single employee, because a one-employee unit is \n     not appropriate for exclusive recognition. The Board thus has \n     decided to adhere to its conclusion that there is not good \n     cause to change the 10% threshold.\n       2. Government-wide rules or regulations.--In the NPR, the \n     Board concluded that it had good cause to modify the \n     threshold requirement contained in the FLRA's regulations \n     that provide for an agency, in appropriate circumstances, to \n     accord consultation rights on Government-wide rules or \n     regulations to a labor organization that holds exclusive \n     recognition for 3,500 or more employees. The Board reasoned \n     that, because of the size of employing offices covered by the \n     CAA, the 3,500 employee threshold could never be met and \n     needed to be revised. Accordingly, by analogy to the \n     eligibility requirement for national consultation rights, the \n     Board adopted a threshold requirement of 10% of employees.\n       One commenter asserted that the Board improperly replaced \n     the 3,500 employee threshold requirement with the 10% \n     requirement, arguing that the intent of the 3,500 employee \n     threshold was to permit consultation only in large agencies. \n     The commenter stated that, because no covered employing \n     office has 3,500 employees, ``consultation on government-wide \n     rules or regulations should not be a requirement under the \n     CAA.''\n       The Board has carefully considered the comment and has now \n     concluded that the substitution of a 10% threshold for the \n     3,500 employee requirement would not result in the \n     appropriate standard for the grant of consultation rights on \n     Government-wide rules or regulations. However, contrary to \n     the commenter's assertion, such consultation rights should \n     be, and indeed are, accorded under the CAA.\n       Section 7117(d) of chapter 71, which is incorporated into \n     the CAA, provides that a labor organization that is the \n     exclusive representative of a substantial number of \n     employees, as determined in accordance with criteria \n     prescribed by the FLRA, shall be granted consultation rights \n     by any agency with respect to any Government-wide rule or \n     regulation issued by the agency that effects any substantive \n     change in any condition of employment. For example, under the \n     FLRA's regulations, in appropriate circumstances, the Office \n     of Personnel Management (OPM) would be required to accord \n     consultation rights on an OPM-issued government-wide \n     regulation to labor organizations that are the exclusive \n     representatives of at least 3,500 executive branch employees, \n     even if those employees are not employees of OPM. Section \n     7117(d) of chapter 71 was incorporated into the CAA. Thus, in \n     the legislative branch, consultation rights on legislative \n     branch-wide rules or regulations issued by an employing \n     office that effect any substantive change in any condition of \n     employment must be granted to the exclusive representative(s) \n     of a substantial number of covered legislative branch \n     employees.\n       The FLRA determined in its regulations that 3,500 employees \n     is a ``substantial'' number of employees in the executive \n     branch. The most recent statistics compiled by OPM's Office \n     of Workforce Information reveal that there are approximately \n     1,958,200 civilian, non-postal, Federal employees. In \n     contrast, the Congressional Research Service reports that \n     there are only approximately 20,100 legislative branch \n     employees currently covered by the CAA. As the covered \n     workforce in the legislative branch is approximately one-\n     tenth the size of the analogous executive branch employee \n     complement, the Board concludes that the appropriate \n     threshold requirement for the grant of consultation rights in \n     the legislative branch is 350 employees, or one-tenth the \n     requirement in the executive branch. Accordingly, the Board \n     finds that there is good cause to modify section 2426.11(a) \n     of the FLRA's rules to provide that requests for consultation \n     rights on Government-wide rules or regulations (e.g. rules or \n     regulations that are generally applicable to the legislative \n     branch) will be granted by an employing office, as \n     appropriate, to a labor organization that holds exclusive \n     recognition for 350 or more covered employees in the \n     legislative branch.\n\n             K. Posting of notices in representation cases\n\n       One commenter asserted that sections 2422.7 and 2422.23, \n     which provide for the posting or distribution of certain \n     notices by employing offices, should be modified. In this \n     regard, the commenter argued that these sections of the \n     proposed rules ``give the Executive Director the authority to \n     determine the placement'' of the notice posting and that such \n     determination should be left to the discretion of the \n     employing office. Contrary to the commenter's assertions, \n     however, nothing in the aforementioned regulations deprives \n     an employing office of the desired discretion so long as the \n     notices are posted ``in places where notices to employees are \n     customarily posted and/or distributed in a manner by which \n     notices are normally distributed.'' Accordingly, there is no \n     reason to modify the regulations, as requested by the \n     commenter.\n\n    L. Enforcement of decisions of the Assistant Secretary of Labor\n\n       In the NPR, the Board found good cause to modify section \n     2428.3 of the FLRA's regulations to delete the requirement in \n     section 2428.3(a) that the Board enforce any decision or \n     order of the Assistant Secretary of Labor (Assistant \n     Secretary) unless it is ``arbitrary and capricious or based \n     upon manifest disregard of the law.'' Noting that section \n     225(f)(3) of the CAA specifically states that the CAA does \n     not authorize executive branch enforcement of the Act, the \n     Board concluded that it should not adopt a regulatory \n     provision that would require the Board to defer to decisions \n     of an executive branch agency.\n       Two commenters asserted that the Board did not have good \n     cause to modify the FLRA's regulation. Both argued that \n     requiring the Board to enforce a decision and order of the \n     Assistant Secretary is not tantamount to executive branch \n     enforcement of the Act.\n       The Board continues to be of the view that, in order to \n     give full effect to section 225(f)(3) of the CAA, it should \n     not defer to decisions of the Assistant Secretary. There is \n     thus good cause to modify section 2428.3 of the FLRA's \n     regulations.\n\n          M. Regulations under section 220(d)(2)(B) of the CAA\n\n       Section 220(d)(2)(B) of the CAA provides that, in issuing \n     regulations to implement section 220, the Board may modify \n     the FLRA's regulations ``as the Board deems necessary to \n     avoid a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest.'' In the ANPR, the Board requested commenters to \n     identify, where applicable, why a proposed modification of \n     the FLRA's regulations is necessary to avoid a conflict of \n     interest or appearance thereof. In this regard, commenters \n     were advised not only to fully and specifically describe the \n     conflict of interest or appearance thereof that they believed \n     would exist were the pertinent FLRA regulations not modified, \n     but also to explain the necessity for avoiding the asserted \n     conflict or appearance of conflict and how any proposed \n     modification would avoid the identified concerns.\n       In response to the ANPR, one commenter argued that the \n     posting requirements of sections 2422.7 and 2422.23 of the \n     FLRA's regulations should be modified. In the NPR, the Board \n     discussed the commenter's suggested modifications and \n     determined that the modifications were not necessary under \n     section 220(d)(2)(B). No other modifications were requested \n     or discussed.\n       Another commenter has now urged the Board to ``promulgate a \n     regulation for the exclusion from a bargaining unit of any \n     employee whose membership or participation in the labor \n     organization would present an actual or apparent conflict of \n     interest with the duties of the employee'' in order to \n     ``eliminate by regulation the possibility, or even the \n     appearance of the possibility, that the contents of \n     legislation or legislative policy might be influenced by \n     union membership of\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\n     Congressional employees.'' This commenter provided no \n     additional explanation for the proposed regulation. Nor did \n     the commenter provide a list of the employees who should be \n     so excluded (or, indeed, any examples).\n       The Board has concluded that it is appropriate to adopt a \n     regulation authorizing parties in appropriate circumstances \n     to assert, and the Board to decide where appropriate and \n     relevant, that a conflict of interest (real or apparent) \n     exists that makes it necessary for the Board to modify a \n     requirement that would otherwise be applicable. The \n     regulation is found at section 2420.2.\n\n                        III. Method of Approval\n\n       The Board received no comments on the method of approval \n     for these regulations. Therefore, the Board continues to \n     recommend that (1) the version of the regulations that shall \n     apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate should be \n     approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the version of the \n     regulations that shall apply to the House of Representatives \n     and employees of the House of Representatives should be \n     approved by the House of Representatives by resolution; and \n     (3) the version of the regulations that apply to other \n     covered employees and employing offices should be approved by \n     concurrent resolution.\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby adopts and submits for approval by the \n     Congress the following regulations.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 9th day of July, 1996.\n\n                                                Glen D.

If the Executive \n     Director finds, on behalf of the Board, that the showing of \n     interest is not valid, the Executive Director will dismiss \n     the petition or deny the request to intervene.\n     Sec. 2422.11  Challenge to the status of a labor \n         organization.\n       (a) Basis of challenge to labor organization status. The \n     only basis on which a challenge to the status of a labor \n     organization may be made is compliance with 5 U.S.C. \n     7103(a)(4), as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) Format and time for filing a challenge. Any party \n     filing a challenge to the status of a labor organization \n     involved in the processing of a petition must do so in \n     writing to the Executive Director before the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause is shown for \n     granting an extension. If no hearing is held, challenges must \n     be filed prior to action being taken pursuant to \n     Sec. 2422.30.\n     Sec. 2422.12  Timeliness of petitions seeking an election.\n       (a) Election bar. Where there is no certified exclusive \n     representative, a petition seeking\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\n     an election will not be considered timely if filed within \n     twelve (12) months of a valid election involving the same \n     unit or a subdivision of the same unit.\n       (b) Certification bar. Where there is a certified exclusive \n     representative of employees, a petition seeking an election \n     will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) \n     months after the certification of the exclusive \n     representative of the employees in an appropriate unit. If a \n     collective bargaining agreement covering the claimed unit is \n     pending employing office head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c), \n     as applied by the CAA, or is in effect, paragraphs (c), (d), \n     or (e) of this section apply.\n       (c) Bar during employing office head review. A petition \n     seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed \n     during the period of employing office head review under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA. This bar expires upon \n     either the passage of thirty (30) days absent employing \n     office head action, or upon the date of any timely employing \n     office head action.\n       (d) Contract bar where the contract is for three (3) years \n     or less. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect \n     covering the claimed unit and has a term of three (3) years \n     or less from the date it became effective, a petition seeking \n     an election will be considered timely if filed not more than \n     one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days \n     prior to the expiration of the agreement.\n       (e) Contract bar where the contract is for more than three \n     (3) years. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in \n     effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of more than \n     three (3) years from the date it became effective, a petition \n     seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not \n     more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty \n     (60) days prior to the expiration of the initial three (3) \n     year period, and any time after the expiration of the initial \n     three (3) year period.\n       (f) Unusual circumstances. A petition seeking an election \n     or a determination relating to representation matters may be \n     filed at any time when unusual circumstances exist that \n     substantially affect the unit or majority representation.\n       (g) Premature extension. Where a collective bargaining \n     agreement with a term of three (3) years or less has been \n     extended prior to sixty (60) days before its expiration date, \n     the extension will not serve as a basis for dismissal of a \n     petition seeking an election filed in accordance with this \n     section.\n       (h) Contract requirements. Collective bargaining \n     agreements, including agreements that go into effect under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA, and those that \n     automatically renew without further action by the parties, do \n     not constitute a bar to a petition seeking an election under \n     this section unless a clear and unambiguous effective date, \n     renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date \n     are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant \n     accompanying documentation.\n     Sec. 2422.13  Resolution of issues raised by a petition.\n       (a) Meetings prior to filing a representation petition. All \n     parties affected by the representation issues that may be \n     raised in a petition are encouraged to meet prior to the \n     filing of the petition to discuss their interests and narrow \n     and resolve the issues. If requested by all parties a \n     representative of the Office will participate in these \n     meetings.\n       (b) Meetings to narrow and resolve the issues after the \n     petition is filed. After a petition is filed, the Executive \n     Director may require all affected parties to meet to narrow \n     and resolve the issues raised in the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.14  Effect of withdrawal/dismissal.\n       (a) Withdrawal/dismissal less than sixty (60) days before \n     contract expiration. When a petition seeking an election that \n     has been timely filed is withdrawn by the petitioner or \n     dismissed by the Executive Director or the Board less than \n     sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of an existing \n     agreement between the incumbent exclusive representative and \n     the employing office or activity or any time after the \n     expiration of the agreement, another petition seeking an \n     election will not be considered timely if filed within a \n     ninety (90) day period from either:\n       (1) The date the withdrawal is approved; or\n       (2) The date the petition is dismissed by the Executive \n     Director when no application for review is filed with the \n     Board; or\n       (3) The date the Board rules on an application for review; \n     or\n       (4) The date the Board issues a Decision and Order \n     dismissing the petition.\n       Other pending petitions that have been timely filed under \n     this Part will continue to be processed.\n       (b) Withdrawal by petitioner. A petitioner who submits a \n     withdrawal request for a petition seeking an election that is \n     received by the Executive Director after the notice of pre-\n     election investigatory hearing issues or after approval of an \n     election agreement, whichever occurs first, will be barred \n     from filing another petition seeking an election for the same \n     unit or any subdivision of the unit for six (6) months from \n     the date of the approval of the withdrawal by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (c) Withdrawal by incumbent. When an election is not held \n     because the incumbent disclaims any representation interest \n     in a unit, a petition by the incumbent seeking an election \n     involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit \n     will not be considered timely if filed within six (6) months \n     of cancellation of the election.\n     Sec. 2422.15  Duty to furnish information and cooperate.\n       (a) Relevant information. After a petition is filed, all \n     parties must, upon request of the Executive Director, furnish \n     the Executive Director and serve all parties affected by \n     issues raised in the petition with information concerning \n     parties, issues, and agreements raised in or affected by the \n     petition.\n       (b) Inclusions and exclusions. After a petition seeking an \n     election is filed, the Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, may direct the employing office or activity to furnish \n     the Executive Director and all parties affected by issues \n     raised in the petition with a current alphabetized list of \n     employees and job classifications included in and/or excluded \n     from the existing or claimed unit affected by issues raised \n     in the petition.\n       (c) Cooperation. All parties are required to cooperate in \n     every aspect of the representation process. This obligation \n     includes cooperating fully with the Executive Director, \n     submitting all required and requested information, and \n     participating in prehearing conferences and pre-election \n     investigatory hearings. The failure to cooperate in the \n     representation process may result in the Executive Director \n     or the Board taking appropriate action, including dismissal \n     of the petition or denial of intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.16  Election agreements or directed elections.\n       (a) Election agreements. Parties are encouraged to enter \n     into election agreements.\n       (b) Executive Director directed election. If the parties \n     are unable to agree on procedural matters, specifically, the \n     eligibility period, method of election, dates, hours, or \n     locations of the election, the Executive Director, on behalf \n     of the Board, will decide election procedures and issue a \n     Direction of Election, without prejudice to the rights of a \n     party to file objections to the procedural conduct of the \n     election.\n       (c) Opportunity for an investigatory hearing. Before \n     directing an election, the Executive Director shall provide \n     affected parties an opportunity for a pre-election \n     investigatory hearing on other than procedural matters.\n       (d) Challenges or objections to a directed election. A \n     Direction of Election issued under this section will be \n     issued without prejudice to the right of a party to file a \n     challenge to the eligibility of any person participating in \n     the election and/or objections to the election.\n     Sec. 2422.17  Notice of pre-election investigatory hearing \n         and prehearing conference.\n       (a) Purpose of notice of an investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, may issue a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing involving any \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (b) Contents. The notice of hearing will advise affected \n     parties about the pre-election investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director will also notify affected parties of the \n     issues raised in the petition and establish a date for the \n     prehearing conference.\n       (c) Prehearing conference. A prehearing conference will be \n     conducted by the Executive Director or her designee, either \n     by meeting or teleconference. All parties must participate in \n     a prehearing conference and be prepared to fully discuss, \n     narrow and resolve the issues set forth in the notification \n     of the prehearing conference.\n       (d) No interlocutory appeal of investigatory hearing \n     determination. The Executive Director's determination of \n     whether to issue a notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing is not appealable to the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.18  Pre-election investigatory hearing procedures.\n       (a) Purpose of a pre-election investigatory hearing. \n     Representation hearings are considered investigatory and not \n     adversarial. The purpose of the hearing is to develop a full \n     and complete record of relevant and material facts.\n       (b) Conduct of hearing. Pre-election investigatory hearings \n     will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the \n     Executive Director or her designee. There is no burden of \n     proof, with the exception of proceedings on objections to \n     elections as provided for in Sec. 2422.27(b). Formal rules of \n     evidence do not apply.\n       (c) Pre-election investigatory hearing. Pre-election \n     investigatory hearings will be conducted by the Executive \n     Director or her designee.\n       (d) Production of evidence. Parties have the obligation to \n     produce existing documents and witnesses for the \n     investigatory hearing in accordance with the instructions of \n     the Executive Director or her designee. If a party willfully \n     fails to comply with such instructions, the Board may draw an \n     inference adverse to that party on the issue related to the \n     evidence sought.\n       (e) Transcript. An official reporter will make the official \n     transcript of the pre-election investigatory hearing. Copies \n     of the official transcript may be examined in the Office \n     during normal working hours. Requests by parties to purchase \n     copies of the official transcript should be made to the \n     official hearing reporter.\n     Sec. 2422.19  Motions.\n       (a) Purpose of a motion. Subsequent to the issuance of a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing in a \n     representation proceeding, a party seeking a ruling, an \n     order, or relief must do so by filing or raising a motion \n     stating the order or relief sought and the\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n     grounds therefor. Challenges and other filings referenced in \n     other sections of this subpart may, in the discretion of the \n     Executive Director or her designee, be treated as a motion.\n       (b) Prehearing motions. Prehearing motions must be filed in \n     writing with the Executive Director. Any response must be \n     filed with the Executive Director within five (5) days after \n     service of the motion. The Executive Director shall rule on \n     the motion.\n       (c) Motions made at the investigatory hearing. During the \n     pre-election investigatory hearing, motions will be made to \n     the Executive Director or her designee, and may be oral on \n     the record, unless otherwise required in this subpart to be \n     in writing. Responses may be oral on the record or in \n     writing, but, absent permission of the Executive Director or \n     her designee, must be provided before the hearing closes. The \n     Executive Director or her designee will rule on motions made \n     at the hearing.\n       (d) Posthearing motions. Motions made after the hearing \n     closes must be filed in writing with the Board. Any response \n     to a posthearing motion must be filed with the Board within \n     five (5) days after service of the motion.\n     Sec. 2422.20  Rights of parties at a pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Rights. A party at a pre-election investigatory hearing \n     will have the right:\n       (1) To appear in person or by a representative;\n       (2) To examine and cross-examine witnesses; and\n       (3) To introduce into the record relevant evidence.\n       (b) Documentary evidence and stipulations. Parties must \n     submit two (2) copies of documentary evidence to the \n     Executive Director or her designee and copies to all other \n     parties. Stipulations of fact between/among the parties may \n     be introduced into evidence.\n       (c) Oral argument. Parties will be entitled to a reasonable \n     period prior to the close of the hearing for oral argument. \n     Presentation of a closing oral argument does not preclude a \n     party from filing a brief under paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n       (d) Briefs. A party will be afforded an opportunity to file \n     a brief with the Board.\n       (1) An original and two (2) copies of a brief must be filed \n     with the Board within thirty (30) days from the close of the \n     hearing.\n       (2) A written request for an extension of time to file a \n     brief must be filed with and received by the Board no later \n     than five (5) days before the date the brief is due.\n       (3) No reply brief may be filed without permission of the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.21  Duties and powers of the Executive Director in \n         the conduct of the pre-election investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Duties. The Executive Director or her designee, on \n     behalf of the Board, will receive evidence and inquire fully \n     into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters \n     that are the subject of the investigatory hearing, and may \n     make recommendations on the record to the Board.\n       (b) Powers. During the period a case is assigned to the \n     Executive Director or her designee for pre-election \n     investigatory hearing and prior to the close of the hearing, \n     the Executive Director or her designee may take any action \n     necessary to schedule, conduct, continue, control, and \n     regulate the pre-election investigatory hearing, including \n     ruling on motions when appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.22  Objections to the conduct of the pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Objections. Objections are oral or written complaints \n     concerning the conduct of a pre-election investigatory \n     hearing.\n       (b) Exceptions to rulings. There are automatic exceptions \n     to all adverse rulings.\n     Sec. 2422.23  Election procedures.\n       (a) Executive Director conducts or supervises election. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will decide to \n     conduct or supervise the election. In supervised elections, \n     employing offices or activities will perform all acts as \n     specified in the Election Agreement or Direction of Election.\n       (b) Notice of election. Prior to the election a notice of \n     election, prepared by the Executive Director, will be posted \n     by the employing office or activity in places where notices \n     to employees are customarily posted and/or distributed in a \n     manner by which notices are normally distributed. The notice \n     of election will contain the details and procedures of the \n     election, including the appropriate unit, the eligibility \n     period, the date(s), hour(s) and location(s) of the election, \n     a sample ballot, and the effect of the vote.\n       (c) Sample ballot. The reproduction of any document \n     purporting to be a copy of the official ballot that suggests \n     either directly or indirectly to employees that the Board \n     endorses a particular choice in the election may constitute \n     grounds for setting aside an election if objections are filed \n     under Sec. 2422.26.\n       (d) Secret ballot. All elections will be by secret ballot.\n       (e) Intervenor withdrawal from ballot. When two or more \n     labor organizations are included as choices in an election, \n     an intervening labor organization may, prior to the approval \n     of an election agreement or before the direction of an \n     election, file a written request with the Executive Director \n     to remove its name from the ballot. If the request is not \n     received prior to the approval of an election agreement or \n     before the direction of an election, unless the parties and \n     the Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, agree \n     otherwise, the intervening labor organization will remain on \n     the ballot. The Executive Director's decision on the request \n     is final and not subject to the filing of an application for \n     review with the Board.\n       (f) Incumbent withdrawal from ballot in an election to \n     decertify an incumbent representative. When there is no \n     intervening labor organization, an election to decertify an \n     incumbent exclusive representative will not be held if the \n     incumbent provides the Executive Director with a written \n     disclaimer of any representation interest in the unit. When \n     there is an intervenor, an election will be held if the \n     intervening labor organization proffers a thirty percent \n     (30%) showing of interest within the time period established \n     by the Executive Director.\n       (g) Petitioner withdraws from ballot in an election. When \n     there is no intervening labor organization, an election will \n     not be held if the petitioner provides the Executive Director \n     with a written request to withdraw the petition. When there \n     is an intervenor, an election will be held if the intervening \n     labor organization proffers a thirty percent (30%) showing of \n     interest within the time period established by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (h) Observers. All parties are entitled to representation \n     at the polling location(s) by observers of their own \n     selection subject to the Executive Director's approval.\n       (1) Parties desiring to name observers must file in writing \n     with the Executive Director a request for specifically named \n     observers at least fifteen (15) days prior to an election. \n     The Executive Director may grant an extension of time for \n     filing a request for specifically named observers for good \n     cause where a party requests such an extension or on the \n     Executive Director's own motion. The request must name and \n     identify the observers requested.\n       (2) An employing office or activity may use as its \n     observers any employees who are not eligible to vote in the \n     election, except:\n       (i) Supervisors or management officials;\n       (ii) Employees who have any official connection with any of \n     the labor organizations involved; or\n       (iii) Non-employees of the legislative branch.\n       (3) A labor organization may use as its observers any \n     employees eligible to vote in the election, except:\n       (i) Employees on leave without pay status who are working \n     for the labor organization involved; or\n       (ii) Employees who hold an elected office in the union.\n       (4) Objections to a request for specific observers must be \n     filed with the Executive Director stating the reasons in \n     support within five (5) days after service of the request.\n       (5) The Executive Director's ruling on requests for and \n     objections to observers is final and binding and is not \n     subject to the filing of an application for review with the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.24  Challenged ballots.\n       (a) Filing challenges. A party or the Executive Director \n     may, for good cause, challenge the eligibility of any person \n     to participate in the election prior to the employee voting.\n       (b) Challenged ballot procedure. An individual whose \n     eligibility to vote is in dispute will be given the \n     opportunity to vote a challenged ballot. If the parties and \n     the Region are unable to resolve the challenged ballot(s) \n     prior to the tally of ballots, the unresolved challenged \n     ballot(s) will be impounded and preserved until a \n     determination can be made, if necessary, by the Executive \n     Director or the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.25  Tally of ballots.\n       (a) Tallying the ballots. When the election is concluded, \n     the Executive Director or her designee will tally the \n     ballots.\n       (b) Service of the tally. When the tally is completed, the \n     Executive Director will serve the tally of ballots on the \n     parties in accordance with the election agreement or \n     direction of election.\n       (c) Valid ballots cast. Representation will be determined \n     by the majority of the valid ballots cast.\n     Sec. 2422.26  Objections to the election.\n       (a) Filing objections to the election. Objections to the \n     procedural conduct of the election or to conduct that may \n     have improperly affected the results of the election may be \n     filed by any party. Objections must be filed and received by \n     the Executive Director within five (5) days after the tally \n     of ballots has been served. Any objections must be timely \n     regardless of whether the challenged ballots are sufficient \n     in number to affect the results of the election. The \n     objections must be supported by clear and concise reasons. An \n     original and two (2) copies of the objections must be \n     received by the Executive Director.\n       (b) Supporting evidence. The objecting party must file with \n     the Executive Director evidence, including signed statements, \n     documents and other materials supporting the objections \n     within ten (10) days after the objections are filed.\n     Sec. 2422.27  Determinative challenged ballots and \n         objections.\n       (a) Investigation. The Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, will investigate objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots that are sufficient in number to affect \n     the results of the election.\n       (b) Burden of proof. A party filing objections to the \n     election bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the \n     evidence concerning those objections. However, no party bears \n     the burden of proof on challenged ballots.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation, the \n     Executive Director will take appropriate action consistent \n     with Sec. 2422.30.\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n       (d) Consolidated hearing on objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots and an unfair labor practice hearing. When \n     appropriate, and in accordance with Sec. 2422.33, objections \n     and/or determinative challenged ballots may be consolidated \n     with an unfair labor practice hearing. Such consolidated \n     hearings will be conducted by a Hearing Officer. Exceptions \n     and related submissions must be filed with the Board and the \n     Board will issue a decision in accordance with Part 2423 of \n     this chapter and section 406 of the CAA, except for the \n     following:\n       (1) Section 2423.18 of this Subchapter concerning the \n     burden of proof is not applicable;\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may not recommend remedial action \n     to be taken or notices to be posted; and,\n       (3) References to ``charge'' and ``complaint'' in Part 2423 \n     of this chapter will be omitted.\n     Sec. 2422.28  Runoff elections.\n       (a) When a runoff may be held. A runoff election is \n     required in an election involving at least three (3) choices, \n     one of which is ``no union'' or ``neither,'' when no choice \n     receives a majority of the valid ballots cast. However, a \n     runoff may not be held until the objections to the election \n     and determinative challenged ballots have been resolved.\n       (b) Eligibility. Employees who were eligible to vote in the \n     original election and who are also eligible on the date of \n     the runoff election may vote in the runoff election.\n       (c) Ballot. The ballot in the runoff election will provide \n     for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest \n     and second largest number of votes in the election.\n     Sec. 2422.29  Inconclusive elections.\n       (a) Inconclusive elections. An inconclusive election is one \n     where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the \n     outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:\n       (1) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one \n     of which is ``no union'' or ``neither'' and the votes are \n     equally divided; or\n       (2) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the \n     choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive \n     a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next \n     highest and same number of votes; or\n       (3) When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two \n     labor organizations and results in the votes being equally \n     divided; or\n       (4) When the Board determines that there have been \n     significant procedural irregularities.\n       (b) Eligibility to vote in a rerun election. A current \n     payroll period will be used to determine eligibility to vote \n     in a rerun election.\n       (c) Ballot. If a determination is made that the election is \n     inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices \n     that appeared on the original ballot.\n       (d) Number of reruns. There will be only one rerun of an \n     inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another \n     inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will indicate a \n     majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice \n     and a certification of results will be issued. If necessary, \n     a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.\n     Sec. 2422.30  Executive Director investigations, notices of \n         pre-election investigatory hearings, and actions; Board \n         Decisions and Orders.\n       (a) Executive Director investigation. The Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will make such \n     investigation of the petition and any other matter as the \n     Executive Director deems necessary.\n       (b) Executive Director notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing. On behalf of the Board, the Executive Director will \n     issue a notice of pre-election investigatory hearing to \n     inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact \n     exists, where there is an issue as to whether a question \n     concerning representation exists, and any time there is \n     reasonable cause to believe a question exists regarding unit \n     appropriateness.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation and/or \n     hearing, when a pre-election investigatory hearing has been \n     ordered, the Executive Director may, on behalf of the Board, \n     approve an election agreement, dismiss a petition or deny \n     intervention where there is an inadequate or invalid showing \n     of interest, or dismiss a petition where there is an \n     undisputed bar to further processing of the petition under \n     law, rule or regulation.\n       (d) Appeal of Executive Director action. A party may file \n     with the Board an application for review of an Executive \n     Director action taken pursuant to section (c) above.\n       (e) Contents of the Record. When no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing has been conducted all material \n     submitted to and considered by the Executive Director during \n     the investigation becomes a part of the record. When a pre-\n     election investigatory hearing has been conducted, the \n     transcript and all material entered into evidence, including \n     any posthearing briefs, become a part of the record.\n       (f) Transfer of record to Board; Board Decisions and \n     Orders. In cases that are submitted to the Board for decision \n     in the first instance, the Board shall decide the issues \n     presented based upon the record developed by the Executive \n     Director, including the transcript of the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing, if any, documents admitted into the \n     record and briefs and other approved submissions from the \n     parties. The Board may direct that a secret ballot election \n     be held, issue an order dismissing the petition, or make such \n     other disposition of the matter as it deems appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.31  Application for review of an Executive Director \n         action.\n       (a) Filing an application for review. A party must file an \n     application for review with the Board within sixty (60) days \n     of the Executive Director's action. The sixty (60) day time \n     limit provided for in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f), as applied by the \n     CAA, may not be extended or waived.\n       (b) Contents. An application for review must be sufficient \n     to enable the Board to rule on the application without \n     recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its \n     discretion, examine the record in evaluating the application. \n     An application must specify the matters and rulings to which \n     exception(s) is taken, include a summary of evidence relating \n     to any issue raised in the application, and make specific \n     reference to page citations in the transcript if a hearing \n     was held. An application may not raise any issue or rely on \n     any facts not timely presented to the Executive Director.\n       (c) Review. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an \n     application for review when the application demonstrates that \n     review is warranted on one or more of the following grounds:\n       (1) The decision raises an issue for which there is an \n     absence of precedent;\n       (2) Established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or,\n       (3) There is a genuine issue over whether the Executive \n     Director has:\n       (i) Failed to apply established law;\n       (ii) Committed a prejudicial procedural error;\n       (iii) Committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a \n     substantial factual matter.\n       (d) Opposition. A party may file with the Board an \n     opposition to an application for review within ten (10) days \n     after the party is served with the application. A copy must \n     be served on the Executive Director and all other parties and \n     a statement of service must be filed with the Board.\n       (e) Executive Director action becomes the Board's action. \n     An action of the Executive Director becomes the action of the \n     Board when:\n       (1) No application for review is filed with the Board \n     within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive \n     Director's action; or\n       (2) A timely application for review is filed with the Board \n     and the Board does not undertake to grant review of the \n     Executive Director's action within sixty (60) days of the \n     filing of the application; or\n       (3) The Board denies an application for review of the \n     Executive Director's action.\n       (f) Board grant of review and stay. The Board may rule on \n     the issue(s) in an application for review in its order \n     granting the application for review. Neither filing nor \n     granting an application for review shall stay any action \n     ordered by the Executive Director unless specifically ordered \n     by the Board.\n       (g) Briefs if review is granted. If the Board does not rule \n     on the issue(s) in the application for review in its order \n     granting review, the Board may, in its discretion, afford the \n     parties an opportunity to file briefs. The briefs will be \n     limited to the issue(s) referenced in the Board's order \n     granting review.\n     Sec. 2422.32  Certifications and revocations.\n       (a) Certifications. The Executive Director, on behalf of \n     the Board, will issue an appropriate certification when:\n       (1) After an election, runoff, or rerun,\n       (i) No objections are filed or challenged ballots are not \n     determinative, or\n       (ii) Objections and determinative challenged ballots are \n     decided and resolved; or\n       (2) The Executive Director takes an action requiring a \n     certification and that action becomes the action of the Board \n     under Sec. 2422.31(e) or the Board otherwise directs the \n     issuance of a certification.\n       (b) Revocations. Without prejudice to any rights and \n     obligations which may exist under the CAA, the Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will revoke a recognition \n     or certification, as appropriate, and provide a written \n     statement of reasons when an incumbent exclusive \n     representative files, during a representation proceeding, a \n     disclaimer of any representational interest in the unit.\n     Sec. 2422.33  Relief obtainable under Part 2423.\n       Remedial relief that was or could have been obtained as a \n     result of a motion, objection, or challenge filed or raised \n     under this subpart, may not be the basis for similar relief \n     if filed or raised as an unfair labor practice under Part \n     2423 of this Chapter: provided, however, that related matters \n     may be consolidated for hearing as noted in Sec. 2422.27(d) \n     of this subpart.\n     Sec. 2422.34  Rights and obligations during the pendency of \n         representation proceedings.\n       (a) Existing recognitions, agreements, and obligations \n     under the CAA. During the pendency of any representation \n     proceeding, parties are obligated to maintain existing \n     recognitions, adhere to the terms and conditions of existing \n     collective bargaining agreements, and fulfill all other \n     representational and bargaining responsibilities under the \n     CAA.\n       (b) Unit status of individual employees. Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (a) of this section and except as otherwise \n     prohibited by law, a party may take action based on its \n     position regarding the bargaining unit status of individual \n     employees, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(2), 7112 (b) and (c), \n     as applied by the CAA: provided, however, that its actions \n     may be challenged, reviewed, and remedied where appropriate.\n\n\n              PART 2423 UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDINGS\n\n     Sec.\n     2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n     2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n     2423.3  Who may file charges.\n     2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n     2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or \n         the negotiability procedure.\n     2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n     2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n     2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n     2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n     2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n     2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n     2423.12  Filing and contents of the complaint.\n     2423.13  Answer to the complaint.\n     2423.14  Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing.\n     2423.15  Intervention.\n     2423.16  [Reserved]\n     2423.17  [Reserved]\n     2423.18  Burden of proof before the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.19  Duties and powers of the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.20  [Reserved]\n     2423.21  [Reserved]\n     2423.22  [Reserved]\n     2423.23  [Reserved]\n     2423.24  [Reserved]\n     2423.25  [Reserved]\n     2423.26  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n         Office.\n     2423.27  Appeal to the Board.\n     2423.28  [Reserved]\n     2423.29  Action by the Board.\n     2423.30  Compliance with decisions and orders of the Board.\n     2423.31  Backpay proceedings.\n     Sec. 2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n       This part is applicable to any charge of alleged unfair \n     labor practices occurring on or after October 1, 1996.\n     Sec. 2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n       (a) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of \n     all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be \n     the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage \n     all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons \n     against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good \n     faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of \n     unfair labor practice charges.\n       (b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph \n     (a) of this section, and noting the 180 day period of \n     limitation set forth in section 220(c)(2) of the CAA, it \n     shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to \n     encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice \n     allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to \n     the filing of a complaint by the General Counsel.\n       (c) In order to afford the parties an opportunity to \n     implement the policy referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of \n     this section, the investigation of an unfair labor practice \n     charge by the General Counsel will normally not commence \n     until the parties have been afforded a reasonable amount of \n     time, not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the filing of the \n     charge, during which period the parties are urged to attempt \n     to informally resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n     Sec. 2423.3  Who may file charges.\n       An employing office, employing activity, or labor \n     organization may be charged by any person with having engaged \n     in or engaging in any unfair labor practice prohibited under \n     5 U.S.C. 7116, as applied by the CAA.\n     Sec. 2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n       (a) A charge alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. 7116, as \n     applied by the CAA, shall be submitted on forms prescribed by \n     the General Counsel and shall contain the following:\n       (1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) \n     making the charge;\n       (2) The name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office or activity, or labor organization against whom the \n     charge is made;\n       (3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting \n     the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the \n     section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 71 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code made applicable by the CAA alleged to have \n     been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the \n     particular acts; and\n       (4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving \n     the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, \n     including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) \n     has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has \n     been referred to the Board under Part 2471 of these \n     regulations, or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \n     Service, or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by \n     the charging party in a petition pending before the Board \n     pursuant to Part 2424 of this subchapter.\n       (b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall \n     contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under \n     the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its \n     contents are true and correct to the best of that person's \n     knowledge and belief.\n       (c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit \n     to the General Counsel any supporting evidence and documents.\n     Sec. 2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability \n     issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part \n     2424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same \n     negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which \n     solely involve an employing office's allegation that the duty \n     to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter \n     proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or \n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be \n     filed under part 2424 of this subchapter.\n     Sec. 2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n       (a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together \n     with one copy for each additional charged party named shall \n     be filed with the General Counsel.\n       (b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall \n     be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge \n     (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the \n     person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a \n     written statement of such service with the General Counsel. \n     The General Counsel will, as a matter of course, cause a copy \n     of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the \n     charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume \n     responsibility for such service.\n       (c) A charge will be deemed to be filed when it is received \n     by the General Counsel in accordance with the requirements in \n     paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. 2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall conduct such investigation of \n     the charge as the General Counsel deems necessary. Consistent \n     with the policy set forth in Sec. 2423.2, the investigation \n     will normally not commence until the parties have been \n     afforded a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed fifteen \n     (15) days from the filing of the charge, to informally \n     resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n       (b) During the course of the investigation all parties \n     involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence \n     and views to the General Counsel.\n       (c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all \n     persons are expected to cooperate fully with the General \n     Counsel.\n       (d) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all \n     parties involved and the voluntary submission of all \n     potentially relevant information from all potential sources \n     during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall \n     be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect \n     the identity of individuals and the substance of the \n     statements and information they submit or which is obtained \n     during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's \n     and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all \n     relevant information.\n     Sec. 2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n       Prior to the issuance of a complaint, the charging party \n     may amend the charge in accordance with the requirements set \n     forth in Sec. 2423.6.\n     Sec. 2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall take action which may consist \n     of the following, as appropriate:\n       (1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;\n       (2) Refuse to file a complaint;\n       (3) Approve a written settlement and recommend that the \n     Executive Director approve a written settlement agreement in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 414 of the CAA;\n       (4) File a complaint;\n       (5) Upon agreement of all parties, transfer to the Board \n     for decision, after filing of a complaint, a stipulation of \n     facts in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2429.1(a) of \n     this subchapter; or\n       (6) Withdraw a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n       (a) If the General Counsel determines that the charge has \n     not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an \n     unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the \n     General Counsel may request the charging party to withdraw \n     the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a \n     reasonable time, decline to file a complaint.\n       (b) The charging party may not obtain a review of the \n     General Counsel's decision not to file a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n       (a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where \n     time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest \n     permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to \n     submit to the Executive Director or General Counsel, as \n     appropriate, for consideration, all facts and arguments \n     concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.\n\n                        Precomplaint settlements\n\n       (b) (1) Prior to the filing of any complaint or the taking \n     of other formal action, the General Counsel will afford the \n     charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time \n     in which to enter into a settlement\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n     agreement to be submitted to and approved by the General \n     Counsel and the Executive Director. Upon approval by the \n     General Counsel and Executive Director and compliance with \n     the terms of the settlement agreement, no further action \n     shall be taken in the case. If the respondent fails to \n     perform its obligations under the settlement agreement, the \n     General Counsel may determine to institute further \n     proceedings.\n       (2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses \n     to become a party to a settlement agreement offered by the \n     respondent, if the General Counsel concludes that the offered \n     settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as \n     applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel and the latter shall \n     decline to file a complaint.\n\n                    Post complaint settlement policy\n\n       (c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) \n     of this section, even after the filing of a complaint, the \n     Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may \n     be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. \n     The parties may, as part of the settlement, agree to waive \n     their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may \n     issue an order requiring the respondent to take action \n     appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily such a \n     settlement agreement will also contain the respondent's \n     consent to the Board's application for the entry of a decree \n     by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     enforcing the Board's order.\n\n                 Post complaint prehearing settlements\n\n       (d) (1) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging \n     party and the respondent enter into a settlement agreement, \n     and such agreement is accepted by the General Counsel, the \n     settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Executive \n     Director for approval.\n       (2) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging party \n     fails or refuses to become a party to a settlement agreement \n     offered by the respondent, and the General Counsel concludes \n     that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of \n     chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be \n     between the respondent and the General Counsel. The charging \n     party will be so informed and provided a brief written \n     statement by the General Counsel of the reasons therefor.

The exclusive representative shall request \n     such allegation in writing and the employing office shall \n     make the allegation in writing and serve a copy on the \n     exclusive representative: provided, however, that review of a \n     negotiability issue may be requested by an exclusive \n     representative under this subpart without a prior written \n     allegation by the employing office if the employing office \n     has not served such allegation upon the exclusive \n     representative within ten (10) days after the date of the \n     receipt by any employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations of a written request for such allegation.\n     Sec. 2424.4  Content of petition; service.\n       (a) A petition for review shall be dated and shall contain \n     the following:\n       (1) A statement setting forth the express language of the \n     proposal sought to be negotiated as submitted to the \n     employing office;\n       (2) An explicit statement of the meaning attributed to the \n     proposal by the exclusive representative including:\n       (i) Explanation of terms of art, acronyms, technical \n     language, or any other aspect of the language of the proposal \n     which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Where the proposal is concerned with a particular work \n     situation, or other particular circumstances, a description \n     of the situation or circumstances which will enable the Board \n     to understand the context in which the proposal is intended \n     to apply;\n       (3) A copy of all pertinent material, including the \n     employing office's allegation in writing that the matter, as \n     proposed, is not within the duty to bargain in good faith, \n     and other relevant documentary material; and\n       (4) Notification by the petitioning labor organization \n     whether the negotiability issue is also involved in an unfair \n     labor practice charge filed by such labor organization under \n     part 2423 of this subchapter and pending before the General \n     Counsel.\n       (b) A copy of the petition including all attachments \n     thereto shall be served on the employing office head and on \n     the principal employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations.\n       (c)(1) Filing an incomplete petition for review will result \n     in the exclusive representative being asked to provide the \n     missing or incomplete information. Noncompliance with a \n     request to complete the record may result in dismissal of the \n     petition.\n       (2) The processing priority accorded to an incomplete \n     petition, relative to other pending negotiability appeals, \n     will be based upon the date when the petition is completed--\n     not the date it was originally filed.\n     Sec. 2424.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter which \n     involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization \n     also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the \n     same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which \n     solely involve an employing office's allegation that the duty \n     to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter \n     proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or \n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be \n     filed under this part.\n     Sec. 2424.6  Position of the employing office; time limits \n         for filing; service.\n       (a) Within thirty (30) days after the date of the receipt \n     by the head of an employing office of a copy of a petition \n     for review of a negotiability issue the employing office \n     shall file a statement--\n       (1) Withdrawing the allegation that the duty to bargain in \n     good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be \n     negotiated; or\n       (2) Setting forth in full its position on any matters \n     relevant to the petition which it wishes the Board to \n     consider in reaching its decision, including a full and \n     detailed statement of its reasons supporting the allegation. \n     The statement shall cite the section of any law, rule or \n     regulation relied upon as a basis for the allegation and \n     shall contain a copy of any internal employing office rule or \n     regulation so relied upon. The statement shall include:\n       (i) Explanation of the meaning the employing office \n     attributes to the proposal as a whole, including any terms of \n     art, acronyms, technical language or any other aspect of the \n     language of the proposal which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Description of a particular work situation, or other \n     particular circumstance the employing office views the \n     proposal to concern, which will enable the Board to \n     understand the context in which the proposal is considered to \n     apply by the employing office.\n       (b) A copy of the employing office's statement of position, \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     exclusive representative.\n     Sec. 2424.7  Response of the exclusive representative; time \n         limits for filing; service.\n       (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of the receipt \n     by an exclusive representative of a copy of an employing \n     office's statement of position the exclusive representative \n     shall file a full and detailed response stating its position \n     and reasons for:\n       (1) Disagreeing with the employing office's allegation that \n     the matter, as proposed to be negotiated, is inconsistent \n     with any Federal law or Government-wide rule or regulation; \n     or\n       (2) Alleging that the employing office's rules or \n     regulations violate applicable law, or rule or regulation or \n     appropriate authority outside the employing office; that the \n     rules or regulations were not issued by the employing office \n     or by any primary national subdivision of the employing \n     office, or otherwise are not applicable to bar negotiations \n     under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA; or that no \n     compelling need exists for the rules or regulations to bar \n     negotiations.\n       (b) The response shall cite the particular section of any \n     law, rule or regulation alleged to be violated by the \n     employing office's rules or regulations; or shall explain the \n     grounds for contending the employing office rules or \n     regulations are not applicable to bar negotiations under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA, or fail to meet the \n     criteria established in subpart B of this part, or were not \n     issued at the employing office headquarters level or at the \n     level of a primary national subdivision.\n       (c) A copy of the response of the exclusive representative \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     employing office head and on the employing office's \n     representative of record in the proceeding before the Board.\n     Sec. 2424.8  Additional submissions to the Board.\n       The Board will not consider any submission filed by any \n     party, whether supplemental or responsive in nature, other \n     than those authorized under Sec. 2424.2 through 2424.7 unless \n     such submission is requested by the Board; or unless, upon \n     written request by any party, a copy of which is served on \n     all other parties, the Board in its discretion grants \n     permission to file such submission.\n     Sec. 2424.9  Hearing.\n       A hearing may be held, in the discretion of the Board, \n     before a determination is made under 5 U.S.C. 7117(b) or (c), \n     as applied by the CAA. If a hearing is held, it shall be \n     expedited to the extent practicable and shall not include the \n     General Counsel as a party.\n     Sec. 2424.10  Board decision and order; compliance.\n       (a) Subject to the requirements of this subpart the Board \n     shall expedite proceedings under this part to the extent \n     practicable and shall issue to the exclusive representative \n     and to the employing office a written decision on the \n     allegation and specific reasons therefor at the earliest \n     practicable date.\n       (b) If the Board finds that the duty to bargain extends to \n     the matter proposed to be bargained, the decision of the \n     Board shall include an order that the employing office shall \n     upon request (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties) \n     bargain concerning such matter. If the Board finds that the \n     duty to bargain does not extend to the matter proposed to be \n     negotiated, the Board shall so state\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\n     and issue an order dismissing the petition for review of the \n     negotiability issue. If the Board finds that the duty to \n     bargain extends to the matter proposed to be bargained only \n     at the election of the employing office, the Board shall so \n     state and issue an order dismissing the petition for review \n     of the negotiability issue.\n       (c) When an order is issued as provided in paragraph (b) of \n     this section, the employing office or exclusive \n     representative shall report to the Executive Director within \n     a specified period failure to comply with an order that the \n     employing office shall upon request (or as otherwise agreed \n     to by the parties) bargain concerning the disputed matter.\n\n   Subpart B--Criteria for Determining Compelling Need for Employing \n                      Office Rules and Regulations\n\n     Sec. 2424.11  Illustrative criteria.\n        A compelling need exists for an employing office rule or \n     regulation concerning any condition of employment when the \n     employing office demonstrates that the rule or regulation \n     meets one or more of the following illustrative criteria:\n       (a) The rule or regulation is essential, as distinguished \n     from helpful or desirable, to the accomplishment of the \n     mission or the execution of functions of the employing office \n     or primary national subdivision in a manner which is \n     consistent with the requirements of an effective and \n     efficient government.\n       (b) The rule or regulation is necessary to insure the \n     maintenance of basic merit principles.\n       (c) The rule or regulation implements a mandate to the \n     employing office or primary national subdivision under law or \n     other outside authority, which implementation is essentially \n     nondiscretionary in nature.\n\n\n                PART 2425--REVIEW OF ARBITRATION AWARDS\n\n     Sec.\n     2425.1  Who may file an exception;

Mr. President, as we reach the final days of the 104th \nCongress, an urgent environmental problem remains unresolved. However, \nunlike many issues, fortunately the question of how to deal with this \nNation's high-level nuclear waste has an answer that is responsible, \nfair, environmentally friendly and supported by members of both \nparties.\n  Today, high level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear \nfuel is accumulating at more than 80 sites in 41 States. Each year, as \nthat increases, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at \neach of these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. The only \nresponsible choice is to support legislation that solves this problem \nby safely moving this used fuel to a safe, monitored facility in the \nremote Nevada desert. This answer will lead us to a safer future for \nall Americans.\n  To facilitate our consideration of such legislation, yesterday I, \nalong with Senator Murkowski, introduced S. 1936, a bill to amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and it was placed on the calendar. S. \n1936 retains the fundamental goals and structure of the substitute for \nS. 1271 that was reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee last March.\n  However, S. 1936 contains many important clarifications and changes \nthat deal with concerns raised regarding the details of that \nlegislation by Members of this body. In addition, we took into account \nthe provisions of H.R. 1020, which was reported out of the House \nCommerce Committee on an overwhelming bipartisan vote last year. We \nadopted much of the language found in H.R. 1020 in order to make the \nbill as similar to the bill under consideration in the House as \npossible.\n  I would like to describe some of the most significant of these \nchanges. S.\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n1936 eliminates certain provisions contained in S. 1271 that would have \nlimited the application of the National Environmental Policy Act to the \nintermodal transfer facility and imposed a general limitation on NEPA's \napplication to the Secretary's actions to only those NEPA requirements \nspecified in the bill. This was to allay the concern that sufficient \nenvironmental analysis would not be done under S. 1271.\n  S. 1936 clarifies that transportation of spent fuel shall be governed \nby all requirements of Federal, State, and local governments and Indian \ntribes to the same extent that any person engaging in transportation in \ninterstate commerce must comply with those requirements. S. 1936 also \nallows that the Secretary provide technical assistance and funds for \ntraining to Unions with experience in safety training for \ntransportation workers. In addition, S. 1936 clarifies that existing \nemployee protections in title 49, United States Code in connection with \nrefusal to work in hazardous conditions apply to transportation under \nthis act. It also provides that certain inspection activities will be \ncarried out by carmen and operating crews only if they are adequately \ntrained. Finally, S. 1936 provides authority for the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish training standards, as necessary, for \nworkers engaged in the transportation, storage and disposal of spent \nfuel and high-level waste.\n\n  In order to ensure that the size and scope of the interim storage \nfacility is manageable in the context of the overall nuclear waste \nprogram, and yet adequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel \nstorage needs, S. 1936 would limit the size of phase I of the interim \nstorage facility to 15,000 metric tons of spent fuel, and the size of \nphase II of the facility to 40,000 metric tons. Phase II of the \nfacility would be expandable to 60,000 metric tons if the Secretary \nfails to meet her projected goals with regard to site characterization \nand licensing of the permanent repository site. In contrast, S. 1271 \nprovided for storage of 20,000 metric tons of spent fuel in phase I and \n100,000 metric tons in phase II.\n  Unlike S. 1271, which provided for unlimited use of existing \nfacilities at the Nevada Test Site for handling spent fuel at the \ninterim facility, S. 1936 allows only the use of those facilities for \nemergency situations during phase I of the interim facility. These \nfacilities should not be needed during phase I and construction of new \nfacilities will be overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for \nany fuel handling during phase II of the interim facility.\n  S. 1271 would have set the standard for releases of radioactivity \nfrom the repository at a maximum annual dose to an average member of \nthe general population in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain at 100 \nmillirem.\n  The 100 millirem standard is fully consistent with current national \nand international standards designed to protect public health and \nsafety and the environment. While maintaining an initial 100 millirem \nstandard, S. 1936 would allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \napply another standard if it finds that the standard in the legislation \nwould pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the public.\n  S. 1936 contains provisions not found in S. 1271 that would grant \nfinancial and technical assistance for oversight activities and \npayments in lieu of taxes to affected units of local government and \nIndian tribes within the State of Nevada. S. 1936 also contains new \nprovisions transferring certain Bureau of Land Management parcels to \nNye County, NV.\n  In order to ensure that monies collected for the Nuclear Waste Fund \nare utilized for purposes of the Nuclear Waste Program, beginning in \nfiscal year 2003, S. 1936 would convert the current Nuclear Waste Fee \nthat is paid by electricity consumers into a user fee that is assessed \nbased upon the level of appropriations for the year in which the fee is \ncollected.\n  Section 408 of S. 1271 provided authority for the Secretary to \nexecute emergency relief contracts with certain eligible utilities that \nwould provide for qualified entities to ship, store, and condition \nspent nuclear fuel. This provision concerned some who feared it could \nbe interpreted to provide new authority for reprocessing in this \ncountry or abroad. This provision is not contained in S. 1936.\n  S. 1271 contained a provision that stated the actions authorized by \nthe bill would be governed only by the requirements of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, the Atomic Energy Act and the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act. S. 1936 eliminates this provision and instead \nprovides that, if any law is inconsistent with the provisions of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act and the Atomic Energy Act, those acts will \ngovern. S. 1936 further provides that any requirement of a State or \nlocal government is preempted only if complying with the State or local \nrequirement and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is impossible, or if the \nrequirement is an obstacle to carrying out the act. This language is \nconsistent with the preemption authority found in the existing \nHazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n  S. 1936 authorizes the Secretary to take title to the fuel at the \nDairyland Power Cooperative's La Crosse reactor, and authorizes the \nSecretary to pay for the on-site storage of the fuel until DOE removes \nthe fuel from the site under terms of the act.\n  S. 1936 contains language making a number of changes designed to \nimprove the management of the nuclear waste program to ensure the \nprogram is operated, to the maximum extent possible, in like manner to \na private business.\n  Finally, although we had not reached a final agreement with Senator \nJohnston on language regarding the schedule and conditions for the \nbeginning of construction on the interim facility at the time S. 1936 \nwas filed, the bill contains new language that was drafted in an \nattempt to address Senator Johnston's concerns. The language in S. 1936 \nprovides that construction shall not begin on an interim storage \nfacility at Yucca Mountain before December 31, 1998.\n  The bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability \nof the Yucca Mountain site to the President and Congress by the \nSecretary of Energy 6 months before the construction can begin on the \ninterim facility. If, based upon the information before him, the \nPresident determines, in his discretion, that Yucca Mountain is not \nsuitable for development as a repository, then the Secretary shall \ncease work on both the interim and permanent repository programs at the \nYucca Mountain site. The bill further provides that, if the President \nmakes such a determination, he shall have 18 months to designate an \ninterim storage facility site. If the President fails to designate a \nsite, or if a site he has designated has not been approved by Congress \nwithin 2 years of his determination, the Secretary is instructed to \nconstruct an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain Site.\n\n  This provision ensures that the construction of an interim storage \nfacility at the Yucca Mountain site will not occur before the President \nand Congress have had an ample opportunity to review the technical \nassessment of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a \npermanent repository and to designate an alternative site for interim \nstorage based upon that technical information. However, this provision \nalso ensures that, ultimately, an interim storage facility site will be \nchosen. Without this assurance, we leave open the possibility we will \nfind in 1998 we have no interim storage, no permanent repository \nprogram, and--after more than 15 years and $6 billion spent--that we \nare back to where we started in 1982 when we passed the first version \nof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act .\n  This issue provides a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have \none, remote, safe and secure nuclear waste storage facility. Or, \nthrough inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have \n80 such sites spread across the Nation. It is irresponsible to shirk \nour responsibility to protect the environment and the future for our \nchildren and grandchildren. This Nation needs to confront its nuclear \nwaste problem now. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and support \nthe passage of S. 1936.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7667-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7668-S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PACTA SUNT SERVANDA\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, Israeli Prime Minister Bingamin \nNetanyahu delivered an important address to Congress in which he \noutlined his vision of continued close ties between our two democracies\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nand of the peace process between Israel and her neighbors. A process \nwith which we have been so closely involved.\n  His address had many important elements, none more so than when he \ndeviated from his prepared statement to pronounce the ancient Roman \nmaxim: Pacta sunt servanda--agreements must be honored. It should not \ncome as a surprise that the disciple of the disciple of Vladimir \nJabotinsky speaks of the importance of international law when \naddressing the U.S. Congress.\n  Jabotinsky found the Revisionist party--the forerunner of the present \nLikud party--in 1925 which had as its goal the establishment of a \nJewish state in Palestine under the protection of international law. \nWhen Prime Minister Netanyahu asserts that agreements must be honored, \nhe aligns himself with a principle that was of vital importance in \ninternational affairs at the beginning of this century but which \nsuffered neglect during the cold war.\n  From its earliest days the leaders of the Soviet Union had asserted, \nin the words of Maxim Litvinov, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, \nin 1922 that ``there was not one world but two--a Soviet world and a \nnon-Soviet world * * * there was no third world to arbitrate. * * *'' \nWhich is to say there was no common law against which to measure \nconduct.\n  This was the Soviet view until Mikhail Gorbachev came before the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations on December 7, 1988, to remind \nthe General Assembly of the political, juridical and moral importance \nof Pacta sunt servanda. Mr. Gorbachev went on:\n\n       While championing demilitarization of international \n     relations, we would like political and legal methods to reign \n     supreme in all attempts to solve the arising problems.\n       Our ideal is a world community of states with political \n     systems and foreign policies based on law.\n       This could be achieved with the help of an accord within \n     the framework of the U.N. on a uniform understanding of the \n     principles and norms of international law; their codification \n     with new conditions taken into consideration; and the \n     elaboration of legislation for new areas of cooperation.\n       In the nuclear era, the effectiveness of international law \n     must be based on norms reflecting a balance of interests of \n     states, rather than on coercion.\n       As the awareness of our common fate grows, every state \n     would be genuinely interested in confining itself within the \n     limits of international law.\n\n  The chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet had come to New \nYork and offered terms of surrender. Gorbachev knew what it meant for \nthe Soviets to assert that they would be bound by norms of \ninternational law. Quite simply, official Washington did not, for it no \nlonger actively felt that the United States was bound by such norms. \nPassively, yes; if pressed. But this was not something we pressed on \nothers in general or thought much about. I wrote:\n\n       In the annals of forgetfulness there is nothing quite to \n     compare with the fading from the American mind of the idea of \n     the law of nations. In the beginning this law was set forth \n     as the foundation of our national existence. By all means \n     wash this proposition with cynical acid and see how it \n     shrinks.\n\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu has raised the possibility that we may one \nday close that chapter in the annals of forgetfulness. I hope that my \ncolleagues and those in the administration have taken note.\n  Mr. Netanyahu stresses that the peace agreements that Israel has made \nwith her neighbors will be followed and that future agreements will be \nbased on law. As he stated, ``we seek to broaden the circle of peace to \nthe whole Arab world and the rest of the Middle East.''\n  This is an important day for both our countries. I congratulate Mr. \nNetanyahu for his address and wish him well as he embarks on his term \nas Prime Minister.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7668-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 159\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public \nLaw 101-246) (``the Act''), and as President of the United States, I \nhereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of \nthe United States to terminate the suspensions under section 902(a) of \nthe Act with respect to the issuance of licenses for defense article \nexports to the People's Republic of China and the export of U.S.-origin \nsatellites, insofar as such restrictions pertain to the Globalstar \nsatellite project.

A bill to allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for \nbreast-cancer research through the voluntary purchase of certain \nspecially issued United States postage stamps; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE BREAST CANCER RESEARCH STAMP ACT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Boxer, \nMoseley-Braun, and Snowe would like to introduce the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp Act.\n  In a time of shrinking budgets and resources for breast cancer \nresearch, this legislation would provide an innovative way to provide \nadditional funding for breast cancer research.\n  This bill would: authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue an \noptional special first class stamp to be priced at 1 cent above the \ncost of normal first-class postage; earmark a penny of every stamp for \nbreast cancer research; provide administrative costs from the revenues \nfor post office expenses; and clarify current law, that any similar \nstamp would require an act of Congress to be issued in the future.\n  If only 10 percent of all the first class mail used this optional 33 \ncent stamp, $60 million could be raised for breast cancer research \nannually.\n  There is wide support for this legislation. Congressman Fazio, along \nwith 62 cosponsors have already introduced the companion bill in the \nHouse.\n  The breast cancer epidemic has been called this Nation's best kept \nsecret. There are 2.6 million women in America today with breast \ncancer, 1 million of whom have yet to be diagnosed with the disease.\n  In 1996, an estimated 184,000 will be diagnosed with, and 44,300 will \ndie from, breast cancer. It is the No. 1 killer of women ages 40 to 44 \nand the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 15 to 54, claiming \na woman's life every 12 minutes in this country.\n  For California, 17,100 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and \n4,100 women will die from the disease in 1996.\n  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of \ntreatment of beast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 \nbillion. This means the average American woman will have $5,000 added \nto her health care costs because of the disease.\n  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent \nover $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast \ncancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer \nresearch have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today. \nThat is the good news.\n  But, the bad news is that the national commitment to cancer research \noverall has been hamstrung since 1980. Currently, NIH is able to fund \nonly 23 percent of applications received by all the institutes. For the \nCancer Institute, only 23 percent can be funded--significant drop from \nthe 60 percent of applications funded in the 1970's.\n  Most alarming is the rapidly diminishing grant funding available for \nnew researcher applicants.\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\n  In real numbers, the National Cancer Institute will fund \napproximately 3,600 research projects, of which about 1,000 are new, \npreviously unfunded activities. For investigator-initiated research, \nonly 600 out of 1,900 research projects will be new.\n  The United States is privileged to have some of the most talented \nscientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world \nsuch as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and the M.D. \nAnderson.\n  This lack of funding is starving some of the most important \nresearch--because scientists will have to look elsewhere for their \nlivelihood.\n  The United States must reverse the trend of diminishing research \nfunds if these scientists and institutions are to continue to \ncontribute their vast talents to the war on cancer and finding a cure.\n  What is clear is that there is a direct correlation between increases \nin research funding and the likelihood of finding a cure.\n  Cancer mortality has declined by 15 percent from 1950 to 1992 due to \nincreases in cancer research funding. In fact, federally funded cancer \nresearch has yielded vast amounts of knowledge about the disease--\ninformation which is guiding our efforts to improve treatment and \nsearch for a cure. We have more knowledge and improvements in \nprevention through: identification of a cancer gene, use of \nmammographies, clinical exams, and encouragement of self breast exams. \nYet there is still no cure.\n  The Bay Area has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence \nand mortality in the world. According to data given to my staff by the \nNorthern California Cancer Center, Bay Area white women have the \nhighest reported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 \npopulation. Bay Area African-American women have the fourth highest \nreported rate in the world at 82 per 100,000.\n  I want to recognize Dr. Balazs (Ernie) Bodai who suggested this \ninnovative funding approach. Dr. Bodai is the chief of the surgery \ndepartment at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Sacramento, CA. He \nis the founder of Cure Cancer Now, which is a nonprofit organization \ncommitted to developing a funding source for breast cancer research.\n  As you know, last week the Postal Service introduced their breast \ncancer awareness stamp. Although the issuance of the awareness stamp \nwas an important step toward educating the public about the disease, \nthe Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act is a new and different effort in \nthat it would actually raise funds for the NIH research on breast \ncancer, and if the stamps were purchased and not used, the postal \nservice would still make money.\n  This legislation is also supported by the American Cancer Society, \nAssociation of Operating Room Nurses, California Health Collaborative \nFoundations, YWCA-Encore Plus, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor \nJoe Serna, Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors, Sutter County Board of \nSupervisors, Nevada County Board of Supervisors, Yuba City Council, \nCalifornia State Senator Diane Watson and California State \nAssemblywoman Dede Alpert as well as the Public Employees Union, San \nJoaquin Public Employees Association, and Sutter and Yuba County \nEmployees Association.\n  Given the intense competition for Federal research funds in a climate \nof shrinking budgets, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act would allow \nanyone who uses the postal service to contribute in finding a cure for \nthe breast cancer epidemic.\n  In a sense, this particular proposal is a pilot. I recognize that the \npostal service may oppose this since it has not been done before. I \nalso recognize that in a day of diminishing Federal resources, this \ninnovation is an idea whose time has come.\n  It will make money for the post office and for breast cancer \nresearch. No one is forced to buy it, but women's organizations may \neven wish to sell the stamps in a fundraising effort.\n  The administrative costs can be handled with the 1 cent added on the \n32 cent stamp and conservatively it can make from $60 million per year \nfor NIH's research on breast cancer.\n  We need to find a cure for breast cancer and I believe the Breast \nCancer Research Stamp Act is an innovative response to the hidden \nepidemic among women. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1938. A bill to enact the model Good Samaritan Act Food Donation \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n           THE BILL EMERSON GOOD SAMARITAN FOOD DONATION ACT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I pay tribute to my good friend and \ncolleague from Missouri, Congressman Bill Emerson, who represented \nsoutheast Missouri's Eighth Congressional District for 16 years. Bill \nEmerson was well known in this body, and certainly to many around this \ncity, and was loved by the people of southeast Missouri. He had a long \nand distinguished career of service in the U.S. Congress.\n  Bill was especially well known for his work in agriculture and in the \nfight against hunger, including being an ardent supporter of food \ndistribution programs. One of his legislative priorities this session \nwas a bill that would make it easier for millions of tons of unused \nfood by restaurants, supermarkets, and other private businesses to end \nup in food pantries and shelters rather than in garbage cans and \ndumpsters.\n  In honor of Bill Emerson, I now send to the desk the Bill Emerson \nGood Samaritan Food Donation Act, which is identical to legislation \nchampioned by Bill Emerson before his death. In the past, private \ndonors have been reluctant to make contributions to non-profit \norganizations because they are concerned about potential civil and \ncriminal liability. With this legislation, private donors will be \nprotected from such liability, except in cases of gross negligence and \nintentional misconduct. Those in need will truly benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  I am happy to continue Bill Emerson's effort, and I will work hard to \nensure that the Senate passes this common sense approach to fight \nhunger. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n        By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Kerrey):\n\n  S. 1939. A bill to improve reporting in the livestock industry and to \nensure the competitiveness of livestock producers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n            The Livestock Market Revitalization Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Livestock \nMarket Revitalization Act of 1996. My colleagues, Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska, are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  I offer this legislation at a time of tremendous challenges within \nthe livestock sector. The occupant of the Chair knows full well what we \nare facing in the livestock industry. His State is a major producer, as \nis mine. From long, drawn-out battles over meat inspection to sudden \nflareups like ``mad cow disease'' in England, to the debilitating price \ndeclines we have been experiencing for the last several months, the \nindustry is facing repeated and difficult challenges.\n  The biggest challenge facing individual producers is the need to \nclimb out of the downturn in the market and ensure a stable income long \ninto the future. I know the occupant of the Chair knows full well, as \nother of my colleagues do, what has happened to the prices of livestock \nover the last year. It has been in precipitous and dramatic decline. \nThe pressure this is putting on producers is enormous.\n  Let me just say that according to North Dakota State University, in \n1995 net farm income in my State of North Dakota was down 24 percent. \nThat is a 24-percent reduction in farm income, its lowest level in 6 \nyears, largely because of the steep drop in cattle prices. In fact, for \nsome, net farm income dropped as much as 30 percent from the previous \nyear.\n  I was recently in my home State talking to some of my closest \nfriends, many of them cattle producers. One after another related to me \nthe extraordinary economic pressure they are under as a result of this \nsteep decline in prices. These price declines are occurring at the same \ntime concentration\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\nwithin the livestock industry is at record levels. The top four \nmeatpacking firms in America controlled 82 percent of the market in \n1994, the latest statistic available. When Congress last took action to \naddress this industry in 1920, the level of concentration was only 49 \npercent.\n\n  Mr. President, producers are deeply frustrated because they lack \nconfidence in the livestock market and find it difficult to obtain \ntimely, reliable market information.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is the least that we can do to ensure \nthat market participants are engaged in a level playing field.\n  For this reason, I am introducing the Livestock Market Revitalization \nAct of 1996. This bill will restore confidence to the livestock market \nby achieving the following objectives:\n  First, define captive supplies to include livestock controlled by or \ncommitted to a packer more than 7 days prior to slaughter through \nstanding arrangements, instead of the current 2 weeks.\n  Second, strengthen the position of the seller in the livestock market \nby providing them daily information on the demand for his or her \nlivestock.\n  Third, collect and disseminate data on national, regional, and local \nmarket activities to monitor possible anticompetitive behavior.\n  Fourth, promote the use of a value-based pricing system that is \nequitable to all cattle dealers and packers.\n  Fifth, improve collection and dissemination of data on imports and \nexports of cattle and meat.\n  If there is one thing my producers have said to me, it is, ``We \ndeserve to know what is going on in this market on a regional basis and \non a local basis. We deserve to know what is happening with imports and \nexports. We deserve that information more readily.\n  Sixth, recognize that the USDA may need additional resources to \nachieve the objectives of the bill and ask the USDA to report its needs \nin this area.\n  Seventh, protect the interests of farmer-owned cooperatives by \nstrengthening their ability to compete in the livestock market.\n  Eighth, improve labeling of cattle and meat so producers and \nconsumers have more information about the origins of meat and meat \nproducts in retail markets.\n  Let me say that is not just in the interest of producers, that is in \nthe interest of consumers as well. Where is the meat that they are \nbuying coming from? What is the country of origin? I think that has \nbeen something that has been delayed for a little too long.\n  Ninth, encourage the livestock industry to review its efforts on \nproduct development to improve the demand for red meat.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to act. We must make action possible \nnow. There should be no further delay.\n  The current depressed cattle market is devastating producers in all \ncattle producing States. While Members on both sides of the aisle, and \nthe administration, have been actively seeking ideas to solve this \nproblem, it is time to turn those ideas into action.\n  My bill addresses real concerns about an industry no one can argue is \nperfect, and many can argue has serious problems.\n  I have specifically designed this bill to be one which Republicans \nand Democrats can support--one that can achieve quick passage.\n  I would prefer to make the bill broader but I understand that in the \ninterest of getting legislation through Congress in this shortened and \nbusy year, lean and targeted legislation has better prospects.\n  Some of the items in my bill will bolster the authorities currently \nheld by the USDA, and will complement the actions the administration \nhas already taken. Those actions include the President's and the \nSecretary of Agriculture's decision to open the Conservation Reserve \nProgram for haying and grazing, to accelerate the purchase of beef for \nthe School Lunch Program, and to continue to maintain our net-exporter \nstatus on beef with an expected 16 percent increase in total beef \nexports from 1995 to 1996.\n  But while administrative actions are good, in a period as serious as \nthis in which prices are depressed and market behaviors are troubling, \nit is incumbent on Congress to take action.\n  I believe the first action we should take is to get the best possible \ninformation. That is the main focus of my bill. It is not burdensome. \nIt is not invasive. It does not point fingers. It is focused and \nforward-thinking.\n  It is an effort to help everyone understand the pressures at each \nlevel of the livestock industry, from producing to marketing to packing \nto retailing.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this very important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the \nbill as well as the bill itself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1939\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill requests that \n     the Secretary defines captive supply transactions to be when \n     packers use any standing arrangement to procure cattle to be \n     delivered for slaughter more than 7 days out. It is also \n     intended that efforts to monitor anticompetitive and \n     antitrust behavior be improved by collecting data nationally, \n     regionally and locally on the types of standing arrangements \n     used, so as a distribution of standing arrangements is \n     provided.\n       (b) The intent is to provide guidance to packers using \n     captive supplies to ensure that markets are as competitive as \n     possible. The extent to which captive supplies are utilized \n     nationally, regionally and locally are unknown.\n       (c) The intent is to ensure that the USDA reports \n     statistics on livestock transactions in a regular and timely \n     fashion, at least annually. In addition, the reports need to \n     provide for more disaggregate information on the industry, \n     maintaining all confidentially concerns. Specifically, the \n     intent is to define and report by geographical procurement \n     markets.\n       (d) The intent is to provide information on captive \n     supplies in a more timely fashion and with the advancement \n     and availability of technology, report no later than 24 hours \n     after a transaction. This reporting requirement is not \n     intended to be burdensome to any of the parties involved. It \n     is intended to strengthen the position of the seller in the \n     market with respect to knowing the demand for his/her \n     livestock.\n\n\n section 3. monitoring of antitrust and anticompetitive behavior among \n                         packers and stockyards\n\n       (a) It is the intent to recognize the high level of \n     concentration in the packing industry, and to ensure that the \n     proper data is collected and disseminated to the industry so \n     that cattlemen and stockmen can have the necessary data to go \n     to Justice or USDA for enforcing the Sherman and Clayton and \n     P Acts. Data on more disaggregate levels in needed for the \n     Department to better monitor and report on anticompetitive \n     and antitrust behavior.\n       (b) The intent is to allow the Secretary to recognize and \n     request additional funding because this bill requires new \n     efforts data be undertaken to ensure the competitiveness of \n     the livestock industry and may have to review its resources \n     on hand.\n       In addition to the resource report, the Secretary will \n     report on progress made after the GAO report recommending \n     that the Secretary of Agriculture determine a feasible and \n     practical approach for monitoring the activity in regional \n     livestock markets. In defining the relevant markets, P \n     must determine the types of data and analysis it needs and \n     the cost-effectiveness of obtaining and analyzing the data. \n     The GAO study reports that P officials agree that \n     effective monitoring for anticompetitive behavior depends \n     upon knowing the relative boundaries for geographical \n     livestock procurement markets. By focusing on calculating \n     national statistics on concentration in the meat packing \n     industry and not defining regional livestock procurement \n     markets, P may in its data be understanding the potential \n     risks associated with concentration in some areas.\n\n\n    SECTION 4. COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF MARKETING INFORMATION\n\n       The intention is to direct the Secretary to collect and \n     disseminate more timely and relevant information to the \n     industry and to utilize existing technologies which enhance \n     the timeliness of delivery. The red meat sector pricing \n     system is largely based on visual quality characteristics and \n     not measurable value. It is intended that the Secretary work \n     with the industry to develop a value based pricing \n     methodology that is equitable to all cattle dealers and \n     packers. Producers also need to have timely information on \n     imports and exports of cattle and meat in order to better \n     schedule their sales.\n\n\n                   SECTION 5. COOPERATIVE BARGAINING\n\n       The intent is to strengthen the ability of cooperatives \n     ability to bargain with the large packers on the terms of \n     sale. It is important to ensure that packers utilize the \n     supplies from cooperatives in the same fashion as other \n     feedlots.\n\n\n           SECTION 6. LABELING OF MEAT AND MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS\n\n       The intent here is to provide the consumer with information \n     about the country of origin of meat and meat food products so \n     as to eliminate any confusion about the USDA grade label \n     implying the beef was produced in the United States. It also \n     requires that cattle entering the United States to be \n     slaughter be label as having resided in other countries \n     unless it has resided here for 120 days.\n\n\n                SECTION 7. LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY COMMISSION\n\n       It is the intent to set up an industry lead Commission to \n     research and report on the more contentious issues swirling \n     around in the industry. The red meat industry lags behind \n     poultry and pork in investments and product development. Many \n     reasons exists, but it is time to identify the most important \n     ones and design a strategy to improve the demand for red \n     meat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Thompson, and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1940.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 290 \nBroadway in New York, NY, as the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      the ronald h. brown federal building designation act of 1996\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to honor and \nremember a truly exceptional American, Ronald H. Brown. The bill would \ndesignate the Federal building located at 290 Broadway in New York, NY, \nas the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building''.\n  It is a grand gesture to recognize the passing of this remarkable \nAmerican and special friend, and I would ask for the support of all \nSenators of this legislation to place one more marker in history on Ron \nBrown's behalf.\n  Ron Brown had a great love for enterprise and industry as reflected \nin his achievements as the first African-American to hold the office of \nU.S. Secretary of Commerce.\n  His was a life of outstanding achievement and service to his country: \nArmy captain; general counsel, deputy executive officer, and vice \npresident of the National Urban League; partner in a prestigious law \nfirm; chief counsel, and chairman of the National Democratic Committee; \nhusband and father. And these are but a few of the achievements that \ndemonstrated Ron's spirited pursuit of life.\n  To have held any one of these posts in the Government, and in the \nprivate sector, is extraordinary. To have held all of the positions he \ndid and prevail as he did, is unique. Indeed, Ron Brown was unfairly \ntaken from us; however, while with us, he lived a sweeping and \ncomprehensive life. And we are all diminished by his loss.\n  Therefore, I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to this uncommon \nman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Gorton and Mrs. Murray):\n\n  S. 1942. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax treatment for foreign investment through a U.S. regulated \ninvestment company comparable to the tax treatment for direct foreign \ninvestment and investment through a foreign mutual fund; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE INVESTMENT COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the U.S. mutual fund industry has \nbecome a dominant force in developing, marketing, and managing assets \nfor American investors. Since 1990, assets under management by U.S. \nmutual funds have grown from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion in \n1995. Yet, while direct foreign investment in U.S. securities is \nstrong, foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds has remained relatively \nflat.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senators Gorton and \nMurray, the Investment Competitiveness Act of 1996. This legislation, \nwhich I have had the honor of cosponsoring in each of the last two \nCongresses, would eliminate a major barrier to attracting foreign \ncapital into the United States while improving the competitiveness of \nthe U.S. mutual fund industry.\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n  This legislation would remove a barrier to the sale and distribution \nof U.S. mutual funds outside the United States. The bill would change \nthe Internal Revenue Code to provide that foreign investors in U.S. \nmutual funds be accorded the same tax treatment as if they had made \ntheir investments directly in U.S. stocks or shares of a foreign mutual \nfund.\n  Under current law, most kinds of interest and short-term capital \ngains received directly by an investor outside the United States or \nreceived through a foreign mutual fund are not subject to the 30-\npercent withholding tax on investment income. However, interest and \nshort-term capital gain income received by a foreign investor through a \nU.S. mutual fund are subject to the withholding tax. This result occurs \nbecause current law characterizes interest income and short-term \ncapital gain distributed by a U.S. mutual fund to a foreign investor as \na dividend subject to withholding.\n  The Investment Competitiveness Act would correct this inequity and \nput U.S. mutual funds on a competitive footing with foreign funds. The \nbill would correctly permit interest income and short-term capital gain \nto retain their character upon distribution.\n  Current law acts as a prohibitive export tax on foreign investors who \nchoose to invest in U.S. funds. That is why the amount of foreign \ninvestment in U.S. mutual funds is small.\n  Mr. President, it is time to dismantle the unfair and unwanted tax \nbarrier to foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds. The American \neconomy will benefit from exporting U.S. mutual funds, creating an \nadditional inflow of investment into U.S. securities markets without a \ndilution of U.S. control of American business that occurs through \ndirect foreign investment in U.S. companies. Moreover, the legislation \nwill support job creation among ancillary fund service providers \nlocated in the United States, rather than in offshore service \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, I very much appreciate the efforts of Senators Gorton \nand Murray in cosponsoring this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and help to move it forward.\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Baucus and Murray, in introducing \nthe Investment Competitiveness Act of 1996, a bill that will make the \ntax treatment for foreign investment through a U.S. regulated \ninvestment company comparable to the tax treatment for direct foreign \ninvestment and investment through a foreign mutual fund.\n  The service industry continues to grow rapidly as a vital form of \ntrade for the United States. While the United States continues to \nsuffer a trade deficit in merchandise, exports of services ran at a \nsurplus of $63 billion in 1995. In my home State of Washington, \nservices such as financial investments and telecommunications are \nintegral to job creation and economic growth.\n  Improving the international competitiveness of the United States is \nof the utmost importance, and encouraging capital investment in U.S. \ncompanies is a critical component of improving our international \ncompetitiveness. Increasingly, foreign capital has been drawn into U.S. \nsecurities markets. We need to permit that capital to be invested in \nU.S. companies through U.S. mutual funds. This legislation will help \nensure that U.S. mutual funds become a leading export for the United \nStates and the leader in providing worldwide mutual fund services that \nattract more capital to the United States. Putting U.S. funds on a \nlevel playing field with foreign-based funds or foreign investments \nmade directly in U.S. securities, produces a worldwide market for U.S. \nmutual funds and releases a flow of international capital into U.S. \ninvestments.\n  The U.S. mutual fund industry is clearly the most technologically \nadvanced in the world, and thus is the most cost efficient in \ndelivering services to its client. Current law, however, imposes a 30-\npercent withholding tax on mutual fund distributions, a tax that does \nnot apply in the case of comparable foreign-based funds or to direct \ninvestments in the United States. The withholding tax, which \neffectively imposes an export tax on the U.S. mutual fund industry, \nmakes U.S. funds less attractive from a pricing standpoint and creates \nan administrative burden for foreign institutional investors. This tax \ndiscourages global institutional investors and the managers who invest \ntheir funds from using U.S.-based mutual funds, thus providing a \ncompetitive disadvantage to foreign-based funds.\n  The Investment Competitiveness Act of 1996 addresses this disparate \ntreatment by making the tax treatment of foreign investment in U.S. \nmutual funds comparable to that afforded to foreign investments made \ndirectly in U.S. securities or indirectly through foreign based funds.\n  Without this change, U.S. mutual funds would have a strong incentive \nto establish offshore funds in order to compete with foreign-based \nfunds and satisfy the demand for U.S. securities in world markets. This \nhas the unsatisfactory effect of moving U.S. mutual fund jobs and \nexpertise to offshore facilities. Instead, we should be working to \nincrease the demand for the fund services provided by U.S. fund \nmanagers, custodians, accountants, transfer agents, and others based in \nthe United States, rather than locate those jobs offshore. This \nlegislation will benefit our capital markets by exporting U.S. mutual \nfunds, while creating and maintaining mutual fund jobs in the United \nStates.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nBaucus in cosponsoring the Investment Competitiveness Act of 1996, \nlegislation that will correct a provision in the Internal Revenue Code \nthat currently makes it difficult to sell mutual funds outside the \nUnited States.\n  I believe Congress has an obligation to implement public policies \nthat encourage investments in U.S. companies. These investments are \nessential to raising capital, initiating research and development, \nexpanding our Nation's economy and ultimately improving our \ninternational competitiveness.\n  Our current Tax Code deters foreign investors from investing in U.S. \nmutual funds by treating interest income and short-term capital gain as \na dividend that is subject to a 30-percent withholding tax. On the \nother hand, a foreign investor can invest in other foreign funds or \ndirectly in U.S. securities without paying this tax.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. mutual fund industry has grown significantly \nover the past 6-years. Since 1990, U.S. mutual fund assets have grown \nfrom $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion. This rapid growth has \noccurred despite the fact that foreign investment in U.S. funds has \nstayed roughly the same.\n  Rather than dissuading foreign investment, we should be encouraging \nforeign investment in U.S. funds and companies. Quite simply, American \ncompanies are put at a disadvantage by a Tax Code that encourages \nforeign investors to invest in other countries and other companies.\n  More importantly, our Tax Code forces U.S. mutual fund companies to \nset up subsidiary funds overseas in order to reach the world \nmarketplace.

Mr. President, I note with great pride that \none of my staff members has been honored with a very special award: \nCharlotte Moreland, who serves me on the minority staff of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, has been named 1996 Congressional \nStaffer of the Year by the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n  I can think of no one who has earned this award more than Charlotte. \nShe has been a loyal member of my personal staff ever since I joined \nthe Senate in 1984, and I have been most grateful for the many \nstrengths she brought to that job. But Charlotte really found her forte \nwhen I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in \n1993, and she became my Special Projects Director on the committee. She \nhas continued to work for me in my capacity now as the committee's \nranking Democratic member.\n  Charlotte has helped countless veterans from West Virginia and all \naround the country obtain the services and benefits they are due from \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. Some of the work she has done is \ntruly amazing; she has been able to get results where many others have \nfailed, or failed to even try, lacking the drive and compassion that \nare Charlotte's trademark.\n  Charlotte was born and raised in West Virginia, and she has never \nlost the stubborn persistence, tenacity, and deep caring that are so \ncharacteristic of my home State. Charlotte is a vigorous--I might say, \nferocious--advocate for the underdog, the vulnerable, those who would \notherwise get lost in the system. She is not afraid to fight Government \nbureaucracy, redtape, and complacency, and she will follow through on a \ncase until all avenues of help are exhausted.\n  Whether it involves quality or availability of medical care in a VA \nhospital, or timely and appropriate decisions on disability claims, \nveterans need a place to turn when they believe the system has failed \nthem. Charlotte acts as my eyes and ears out in the community, \nlistening to the concerns of individual veterans and reporting them \nback to me, so that I can address systemic problems through legislation \nand oversight. I count on her tremendously, and I truly would not be \nable to perform my job well on the committee if she were not performing \nhers.\n  Charlotte is a prime example of a very special class of employees--\ndedicated congressional staffers who labor, often anonymously, behind \nthe scenes, making our Government work and providing services to our \ncitizens. Too often they do not receive the recognition they so richly \ndeserve. In saluting Charlotte, I salute also these other unsung \nheroes. As Members of Congress, we are often in the limelight. But our \naccomplishments would be far less without the dedicated staff that \nserve us, and we should never forget that.\n  Veterans--in West Virginia and throughout our country--are incredibly \nlucky to have Charlotte as their\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nadvocate. I am grateful to have her on my staff, and enormously proud \nof all she has accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7676-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. Let me \nbegin by thanking the two distinguished colleagues from Nevada for \ntheir cooperation this afternoon in allowing us to get to this point. \nAs the majority leader indicated, they care deeply about this issue. \nNevada is well served by their representation and their determination \non this issue.\n  I also want to thank the majority leader for his effort to work with \nus. He has said again today what he said yesterday. He is prepared to \ntry to work through these things in a way that would allow us to \nresolve all of the outstanding questions.\n  He has given me his assurance again today that we will attempt--all \nwe can do is attempt--to work through the list of the 23 judges that \nare currently on the calendar. This is the first downpayment.\n  I appreciate his willingness to work with us on all of them. I \nbelieve that this is a good process. I think it is the way we should \nproceed.\n  So I am very pleased that we have been able to reach this point.\n  So I have no objection.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nassure the two distinguished leaders that I have no intention of \nobjecting--I will just say that I congratulate both leaders for being \nable to reach this point where I think there is, indeed, light at the \nend of the tunnel.\n  I think that the courtesies that they have shown to me and to other \nMembers of this body on both sides of the aisle really is a very \npositive indication of the cooperation that will allow us to get \nthrough the list of judges that have been approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I also would echo the comments by the two distinguished Senators from \nNevada about how far they have been able to go, and I thank them for \nbeing willing to cooperate on the Defense authorization bill which I \nknow is very, very important.\n  I congratulate both leaders for the work that they have done. I think \nthis is a spirit of cooperation that we need more of. I congratulate \nboth of them for their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed, en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                             The Judiciary\n\n       Gary A. Fenner, of Missouri, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\n       Mary Ann Vial Lemmon, of Louisiana, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to just note with regard to the \nnomination of Mary Lemmon from Louisiana there are other judges that \nhad been on the list longer. But there was a particular problem with \nthis judge due to the fact that she does hold office. I believe she is \na judge. And she has to qualify in the next day or two or she would not \nbe able to run for reelection. And then, if she did not get this \nposition, she would be really caught in the middle. That is why we \nmoved this one up to sort of the head of the list. I am glad it worked \nout.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/10/senate-section/article/S7677-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
