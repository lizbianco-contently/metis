With respect to an \n     individual described in subsection (a)(2) who maintains \n     continuous coverage, no limitation or exclusion of benefits \n     relating to treatment of a preexisting condition may be \n     applied to a child within the child's first 12 months of life \n     or within 12 months after the placement of a child for \n     adoption.\n       (2) Discharge of duty.--An employee health benefit plan \n     shall provide documentation of coverage to participants and \n     beneficiaries whose coverage is terminated under the plan. \n     Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, the \n     duty of an employee health benefit plan to verify previous \n     qualifying coverage with respect to a participant or \n     beneficiary is effectively discharged when such employee \n     health benefit plan provides documentation to a participant \n     or beneficiary that includes the following information:\n       (A) the dates that the participant or beneficiary was \n     covered under the plan; and\n       (B) the benefits and cost-sharing arrangement available to \n     the participant or beneficiary under such plan.\n\n     An employee health benefit plan shall retain the \n     documentation provided to a participant or beneficiary under \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) for at least the 12-month period \n     following the date on which the participant or beneficiary \n     ceases to be covered under the plan. Upon request, an \n     employee health benefit plan shall provide a second copy of \n     such documentation to such participant or beneficiary within \n     the 12-month period following the date of such ineligibility.\n       (3) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (A) Previous qualifying coverage.--The term ``previous \n     qualifying coverage'' means the period beginning on the \n     date--\n       (i) a participant or beneficiary is enrolled under an \n     employee health benefit plan or a group health plan, and \n     ending on the date the participant or beneficiary is not so \n     enrolled; or\n       (ii) an individual is enrolled under an individual health \n     plan (as defined in section 113) or under a public or private \n     health plan established under Federal or State law, and \n     ending on the date the individual is not so enrolled;\n\n     for a continuous period of more than 30 days (without regard \n     to any waiting period).\n       (B) Limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to \n     treatment of a preexisting condition.--The term ``limitation \n     or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of a \n     preexisting condition'' means a limitation or exclusion of \n     benefits imposed on an individual based on a preexisting \n     condition of such individual.\n       (4) Effect of previous coverage.--An employee health \n     benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering a group health \n     plan may impose a limitation or exclusion of benefits \n     relating to the treatment of a preexisting condition, subject \n     to the limits in subsection (a)(1), only to the extent that \n     such service or benefit was not previously covered under the \n     group health plan, employee health benefit plan, or \n     individual health plan in which the participant or \n     beneficiary was enrolled immediately prior to enrollment in \n     the plan involved.\n       (c) Late Enrollees.--Except as provided in section 104, \n     with respect to a participant or beneficiary enrolling in an \n     employee health benefit plan or a group health plan during a \n     time that is other than the first opportunity to enroll \n     during an enrollment period of at least 30 days, coverage \n     with respect to benefits or services relating to the \n     treatment of a preexisting condition in accordance with \n     subsections (a) and (b) may be excluded, except the period of \n     such exclusion may not exceed 18 months beginning on the date \n     of coverage under the plan.\n       (d) Affiliation Periods.--With respect to a participant or \n     beneficiary who would otherwise be eligible to receive \n     benefits under an employee health benefit plan or a group \n     health plan but for the operation of a preexisting condition \n     limitation or exclusion, if such plan does not utilize a \n     limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to the treatment \n     of a preexisting condition, such plan may impose an \n     affiliation period on such participant or beneficiary not to \n     exceed 60 days (or in the case of a late participant or \n     beneficiary described in subsection (c), 90 days) from the \n     date on which the participant or beneficiary would otherwise \n     be eligible to receive benefits under the plan. An employee \n     health benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering a group \n     health plan may also use alternative methods to address \n     adverse selection as approved by the applicable certifying \n     authority (as defined in section 202(d)). During such an \n     affiliation period, the plan may not be required to provide \n     health care services or benefits and no premium shall be \n     charged to the participant or beneficiary.\n       (e)  Preexisting Condition.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``preexisting condition'' means a condition, \n     regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical \n     advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or \n     received within the 6-month period ending on the day before \n     the effective date of the coverage (without regard to any \n     waiting period).\n       (f) State Flexibility.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to preempt State laws that--\n       (1) require health plan issuers to impose a limitation or \n     exclusion of benefits relating to the treatment of a \n     preexisting condition for periods that are shorter than those \n     provided for under this section; or\n       (2) allow individuals, participants, and beneficiaries to \n     be considered to be in a period of previous qualifying \n     coverage if such individual, participant, or beneficiary \n     experiences a lapse in coverage that is greater than the 30-\n     day period provided for under subsection (b)(3);\n\n     unless such laws are preempted by section 514 of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1144).\n\n     SEC. 104.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, Congress has spent significant time \nduring the past 4 years debating comprehensive health care reform and \nmajor reforms to the Medicaid and Medicare Programs. While we have \nfilled pages of newspapers and the Congressional Record and hearing \nrecords, our actions have not equaled our words.\n  Meanwhile, many American families worry about the availability, \nportability, and cost of their own health care coverage.\n  The health insurance problem is not merely one of perception. The \nhealth care market continues to transform itself. An example is the \nrapid movement toward managed care. At the same time, the number of \nuninsured and underinsured Americans has continued to climb. There are \nnow over 40 million Americans without health insurance, and that number \ncontinues to grow.\n  Over 1 million working Americans have lost health insurance in the \nlast 2 years alone, and over 80 million Americans have preexisting \nconditions that could make it difficult for them to maintain health \ncoverage when they change jobs.\n  The current health insurance system provides too little protection \nfor individuals and families with health problems and makes it too \ndifficult for employers, particularly small employers, to obtain \nadequate coverage for their employees. It also locks people into jobs \nout of fear they will lose their health care coverage if they change \njobs or if they lose their jobs.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Federal law preempts States from \nproviding portability to the majority of Americans who get their \ncoverage through so-called self-insured health plans. Therefore, only \nCongress, only the Federal Government, can guarantee insurance \nportability and an end to job lock. That is one of the main reasons all \nmajor organizations representing the States have endorsed S. 1028.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act before the Senate today passed the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee in August by a unanimous \nvote. It now has 65 cosponsors, 27 Republicans and 38 Democrats. It is \nclear that, if this bill were to come to a vote in its current form, it \nwould have more than enough votes to overcome any potential filibuster. \nThe House of Representatives already has passed legislation containing \nhealth insurance reform similar to S. 1028.\n  Moreover, the bill has been endorsed by a wide range of \norganizations, including the National Governors' Association, the \nNational Association of State Insurance Commissioners, the Consortium \nfor Citizens with Disabilities, Small Business United, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Medical \nAssociation, American Hospital Association, Families USA, Consumers \nUnion, the American Association of Retired Persons, and the AFL-CIO.\n  The portability provisions of this bill are even supported by many \nhealth insurers, including the American Association of Health Plans, \nAetna, Prudential, Cigna, United Healthcare and the Blue Cross and Blue \nShield Association, which is the largest health insurance carrier in \nthe individual market.\n  Doctors, hospitals, insurers, HMO's, large business, small business, \norganized labor, and consumer groups all support the bill before us \ntoday. When one looks at the history of health care reform and the \ndifficult tradeoffs and policy choices that must be made, that fact \nalone, I suggest, is remarkable.\n  The majority of these organizations have made clear that their \nsupport is conditioned on S. 1028 remaining free of contentious \namendments.\n  We have a historic opportunity to pass limited, but real, health \nreform for the American people. We must not squander this opportunity \nby expanding the scope of this bill. The lessons of the past are clear. \nIf we try to do too much, we will fail to do anything.\n  This bill is too important to people who may not have a voice in the \nHalls of Congress by any major organization, but who will be helped \ntremendously by this legislation. People like Tom Hall, a retired \nconstruction worker and farmer from Oklahoma City.\n  After 30 years of being covered by his employer, Tom started his own \ncompany and tried to buy an insurance policy for his family. However, \nthe same insurer that had covered him while he was employed turned him \ndown. Several years later, he did find an insurance policy that covers \neverything but his preexisting heart condition.\n  Mr. Hall testified before our committee, and it was very powerful \ntestimony in its own significant way. Clearly, Mr. Hall would be \nprotected by the group-to-individual portability provisions of this \nbill.\n  There are other families who would benefit. One is from Herndon, VA. \nA daughter who has cerebral palsy is excluded from coverage for at \nleast 12 months every time the husband, Robert, changes jobs. While \nthey have waited for these preexisting conditions to expire, they have \nhad to pay both COBRA coverage and coverage under the new employer \nplan.\n  Mr. President, I also visited with a young woman who is an employee \nof the U.S. Senate. She has cancer. Her husband is completing his \ngraduate work, and they hope to move to Florida. She is afraid to leave \nthe coverage she has under her Federal employees health insurance for \nfear if they move to Florida, she may not be able to get insurance \nwhich would cover her because of her having cancer.\n  These are just some examples of people who would be helped directly \nby this legislation.\n  Only a year after President Clinton waved his veto pen and said he \nwould not sign any bill that did not contain universal coverage, the \nPresident now says he will sign this carefully targeted health \ninsurance portability bill. We should take him up on that offer.\n  The bill before us today does not achieve universal coverage. It is a \nfar cry from the comprehensive health reform proposals that were \nconsidered by Congress only in the last Congress. However, it would \nimmediately and measurably improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Through sensible, market-based reforms, the Health Insurance Reform \nAct would, first, limit the ability of insurers and employers to impose \nexclusions for preexisting conditions; second, prevent insurers from \ndropping coverage when an individual changes jobs or family members \nbecome sick; and third, help small companies gain more purchasing clout \nin the marketplace.\n  Despite its limited scope, the General Accounting Office estimates \nthat the Health Insurance Reform Act would\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nhelp at least 25 million Americans each year, and the Congressional \nBudget Office predicts that it would do so without any cost to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I do not know whether it is 25 million. I do not know \nif it is 10 million or if it is 5 million. What matters is each and \nevery one of us in this U.S. Senate knows someone it would help. And if \nit only helps those few that we know even, it would be well worth \npositive consideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  I believe the legislation has achieved broad consensus for two main \nreasons. First, it is narrowly focused. It does not contain employer \nmandates, mandatory purchasing alliances, new taxes or new \nbureaucracies. Instead, the legislation focuses only on those areas \nwhere broad bipartisan agreement existed during the health care debate \nin the 103d Congress and where State insurance reforms have \ndemonstrated the ability to work.\n  Second, the legislation was crafted with a significant input from \nconsumers, insurers, businesses, hospitals and doctors. It is carefully \nattuned to the rapidly changing private health care market.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is not without some detractors. We \nhave worked closely with the health insurance industry, and insurers \ngenerally support the bill. For example, the Health Insurance \nAssociation of America submitted testimony in favor of the vast \nmajority of the bill's provisions. However, some continue to raise \nconcerns about one provision of the legislation that is designed to \nhelp individuals and families who have played by the rules to maintain \nhealth coverage if they lose their job or leave a job to work for an \nemployer that does not offer coverage.\n  I believe, however, that this provision strikes a careful balance \nbetween the need to provide consumers access to individual coverage and \nthe need to protect the fragile individual insurance market.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act would provide access to individual \ninsurance only for those who have maintained prior continuous coverage \nunder an employer-sponsored health plan for at least 1\\1/2\\ years, who \nhave exhausted their COBRA benefits, and who are ineligible for \ncoverage under another group policy.\n  Moreover, S. 1028 contains no restrictions on premiums. There are \nmany who wish that it did, and it leaves broader reforms, such as \nguaranteed issue for individuals who have not had prior coverage, \nguaranteed issue for self-employed and portability between individual \nhealth plans to the States.\n  As a result, the bill requires individuals to pay into the system \nbefore being able to use its provisions for continued health coverage. \nThis group-to-individual portability provision is carefully \ncircumscribed precisely to avoid potential premium increases and \nadverse selection problems that could result from broader individual \nmarket reforms.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries, the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe Rand Corp., the Hay Huggins Group and other credible independent \nactuaries have confirmed that this narrow provision would have only a \nminimal impact on the cost of health coverage in the individual market. \nThere are some who have vastly exaggerated what the premium increase \nwould be, but those that I have mentioned are sources that have no ax \nto grind in this area and whose reliability on projections are totally \nobjective.\n  The substitute goes even further. It expressly provides that if a \nState has adopted or adopts in the future a high-risk pool or other \nmeans of allowing individuals to maintain health coverage, that State \nlaw or program will apply in lieu of the group-to-individual \nportability provision contained in the bill.\n  Instead of preempting State reforms that are working or prescribing a \none-size-fits-all solution from Washington, S. 1028 allows each State \nto fashion individual market solutions that are appropriate for \nindividuals in that State. This is another reason why both the \nGovernors and the State insurance commissioners support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I think we all know those who would be helped by this \nlegislation, as I said. The Health Insurance Reform Act does not strike \nout in a bold new direction, but it is a positive step forward that \nwill help reduce barriers to health coverage for millions of working \nAmericans. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate to the American \npeople that Republicans and Democrats can work together to address \ntheir most serious concerns regarding health care.\n  As Robert Samuelson stated in his column on April 17 in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       The virtue of this proposal is its modesty. There is \n     nothing wrong with constructive tinkering. We've had enough \n     of grand reforms, which promise much and deliver little. \n     However, if enacted, it would provide a little extra peace of \n     mind for those who have already had employer-paid insurance.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       This legislation isn't exciting but then again good \n     government often isn't.\n\n  Mr. President, it may not be exciting, but let me tell you, if you \nknow one person this legislation would help, it is, indeed, exciting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want, first of all, as we begin the \nconsideration of the legislation which can make such an extraordinary \ndifference to millions of our fellow citizens in this country, mention \nat the outset my great respect, and I think the respect all of us in \nthe Senate should have, for the chairperson of our committee of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee.\n  I can remember going back the last time that the Senate was \nconsidering major legislation--we have had other legislation in the \nmeantime--the comprehensive legislation that we considered now some 2 \nyears ago. During that period of time, Senator Kassebaum was tireless \nin trying to find some common ground. We had some areas of agreement. \nWe were unable, obviously, to get to the full measure of agreement \nduring those considerations. But I think all of us who were a part of \nthat effort knew that Senator Kassebaum was trying to find the areas of \ncommon ground on which we could move forward. At the end of the \nconsideration of that legislation, I can remember a conversation that \nwe had.\n  In her typical manner, she expressed a very compelling view that we \nshould not let the issues of health care fall by the wayside and that \nwe ought to try to look through the various proposals that had been \nconsidered at that period of time and that we ought to try to piece \nwhat we could together that could make an important difference for the \nAmerican people and see if we could not work out a bipartisan effort.\n  It was really from that initiative and from that energy that she has \nspent hour after hour after hour in small meetings, large meetings, \nhearings, in visiting with various interested members of our committee \nand other Members of the Senate, and really helped in developing this \nlegislation. In an extraordinary committee action, we were able to \nbring all the members and get a unanimous vote in support of this \nlegislation, which is really an extraordinary achievement and \naccomplishment at any time. It certainly is now in this Congress, which \nin many instances has had more contentious debates and less agreement \non many public policy issues.\n  But in this area, it is really a result of her own particular skills \nand talents and energy and strong commitment that we are here today \nwith the extraordinary support that she has mentioned in regard to both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I think all Members of the Senate, \nobviously, who know her and know her perseverance pay tribute to her \nextraordinary leadership on this issue.\n\n  I certainly at the outset of this debate and discussion acknowledge \nthat and pay tribute to it. I think when the history of health policy \nis written, her imprint on not just this legislation but on so many \nother measures of health will be very, very much recognized, as it \nshould be. It has been a personal pleasure to have the chance to work \nwith her. I know all the members of the committee feel the same way.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are considering today will end many \nof the most serious health insurance abuses and provide greater \nprotection to millions of families. It is an opportunity we cannot \nafford to miss.\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\n  The abusive practices addressed by this bill create endless, \nunnecessary suffering. Millions of Americans are forced to pass up \nopportunities to accept jobs that would improve their standard of \nliving or offer them greater opportunities because they are afraid they \nwill lose their health insurance. Many others have to abandon the goal \nof starting their own business because health insurance would be \nunavailable to them or members of their families.\n  Children who age out of their parents' policies often find themselves \nunable to obtain their own insurance if they have any significant \nhealth problems. Early retirees can find themselves uninsured just when \nthey are entering the years of highest health risks.\n  Other Americans lose their health insurance because they become sick \nor lose their job or change their job, even when they have faithfully \npaid their insurance premiums for many years.\n  With each passing year, the flaws in the private health insurance \nmarket become more serious. More than half of all insurance policies \nimpose exclusions for preexisting conditions. As a result, insurance is \noften denied for the very illnesses most likely to require medical \ncare. The purpose of such exclusions is reasonable to prevent people \nfrom gaming the system by purchasing coverage only when they get sick, \nbut current practices are indefensible.\n  No matter how faithfully people pay their premiums, they often have \nto start over again with a new exclusion period if they change jobs or \nlose their coverage. And 81 million Americans have conditions that \ncould subject them to such exclusions if they lose their current health \ncare coverage. Sometimes the exclusions make them completely \nuninsurable.\n  Insurers impose exclusions for preexisting conditions on people who \ndo not deserve to be excluded from the coverage they need. Sometimes \ninsurers deny coverage to entire firms if one employee of the firm is \nin poor health or exclude that employee from the coverage. In other \ncases, entire categories of businesses with millions of employees are \nred lined out of coverage.\n\n  Even if people are fortunate enough to gain coverage and have no \npreexisting condition, their coverage can be canceled if they have the \nmisfortune to become sick, even after paying premiums for years.\n  Robert Frasher from Mansfield, OH, works for an employer who offers \nhealth coverage to employees, but the insurance company will not cover \nhim. Why? Because he has Crohn's disease.\n  Jean Meredith of Harriman, TN, and her husband Tom owned Fruitland \nUSA, a mom-and-pop convenience store. They had insurance through their \nsmall business for 8 years until Tom was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma, and their insurance company dropped them. When the Merediths \nasked why, they were told they were no longer profitable insurance \nrisks. Without health insurance, Tom Meredith had to wait a year to get \nthe surgery he needed. After spending $60,000 of his own funds, his \ncancer recurred and he died of cancer about a year ago. Tom Meredith \nmight still be alive today if he had not been forced to wait that year.\n  One of the most serious consequences of the current system is job \nlock. Workers who want to change jobs to improve their careers or \nprovide a better standard of living for their families must give up \nthat opportunity because it means losing their health insurance. A \nquarter of all American workers say they are forced to stay in a job \nthey otherwise would have left because they are afraid of losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  Diane Bratten, from Grove Heights, MN, her family had insurance \nthrough Diane's employer. Because of a history of breast cancer--now in \nremission--Diane and her family will not be able to get decent coverage \nif she decides to change jobs or is laid off.\n  The legislation that Senator Kassebaum and I have introduced will \naddress these problems effectively. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Health \nInsurance Reform Act is a health insurance bill of rights for every \nAmerican and for every business as well. The legislation contains many \nof the provisions from the 1994 health reform debate which received \nbipartisan support, such as an increased access to health insurance, \nincreased portability, protection of health benefits for those who lose \ntheir jobs or want to start their own business, and greater purchasing \npower for individuals and small businesses.\n\n  Those who have insurance deserve the security of knowing that their \ncoverage cannot be canceled, especially when they need it the most. \nThey deserve the security of knowing that if they pay their insurance \npremiums for years, they cannot be denied coverage, be subjected to a \nnew exclusion for a preexisting condition when they change jobs, join \nanother group policy, or when they need to purchase coverage in the \nindividual market. Businesses, especially small businesses, deserve the \nright to purchase health insurance for their employees at a reasonable \nprice.\n  Our Health Insurance Reform Act addresses these fundamental flaws in \nthe private insurance system. The bill limits the ability of insurance \ncompanies to impose exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under the \nlegislation, no exclusion can last for more than 12 months. Once \nsomeone has been covered for 12 months, no new exclusion can be imposed \nas long as there is no gap in coverage, even if someone changes jobs, \nloses their job, or changes insurance companies.\n  The bill requires insurers to sell and renew group health policies \nfor all employers who want coverage for their employees. It guarantees \nrenewability of individual policies. It prohibits insurers from denying \ninsurance to those moving from group coverage to individual coverage. \nIt prohibits group health plans from excluding any employee based on \nhealth status.\n  The portability provisions of the bill mean that individuals with \ncoverage under a group health plan will not be locked into their job \nfor fear that they will be denied coverage or face a new exclusion for \na preexisting condition. These provisions will benefit at least 25 \nmillion Americans annually, according to the General Accounting Office. \nIn addition, the provisions will provide greater security for the 131 \nmillion Americans currently covered under group health plans.\n  The bill will also help small businesses provide better and less \nexpensive coverage for their employees. Purchasing cooperatives will \nenable small groups and individuals to join together to negotiate \nbetter rates in the market. As a result, they can obtain the kind of \nclout in the marketplace currently available only to large employers.\n  The bill also provides great flexibility for States to meet the \nobjective of access to affordable health care for individuals who leave \ntheir group health plans.\n  During the debate on health reform in the last Congress, even the \nopponents of comprehensive reform urged Congress to pass at least the \nreforms that everyone supported--portability of coverage, guaranteed \navailability of coverage, and limitations on exclusions for preexisting \nconditions. These are exactly the provisions included in this bill.\n  Senator Phil Gramm, over 2 years ago said:\n\n       We can fix the system and make it possible for people to \n     change jobs without losing their health insurance. Every one \n     of the proposals that has been made to reform health care--\n     every single bill--has a provision that would make it \n     possible for people to change jobs without losing their \n     insurance.\n\n  Majority Leader Dole, in his statement on the floor of the Senate in \nAugust 1994 said this:\n\n       We will be back . . . And you can bet that health care will \n     be near the top of our agenda. . . . There are a lot of plans \n     and some have similarities. Many of us think we ought to take \n     all the common parts of these plans, put them together and \n     pass that bill.\n\n  Here is our chance. This is the bill.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is a modest, responsible, bipartisan \nsolution to many of the most obvious abuses in the health insurance \nmarketplace today. The bill was approved by the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee last August by a unanimous vote of 16 to 0. It is \nsimilar to proposals made by President Clinton in his recent balanced \nbudget plan.\n  The measures it includes are also virtually identical to provisions \nof legislation offered by Senator Dole in the last Congress--\nlegislation supported by virtually every Republican Member. Sponsors \nrange from the most conservative Members of the Senate to the most \nliberal--because these reforms\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nrepresent simple justice. They are not issues of ideology or \npartisanship.\n  Support for the bill by outside groups is equally broad. Almost 200 \ngroups have expressed their support. These include business \nassociations like the chamber of commercve, National Small Business \nUnited, the National Association of Manufacturers, the ERISA Industry \nCommittee, and the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. \nThe AFL-CIO has endorsed the program, so that on this issue business \nand labor are united. The program is also supported by the National \nGovernors' Association and the National Association of State Insurance \nCommissioners, who believe the legislation represents an appropriate \nbalance between Federal and State responsibilities.\n  Responsible insurance companies support this bill, including the \ninsurance companies in the Alliance for Managed Care, the American \nAssociation of Health Plans, Phoenix Life Insurance Co., the Blue \nCross/Blue Shield Association, and other insurance companies. Blue \nCross and Blue Shield are the largest carriers in the individual \ninsurance market. The American Association of Health Plans has millions \nof individual subscribers. These responsible companies know that the \ninsurance system is broken and needs to be fixed.\n  The Independent Insurance Agents of America--the largest association \nof agents in the country--sees the tragedies created by the current \nsystem every day. They support this bill.\n  Doctors, hospitals, and other health providers see those tragedies as \nwell, and they support the legislation. It has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and \nover 44 medical specialty societies. This bill also enjoys the support \nof a number of the consumer groups that understand the need for \nlegislation so well, including the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities, and Consumers Union.\n  In fact, the only opposition to this legislation comes from those who \nprofit from the abuses in the current system.\n  In his State of the Union Address last January, President Clinton \nchallenged Congress to pass this bill. Now that the legislation has \nbeen brought to the floor of the Senate, I believe it will pass \noverwhelmingly--unless some in the Senate insist on following the \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives by addressing \ncontroversial and harmful provisions like medical savings accounts, \nfederalization of multiple employer welfare arrangements, Federal caps \non malpractice awards, repeal of MediGap rules protecting senior \ncitizens against profiteers, or provisions making it more difficult to \ncombat the waste, fraud and abuse in the current Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms. Almost all of the 200 groups that support the legislation \nhave urged the Senate to pass a clean bill, without these controversial \namendments.\n  These objectionable provisions of the House bill may serve the \nspecial interests, but they have no place in this legislation. Their \nadoption will almost certainly kill this bill, and destroy the hopes of \nmillions of Americans for the kind of modest but effective reform that \nleaders of both parties have supported in the past.\n  Medical savings accounts, which are included in a major amendment to \nbe offered later in this debate are particularly objectionable. They \nare opposed by virtually every credible health policy expert. They \nattract the healthy and wealthy, and add up to an unjustified $1.8 \nbillion Federal giveaway to those who need it the least. They are a \ngift to the insurance companies with the worst record of abusive \npractices--a poorly disguised reward for millions of dollars of \ncampaign contributions. And by pulling the healthiest individuals out \nof the conventional insurance market, they will raise premiums for \neveryone else, including those who need coverage the most.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that, ``In the \nlong run, the existence of any type of catastrophic plus MSA option \nthat would be attractive to a large number of people could threaten the \nexistence of standard health insurance.''\n  Members of the Senate who are serious about insurance reform should \nvote against all controversial amendments--including medical savings \naccounts. Senator Kassebaum and I have agreed that we will vigorously \noppose all such amendments--even those that we might support under \nother circumstances. The Democratic leader, and many other Senators of \nboth parties have joined us in this pledge. This is a test of the \nSenate's seriousness and ability to put the interest of the American \npeople ahead of the special interests.\n  This legislation is not comprehensive health reform. It will not \nsolve all the problems in the current system. But it is a constructive \nstep forward--a step that will help millions of Americans. I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. President, if we are looking for just a shorthand explanation of \nwhat the legislation achieves, effectively, it is the Health Insurance \nReform Act, the health insurance bill of rights. It guarantees that \nyour insurance cannot be taken away because you, first, lose your job; \nsecond, change your job; third, become sick; or, fourth, start your own \nbusiness. It protects against unfair preexisting conditions exclusion \nwhich affect millions of American citizens who virtually have no \ncontrol over those preexisting conditions. In an important way it \nincreases the purchasing power of small businesses so that they will be \nable to provide health insurance to the millions of Americans who work \nin small businesses and have no coverage at this time.\n  This is a modest bill, an important bill. It deserves overwhelming \npassage. It deserves, most importantly, to become law. Every day that \nwe delay the legislation, there are other fellow citizens in this \ncountry that continue to be unable to get the kind of protections that \nthey need and that they deserve. Hopefully, we will have overwhelming \nbipartisan vote on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I see a number of our colleagues that will be \nspeaking. I just hope that those that do have amendments--we hope there \nare not many of those--will make their amendments available to us at \nthe earliest possible time so we can have a chance to review those \namendments and to see what disposal we can make of them.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that members of \nthe staff, four fellows, Lauren Ewers, Susan Castleberry, Sara Thom, \nand Anna Marie Murphy, be granted privileges of the floor during the \ndebate on health insurance reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne Rufo \nand Kevin McShane be extended floor privileges during the duration of \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nSenator Kennedy for his thoughtful statement. He is one who has been \ninvolved in health care issues for many, many years and cares deeply \nabout it. He would, I am sure, like to have expanded this bill much \nfurther. But we worked hard to construct, as he mentioned, something \nthat we felt could be passed and could be approved by the widest number \nin both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. So I have \ngreatly appreciated his leadership in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, as we have worked hard and constructively on both sides of \nthe aisle in the committee, as well as on the floor, to bring this to \nfruition today.\n  One who has been a great asset in working with us is the Senator from \nTennessee, who is waiting to speak. Not only has he been an exceptional \nlegislator on this issue, he comes to it also with an expertise that \nthe rest of us do not have--as a renowned cardiologist. So we have \nvalued his willingness to be very engaged in this issue.\n  I have greatly appreciated his help on the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee as the ranking member. Senator Kennedy and I have worked \ntogether to achieve this bill we are presenting today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senators Kassebaum \nand Kennedy for introducing what I consider to be a fair, balanced, \nfocused, and excellent bill that will be to the\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nbenefit of over 25 million Americans. I welcome this opportunity to \nfocus today on the Health Insurance Reform Act.\n  The bill before us provides protection for some 25 million Americans, \nwho, each year--it is a rolling number--are at risk for becoming \nuninsured. Too many Americans today have to live each day with that \nfear of the loss of health insurance for preexisting illness--for \nexample, if they have heart disease or if they have a stroke--and for \nthe lack of insurance portability when they move from one job to \nanother job.\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum for her leadership in crafting this \nlegislation because it truly is balanced, bipartisan, and focused. \nThere has been much misinformation and misunderstanding of what the \nprovisions in this bill truly accomplish. Its objectives are very well-\ndefined, very specific.\n  I reject the notion that this bill, in any way, resembles, as has \nbeen alleged, or is similar to President Clinton's very large, massive, \nfailed health care plan. This bill is very different and should not be \nconfused with the President's. This bill contains the very provisions \nwhich had broad, very bipartisan support throughout the entire health \ncare debate.\n  The bill before us today proves that we can move forward \nincrementally, rationally, step by step, to fix the problems in our \nhealth care system today--without a massive Federal Government takeover \nof the entire delivery system.\n  I am a physician, and as we talk about this bill and as we look at \nthe provisions of this bill, I see those faces of hundreds--in fact, \neven thousands--of patients who I have had the opportunity to serve in \nthe past. Too many of those faces, when I picture them, are faces of \nterror, of fear, that one day they will lose the insurance they have, \nwhich they have purchased and that they have been a player in \npurchasing, historically, that they will lose it, and that it will be \ntaken away simply because they want to change jobs or leave a group \nplan, leave an insurance plan to go out and set up their own business.\n  As the only physician in this body, I do feel a very special \nresponsibility to speak out loudly, clearly, and forcefully in support \nof those very practical solutions and patient protection when the \nSenate considers matters dealing with these challenging issues of \nhealth care. Each time I make a decision in this body regarding health \ncare legislation, I apply some very stringent tests that go back to my \nexperience as a physician delivering care to individuals, one on one, \nwho need that care, who depend on that care for their quality of life \nand for their well-being.\n\n  In my practice as a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I shared daily \nthe obstacles that patients face. They tell you about that every day in \nyour office. For example, after a patient receives a new heart, has a \nheart transplant, and after they are ready to return to the work force \nand productive lives, there is a huge barrier there today, a barrier \nthat, once we remove it with this bill, will allow that individual to \nlive a more productive life, a life more fulfilling, a better quality \nof life. When I give a person a new heart today, the next day they \nstart asking questions because they are petrified that they are not \ngoing to be able to go back to their old job, to go back and get \ninsurance if they decide to change jobs.\n  They get trapped in a current situation for the rest of their lives \nbecause of this lack of portability of insurance coverage. The cost of \ntheir care, by no fault of their own, restricts their freedom of \nmovement within the workplace.\n  I cannot help but to think back to last July during our Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee when a man from Oklahoma, Tom Hall, testified \nbefore us. He reminded me so directly of the hundreds of patients who \nhave told me this same story. He was denied individual coverage because \nof what we call a preexisting heart condition. But it was denied by the \nsame insurer that he had insurance with for the last 30 years. It was \ndenied because he wanted to go out and start his own company. The \ninsurance company who he had worked with for 30 years--the same person, \nthe same condition--when he wanted to go out and start his own company, \ninitially denied that insurance. Eventually, yes, he got that \ninsurance. But, remember, he had a heart condition. He got that \ninsurance, but it did not cover his heart condition.\n  Well, this bill will address that. It passed the Labor Committee \nunanimously and is currently supported by well over half of the U.S. \nSenate. It limits exclusions for preexisting medical conditions, it \nguarantees renewability of health coverage, and it reduces this concept \nof job-lock--being locked in a job--by making health insurance coverage \nportable from one job to another. In other words, when this bill \nbecomes law, people like Tom Hall will no longer be locked into jobs \nor prevented from starting their own businesses for fear of losing \ntheir health coverage.\n\n  As a doctor, there is nothing worse than having a patient tell me \nthat he or she cannot afford health care due to denial of coverage by \nan insurance company. Tragically, over 1 million working Americans have \nlost health insurance over the last 2 years. Over 80 million Americans \nhave preexisting conditions of some sort that could make it difficult, \nif not impossible, for them to maintain coverage when they change jobs. \nMany of these people are willing to pay the insurance premiums. In many \ncases, those insurance premiums could be costly. But they cannot find \ncoverage at any price.\n  As a physician and as someone who is a real advocate of the free \nmarket system, I find this unacceptable, unconscionable. People who are \nwilling to play by the rules--and again, this bill addresses people who \ncurrently have insurance coverage, who have paid in, or had their \nemployer pay in, and have coverage. These are people who have played by \nthe rules in the system. These people should not be denied the \nopportunity to lead productive lives.\n  I applaud Majority Leader Dole, who has a long record of support for \nhealth care reform, for bringing this bill to the Senate floor. It is \nimportant to debate, and it is important for us to take this step and \nvote on this legislation.\n  Before I entered the public service as U.S. Senator a year and a half \nago, the Senate had already debated and even passed provisions almost \nidentical to this bill--debated and passed. Unfortunately, as the scope \nof many of these bills grew larger and larger, the support for the \noverall bill dwindled. As a result, we are here today still debating \nthose long-awaited insurance reforms.\n  In closing, while this bill is not a cure-all--and we should not \npretend it to be a cure-all, but it is a good first step--it is \nincremental, it is straightforward, it is rationale, it is focused, and \nit is direct. The bill will correct many of those imperfections in the \nmarket that we have today for health insurance.\n  I am confident that this Congress will be the one--this Congress will \nbe the one--to deliver these much-needed reforms.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg \nJones, a legislative fellow in my office, be allowed privileges of the \nSenate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Tennessee for the remarks just made. There is really an \nextraordinary synergy between Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy \nwhich has produced this legislation. It is interesting.\n  I was home last week in my State, and I was talking about this bill. \nAs I talked, a lot of the feelings that a lot of us had 2 or 3 years \nago began to come back. When the larger comprehensive health \nlegislation failed, it was just pulled to the ground by Harry and \nLouise, special interests, and other things, there may be a feeling out \nthere in the land that, well, since that did not pass, I guess things \nmust be going better. Of course, that is not true. Things are really \nworse. The system is in worse condition than it was at that time, and \npeople, I think, increasingly know that.\n  I think what we have to do is wait for a renewed demand, a broader \ndemand, a broader anger on the part of the American people so that they \nwill speak to\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nus with more clarity than happened in the last go-around and we can \nrespond. But in the meantime, Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy saw \nan opportunity to take certain very specific and important parts of \nthis problem and solve them, and they did so in a way which was so \nsuccessful and so agreeable that the vote was unanimous from that \ncommittee. The Labor and Human Resources Committee has a reputation for \nhaving a good deal of bipartisanship. But it is also a committee where \nthere are sharp differences of views and, therefore, the unanimity of \nthe vote I think is a very, very good sign for the Health Insurance \nReform Act of 1995.\n  I think that we have to be fully aware that people in this country \ndesperately want and thoroughly deserve the security that health \ninsurance will not disappear the way it does now. The Senator from \nTennessee was talking about how he could see that fear in people's \nfaces. I am not a physician, but I hear that constantly in my State of \nWest Virginia. When it disappears, it disappears cruelly. It disappears \nwithout warning. It disappears often because people are simply just \nlaid off because of downsizing or because of other economic factors. It \nalways affects, it seems, millions of hard-working men and women, \npeople who are playing by the rules every day. I think today is our \nchance to really do something. I think we can do our job for the West \nVirginians, for the South Dakotans, the Kansans, and other Americans \neverywhere who are out there doing their job but still fear the loss of \nhealth insurance.\n  Health insurance is a little bit like air. Sometimes you take it for \ngranted. All of a sudden it is not there. You panic very quickly, and I \nthink a lot more Americans are doing that. Some people, in fact, are \nestimating--a lot of people are--that by the year 2000, which is really \nonly 3-plus years off, that 50 percent of Americans who work for a \nliving--not 50 percent of Americans but 50 percent of Americans who \nwork for a living--will not have health insurance.\n  So, this problem just continues to get worse and worse. Yet, the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee has made a substantial improvement \nif we are able to pass this bill and if we can do it without \ncontroversial amendments. I will have more to say about that as the day \ngoes along.\n  I have, frankly, waited for this day for a long, long time, and I am \nfilled with a sense of gratitude and a sense of relief that we are \nfinally, as a body, going to do something which is meaningful. If \neverything really goes well, we may do this by the end of the night or \ntomorrow night. But the point is we really have a chance to do this.\n  I do not know of a great deal of criticism about this bill on the \npart of my colleagues. Relatively few people on the outside are \ncriticizing it, and, therefore, I have a good feeling about it.\n  The so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, the Health Insurance Reform \nAct, would establish some of the most fundamental and far-reaching \nchanges in health insurance since the creation, in fact, of Medicare \nand Medicaid in 1965. I, therefore, again salute the two Senators, the \nchairman and the ranking member, for their really inspiring bipartisan \npartnership in crafting and advancing this very important legislation. \nI think we all remember, as I indicated--it seems like a long time ago, \nbut it really was not--that there was a mighty debate in this body \nabout guaranteeing health insurance for every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. I believe that must still be the goal and the vision for \nAmerica. I believe that as strongly as I did at the time. I believe in \nthat even more strongly as I watch what is happening to more and more \npeople as they lose their health insurance even though they are \nworking.\n  Mr. President, that comprehensive effort at that time to reform our \ncountry's health care system was stopped. But, again, the problems of \nlosing health insurance continue. That is why in a sense we have won, \nthrough the good work of Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, we have \nwon another chance to enact something which is really meaningful in the \nway of health care reform. The people of our States are still writing, \ncalling, visiting, and asking for help. I am going to do whatever I can \nto make sure that we do not let this opportunity pass us by--that we \nwill not fail on this and that we will make a real difference in \npeople's day-to-day lives.\n  That is why we simply have to also exercise restraint and not kill \nthis bill with extra baggage. It is tempting, but it cannot happen. \nAmendments, whether they are well-intentioned or not, which are \ncontroversial will have the effect of bringing this bill down, and we \nall know that. We have to be very careful as we go through this \nexercise that we do not accept controversial amendments.\n  I think this bill is going to solve some really horrible problems for \nreal people. So why would we accept controversial amendments which we \nmight otherwise support, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, when \nit could pull down the chance to do something really good for a lot of \npeople?\n  During debate on comprehensive health care reform several years ago, \nmany of my colleagues--especially those on the other side of the \naisle--said repeatedly that we should only enact those health reforms \non which there is a strong bipartisan consensus and support. Well, here \nwe have it. Here we have that piece of legislation. That is the precise \ndescription of this bill, S. 1028, which is before us today. It was so \ncarefully crafted by the chairman and the ranking member; it came out \nof the committee by unanimous vote; it is a bill which should be sent \nto the President for his signature, and I am certain, although one \nnever knows, that he would sign it.\n\n  Loading up this bill with extraneous provisions which will please \ncertain special interests but only delay enactment of health reform \njust does not make any sense at all. So, Mr. President, I intend to \njoin the floor managers of this bill and Minority Leader Daschle in \nopposing any controversial amendment that will delay enactment of this \nbill--any controversial amendment, even if it means voting against \namendments that, as I have indicated and so have others, have merit on \ntheir own and I would fight to enact in other terms and other \ncircumstances. We cannot be distracted from the basic purposes of this \nbill, which are terribly important.\n  Almost 40 million Americans lack basic health coverage today. It is \ngoing up about a million plus every year, Mr. President. It has been \ndoing that regularly, and it will continue to do that, perhaps at an \naccelerating rate. One cannot be sure. Most of the people who are not \nlucky enough to have health insurance, with cards in their wallets or \nback pockets, are in fact the people we revere and honor in this body, \nand that is they are the hard-working, middle-class families who are \nvictims of layoffs and downsizing or just plain profit gouging.\n  This country offers the best health care in the world. Nobody has \never denied that. It is terribly true. Unfortunately, that health care \ncontinues to be beyond the reach of too many of our fellow citizens who \ndo not deserve that lot in a country that is as outstanding and great \nas ours.\n  As both Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy said, this bill before \nus today will not solve all of the problems in the health care \nmarketplace. I think it was Senator Kassebaum who said that the so-\ncalled guarantee issue, or guaranteed coverage, for that matter, for \nevery man, woman and child in this country has not diminished. The bill \nis not going to solve it.\n  I still believe it is a fundamental right for each and every one of \nus, not just for those who can afford it or are healthy enough to keep \ninsurance companies profitable. But again, the machinery of our health \ncare system is breaking down, and this bill helps substantially. If we \ncannot therefore enact a complete overhaul, if we are not going to be \nable to do that in this session, we must enact the individual fixes and \nthe individual reforms that will at least keep the engine of this \nsystem running.\n  Evidence of this need for an overhaul of our health care system is \neverywhere. It is found in the emergency rooms of our public hospitals, \ncollapsing under the demand of the growing millions who need medical \ntreatment but cannot pay for it. It is found in our schools where far \ntoo many children go without immunization and preventive care. It is \nfound in the rooms of our nursing homes with so many residents\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nbeing uprooted from their homes and neighborhoods because of their \ninability to afford community-based alternatives. They are forced onto \nMedicaid. They are institutionalized because their savings have been \nexhausted, and on and on.\n  Mr. President, individuals and families go uninsured for several \nreasons. Often health insurance coverage is simply not available, or \nwhat is available is not affordable. The effect is the same. Health \ninsurance often lapses after a worker is laid off and COBRA extensions \nthat affect certain larger industries have expired.\n  Entrepreneurs who leave their jobs to start their own businesses, \nwhich is what we glory in America--IBM used to have it all and then \npeople started going out and creating all kinds of other things. That \nis what we do in America. We are a country of entrepreneurs. \nEntrepreneurs who have to leave their jobs or want to leave their jobs \nto start their own companies because they think they have a better idea \nare sometimes unable to convert their group health insurance policies \nto an individual health plan, and, even more tragic, insurance coverage \nis often terminated by an insurer just when that insurance policy is \nneeded the most, when an individual or a family member experiences a \nreally serious, devastating illness or disability.\n\n  How reliable is a guarantee, so to speak, of health coverage when the \nhealth plan issuer acts in its own self-interest or cuts the safety \nline by either terminating a policy or increasing the premiums beyond \nthe ability of the individual to pay, thus, in effect, accomplishing \nthe same end--cutting that person off.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 makes significant strides to \naddress each of these two problems, and that is why it is such a good \nbill and needs to be passed. The Health Insurance Reform Act will \nstrengthen the safety net for millions of Americans by improving \nportability and security of private health insurance, especially in the \nsmall group and the individual insurance markets. I support this bill \nbecause I personally have heard the stories of hundreds of West \nVirginians who have fallen between the cracks of our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I wish to just give three personal examples that I \nknow of and then end with a statement from the White House.\n  Mr. President, I want to start--and these are all people who would be \nhelped by this bill, and the examples are so many--with one Norma \nSchoppert, who lives in Piedmont, WV--not large, near the top of our \nState. Several years ago, she developed diabetes. Lots of people do. \nWhen her husband was working, Mrs. Schoppert was covered by the health \nplan offered by his employer. That is understandable. But then he \nretired in 1991 and became eligible for Medicare. When that happened, \nshe was able to extend her own health insurance coverage for 3 years \nbecause of the COBRA provisions that affected his health insurance, and \nthus she was able to pay monthly premiums of $354 and continue full \nhealth insurance coverage under COBRA for 3 years. But that only lasted \nfrom 1991 to 1994, those 3 years.\n  Mrs. Schoppert was offered an individual policy when her COBRA \nextension expired at a monthly premium, Mr. President, of $1,800. So \nyou understand the effect, $354 in the COBRA extension, $1,800 without \nit. In effect, obviously, she could not pay that. She could not afford \nto pay this amount, so she has now no medical coverage at all. And \nunless the system is reformed, she will have to go without insurance \nuntil she qualifies for Medicare, which is still 3 years away.\n  Now, Mr. President, that means, as the Senator from Tennessee \nindicated, 3 more years of anxiety, 3 more years of fear, worrying \nabout the risk of losing everything that she and her husband worked all \nof their lives to build. And we say that sentence so easily; it just \nrolls off our tongue. But these are gigantic tragedies in the lives of \nreal people.\n  Second example. Juanita Taylor of Elkins, WV. Just a few years ago, \nshe was a hard-working employee at Davis & Elkins, which is the local \nprivate college, but then she developed multiple sclerosis. She kept \nright on working, struggling to overcome the advancing weakness that \nher illness caused her. When she was, in fact, really too weak to meet \nthe demands of her job, she lost her job and eventually the health \ninsurance that had provided.\n\n  Her neighbors and her friends pitched in to help her pay for a \nwheelchair, so that she could stay connected and involved with her \ncommunity, so that her morale would be better.\n  Those friends and neighbors told me that she was forced to pay out-\nof-pocket costs of $1,000 per treatment to help slow the advance of her \nmultiple sclerosis. How many people can pay $1,000 per treatment? \nAlthough she now has Medicare, her medical expenses ate up all of her \nsavings. Juanita Taylor courageously faced and fought a ravaging \ndisease, only to be victimized by a system that cared more about how \nmuch money she had in her pocket than it did, quite honestly, about her \nhealth condition.\n  But the final story, and the saddest one of all, it seems to me, \ncomes from Falling Waters, WV, which is in Berkeley County. In 1990, \nWalter McPeak and his wife, Karen, were granted custody of Mr. McPeak's \ntwo sons, Anthony and Thomas. They wanted these boys. Both the boys \nhave severe hemophilia and hepatitis, as well as the social and the \nemotional difficulties that come from living in constant fear that even \nthe slightest injury could result in terrible trauma or instant death.\n  At the time the boys came to live with them, both Walter and Karen \nMcPeak were employed in high-paying management jobs. Together they \nearned a little over $80,000. But their employer's health plan would \nnot issue coverage for Anthony or for Thomas. Their need for special \nclotting factors and other treatments means medical costs of several \nthousands of dollars each week.\n  So it was not long before the McPeak family had used up all of their \nsavings. They had to sell their house and then they sold their first \ncar, and then they sold their second car, but still the costs climbed \nand there was no help in sight. When they tried to apply for Medicaid--\nwhich you can imagine they did not want to have to do--because Medicaid \nwould have helped pay for their sons' treatments, they were told that \ntheir family income was too high for the boys to be eligible for SSI, \nwhich would automatically make them eligible for Medicaid.\n  So, what choice did Walter and Karen McPeak have to make? In order to \nqualify the boys for SSI, which was their moral and parental \nresponsibility, they gave up their management jobs, both of them, over \n$80,000 a year, and took minimum wage, unskilled jobs so their income \nwould not exceed allowable limits for them to qualify for SSI and hence \nMedicaid.\n  This is a tragedy and this is a travesty. It should never happen in \nAmerica. Anthony and Thomas got health insurance; yes, they did. But \nthe McPeaks lost their savings, their home, their car, their jobs, \nprobably a good deal of self-esteem--although not on a moral basis; and \ntheir employers, of course, lost two highly skilled managers. So we \nmust pass health insurance reform in the form of this bill.\n  The bill we are considering is not a perfect solution and nobody has \nmade that claim. But it will go a long way toward ensuring that working \nAmericans and their families are able to keep the health insurance that \nthey have, if they lose or if they change jobs. This legislation will \nmean that families like the McPeak's, who have children with special \nneeds, will have the protection and have the security of insurance \ncoverage. And it will mean that talented and hard-working individuals \nwith new and creative ideas, entrepreneurs, will be free to go out and \nstart their own businesses, because of this reform bill, without the \nfear of losing their health insurance.\n  Again, I thank and congratulate Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for \ntheir enormous leadership that gives us this historic--and it is \nhistoric--chance to do something that Americans deserve and want so \nbadly. I conclude with a statement of administration policy. This is \njust for the edification of the membership.\n  I read from the administration's latest statement of administrative \npolicy:\n\n       Certain provisions included in the House-passed bill are so \n     controversial and so potentially damaging to the health care \n     system that they jeopardize enactment of the insurance reform \n     that Americans want signed\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\n     into law this year. Specifically, the inclusion of amendments \n     that, one, provide for medical savings accounts, MSA's; two, \n     deregulate multiple employer welfare arrangements--MEWA's; \n     three, impose federally defined caps on punitive and \n     noneconomic medical malpractice awards; four, undermine \n     Medicare fraud and abuse efforts; and, five, weaken the ban \n     on the sale of duplicative insurance policies to the Medicare \n     beneficiaries, would call into question the seriousness of \n     the commitment of the Senate to health insurance reform this \n     year.\n       The administration views such provisions as an effort to \n     undermine a bipartisan consensus on health reform. If such \n     amendments are adopted, they would create a grave risk to the \n     passage and enactment of this bipartisan legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia for an excellent presentation on the current legislation and \nalso for his really extraordinary leadership on the whole health care \nissue. As he mentioned, he was right in the vanguard of leaders when we \ndebated the more comprehensive program over a year ago. I think he is \ntireless, as a member of the Finance Committee, in pursuing good health \ncare policy. So I thank him for his comments. I am very hopeful he will \nbe involved during the course of debate on this measure, because he \nbrings great interest and knowledge to his comments.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I second those observations. Senator \nRockefeller has cared for a long time, as well, about a wide breadth of \nhealth issues, particularly as regards to children. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] be added as the \n66th cosponsor of the bill before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The next speaker is the leader of the Republican \nhealth care task force. Senator Bennett has been a very, very strong \nand constructive Member of the Senate, working with health care issues. \nI have certainly valued his advice and support in this endeavor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for her \nkind and generous words. It has been an interesting odyssey for me to \nget involved in the health care issue. It came up in the 1992 campaign, \nwhen I ran for the Senate in the first instance. I must confess, the \nfirst time the question came up I was pretty much stumped for any kind \nof an answer as to what we ought to do on health care. I do not like \nbeing stumped for an answer, so I have plunged into this issue ever \nsince I have been in the Senate, and the more I get into it, the more \ncertain things become clear.\n  One of the things that is very clear is that we need insurance reform \nnow. It is something we can do now. And we should be careful not to \nattempt a complete overhaul of the system just to get insurance reform. \nThat was one of the errors, in my view, that was made strategically by \nthe President of the then majority party in the last Congress.\n  I always said, and repeat again, that the President deserves credit \nfor having raised this issue. It is such a thorny issue that the \ninstinct of most politicians is to flee from it. I learned in the days \nwhen I was working with the Congress, before I came here, that all you \nneeded to do in order to defeat a bill was, not convince Congress that \nit was a bad bill, all you had to do was convince them that it was a \ncontroversial bill and they would flee from the controversy. So I \nsalute the President and have always done so, since coming to the \nSenate, for his courage in raising the issue.\n  But in the last Congress, I seriously departed from the President \nbecause of his insistence that the entire system had to be fixed at \nonce with a single bill and a single Congress. I thought that was the \nheight of arrogance and, ultimately, it proved to be impossible.\n  I remind people that the Clinton health care plan was not voted down \nin the 103d Congress. It simply died, collapsed of its own weight, and \na vote was never taken on it because it could never be put together in \nsuch fashion that it was ready for a vote.\n  So I commend the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from \nMassachusetts in their willingness to say, ``Let's step aside from the \nattempt to do everything in a single bill. Let's pick out the most \npressing problems and see if we can address those.''\n  Those of us who tried to put forth this strategy in the last Congress \nwere attacked as incrementalists, and we were denounced as being \ninsufficiently compassionate and concerned. I do not know anybody in \nthis body who is more compassionate and more concerned than the Senator \nfrom Kansas. I stand now to say that the incremental approach that we \nproposed in the 103d Congress is now bearing fruit in the 104th, \nprimarily due to her leadership and her compassion and her concern. So \nI am delighted to be a cosponsor of the bill and to participate in this \ndebate.\n  I do have to make a few general observations, however, before I get \ninto talking about this bill, so that people who have heard me on \nhealth care in the past will know that I have not abandoned those \nobservations.\n  I believe that we have the system that we have in the country today \nprimarily because of the tax laws in this country. We have a system \nthat is distorted, for a whole series of reasons. Not to go through the \nwhole litany but to, again, lay down certain principles so that I am \nnot accused of abandoning them, we have not one health care system in \nthis country but two.\n  The first one is the delivery system, and it is run by doctors and \nnurses and hospital administrators and researchers and research \nhospitals and foundations and all of the rest of it, and it is \ndedicated to delivering the finest health care medical result for our \ncitizens as possibly can be.\n  The second system is the payment system, and it is run by insurance \ncompanies and adjustors and, to a very large extent, the Federal \nGovernment. Forty percent of the health care bills in this country are \npaid by the Federal Government.\n  The payment system, to a certain extent and certainly to a larger \nextent than is proper, in my view, distorts the delivery system. \nDelivery system decisions are made on the basis of payment system \ndecisions, and that is where we get into all of the difficulty, in my \nview.\n\n  If we could devise a way that the delivery system goes forward with \nthe focus primarily on producing the best medical result for the \npatient, undistorted by the payment system, we would have the ultimate \ncircumstance.\n  If I may give us an example--I realize it is not perfect, but it is \none we ought to look at--I have been in Shriners hospitals. The \nShriners raise every dollar that they spend for health care, which \nmeans that they do not interface with a single insurance company or a \nsingle Government bureaucrat. They simply raise the money to pay the \nbill for the kids, and they make the decision as to what will be done \nin a Shriners hospital solely and entirely on the question of medical \nneed.\n  Here is the result of not having to deal with insurance companies or \nthe Government at the Shriners Hospital in Salt Lake City: The cost per \nday, per-bed night, or whatever the appropriate medical term is, in the \nShriners Hospital in Salt Lake City is $95. What could we do in medical \ncosts if the per-night cost in a hospital were $95 for every 24-hour \nperiod?\n  The administrative costs of running the Shriners hospital system are \n4 percent, which means that 96 percent of every dollar they raise to \ntake care of the medical needs of these kids goes to the kids and only \n4 percent goes to administration.\n  That is what happens when you do not have to deal with an insurance \ncompany or with the Government bureaucrat. That is the goal for which \nwe should aspire somewhere out there to clean up the enormous costs and \ncomplexity of the system in which we are engaged.\n  I think the answer to that lies in restructuring our tax laws in the \nway we deal with health insurance. That is a speech I have given \nbefore; it is not a speech I will give today, but I lay that down \nbecause I do not want anyone who is listening to me to think that for \none moment I have abandoned that as my ultimate goal: To get to the \ncircumstance where we clear up the enormous complexities that now beset \nthe whole health care issue.\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\n  That having been said then, Mr. President, let me address S. 1028 and \nmy support for it. As I said at the outset, I believe in the \nincremental approach. I believe that when you are dealing with a \ntrillion dollars' worth of economic activity, trying to fix it all at \nonce with a single piece of legislation is a major mistake, and I think \nwe learned that lesson in the 103d Congress.\n\n  The most pressing issue for most Americans is the question of job \nlock, the question of insurance through the employer keeping people \ntied to a particular employer or to a particular job.\n  During the campaign, whenever this came up, I had a little exercise I \nwould go through, and it never failed to produce exactly the same \nresult. As people would turn to me and say, ``What is the biggest \nproblem with health insurance,'' I would answer with a question. I \nwould say, ``How many of you here know of someone--either yourself, a \nmember of your family, or friend--who is locked in a job he or she \nhates because he or she is afraid to lose health insurance?''\n  I would just sit back and watch the hands go up, and they would \nalways go up in sufficient number around the room to make my point: \nThat portability of health insurance is, for most Americans concerned \nwith this issue, the No. 1 challenge, and portability of health \ninsurance is at the core of S. 1028.\n  If we can make it possible for people to ultimately control their own \ndestiny and not be under the control of their employer, then we have \nsolved the problem for many, many Americans.\n  I am not one who subscribes to the statistics about the tremendous \nnumber of uninsured. I point out that for most of the uninsured, they \nare just passing through that category. I give this example.\n  In my own family, I have a son who, when he turned 24, went off the \nfamily policy. The insurance company says he should be through with \nschool at age 24. I said, ``I agree with you he should be through with \nschool at age 24, but he's not, so what do we do?''\n  Well, I called him up and said, ``Jim, go down to the student health \ncenter and sign up for the student health policy at the University of \nSouthern California.''\n  He said, ``Sure, dad, I'll take care of that.''\n  Those of you who have children know that it took about 6 months for \nhim to finally get around to taking care of that. During that 6-month \nperiod, he was one of those statistics of the uninsured. He had gone \noff my policy because he was too old to be a dependent and he had not \ngotten around to signing up with the other, and so he ended up in that \nstatistical pool of the uninsured.\n  Frankly, it is not my son, Jim, we are worried about here. It is the \npeople who, in that statistical pool, have a real problem.\n  I raise that only because I think it is unfair to use the huge \nstatistical number of 37 or 40 million or whatever it may be, to try to \nhighlight the problem that is really severe and significant for roughly \na third or even a quarter of that number. But the people who are in \nthat quarter, the 10 million, whatever, have real problems, and this \nbill addresses those problems.\n  We should understand that this terror of losing health insurance that \nhas caused job lock can become more than just a personal problem for \nthe individual involved. It can have consequences throughout the entire \neconomy.\n  The Senator from West Virginia spoke about the entrepreneurs who \nleave a secure business to go start another one. I have been one of \nthose entrepreneurs and had the experience of walking out of a secure \ncompany where I had health insurance, being told, ``OK, you have COBRA \ncoverage for 18 months, and in that 18-month period, good luck in \nlining up some other kind of health insurance.''\n  I was able to line up another kind of health insurance for me, but \ndiscovered a very difficult problem. My secretary, who left with me \nwhen I left the company to start my own activity, was also covered by \nCOBRA, and in that COBRA period while we were putting together a health \ninsurance plan for our little tiny company--just the two of us; we were \nthe only two employees--she came into my office one day and said she \nhad to see a doctor, she was not feeling well. She came back from the \nappointment and said, ``I have a brain tumor. It is operable. It can be \nhandled, but the problem of dealing with it is going to take a \ntimeframe longer than the 18 months of COBRA. What are we going to \ndo?''\n  I will not bore the Senate with the details. We were able to solve \nthe problem. We were able, through the State of Utah and some of the \nthings that it does on health insurance, to find an insurance pool that \nwould accept her. But I saw firsthand how difficult that can be. People \nwho are normal and healthy and have no problems at all in the 18-month \nperiod of COBRA are suddenly faced with this kind of circumstance.\n  So that is why I have joined in cosponsoring S. 1028. It is focused \non a single problem. It is not an attempt to solve all of the issues \nsimultaneously and thereby get gummed up in all of the challenges that \nface our health insurance and health care problems. It deals with the \nmost pressing problem for most Americans who fall in this category. It \ndoes so in such a way that it does not close the door to the kinds of \nsolutions I want to see down the road. It does not close the door to \nthe kind of tax reform that I think will ultimately bring us the \nultimate health care solution.\n\n  So, for those who say, ``Well, Senator Bennett, you have been a voice \nfor the entrepreneurial approach, the market approach, and don't \nendorse anything until you can restructure everything,'' I say, we have \nnot got that luxury. We have to deal with the problem of job lock, the \nproblem of portability of health insurance as quickly as we can, even \nas we have these other discussions for the solution a long way down the \nroad.\n  Again, Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Kansas for her \nleadership and her tenacity. I say, as I have said before, that the \nloss of her membership in this body will be keenly felt. She brings an \naura of civility and intelligence, combined with a tenacity and a sense \nof steel in her back that sometimes her pleasant exterior will cause \npeople to misjudge. We have been honored with her service in the \nSenate. I think this will be a monument to her service in the Senate. I \nam delighted to be one of those who raises a voice in support of that \nconcept. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to express appreciation \nto the Senator from Utah, who gave such a very thoughtful opening \nstatement, I think, by example, showing concretely why the provisions \nof this bill are important. I know that the majority leader, the senior \nSenator from Kansas, has also over the years been cognizant of the very \nthings that Senator Bennett, as the leader of the Republican health \ncare task force, spoke so eloquently and sincerely about. I am very \nappreciative.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand there are a number of my \ncolleagues who wish to make opening statements. I just want to indicate \nthat I am prepared to offer the so-called tax amendment. We are trying \nto get some agreement that is acceptable on both sides as far as a \nmotion to strike one provision of that. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat, following opening statements, I be recognized to offer the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. First of all, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont for permitting me to go ahead of him. I know he \nhas been waiting. I assured him my statement would be brief, so I am \ngoing to be held to that.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my \nsupport for the Kassebaum-Kennedy health reform legislation. The \nsponsors of this legislation have worked for a number of years to enact \nreforms in the private insurance market. I applaud them for their \nconsiderable efforts in bringing this legislation to the floor.\n  It is interesting to note this legislation is quite similar to that \nwhich Senator Durenberger first presented in\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nthe Finance Committee, as I recall, or perhaps in the Labor Committee \nseveral years ago. Although he has left the Senate, I think he would be \npleased to know we are making progress with the legislation he was so \ninvolved with.\n  In the wake of attempts in recent years to completely overhaul our \nhealth care system, this legislation has been characterized, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah noted, as incremental. It has been \ncriticized as even meager. But I urge my colleagues, as the Senator \nfrom Utah noted, not to underestimate the importance of this \nlegislation.\n  One of the major failings of our health care system in this country \nis the difficulty thousands of Americans face each year when they \nchange jobs or look for new jobs. But they find they cannot change jobs \nbecause they will no longer be eligible for health insurance. This is \nwhat is known in the trade as ``job lock.'' This problem for many \nAmericans would be addressed under the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Insurers \nwould be required to offer coverage, with no preexisting condition \nexclusions, for those moving from one group plan to another or from a \ngroup plan to an individual plan.\n  I expect, Mr. President, we will see many amendments to this \nproposal, many of which I have supported in the past. Though laudable, \nthese additional provisions could jeopardize the more immediate and \nimportant goal of enacting insurance market reforms. Those of us who \nworked to enact health care reform 2 years ago know all too well the \nconsequences of attempting to do too much with respect to health care \nreform. We failed to enact comprehensive health care reform in 1994. \nYou try to do too much and you end up getting nothing. We have been \nthrough that experience, Mr. President, not only with the health care \nmeasure that we tried in 1994, but in other efforts in the past.\n  In the last 2 years, over a million Americans lost their health \ninsurance coverage. Although this proposal, the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nproposal, does not include many of the health reforms which I advocated \n2 years ago, I strongly support its enactment as a sound first step \ntoward reform and improvement in our Nation's health care system.\n  So I congratulate the two principal cosponsors of this legislation \nand am delighted to be listed as a cosponsor myself. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He, too, has \nbeen a long-time worker in the vineyards of health care, a staunch \nleader in the last Congress to find some answers and to bring people \ntogether to present health care reform. I value his support in helping \nus work through the language in this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nTheresa Stathas, a fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for the duration of the consideration of S. 1028.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill. Before I do that, I want to express my deep \nappreciation for the efforts that were put in, in 1994, by Senator \nChafee, in trying to reach a consensus on what we can do to move health \ncare forward. We worked long and hard, many of us, and the issues which \nwe are involved with today in S. 1028 were some of those which gave us \nthe greatest concern.\n  I also want to thank Senator Bennett for his work with the Republican \ntask force on health care. His work has been invaluable to us as we \nmove forward to try and find, again, the kind of consensus that is \nnecessary to get us good health care reform. What a refreshing \nexperience it is to have Senator Frist with us, who has given us the \ninvaluable knowledge of a practicing physician, who kept us from going \ntoo far astray in our efforts. It is wonderful that we have this kind \nof a coalition. Senator Rockefeller, who I have worked with, also, is \nso helpful in the health care reform area.\n  I am beginning to feel confident that we will do something \nconstructive here in health care reform, and hopefully it will happen \nin the next few days. Of course, my chairman and my ranking member, \nSenator Kennedy, who both have shown outstanding leadership in getting \nour committee to come out 16 to 0 on a bill, this is a miracle in \nitself. I am deeply appreciative of all their efforts.\n  I rise in support of the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform \nAct. If we send this legislation to the President, the 104th Congress \nwill be remembered in history for taking the first steps toward real \nmarket-based health care reform. Market reform is not as easy as it may \nsound, for the simple reason you must take into consideration the \nState's responsibility for regulating insurance versus the Federal \nresponsibility for regulating ERISA, employee benefit plans.\n  That word, ERISA, is one that troubles many. The reason it troubles \npeople is because there is not much there. We have the authority and \nthe responsibility to provide good health care conditions for the self-\nfunded plans, but we have exempted the self-funded plans from State \nregulations. That is why we are here today and why this is an important \nmove forward.\n  Finding the right balance between insurance regulation and employee \nbenefits, while trying to incrementally reform the market, is something \nlike mastering the Rubic's cube. Just when you think you have all the \nsides lined up, you find out one square is out of place. Last August, \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee lined up that Rubic's cube and \nit all seemed right with the world.\n  As I mentioned, in a unanimous 16 to 0 vote, the committee voted \nfavorably on S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995. I must \ncommend the chairman and the ranking member for that incredible feat. \nIt is not an easy task putting together a health care reform bill that \nevery member of the committee can vote for, but it happened. The Health \nInsurance Reform Act makes great strides in addressing many of the \nproblems in the insured market and also begins to level the playing \nfield in the self-funded ERISA market by apply the same national rules \nto both segments of the marketplace.\n  Chairman Kassebaum's approach from the beginning was to build a bill \naround two areas of consensus--portability and elimination of \ndiscriminatory treatment of preexisting condition rules. The Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill provides Americans the security of knowing that their \nhealth insurance will be portable from job to job and that all people \nwho have insurance today will be able to purchase affordable insurance \ntomorrow even if they get sick. That is a critical phrase--even if they \nget sick, or change or lose their jobs.\n  This is accomplished by converting the rules in today's insurance \nmarket which reward excluding people into rules where health plans can \ntake all comers. There is a tendency to want to exclude sick people, \nnaturally. You make more money if that happens. This will step in and \nsay, ``Hey, no.'' S. 1028 provides much-needed improvements at the \nnational level, but at the same time allows States the flexibility they \nneed to move ahead in their own reform efforts.\n  As we attempt to make coverage more widely available, we must also \nnot lose sight of affordability, particularly in a market where \nemployers and individuals are not mandated to purchase insurance. We \nmust be very careful as we reform the insurance market, because if we \nare not, reforms that we hope will reduce costs and improve access may \ndo just the opposite.\n  How is this possible? Today, over 92 percent of the people who have \nprivate health coverage are part of a group--92 percent are part of a \ngroup. Most of these people get it through their employer under an \nERISA health benefit plan. The key concern regarding ERISA is the risk \nsegmentation that occurs in the private market due to the preemption \nclause. ERISA preemption effectively blocks States from regulating most \nemployer-based health plans. ERISA preempts States from being in this \narea.\n  Although many employers still purchase health coverage from a State-\nregulated health insurer that is subject to State insurance regulation, \nemployer plans that cover 44 million people have elected to self-fund \nand avoid\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nthe State insurance laws. These laws deal with financial solvency, \nmarket conduct, benefit coverage, and premium taxes. States impose \ntaxes on insurers for general revenues, as well as for financing \nspecific programs like State guaranty funds and high-risk pools.\n  Preemption made a lot of sense 20 years ago when the multistate \nemployers and unions were looking for a way to offer uniform benefits \nto employees throughout the country. Most of the plans were offered \nthrough insurers. Most of the plans were offered through insurers. As \nStates started to weigh down the insured market with mandated benefits, \nemployers saw self-funding as a means of flexibility and plan design.\n  These are two reasons why employers have left the insured \nmarketplace. In a preliminary report I just received from GAO, the \nestimated additional costs of these mandated benefits range from a high \nin Maryland of 22 percent additional cost and low in Iowa of 5 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of the GAO \npreliminary estimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    General Accounting Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1996.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The Congress is considering \n     proposals intended to enhance the availability of health \n     insurance. This debate has led to specific questions about \n     the state regulation of health plans, including mandated \n     benefit laws. In particular, you asked us to provide \n     information on--\n       1. state requirements affecting fully insured health plans \n     and how they compare with federal requirements affecting \n     self-funded health plans,\n       2. the number of states that have enacted particular \n     mandated benefit laws,\n       3. estimates of the costs of mandated benefits in \n     particular states, and\n       4. the extent to which commonly mandated benefits are \n     provided by self-funded health plans that are exempt from \n     state laws.\n       This letter provides interim information based on our \n     ongoing work for you on the factors affecting the costs of \n     state health insurance regulation. As part of this effort, we \n     interviewed officials from the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); several state insurance \n     commissions; and national organizations representing \n     actuaries, health insurers, and self-funded employers. We \n     reviewed documents and used data provided by these groups as \n     well as available studies on mandated benefits. In addition, \n     we included and updated information from previous GAO reports \n     on state insurance regulation and the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Our review was conducted \n     between January and March 1996 in accordance with \n     generally accepted government auditing standards. We \n     expect to issue a report to you later this year that will \n     provide a more detailed analysis of the factors affecting \n     the costs of state health insurance regulation.\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       We found that states have an average of 18 mandated \n     benefits that health insurers must cover but the number of \n     mandated benefits varies from a low of 6 in Idaho to a high \n     of 39 in Maryland. However, assessing the costs of mandated \n     benefits is difficult because their impact varies depending \n     on state laws and employer practices. Published studies \n     provide a range of cost estimates. For example, a recent \n     study found that Virginia's mandated benefits accounted for \n     about 12 percent of claims costs; earlier studies estimated \n     that mandated benefits in Maryland cost 22 percent of claims \n     and in Iowa cost 5 percent of claims. In general, cost \n     estimates are higher in states with more mandated benefits \n     and in states that mandate more costly benefits, such as \n     mental health services and substance abuse treatment. We also \n     found that self-funded health plans often offer similar \n     benefits, even though they are exempt from state-mandated \n     benefit laws. For example, a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick \n     found that a large percentage of self-funded health plans \n     offer benefits similar to those mandated for health insurers \n     in many states.\n\n\nregulatory framework depends on whether a health plan is fully insured \n                             or self-funded\n\n       While states are able to regulate health insurance, state \n     regulation does not directly affect everyone with private \n     health coverage. ERISA preempts states from directly \n     regulating employer provision of health plans. This results \n     in a very different regulatory framework depending on whether \n     an employer purchases its health care coverage from an \n     insurer that the state regulates or self-funds its health \n     plan is not directly affected by state regulation.\\1\\\n       States focus their regulation on the financial soundness of \n     insurers and their market conduct, including benefit \n     coverage. In addition, states impose taxes on insurers for \n     general revenues as well as for financing specific programs. \n     While federal requirements include fiduciary and other \n     responsibilities, in many other areas no federal requirements \n     exist for self-funded health plans that are comparable to \n     state requirements for health insurers. In particular, self-\n     funded health plans are exempt from state laws that mandate \n     insurers to include coverage for specific benefits. Table 1 \n     companies the requirements that fully insured and self-funded \n     health plans must meet.\n\n TABLE 1.--COMPARISON OF RELEVANT STATE AND FEDERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING\n               FULLY INSURED AND SELF-FUNDED HEALTH PLANS               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 State insurance      ERISA provisions  \n                                   regulations         affecting self-  \n                                 affecting fully        funded health   \n                              insured health plans        plans\\1\\      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial requirements:                                                 \n    Licensing...............

(See table 3.) Among the most recent, the \n     Virginia State Corporation Commission has required insurers \n     to report cost and utilization information annually for each \n     of the mandated benefits in the state. Overall, the \n     commission reports that Virginia's mandated benefits \n     accounted for about 12 percent of group health insurance \n     claims in 1993. An earlier study in Maryland, the state with \n     the most mandated benefits, estimated that mandated benefits \n     represent 22 percent of average claims costs in 1988. At the \n     other extreme, a 1987 study in Iowa estimated that the \n     potential costs of introducing several commonly mandated \n     benefits would be about 5 percent of claims costs.\n\n TABLE 3.--STUDIES OF THE COSTS OF MANDATED BENEFITS IN SELECTED STATES \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Percent of\n                                                                total   \n                      State                          Year       claims  \n                                                                costs   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaryland.........................................      1988         22.0\nMassachusetts....................................      1990         18.0\nVirginia.........................................      1993         12.2\nOregon...........................................      1989          8.1\nWisconsin\\1\\.....................................      1989          7.9\nIowa\\2\\..........................................      1987          5.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes six mandated benefits: alcohol and other drug abuse        \n  treatment, chiropractic care, diabetes care, home health care, skilled\n  nursing facility care, and kidney disease treatment.                  \n\\2\\ The study in Iowa examined potential costs of six commonly mandated \n  benefits, including mental health, alcohol and drug abuse,            \n  podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, and physical therapists.\n  Iowa has not adopted all of these mandates; according to the Blue     \n  Cross and Blue Shield Association, Iowa's current mandates are        \n  mammography screening, well-child care, chiropractors, dentists,      \n  registered nurses, optometrists, and diabetic education.              \n\n       To some extent, the differences in the cost estimates \n     reported by the various studies are related to the number of \n     mandated benefits included in each state. For example, the \n     studies that showed the highest estimated costs were for \n     Maryland and Massachusetts, states that have more mandated \n     benefits than most states. Thus, these cost estimates cannot \n     be generalized to other states.\n       While the studies report varying cumulative costs in \n     different states, they generally agree that several specific \n     mandated benefits account for a large share of the additional \n     costs. In particular, mental health and substance abuse \n     are often cited as the most costly mandated benefits \n     whereas other commonly mandated benefits, such as \n     mammography screening, account for fewer than 1 percent of \n     costs. Furthermore, in some cases, mandated benefits \n     covering services offered by some alternative types of \n     providers, such as nurse midwives, may reduce costs \n     because they substitute for more costly forms of care. \n     However, some provider mandated benefits may also increase \n     the demand for services, thereby increasing costs. For \n     example, while chiropractic services may be a less \n     expensive alternative for some treatments, mandating their \n     coverage may also lead to increased use.\n       One limitation of most studies on mandated benefits is that \n     they have examined the impact of mandated benefits on claims \n     costs, which does not necessarily capture the actual effect \n     on employers' costs. In particular, multistate employers note \n     that varying state-mandated benefits result in additional \n     administrative cost. Employers that purchase health insurance \n     must modify their plans to meet these differences in state-\n     mandated benefits. Furthermore, employers are concerned that \n     mandated benefits limit their flexibility in designing the \n     most cost-effective health benefit plan to best meet the \n     needs of their employees.\n\n\n  self-funded health plans often cover benefits commonly mandated by \n                                 states\n\n       The actual cost impact of mandated benefits to employers \n     also depends on whether the employer offers a comprehensive \n     or limited health plan, which in turn is often related to the \n     size of the employer. Many of the commonly mandated benefits \n     are often offered by employers, even those who self-fund and \n     are not subject to the state mandates. In general, large \n     employers are more likely to self-fund their health plans and \n     also tend to offer more comprehensive benefits than small \n     employers. For small employers, who typically purchase fully \n     insured health plans and are less likely to offer health \n     coverage at all, mandates may impose claims costs for \n     benefits that they otherwise might not have covered.\n       Studies have shown that self-funded health plans typically \n     offer many of the benefits that are commonly mandated by \n     states for fully insured health plans. For example, as shown \n     in figure 2, a KPMG Peat Marwick survey of employer benefits \n     among all firm sizes indicates that self-funded health plans \n     are more likely to offer well-child care outpatient alcohol \n     treatment, outpatient drug treatment, mental health benefits, \n     and chiropractic care than fully insured health plans. This \n     survey also reports similar patterns for other benefits that \n     are not typically mandated, including prescription drugs, \n     adult physicals, and dental benefits.\\3\\ Similarly, a survey \n     of Wisconsin insurers also found that: ``self-funded health \n     plans provide at least as many of the managed benefits as \n     insured health plans and in some cases provide more generous \n     coverage.''\n       This result may partially be due to the tendency of large \n     employers to both self-fund and offer more comprehensive \n     benefits.\n       Although self-funded plans often offer the same types of \n     benefits as are commonly mandated by states for insurers, \n     they may include features that differ from the requirements \n     of state mandates. For example, state mandates generally \n     specify a minimum number of days of care that insurers must \n     cover for inpatient mental health care. One employer \n     association indicated that many employers prefer designing \n     more flexible mental health benefits; for example, requiring \n     case management rather than specifying a limited number of \n     days of care. Thus, even though 97 percent of self-funded \n     plans offer inpatient mental health care services, all these \n     plans would not meet the state requirement for fully insured \n     health plans.\n       Assessing the cost differences between self-funded and \n     fully insured health plans resulting from mandated benefits \n     is difficult. To the extent that self-funded health plans \n     offer benefits that are similar to state-mandated benefits, \n     they do not have lower claims costs due to their exemption \n     from state-mandated benefit laws. For less commonly offered \n     benefits, such as in vitro fertilization, self-funded \n     employers would face additional claims costs if they were \n     required to meet the state mandates.\n       Please contact me at (202) 512-7119 or Michael Gutowski, \n     Assistant Director, at (202) 512-7128 if you or your staff \n     have any questions.

The majority of employers \n     purchase health coverage from a third-party insurer that is \n     subject to state insurance regulation. However, for plans \n     covering about 44 million people in 1993 the employer chose \n     to self-fund and retain at least some financial risk for its \n     health plan. Because these self-funded health plans are not \n     deemed to be insurance, ERISA preempts them from insurance \n     regulation and premium taxation. For a fuller discussion of \n     the regulatory differences, see Employer Based Health Plans \n     (GAO/HEHS-95-167, July 25, 1995).\n     \\2\\ The calculation of the number of mandated benefits \n     includes requirements that insurers provide or continue \n     coverage for specific populations, such as dependent \n     students, as a mandated benefit. Thus, the number of mandated \n     benefits per state includes these requirements as well as \n     treatment-related and provider-related mandated benefits. See \n     Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, State Legislative \n     Health Care and Insurance Issuers: 1995 Survey of Plans \n     (Washington, D.C.: Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, \n     1995) for a list of mandated benefits for each state.\n     \\3\\ The data in figure 2 represent the percentage of covered \n     workers in conventional health plans. KPMG Peat Marwick \n     reports similar findings for workers in preferred provider \n     organizations and point-of-service plans that are either \n     self-funded or fully insured. KPMG Peat Marwick is currently \n     examining to what extent these differences in the rates of \n     benefits coverage among self-funded and fully insured health \n     plans can be explained by differences in firm size and \n     premium levels.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Because the employer frequently pays a significant \nportion of the premium, a large majority of the eligible employee--both \nyoung and old, sick and healthy--choose to enroll in an employer-\nsponsored plan. Since so many people participate in group plans, the \naverage per employee price of coverage stays relatively low and remains \naffordable for each employee, since the insurance risk is spread over a \nlarge pool of people.\n  The individual market, on the other hand, contrasts in many ways from \nthe group market. For instance, those who buy individual health \ninsurance pay the entire premium out of their own pockets, whereas, in \nmost cases, a business picks up most of the tab. If an individual buys \nit, it is out of his own pocket. Not only do the people receive no \nsubsidy from the employer, they also do not receive the same tax \nadvantages afforded to employer-sponsored health plans. This is a \ncritical difference. Therefore, costs to the individual is a major \nconcern. When individuals leave a group coverage situation\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nand decide not to purchase in the individual market, it is because they \ncannot afford it or because they are healthy and have decided they do \nnot need the coverage and do not want to pay the amount of money they \nwould have to pay.\n  The individual market is so price sensitive, as prices go up, healthy \nand less costly people leave the market, causing the prices to continue \nto spiral upward. This vicious cycle makes it inevitable that \nindividual coverage will become less affordable for hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of Americans.\n  What is the solution? We must encourage purchasing cooperatives in \nthe individual and small group market. Group purchasing is the first \ntool to bring down costs of individuals. The key concern regarding \nERISA is the risk of segmentation.\n  I was very pleased when Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy included in \nthe health plan purchasing coalition section my own bill which I \noffered with Senator Nunn, S. 1062. I believe that the key to making \nhealth insurance more affordable for individuals and small employers is \nproperly designed voluntary group purchasing arrangements.\n  Employer group purchasing is not in the concept. Many employers have \nbeen pooling funds and contracting with entrepreneurs to offer health \nbenefits to their employees at reduced rates for many years through \nsomething defined as multiple employer welfare arrangements, referred \nto as MEWA's, under ERISA. A MEWA is an arrangement where two or more \nemployers group together to purchase health benefits. The more that \ngroup together, the lower the per employee cost or employer cost.\n  While a number of MEWA's form important gaps in our health care \nsystem, some MEWA administrators have taken advantage of the confusion \nas to who bears responsibility for regulatory oversight, the Feds or \nthe States. It is very, very confusing. They have been able to create \nand run ponzi schemes, designed to take premium payments with no \nintention of covering any major health claims. My esteemed cosponsor of \nS. 1062, Senator Nunn, led the effort to uncover the corruption of \nfraudulent MEWA's when he chaired the Senate Permanent Committee on \nInvestigations. He was instrumental in drafting the section of the bill \nthat addresses MEWA reform. It is important. I bring it up, also, as I \nwill mention later, because of what is in the House bill.\n  The bill Senator Nunn and I introduced makes clear, once and for all, \nthat the States are responsible for regulating all MEWA's. Therefore, \nthe number of States that have moved forward in this area will no \nlonger have to be involved in costly litigation, using precious State \nresources, to prove they are regulated.\n  I must say, I am very concerned about the way the House bill handles \nthe group purchasing in the small group market. First, continuing to \nsegment the market by creating different rules for insured and self-\ninsured MEWA's is a mistake.\n  Second, giving the Department of Labor the additional responsibility \nof now being the insurance regulator for all self-insured MEWA's takes \naway a current State responsibility and hands it over to the Federal \nGovernment. This seems totally inconsistent with the philosophy and \nfiscal reality of less Federal Government and more responsibility for \nthe States. I think we should be careful when we are looking at this in \nthe conference committee.\n  Requiring purchasing cooperatives to offer only fully insured \nproducts, as in the case of S. 1028, is a much better solution. \nAlthough the group purchasing section of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is \ngood, I hope we will be able to improve upon it in conference with the \nHouse. I hope we can take the lead from Governor Whitman accomplished \nin New Jersey. She saw the need to look at the impact overburdened \nState-mandated benefits laws can have in a small group market and \ndeveloped a variety of distinct benefit packages that small employers \ncan choose to purchase for their employees. This strikes me as a \ncritical step at expanding health care coverage.\n  Fixing what is broken in our current health insurance system should \nbe what is accomplished in this year of incremental reform. Although I \nbelieve the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is a good bill, I believe it can be \na great one. That is the main reason Senator Simon and I plan to offer \nan amendment that would raise lifetime limits, caps, to $10 million. We \nwant to ensure that this bill lives up to its basic promise. What good \ndoes it do to pass a law that prevents insurers from excluding \nindividuals with preexisting conditions if you let employers set \nlifetime caps at $50,000--which is probably 1 day or 1 week for those \npeople--to meet the needs of those conditions?\n  It is critically important, in my mind, that we make sure that we \nmake this remain a good bill and that we pass a good bill. I will \nmention that I offered this amendment in committee, and they said at \nthat time that we wanted to come out with a 16 to 0 bill. This was the \nstep that people have to understand--that I would not offer this in \ncommittee, but I said I would offer it on the floor. There was some \nconcern raised about having amendments to this bill. But I point out \nthat this is important to the bill in order to make it work.\n  This is not an extraneous amendment, unrelated to the purpose of the \nbill. If we do not prevent insurers from reducing lifetime caps, then \nwe have the very likely situation where they will reduce the caps if \nthey have to take sick people in. If we do that, we will have lost the \ngreat benefit of what we are trying to do today.\n\n  Let me talk about the lifetime cap amendment. In a letter I received \nfrom the American Academy of Actuaries addressing my amendment, they \nstated:\n\n       . . . this amendment is unlike State mandates that require \n     coverage of specific medical services. This is a Federal \n     mandate that appears to greatly increase the security \n     provided plan participants by raising their potential \n     benefits to $10 million.\n\n  This is also important. CBO has estimated that premiums would only \nincrease by 0.16 of a percent, while at the same time reducing Federal \nand State expenditures in the Medicaid Program. So what we would do is \nto prevent the horrendous situation we have now.\n  How do you take care of the sick people in this country that have an \ninsurance policy that has a lifetime cap? What happens? You reach the \ncap and then you have to, under the present situation, drain all your \nresources until you are poor. And then you apply for Medicaid, and you \nare eligible for Medicaid. I want to point out that I think that is a \nterrible way to handle things.\n  I also point out that other information that we have received from \nreputable organizations has backed us up in the fact that this is a de \nminimus cost to most employers, and it is a huge benefit to the Federal \nbudget. The National Taxpayers Union has said that the net savings \ncould be as much as $2 billion in Federal savings and $3 billion in \nState and local savings by just passing this amendment, at a very \nminimal cost to employers.\n  As U.S. Senators, we have the peace of mind in knowing that our \nhealth insurance will be there if a catastrophic illness or injury \nstrikes one of our families. In our plan, there is no cap. Anything can \nbe covered. In a large number of HMO's, there are no lifetime caps, and \nin some other group policies there are no lifetime caps. So I want to \nfocus your attention on that. Hopefully, in the time before I offer the \namendment, you will learn more about this and agree with us.\n  For now, I would like to, once again, commend both Senators Kassebaum \nand Kennedy for bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for its passage. I am hopeful that when we \nfinally do get to my amendment, you will keep in mind that what we will \ndo will be almost an unmentionable expense to most employers, but will \nsave people from incredible experiences of having to go through \nbankruptcy in order to get health care coverage, and also will allow us \nto reduce the cost of Medicaid to State, local, and Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Karen \nDavenport, a fellow in my office, be allowed privileges of the Senate \nfloor during our debate and consideration of S. 1028.\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to support the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill, S. 1028. I believe it is a long-overdue change. As the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and others have said already, it is regarded by some \nas very incremental. I regard it as one of those very important pieces \nof legislation.\n\n  Earlier, we enacted a piece of legislation, ironically, that Senator \nKassebaum actually took the lead on last year, which consolidated the \njob training programs and gave the States a lot more flexibility in \ndesigning their own programs. I said at the time that I thought this \nlaw was the second most important thing we could take up this year \nbecause we know, with certainty, that it is going to effect some 20 \nmillion people. It does not cost the taxpayers any money. It does make \na change of the law, the Federal law and will alter the way the market \nworks. But it is not the first time that we have interfered with the \nhealth care market.\n  One of the most expensive interferences that we have with the health \ncare market is that we allow health insurance to be deducted with \noffsets against FICA by employers, as well. It is a very important \ndeduction, but it also must be seen by citizens as an interference with \nthe market because it is for upper income people in particular. For \npeople like myself, if I am buying private health insurance, it \nprovides me with a substantial subsidy.\n  It has been a very important way to allow people who otherwise would \nnot be able to purchase health insurance to buy it. So it is not as if \nthis kind of action is without precedent. There is no doubt that close \nto 21 million Americans will be positively affected by this. They will \nbe able to purchase with their own money health insurance, and still in \nmany cases it is going to be quite high. But nonetheless they are going \nto have an opportunity to buy it. They are not going to be denied the \nopportunity to purchase. It does not obliterate the high-risk pool \nStates like Nebraska. We started one when I was Governor. It does not \naffect States that worked on this for years to try to provide some way \nto have all of us share a bit of the risk.\n  This bill, as I see it, is designed to accommodate or rather \nradically change the economy where we are seeing a lot of downsizing, \nparticularly in larger corporations. You have individuals that are \ncovered by group policies from those corporations. They will find \nthemselves very quickly running out of their benefits and having to \npurchase individual policies. And very often they find themselves faced \nwith the inability to make the purchase. This law will basically say we \nare all going to share the risk of that in the marketplace so that \nthese individuals can make the purchase. As has already been pointed \nout, nearly 25 percent of all working Americans who have private sector \njobs have job lock as a result of the lack of portability and the lack \nof ability to be able to purchase with preexisting conditions. Nearly \n3.8 million American workers lost their jobs in March. It is a rather \nsubstantial paradox that it has become a fact of life that even at a \ntime when the economy continues to grow, even as we have a recovery \nunderway, that we have layoffs that are close to the same number that \nwere occurring during the last recession that we experienced in the \nearly 1990's. Thus, this change in the law accommodates rather \nsubstantial change in our economy.\n  One of the things that a lot of us who are older--I am 52--sometimes \nfail to recognize is that the cost of health care as it has gone up has \nchanged the way people in the market, working people and particularly \nyounger people, face health care expenditures. For example, when my \nbabies were born 20 and 19 years ago I was able to pay cash for them. I \ndid not insure against the risk of having a baby because it was a \nrelatively modest amount of money. You paid for it out of pocket. It \nwas not considered to be a big deal. Today you need to be insured \nbecause the normal delivery is expensive. But almost any extended stay \nin the hospital can put a young family in a great deal of financial \ndistress.\n\n  That is just one of many, many examples that one could cite; a very \nrelevant example because it is a rather common experience. There are 4 \nmillion live births a year in the United States, and an awful lot of \nthose births are in families that are uninsured. This will make it more \nlikely that those families will have insurance and have coverage.\n  It certainly will not get us to where I would like to see us; and, \nthat is, at a point where every single American and legal resident \nknows with certainty that they have insurance. I hope this is a first \nstep.\n  I will support Senator Kassebaum's and Senator Kennedy's request to \nvote against all amendments. I believe that this bill needs to go \nacross in an amendment-free fashion. I do not know if I ever stated \nwhat Senator Kassebaum is going to support. But I believe this bill is \ntoo important for me to be supporting, as Senator Jeffords earlier \nindicated, an amendment that I would under normal circumstances \nsupport. I will vote against that amendment because I believe the bill \nneeds to be clean and clear. It came out of the Labor Committee with \nunanimous support. We have an opportunity to help 21 million Americans. \nI think it is very important, in spite of my respect for the Senator \nfrom Vermont and admiration for him personally, as well as my normal \ninclination to vote for that amendment. I believe an amendment-free \nstrategy is the right one to adopt.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that I think we need to do as we \nmove toward universal coverage--and I hope that is the goal--we spend \n$400 billion a year in Federal direct spending in tax benefits for \nhealth care. We spend a sufficient amount. If we would change the way \neligibility occurs, one of the things we have to do in order to be able \nto get there is we all have to face the true cost of health care and \nvery often we do not. Somebody else is paying for it. The insurance \ncompany is paying for it--the Government. So we really do not worry \nabout whether or not the bill is high or the bill is low. The more that \nwe can face that cost directly and understand that, if we do not have \nthe resources to pay for it--it is paid for out of an insurance pool, \npaid for with Medicaid or Medicare, somebody else is essentially paying \nour bills--the more that we can face that fact the more likely it is \nthat we will move quickly to a point where, if you are an American or \nlegal resident, you will know for certainty that you have health \ninsurance.\n  This morning June O'Neill, the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, appeared before the Senate Budget Committee and laid down a \nrather stark warning; that is, even if the President's budget or the \nRepublican budget were adopted, we still have not controlled the growth \nof entitlement programs. I say that to colleagues because I think once \nwe get beyond the Presidential election we are going face in 1997 a \nreally rather difficult fact. And I believe June O'Neill laid it out \nfor us this morning; that is, we have commitments on the mandatory side \nthat are going to make it difficult for us to fund education, to fund \ntransportation, to fund defense, to fund space, to fund law \nenforcement, and to fund all sorts of other things that are going on. \nUnfortunately, very often that occurs because people believe that they \nhave a right to something, that they have a benefit that actually is \npaid up, the money is all there, and it is set aside for them--no \nproblems, do not worry about it--when in fact that is not the case.\n\n  It gets back, it seems to me, to a problem that we have whether it is \nthe tax deductibility, or whether it is Medicare part B. There is sort \nof a sense that somebody else is paying for it. Why should I have to \nworry about it? As a consequence, we just are not engaged personally as \nwe ought to be in trying to control the cost of health care, and as a \nresult, it seems to me, it is difficult for us to take the next step.\n  So again I want to say how much I really appreciate very much and \napplaud the determination of the Senator from Kansas, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. They and the Labor Committee voted this out \nunanimously, and 21 million Americans will be affected positively. \nTaxpayers will not be on the hook for this thing. It has been measured. \nIt will cost no more than 2 percent in premiums across the country and \nwith reasonable changes in the law given what is happening out in the \nmarketplace.\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\n  I hope this body will pass it as quickly as possible and get it on to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the \ncomments of the Senator from Nebraska about my amendment. I point out \nthat, unlike all of the other amendments, this one is very relevant to \nthis bill and will improve the bill. It is not extraneous to it. If we \ndo not keep track of what the lifetime caps are, then this bill will be \na mockery because, if we require the insurers to take sick people on, \none way of getting out of that is to reduce the lifetime caps so that \nas soon as they come in they are out the other end. It was offered in \ncommittee with the understanding that it would be brought forward at \nthis time.\n  I just wanted to bring that to the Senator's attention and hope that \nI will make an exception to his decision in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very glad that this debate is \ntaking place before this body. Having had an opportunity on two \nseparate occasions to push concepts similar to what is in this \nlegislation to accomplish the same goal in maybe not exactly the same \nway, I am glad that we are here today and that there is a bipartisan \neffort to get this legislation passed. I think being truly bipartisan \nis a continuation on these issues of guaranteeing some health insurance \nto people who can afford it--things that we have tried to accomplish \nbefore in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I respect Secretary of Treasury Bentsen because when he was chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee he had proposals which I think were \nbipartisan with the ranking Republican at that time included in H.R. \n11, a major tax bill. And those health insurance provisions went \nthrough without any debate on the floor of this body because they were \naccepted as things that should be done. To see that happen was \ngood. Obviously, President Bush vetoed that bill because he did not \nlike the tax provisions that were in it.\n\n  Then, if you remember the next step, there was a fairly bipartisan \neffort to make these provisions part of basic law. It was during the \nhealth care reform debate of 1993 and 1994. They were relatively \nnoncontroversial provisions of much more controversial efforts by the \nClinton administration to have the Government totally dominant in the \ndelivery of health care in America and do it through a provision that \nwe called employer mandates, meaning every employer, large or small, \nwould have to provide health insurance to their employees.\n  Of course, that came down to total defeat in 1994 because the middle \nclass and the small business people of America woke up to a couple of \nthings: First, that small-business America could not afford an employer \nmandate because they could not pass it on to their consumers like big \ncorporations can do; second, middle-class, taxpaying people saw their \nrates going up, or if their rates did not go up the services that they \nreceived from the health care industry and from the health insurance \nindustry would have gone down.\n  You remember that was part of a big effort we had in 1993 and 1994 \nwhere we were going to insure everybody. Obviously, when there is 13 or \n14 percent of the people who do not get insurance and a large \npercentage of them that cannot afford it, somebody is going to pay. \nThere is no doubt about it. There is no free lunch in our system of \ndoing business in America.\n  The middle class saw this problem, that we were trying to reduce the \ncoverage, affordability and quality of health care to middle class \nworking America as we were trying to solve the problems of the 13 or 14 \npercent of the American people who did not have any health insurance. \nOf course, it only took about 3 or 4 months until working, taxpaying \nAmerican citizens found out what Congress was proposing to do, and they \nturned against the Clinton health care proposal.\n  Then that message really did sink in to the President of the United \nStates because after the November election in 1994, when the \nRepublicans took over the Congress, the President said he was not going \nto attempt to have that complete overhaul of the American health care \nprovisions he incorporated in his 1993 and 1994 proposals, and that if \nhe was going to do anything it was going to be done incrementally.\n  So you have a President, thankfully, waking up to the realities of \nwhat grassroots America wants, particularly what middle class America \nwants, they liked their health care plans and wanted to keep them from \nbeing diluted. You have the President waking up to that reality, on the \none hand, and then you have Republicans who had accepted these \nnoncontroversial parts of the President's health care provisions, the \nnoncontroversial parts, being debated in this Chamber today, which \nbring together the bipartisan efforts that are going to make this \nlegislation very successful.\n  So I just wanted to give that background before I express my words of \nsupport for and cosponsorship of this very important piece of \nlegislation, because the American people for the last 6 or 7 years, as \nexpressed by this history I just gave you, believe it is high time \nCongress passed legislation which provides basic health insurance \nprotections for individuals and small businesses. The Kassebaum bill is \nour opportunity to respond to these concerns.\n  This bill would assure greater portability of health insurance for \nindividuals. It would limit the ability of insurers to deny health \ninsurance coverage because an individual has a preexisting condition. \nIt would require insurers to offer health insurance to individuals who \nhave lost jobs and seek such insurance. And it would require insurers \nto issue health coverage to individuals who want to purchase insurance \nfor their employees on a group basis.\n  The bill defers to health insurance reforms passed by the States. \nThis is very important for my State of Iowa, because in my State we \nhave enacted a very good health insurance reform law. It went into \neffect on April 1 just past.\n\n  Enactment of the Kassebaum bill should not disrupt the reforms that \nare going on in my State. So, in my State, Iowans would continue to \nreceive health insurance under the terms of the Iowa reforms.\n  I thank Senator Kassebaum and her very capable staff for working with \nme and my staff and with some of the Iowans who helped put together the \nIowa reforms. The modifications Senator Kassebaum will offer to her \nbill would help make sure that Iowa and similar State reforms would not \nbe disrupted when this bill is enacted. As a consequence of these \nchanges, Iowa, and probably several other States should be able to \ncarry out their own reforms without undue interference from the Federal \nlevel.\n  For States which have not implemented their own reforms, this bill \nwould then reform both the group and the individual health insurance \nmarkets in those particular States. As I said earlier, these reforms \nwould respond to some of the most pressing problems encountered by \nsmall businesses and individuals when they need health insurance.\n  For the group market, this bill would require insurers who offer \ngroup health plan coverage to offer such coverage to all groups that \napply. This would prohibit insurers from denying health insurance \ncoverage to employers whose work force the insurer believes is not \nhealthy enough to insure.\n  Next, the Kassebaum bill would require insurers to offer coverage to \nall individuals in a group without regard to their health status. This \nwould prohibit insurers then from denying coverage for an individual \nmember of a group plan based on that individual's health status. This \nlegislation would require insurers to renew group health plans at the \noption of the employer. Renewal may not be denied for reasons of health \nstatus of those in the plan. Thus, an insurer would not be able to \nrefuse to renew a health insurance plan to a group based on changes in \nthe health profile of the individual.\n  This legislation would limit an insurer's ability to deny coverage \nfor preexisting conditions to 12 months. This waiting period would be \nreduced by 1 month for every month during which an individual was \ncontinuously covered under a prior health plan. Thus, Mr. President, an \nindividual who had maintained continuous coverage for 12 months could \nnot be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions.\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\n  I think it is simple to say, Mr. President--as far as I can tell--the \nprovisions I have just outlined in this bill, the provisions which \napply to the group health insurance market only, are relatively \nunopposed.\n  This bill would also reform the individual market. This bill would \nguarantee the availability of health insurance coverage for individuals \nleaving group coverage, who want to get individual insurance coverage, \nas long as they have been covered under their previous group plan for \n18 months.\n  If those individuals were eligible for coverage under current Federal \nlaw, and we call that law by the acronym COBRA, these individuals must \nhave exhausted that coverage before they can be guaranteed coverage in \nthe individual market. But that is the only requirement that keeps \nthese individuals from getting insurance.\n  This legislation would require that health plan insurers renew \nindividual policies at the discretion of the individual, similar to \ngroup policies being renewed at the discretion of the employer \nproviding the group policy. Now, without a doubt, there has been a lot \nof concern expressed about this provision, and it continues to be \nexpressed. It continues to be expressed by insurers who operate \nprimarily in the individual market.\n  I might say to these companies that I am talking about here, that \nhave this concern--and I am not going to say that this concern is not \nlegitimate--but, as far as practical matters are concerned, I want to \nremind these companies that if we were to have passed the Clinton \nhealth reform plan of 1993, there would not have been any individual \nmarket out there. These companies would have been out of business. A \nlot of the companies in my State that do a majority of group coverage \nstill have a vast minority of their business in the individual market. \nThat portion of their market would have been wiped out. I hope these \ncompanies that have some concern about this provision I am speaking \nabout here realize that they have a lot of friends in this body that \nbelieve in the free market and do not want to hurt individual insurance \ncoverage. A lot of Americans want individual insurance coverage, not \nnecessarily because it is better than group, but because that may be \nthe only way they can have it and get the type of health care that they \nwant. These companies have that business today because we stopped the \nClinton health care reform plan that would have wiped out individual \ninsurance coverage for health care.\n  Now, what do these companies fear? They fear that the group to \nindividual provisions in the Kassebaum bill would have the ultimate \neffect of greatly raising premiums in the individual market and hence, \nI suppose, cutting out a lot of their business because some people \nmight drop it. The marketplace kind of dictates as the price goes up \nyou sell less of something. So these insurers feel the numbers of \ninsured are going to go up. Some of them would say the numbers would \nincrease greatly. But going up greatly, compared to not having any of \nthis business had these reforms been adopted in 1993, is the difference \nbetween night and day, as far as I can tell.\n  It is the case that the bill would not forbid health insurers from \nrating individuals and charging them a higher premium if such rating \nindicates that they are greater health risks than any other \nindividuals. I would think that would help this problem for these \nindividual policy companies to some extent. But as far as we can tell \nfrom analysis done by the independent actuaries, the premium price \nincreases caused by the bill should be very modest.\n  The analysis done by the health insurers' association, the Health \nInsurance Association of America, wants us to believe that the premiums \nwould increase in the neighborhood of 15 percent. But in making my \ndecision to support the Kassebaum bill vis-a-vis this problem I am just \ndescribing, I took into consideration the analyses done by independent \nactuaries such as the American Academy of Actuaries, and Hay Huggins, \nwhich was done under contract with the Congressional Research Service \nat the request of Senator Kassebaum, and even the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. All these found that any premium increases \nattributable to the enactment of this legislation should be very \nmodest, in the range of 1 to 5 percent. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that this increase would be no more than 2 percent as a \nresult of the group to individual portability provisions. If this bill \nis enacted, it should help provide some peace of mind for a lot of \npeople.\n  But we should make it clear to the public what this bill would not \ndo. As a lot of people have said here already, it would not solve the \nproblems of those people who cannot afford to have health care \ninsurance. But that is what the term ``incremental'' meant. When \nPresident Clinton, after the November 1994 election, when the \nRepublicans gained control of Congress, was asked about health care \nreform, he indicated he had learned a lesson from the debate of 1993 \nand 1994, and he was going to promote the incremental approach. \nBasically that means we should provide a marketplace out there so \npeople who want and can afford health insurance are going to be able to \nbuy it.\n\n  We are going to be able to get a better handle on what the cost is \nout there, for those who cannot afford insurance. Maybe we can help \nthose people without screwing up the best health care system in the \nworld, which would have been done with the effective Government \ntakeover of health care, if the Clinton health care proposal had gone \nthrough in 1993.\n  But peace of mind for this percentage of people that can afford it is \nonly one goal. That peace of mind should not be enough for everybody to \nbuy into this, because there are some shortcomings that we have to \nadmit to the American people. This bill would not completely eliminate \nthe denial of coverage for every preexisting condition. It would not \nrequire employers to offer insurance to their employees. It would not \nprovide portability between different individual policies. And it would \nnot necessarily mean that currently uninsured individuals would have to \nbe sold a health insurance policy.\n  It is for these reasons that I support the addition to the bill of \nprovisions which would increase the tax deductibility of health care \ncosts for the self-employed. That is not only to pick up a hole that is \nin this bill but to also bring some equity to the difference between \nthe deductibility at 30 percent of health insurance for self-employed \nand the 100-percent deductibility for health insurance for employees of \ncorporations. In my State of Iowa, that is like saying that the farmers \nof my State are denied equity when they can only deduct 30 percent of \ntheir health insurance from their income tax, where John Deere, for its \nworkers, can deduct 100 percent of the cost of insurance for that \ncorporation.\n  I support the addition of medical savings accounts. Both the tax \ndeductibility of health care costs for the self-employed and MSA's, \ntogether, at a minimum should make health insurance more affordable, \nimprove portability, as well as providing a greater degree of tax \nfairness. In any case, if enacted, the bill would be a step forward. \nThe majority of those who are paying attention to our debate since it \nbegan several years ago very much want to see Senator Kassebaum's bill \nenacted. We have been promising these reforms, as I indicated at the \nopening of my remarks, since the Bentsen bill passed this body in 1992, \nwithout any debate--indicating, then, that it was the best thing to do. \nIt was a good thing to do. It was a bipartisan thing to do.\n  So most of us have been saying since that date in 1992, or years \nbefore that, we could easily enact such reforms as those that are in \nthis bill. Remember, then, what incremental health reform is. \nIncremental reforms were what most Republicans were saying was the way \nto go and we have the President of the United States, in November 1994, \nsaying the same thing. Now we have before us a bill that will deliver \nincremental health insurance reform if it is enacted. We should pass \nit.\n  We have before us a bill that will deliver these incremental health \ninsurance reforms if this bill is enacted--and it will be enacted--and \nwe should pass it. Thank you.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to voice my very strong support for this health insurance \nreform.\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\n This is a tremendous opportunity today to provide greater access to \nhealth care for millions of Americans and their families. The \nKassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill, of which I am a cosponsor, is \nan excellent step in that direction.\n  This bill will be a great relief for most working Americans. They \nwill not have to worry about losing their insurance if they change \njobs. Insurance companies will not be able to deny coverage or make it \nprohibitively expensive for a preexisting condition.\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that this bill is a safety net for \nworking Americans and their families. This legislation will make health \ninsurance portable and affordable, and it will give a benefit package \nthat is both reliable and renewable.\n  I was disappointed that we were not able to enact comprehensive \nhealth insurance reform. After that debate came to a close, I pledged \nto continue the fight to reform health care. This is an important step \nin that direction, and Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy should be \nthanked for their great effort in bringing us this far.\n  Many Americans have medical histories of preexisting conditions that \nmake it difficult for them to get insurance coverage. They stay locked \nin their jobs and unable to move to improve their standard of living \nbecause they fear they will not be able to get insurance coverage. This \nlegislation will end job lock. This legislation will end the penalty \nfor having a preexisting condition, like diabetes. People who work in \nsmall business, especially many women, will now be able to get health \ninsurance.\n  The bill before us today goes a long way toward eliminating the \nbarriers to coverage. For 81 million Americans who have preexisting \nmedical conditions, insurance companies can no longer exclude them from \ncoverage.\n  Millions of Americans will be able to be secure in the knowledge that \nif they change or lose their jobs, they will not lose their health \ninsurance. And for those entrepreneurs who start and work in small \nbusiness, this legislation will provide increasing purchasing power for \nthem and their families.\n  I am pleased that the bill has the potential to help millions of \nwomen and their families. This legislation will help women who start a \nnew job with an employer who provides health insurance. A woman will \nnot be denied insurance for herself and/or family if there is a \npreexisting condition. Like when she is pregnant, she will be able to \nget immediate coverage for the pregnancy, even if she is already \npregnant. Her newborn or adopted child will receive health insurance \ncoverage as well.\n  This bill will stop the terrible practice of denying women insurance \nif they are victims of domestic violence. I think that is crucial. This \nbill will stop that horrible practice of denying women health insurance \nif they are victims of domestic violence.\n  There is much more that I would like to be able to do to make \ninsurance coverage affordable, accessible, portable and undeniable. I \nwould like to see coverage for long-term care, and I would like to see \na comprehensive benefit package for women and children, but this is a \nvery important step. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve the \nlives of many Americans, and I am pleased to support this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kassebaum bill. I \nsuppose most of us today and on through the night will be saying much \nthe same thing. We have not all said it yet, so we will have to keep \ndoing it. But this is a bill that is very important to us, and we ought \nto comment on it.\n  It provides, I think, long-awaited reforms. We have all worked on \nhealth care for a very long time. I have had a particular interest in \nrural health care in that the delivery systems in rural States are \nnecessarily quite different than they are in other States.\n  This is an incremental move, and I am for that. The portability is \nimportant so that people are not afraid to change jobs. Certainly, not \nprohibiting preexisting conditions and allowing small businesses to \nform purchasing cooperatives are terribly important. So these are \npractical and affordable reforms that we need--really relief from \ntrying to change the whole system. I think Congress will meet this \nchallenge.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act helps each and every American, more \nthan any other bill that has passed this year. Wyoming ranchers and \nfarmers and owners of small businesses and folks in the mineral \nindustry will no longer be excluded from care they deserve. S. 1028 is \ncompassionate, and I challenge President Clinton to sign this bill for \nthe sake of all Americans.\n  There has been a major shift in the debate, of course, over the last \ncouple of years. It is historical when you look at how far we have come \nsince we initially discussed health care reform. No longer are we \nconsidering the Clinton approach to a Government-run system. That was \nrejected by Americans, and I think properly so. Instead, we are going \nto move incrementally into some commonsense reforms. There will be some \nchanges, and there have been some changes suggested by the managers, \nmoving closer to the House proposal, in terms of high-risk pools.\n  In 1991, my State of Wyoming responded to the health care concerns of \nindividuals with serious illnesses establishing a State insurance pool, \na high-risk pool allowing States to continue these measures, rather \nthan be forced to enact other individual insurance reforms. I think \nthis is very helpful to rural States like Wyoming.\n\n  Moving incrementally does not mean keeping every worthwhile proposal \noff the table, however. I think we should promote solutions that expand \nhealth care choices and, most of all, in the final analysis, do \nsomething about cost. When you talk about health care, what do you \nusually end up talking about? Cost. Availability, of course, then cost.\n  I happen to favor medical savings accounts. I think this gives the \nkind of discipline to health care costs that individuals give when they \nare responsible for making some of the decisions.\n  Self-employed deductibility is fair and equitable, and we should have \ndone it long, long ago. Eighty percent of that is good. Administrative \nsimplification, of course. And I believe when we talk about costs, we \nought to concern ourselves with malpractice reform. I do not think \nthere is any question but what there are substantial costs there.\n  Mr. President, I have been dismayed that the President is threatening \nto veto health insurance reform over some of these provisions. I \nbelieve the veto flies in the face of what the American people want.\n  As part of the changes that have occurred in Washington last fall, I \nam committed to bringing quality health care to rural America, some \nequity to rural America, and that is why I have an amendment to offer \nthat corrects the formula used to set payments for rates under managed \ncare plans that participate under Medicare. We will see increasing \nnumbers of managed care plans, and more and more people in Medicare \ngoing into them.\n  The formula is not fair, the formula is not equitable, and we need to \nmake some adjustments. To give an example, the payments made in rural \nareas of South Dakota are $177 a month. Payments for similar services \nin New York are $678 a month based on historical utilization. That \nneeds to be changed. That is unfair. When we have a program like \nMedicare that is treated somewhat uniformly, that is a 367-percent gap, \nand we can change that, and I think we should.\n  The longer these disparities exist, the longer rural seniors will be \nleft with less health care choices.\n  So I am in support of this bill. I think it could be stronger. I hope \nit is. But I am supporting it. I think we should have this bill. Access \nto health insurance is, of course, a little comforting for those who \nneed it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I recall the Senator bringing up and discussing some of \nthese things that need to be done within our health care system. I \nremember so well back when we had the proposal by the President to have \nGovernment take over a system that has been run well but needed some \nimprovements, we committed ourselves at that time to incremental \nimprovements.\n  I think the bill that is before us today is good. But I also think \nthat the amendments that will be offered, some of the provisions of \nwhich the Senator\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nhas talked about, are going to make it better. The MSA element of this \nbill I think is very significant. You know, this is the only product or \nservice anywhere in America where it has built in a factor to pay more. \nI do not know of anyone in America, that once they pay their deductible \non a health policy, watches what they spend as much as if they were \npaying their own money. This is human nature.\n  I am hoping that this bill that is a good bill, can be made a much \nbetter bill and we can come through and take care of some of the things \nthat the Senator is talking about. I am particularly interested in some \nitems that are not going in there. I would like medical malpractice \nreform but I also realize that would be a very heavy thing that would \ncause it to go down and perhaps cause a veto. I think with these very \nmoderate and modest reforms that the Senator is talking about, I think \nit will be a better bill, better bill for our health delivery system in \nAmerica. I applaud the Senator for bringing these up and discussing \nthem.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank my colleague. Before I sit down, I do want to \ncompliment the Senator from Kansas. This is the product of a great deal \nof work and great deal of leadership and something that we do need to \ndo. I want to say, however, in closing, that I think we have made some \nreal progress in the last couple years in the industry, in the private \nsector. And even though I think there are some problems that we will \nhave to deal with as we go about it, managed care has been helpful, \nmanaged care has done something to control prices.\n  I think more and more people are becoming aware of their \nresponsibility with regard to payments. I think it is true that third-\nparty payers have been part of the problem of costs. We can work that \nout. So in any event, I rise in support of the basic bill. It \nguarantees coverage of the type of insurance particularly important \ntoday, and I compliment the Senator for it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Let me start by saying what I would imagine has already been said a \nnumber of times; that is, to compliment the junior Senator from the \nState of Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and the senior Senator from the \nState of Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for bringing together a \nunique, I think in these times, coalition of Members to support a \nmajor, major legislative effort in one of the most important areas that \nthis Congress could be dealing with, and that is the health care of the \ncitizens of this country.\n  This body is going to miss the Senator from Kansas for her wisdom and \nher balance and her willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion to \naccommodate the various interests of the Members of this body. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with her in the so-called Chafee-Breaux \nGroup where we have been trying to come together to come up with a \nbalanced budget. I commend her for her efforts in that regard, but \nparticularly in bringing this Kassebaum-Kennedy bill to the floor; and, \nof course, for the years of tireless service by the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, because he has really been dedicated over the years in \ntrying to come up with health care legislation that really serves the \nneeds of the people of this country.\n  Let me start by saying that this indeed is a large coalition. It is a \nlarge coalition--65 Members of Congress in the Senate alone have \nendorsed and have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. So that in \nitself is very rare in today's atmosphere of high partisanship that we \nsee more and more, unfortunately. So anytime you can get a coalition of \n65 cosponsors of a major piece of legislation indeed that is very, very \ngood news.\n  Let me also say that while the coalition is large, the coalition is \nvery fragile. It is very fragile because it does not do as much as what \nmany Members would like to see it do. And there are still things that \nthis legislation does not do that it should address. It probably does \nmore than some people would like to see done with requirements from a \nFederal level that certain things be required when you sell health \ninsurance in this country.\n\n  But the real accomplishment of the two Senators in bringing this \nlegislation today to the floor of the Senate is the fact that it is a \nlarge coalition, it is a bipartisan coalition. It does, I think, \naccomplish some very important things that need to be done in the area \nof health insurance for the people of America.\n  In my own State of Louisiana there are nearly a million people who \nare uninsured, a million people who do not have enough money to buy a \nprivate insurance policy or who earn more than they are allowed to earn \nand qualify for Medicaid, the Federal-State health insurance program. \nSo a million people walk around my State every day--go to work in most \ncases every day--but do not know how they are going to treat their \nchildren, their spouses, if they should get seriously ill other than \nthrough the charity of others or the charity of the hospital systems in \nmy State of Louisiana.\n  Many people do not have insurance for reasons that are corrected by \nthis legislation. For instance, there are many people who had insurance \nbut when they got sick and needed it the most, it was canceled. How \nmany of us as Members know a family or perhaps a member of our own \nfamilies that have had health insurance, but then when they need it the \nmost, when they get sick, after the illness is over, they get a little \nnote in the mail from an insurance company that says, ``Well, we're \ngoing to cancel your insurance''? And the only reason they really give \nis because you got sick. That was what they bought insurance for in the \nfirst place. If you get sick you have insurance. It takes care of the \nhospital and the doctor bills.\n  But today, unfortunately, in this society we have people who get sick \nand then have their insurance canceled just when they need it the most. \nSo they do not have it today. This legislation, for the first time, \nsays that you are not going to be able to cancel someone's health \ninsurance because they got sick--sort of a logical thing I think we \nshould have done a long time ago. But this legislation does accomplish \nthat.\n  The second point is, people, in my State and other States, that have \ntried to buy health insurance, and, sometimes, because they have had a \npreexisting condition, they are prohibited from buying a health \ninsurance policy. I do not think that is basically fair. Health \ninsurance shares the risks. There are a lot of sick people that are in \nthe insurance pool. There are a lot of well people in the insurance \npool. On balance, the insurance companies make money and people get \nhealth insurance.\n  That is how the system is supposed to work. So this legislation \naddresses the problem of people who have had preexisting conditions and \nbrings them in a fair fashion into the system in a way that I think \nmakes a great deal of sense.\n  The other problem of all those people who do not have health \ninsurance in my State and, again, in the other 49 States is because \nthey have had to change a job. And we all know in this mobile society \nas people change jobs because of downsizing, or because of changes in \ntechnology, they are able to get a better job through education and \ntraining, they could move on to another field, the problem is that many \npeople will not change jobs, will not get a better job even if it means \nbetter economic conditions for themselves and their families. Guess \nwhy? Because they will lose their health insurance.\n  So we have a situation referred to as ``job lock'' where our people \nwould like to move on to better jobs--or maybe even forced to change to \na new job because of downsizing--and cannot do so because they lose \ntheir health insurance, which is one of the most important things that \nthe job market can provide. But if you cannot be guaranteed that \ncoverage you have today will be with you tomorrow when you are in a \ndifferent job, well then, people say, ``I'm just going to stay right \nhere.'' Or if they get laid off and they have to move to another job, \nthey do so perhaps without any insurance because they are uninsurable \nwhen they move into the new position.\n  So what we have today through the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation is a \nmajor, major health reform package which I enthusiastically am a \ncosponsor of and congratulate the people who have brought this \nmonumental piece of\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nlegislation to us. It will, when it passes, and President Clinton signs \nit, be, I think, a shining example of what Congress can do when we are \nwilling to work in a bipartisan fashion to accomplish something as \nmonumental as this legislation does.\n  I know the majority leader has a package of amendments that he is \ngoing to present at a later time. I as an individual Senator and a \nmember of the Finance Committee looked over a lot of the suggestions in \nthe proposed amendments that he has submitted. You know, a lot of them \nare good ideas. They have not yet worked their way through the \ncommittee. That gives me a little concern about how these new ideas are \ngoing to be paid for. Our staffs are now, as we speak, looking at the \nlegislation and the series of amendments. I think, by and large, most \nof them are pretty good--80 percent tax deductibility for self-employed \npeople who buy insurance. All the people around the country that are \nself-employed, now, can only deduct about 30 percent of their premiums. \nWith this amendment, you would be able to deduct 80 percent of your \nhealth insurance premiums. I think that is pretty darn good, just like \na company that contributes to a policy can deduct 100 percent of their \ncontributions. So we should do something for the self-employed people \nin this country. That amendment does that.\n\n  Penalty-free IRA, individual retirement accounts, withdrawals for \nlarge medical expenses and for the unemployed to pay their health \ninsurance premiums. That is a good idea. We have talked about that. I \nthink this should be bipartisan in that amendment. I think that is \ngood.\n  My point, as I reach to a conclusion here, is that we have a large \ncoalition, but it is a fragile coalition. I suggest that if people come \nup with amendments that are very controversial, that there is not a \nconsensus on, or that we have not had hearings on, or amendments that \nhave not been reported out, like this bill has, by a full committee of \nthe Senate, that we will run into problems, and we will miss what I \nthink is a golden opportunity to, in fact, create legislation which \nmakes a lot of sense for all Americans.\n  One of the amendments I will just mention is a so-called medical \nsavings account. This is a classic example of ``if it sounds too good \nto be true, it probably is.'' I think that when you look at this \nconcept--and I found after looking at it--that it, in fact, is too good \nto be true and causes problems that greatly outweigh the benefits. It \nis not to say that medical savings accounts do not have some benefits; \nthey do. But I do not think that we are certain enough about those \nbenefits as opposed to the negative problems that will occur to \nautomatically accept this provision without a great deal of discussion.\n  I hope when that amendment is offered we will be able to strike out \nthat section of the proposed Dole amendment and proceed to pass this \nlegislation, hopefully with the other amendments that the majority \nleader is prepared to offer.\n  Let me tell you why I think medical savings accounts are a bad idea. \nI say, first of all, at one time I thought they were a great idea. At \none time I introduced legislation to create medical savings accounts. \nBoy--they sound terrific. I asked my staff--``What is the problem?'' At \nthe time, we--like many others--did not have the full picture to \nunderstand the problems. Few had analyzed the effects of medical \nsavings accounts.\n  The problem was that while it is really terrific for healthy people, \nit is not so terrific, in fact, potentially very bad, for people who \nare not healthy. If you take, for example, young people--I have four \nchildren who are relatively young and very healthy, thank goodness--a \nmedical savings account is very attractive for them. Their employer can \ncontribute money to an account, and they would use that account to pay \nfor their initial medical bills during the course of the year. If they \ndid not have to use it at all, they get to keep the money. What a great \ndeal if you are 20, 25 years old and very healthy.\n  So, in the past, we had only looked at how it affected one group of \npeople--healthy, basically young people. A terrific idea for them. What \nwe failed to look at is how it affected other people who buy insurance \nbecause they may get sick--generally, more elderly people, and people \nwho do get sick during the course of their life. If they have a very \nhigh deductible policy, as high as $3,000 for a family, they have a \nproblem, because they will incur medical expenses during the year. If \nthey have to pay for it out of their pocket, it is a really serious \nproblem for them. Again, it is not a problem for people who are young \nand never have to go to the doctor during the course of the year.\n  Incentives for the medical savings account have a tendency to suck \nout all the healthy people from the insurance pool, put them into a \nmedical savings account where they will not be using a lot of medical \nhealth care, but leaving behind people who do get sick, who do have to \ngo to the doctor and do have to go to a hospital during the course of a \nyear. If the only people remaining in an insurance pool are people who \nhave to use doctors and hospitals, the risk becomes so great because of \nthe loss of healthy people, that their premiums would rise so high that \ninsurance would soon be unaffordable for them as well.\n\n  My fear is that while a medical savings account takes care of one \ngroup of people, it causes far greater problems than are justified for \neverybody else, which is the vast majority of the remaining people in \nthis country.\n  I think at the appropriate time we should set aside the medical \nsavings account, with an amendment if we have to, look at the other \namendments that Senator Dole has offered, and I think most of them, \nfrom my personal observation, are good. I think we should accept them. \nBut certainly not the medical savings account at this time.\n  Let me conclude, once again, saying to Senator Kennedy and Senator \nKassebaum, my congratulations to you for bringing to the Senate a real \nopportunity to do real health care reform in 1996. We hope that the \nSenate and the House would ultimately pass this legislation, and the \nPresident should sign it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bipartisan \nhealth insurance reform bill, a measure that I was pleased to \ncosponsor. There are a number of reasons to support this legislation \nintroduced by my good friends, the Senator from Kansas and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Let me focus my remarks on ways in which this measure should provide \nsome meaningful help for one group in particular. That is our Nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  From existing companies trying to maintain health care coverage to \nindividuals who are trying to start a small business, this bill \naddresses several problems confronting smaller firms trying to provide \nhealth insurance for their employees.\n  First, Mr. President, and I want to emphasize this, the measure \naddresses the barriers often posed by preexisting conditions. An \nestimated 81 million Americans have some kind of preexisting medical \ncondition that could, unfortunately, affect their insurability. The \nlegislation limits the ability of insurers to impose exclusions for \npreexisting conditions.\n  In addition, the bill requires insurers to sell and renew group \nhealth policies for all employers who want coverage for their \nemployees, and it prohibits group health plans from excluding any \nemployee based on health status.\n  Now, Mr. President, this can be especially helpful to our small \nbusinesses. The problem of getting insurance does not just affect \nindividuals with preexisting conditions. Whole industries have been \ndenied coverage by certain insurers because they are not to employ \npeople who are more likely than others to get sick.\n  A study by the Congressional Research Service found that several \ninsurers routinely denied coverage to dozens of different types of \nbusinesses ranging from some of the following: auto dealers, barber \nshops, beauty parlors, hotels, lodges, and restaurants. Mr. President, \neven businesses and individuals that have health insurance cannot be \nsure of maintaining their coverage if illness strikes.\n  Insurers can, therefore, collect premiums for years and then just \nsuddenly refuse to renew coverage in individuals or employees who begin \nto incur large health care costs. So, requiring insurers to renew \npolicies can certainly help address that problem. This bill finally \nhelps move us down this road.\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\n  Mr. President, the bill also guarantees renewability of individual \npolicies and prohibits insurers from denying insurance to those moving \nfrom group coverage to individual coverage. We know that the inability \nto retain health care coverage once somebody leaves a job can trap many \npeople in the jobs they wish to leave. This is often referred to as \n``job lock,'' a problem, according to one survey, that may touch one \nquarter of all American workers--individuals that stay in jobs they \nwould otherwise leave, because they fear losing their health care \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, this job-lock effect has an impact on small business, \nas well. Unless you inherit wealth, or maybe win the lottery, the \nchances are pretty good that anyone who wants to start a small business \nwill be somebody's employee--at least as they make the decision to \nbecome a small business person. If you or a member of your family have \nany kind of preexisting condition, you may be faced with this job lock. \nThe inability to get health insurance prevents those individuals from \nleaving their existing jobs to start their new business.\n  Mr. President, I think this barrier has a major impact on our economy \nby discouraging new business startups. We all know that small business \nis the real foundation of our economy. We have an insurance practice \nthat discourages people from taking their good ideas and starting new \nbusinesses that will employ many more people. That is a real, real \nrestraint on the growth of our economy.\n  Mr. President, finally, I want to commend the authors of this measure \nfor the provisions that help make it easier for small businesses to \nform private, voluntary coalitions to purchase health insurance, and to \nalso negotiate with providers in health plans.\n  While the economic power of big businesses has enabled many larger \nfirms to contain health care costs and improve the quality of health \ncare for their employees, small businesses continue to see health care \ncosts climb.\n  The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee reported that while \nhealth care costs for large employers declined 1.9 percent in 1994, \nsmall employers saw an average increase of 6.5 percent. This is a very \nlarge discrepancy, and one that really discourages small business at \nthe same time that larger businesses are benefited.\n  By providing small employers and individuals with the kind of \neconomic leverage in the marketplace that is currently enjoyed by large \nemployers, these provisions should help bring the costs of health \ninsurance down for small businesses and individuals.\n  Mr. President, as you know, there are over 50 cosponsors of this \nmeasure, pretty evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Of \ncourse, this is an indication of the broad desire for health insurance \nreform. But it is also an indication of the care taken by Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy in crafting a measure that, finally, has \na real good chance of becoming law, at a time of very heightened \npolitical sensitivities on this issue.\n  Before any measure is enacted, it has to navigate the choppy waters \nof each body, a conference committee, going back to each body again, \nand, finally, receive Presidential approval.\n  That is no mean feat at any time, but it is especially difficult in \nthe political environment of a Presidential election year.\n  If this bill becomes law, as I hope it will, its enactment would be \nin no small part due to the legislative skills of the Senator from \nKansas and the Senator from Massachusetts, and, I might add, to the \nfondness and respect many of us in this body have for both of them.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my friends, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Dr. Maimon Cohen, a fellow on my staff, have the privilege of the \nfloor during the pendency of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think every Senator who came to the \nfloor has thanked both Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their \nfine work. I wish to join in that. I also say to the Senator from \nKansas, who is chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, that \nalong with everyone else, I will miss her. I think she has been a great \nSenator for Kansas and for the benefit the country. I mean that \nsincerely.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a very important piece of legislation \nfor a number of different reasons. I would like to start out talking \nabout that. I am going to be relatively brief, I say to other \ncolleagues, who may want to come down to the floor for opening \nstatements.\n  I think this is important because, first of all, we will not be able \nto have any kind of regulation if we do not do it at the Federal level \nbecause of ERISA exemption--in other words, preemption. In other words, \nso many citizens in our States are insured by self-insured plans, and \nreally it is impossible for States--and Minnesota has run into this--to \npass reforms that, in fact, will help people and cover everyone because \nself-insured plans are exempt from that coverage. We ran into this the \nother day when we marked up an important piece of legislation that I \nhope will come to the floor, where we said, look, you really do not \nwant to have a family be put in the situation where a mother with a \nnewborn is told, after 24 hours, regardless of circumstances, ``You are \nout.'' I mean, that is something that people in the country do not \nthink is fair.\n  But the fact of the matter is that even though my State of Minnesota \nhas passed such a piece of legislation, saying, no, that is not fair, \nthere has to be a mother and a doctor and the family in consultation \nmaking decisions about what is good for that mother, about 40 percent \nof the citizens in Minnesota would not be covered because they are in a \nself-insured plan.\n  This is an extremely important piece of legislation. I hope it is not \nso weighted down with killer amendments that it does not pass. This is \na bipartisan effort, and I think we ought to take this step for one \nreason more than any other; it is just a matter of elementary fairness. \nI have not seen polls on this, but I think the Senator from Kansas and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and all the rest of us that are \ncosponsors, would go forward regardless, but I just bet that 99 percent \nof the country would agree with the proposition that if you have paid \nyour premium on time, just because you now have a bout with breast \ncancer, or some other kind of illness, it would be outrageous to all of \na sudden find yourself without coverage, or you should leave one job \nand go to another job and not be able to obtain coverage.\n\n  Most all Americans just find that to be an outrageous proposition. My \nwife, Sheila, has been my teacher when it comes to domestic violence \nissues. And with the support of both the Senators from Kansas and \nMassachusetts in markup, we have a provision in here that we think is \nimportant dealing with issues of family violence. I wish these issues \nwere not out there. But we want to make sure battered women are not \nbattered again. If a woman is beaten up and comes to a hospital with \nher children and reports that, which is what she should do, and which \nis the first step in being able to leave a very dangerous home--and, \nunfortunately, homes are not always the safest places in the world--she \nwould not find herself without coverage for that condition.\n  So this is really a piece of legislation that is a matter of basic \nfairness. I know GAO has estimated that some 25 million Americans could \nbenefit. I also want to make the point that most of the uninsured in \nour country are uninsured because they cannot afford coverage, not \nbecause they are denied coverage.\n  So, in other words, we have a piece of legislation that deals with \naccessibility and with portability. For those of you listening to the \ndebate, that means you can go from one job to another and not lose your \ncoverage or be locked out because of a preexisting condition. We are \nnot still dealing with affordability. In Minnesota, there are 400,000 \nMinnesotans without insurance coverage, and 91,000 of them are \nchildren. In the main, that is not because of preexisting conditions, \nit is because the families cannot afford the coverage. Nationwide, the \nuninsured now number 40 million people.\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\n  I hope that we will get to the point, again, in this Congress when, \nin fact, we make sure that every citizen in our country has at least as \ngood a health care coverage as we have as Senators and Representatives. \nThis piece of legislation does not do all that, but it is an important \nstep forward.\n  One other concern I have, Mr. President--and I just want to make this \npoint--you cannot do everything in one piece of legislation. I am out \nhere to support it. I worry a little bit that what might happen is that \nthe insurance companies might say, ``OK, when you shift from job to \njob, or you move from one job and now you want to set up your own small \nbusiness, or whatever, we will not deny you coverage because of a \npreexisting condition, but we will raise your premium to $8,800 a year \nor $9,000 a year,'' in which case, my fear is that it will become \nthe functional equivalent of preexisting condition discrimination. Let \nus hope we have the cooperation of the insurance industry. But I just \nflag that as a potential problem.\n\n  Last point, Mr. President. I have been doing a lot of work with my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. A couple of years ago, we \nstarted a working group on mental health. Both of us, and other \nSenators, feel very strongly about this issue. We are working on an \namendment that I think is real important. It is an amendment that would \nprovide equitable health care coverage for mental illness and substance \nabuse services. In other words, what we want to make sure of is that \nwe, once and for all, put a stop to the discrimination that all too \noften takes place in the health care field. We are simply talking about \nparity--parity in coverage for physical and mental health and substance \nabuse services, and not different co-pay requirements, not arbitrary \ncaps on visits with physicians or other health care providers. I have \nto say that I believe this amendment, which we have worked very hard \non, is an extremely important amendment.\n  I believe that Senators, regardless of political party--Senator \nDomenici and I certainly do not agree on all issues, but we have been \nimmersed in this issue for several years now. We have seen all of the \nways in which people, who are struggling with these health care \nproblems, fall between the cracks. We have seen the discrimination. And \nthis amendment, which will really focus on the importance of parity, \nwhich will make sure there is no discrimination in this area, I think, \nis extremely important.\n  I will have data to bring to the floor. I will talk about some of the \ninsurance plans right now that do not discriminate and will talk about \nwhy this part is so important. I will talk about the differences it can \nmake for women and men being able to work, to live lives of dignity, \nand to contribute to the community.\n  But I do look forward at some point in time as we move along with \nthis piece of legislation to bringing this amendment to the floor with \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici. Mr. President, I do not know that there \nhas been another Senator who has been a stronger voice in this area for \nthose citizens who are struggling with mental illness. The same thing \ncan be said for his wife Nancy. For Sheila and I, this has emerged as a \nprofessional and a personal friendship. I look forward to being able to \nproudly bring this amendment out to the floor with my colleague and \ngood friend, Senator Domenici, and I hope in the spirit of what I think \nis bipartisanship that we will be able to get good, strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, may I respond for a moment to the \nSenator from Minnesota, who is a valued member of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee?\n  When he mentioned the rate increase possibly coming if we do not cap \nany of the premiums, I would just say also that we do not preempt \nStates from doing community weighting or a cap, if a State so desires. \nThat is one of the flexibilities that I believe is important. It is one \nof the reasons we have the strong support of the State insurance \ncommissioners. That flexibility which has been built into this also has \nstrong support from the National Governors' Association.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I never argue or disagree with the \nchairman of my committee. I think it is a point well taken. I do hope \nat the State level we will have in fact that oversight and that \naccountability.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak on behalf of this \nextremely important bill. In doing so, I want to commend the chair, \nSenator Kassebaum, and also Senator Kennedy for what I think is exactly \nthe kind of spirit of bipartisan effort that is needed to produce an \nimportant health bill.\n  The reason this legislation is very important is it will provide a \nnew path for upward mobility in American life. I have seen again and \nagain in my home State--this goes back to the days when I was director \nof the Grey Panthers, a senior citizens group at home--I have seen \ncitizens cut off from economic opportunity because this bill was not \nlaw. You could have, for example, a young person just starting their \ncareer in Oregon. They are working hard. They are committed, doing well \nin the marketplace, playing by the rules, and showing the kind of \ndiscipline to get ahead in the work force. But they, in effect, end up \nbeing cut off because they have a medical problem. So, if they hear \nabout a better job across town, another economic opportunity where they \ncan make a better wage, they lose out simply because today's insurance \nsystem does not work all that well unless you are healthy and wealthy.\n\n  With this legislation, it is going to be possible to make the health \ninsurance system work for all Americans so that all Americans can get \naccess to health insurance and get it when they need it most, which is \nwhen they have serious medical problems.\n  I would like to give special thanks to the chair, Senator Kassebaum, \nand to Senator Kennedy for their efforts to work with those of us from \nOregon. Oregon has been one of the States, as the Chair knows, that has \nconsistently been out in front in terms of health reform. We have done \nit with the Oregon Health Plan, for example, innovative in terms of \nsenior programs, and we have been on the cutting edge with insurance \nreform as well. There is a very special State effort supported by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike at home. We have initiated a number of \nimportant insurance reforms at the State level that we felt had to be \nprotected. Through the good offices of the chair, Senator Kassebaum, \nand Senator Kennedy that has been possible.\n  I have been notified in writing that the Oregon insurance reforms \nthat have been initiated on a bipartisan basis are working well \naccording to the insurance industry, and consumer groups alike are \nprotected under this legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me add that no one should be mistaken \nabout how much more is left to do in the area of health reform. If I \nhad my way, for example, a very important, albeit modest, change that \nwe would add to this legislation would be to open up the national \npractitioner data base to the public so that the citizens of this \ncountry could get access to the disciplinary record where the medical \nprofession has disciplined one of their colleagues. I wrote this law as \na Member of the House of Representatives--again, a statute that has \nbipartisan support. Today in that data bank lay thousands and thousands \nof names of physicians who have been disciplined formally by \ntheir colleagues, and the American people cannot find out about it.\n\n  Senator Boxer has done yeoman work on this issue. A number of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the floor have approached me on this. If I \nhad my way, we would be on the floor today including this important \nchange that would be of benefit to consumers.\n  But as a number of our colleagues have noted, it is not possible to \nget all the way to health reform in America. It is not possible today \nto get all of the work done that needs to be done to protect consumers \nand to insure universal coverage. But I think it is quite clear that a \nmajor step forward is being taken as a result of the bipartisan work \ndone by Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and then, as it goes \nto conference, to reject the number of anticonsumer provisions that \nwere added in the House. For example, in the House--it seems, again, \nincredible\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nto see this kind of anticonsumer retreat--the House wants to roll back \nthe protections for older people who buy policies to supplement their \nMedicare care. The late Senator Heinz of Pennsylvania and others fought \nfor years for this legislation. The House wants to roll it back. The \nHouse wants to roll back the fight against fraud and waste.\n  So, I hope today that the Senate will vote for this important \nbipartisan legislation--it is an important step forward--and then to \nreject the legislation in conference coming from the House.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Senator \nKennedy on the Oregon reform proposal and his reply to me be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The development of S. 1028, the \n     ``Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995,'' certainly is one of \n     the current Congress' most important advances in assuring \n     access to quality health care. I look forward to the debate \n     of this significant legislation on the floor of the Senate.\n       I am, however, concerned that our efforts to extend health \n     insurance coverage and end ``job-lock'' not impede \n     significant advances made by individual states in the health \n     insurance reform arena. One such effort is coming to \n     culmination in my home state of Oregon, and I write to you \n     today to inquire if the Oregon reform proposal likely would \n     be subject to a favorable exemption ruling by the Secretary \n     under the language of Section 112 of your legislation. The \n     section's flexibility in this regard will be an important \n     element in my consideration of the overall legislation.\n       Embodied by Oregon State Senate Bill 152, our group-to-\n     individual portability plan was designed by a working group \n     of state insurance officials, insurance carrier \n     representatives and health insurance agents. This enacted \n     state law will extend affordable health insurance coverage by \n     mandating that all state-regulated group insurance carriers \n     offer portability plans to persons leaving groups after \n     having had six months of continuous insurance coverage.\n       This plan also demands that carriers offer a choice between \n     both a moderately priced insurance package based on the \n     average of the State's most popular HMO plans, and a lower-\n     priced, catastrophic coverage option.\n       Finally, group carriers that have individual products can \n     offer them as their portability products as long as they \n     offer both the prevailing (HMO average-best) and low-cost \n     options.\n       The Oregon insurance reform program, due to go into effect \n     October 1, 1996, with portability plans on the market by \n     January 1, 1997, has other encouraging elements as well. For \n     your information, I attach a copy of a March 22, 1996, letter \n     to me by two members of the working group which produced the \n     plan. Should you have any questions regarding this letter, \n     please don't hesitate to contact me, or Steve Jenning of my \n     staff at 224-1084.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. I look \n     forward to working with you on this issue, and on other \n     important health matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                    Labor and Human Resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden;\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ron: Based on my understanding of the Oregon plan, it \n     would clearly meet the requirements for an alternative State \n     mechanism under the State flexibility mechanism of the \n     Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. My understanding is that your program \n     offers a program for all individuals leaving insured group \n     coverage that allows them to remain in a pool with employed \n     persons remaining in the entire insured market. For those \n     individuals leaving self-insured coverage, access to an open \n     high risk pool meeting the standards of the bill is \n     guaranteed.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Edward M. Kennedy.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words in support \nof the pending legislation.\n  Our distinguished colleagues, the Senator from Kansas and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, I believe, have crafted a sensible piece of \nlegislation that really represents the broadest possible consensus on \nhealth reform that we can achieve at this point.\n  Back in 1994 when I was a candidate for the U.S. Senate, the \nPresident was trying to get Congress to enact a health reform bill. \nThat was a health reform bill that went substantially further than the \nnational consensus on health care would allow. For better or for worse, \nthe American people made a decision. They made a decision and \ndetermined that they would not support a bill that threatened a large \nexpansion of Federal involvement in health care. They made the decision \nthat that simply was not good.\n  During that debate when I was running for the Senate, I said that the \nfailure to enact the President's plan did not mean that we would have \nto give up on health care reform. And we should not. In fact, what we \nshould do, as I said at the time we should do, is to try to get a \nconsensus, that there were things that we could agree on, there were \nthings that Democrats and Republicans could agree on, liberals and \nconservatives. We ought to agree on those things. We ought to put that \ninto legislation, and we ought to pass it. I think what we have in \nfront of us today is just that. It is that bipartisan consensus. It is \na consensus of what we can agree on.\n\n  There was, going back 2 years ago, a broad agreement on several \naspects of this health care reform--disagreement on some areas but \nagreement on others. One of the areas where there clearly was agreement \nwas on the problem of portability, or the challenge of portability or \nthe need for portability. Basically, there was agreement on the issue \nof letting people who have preexisting conditions get health insurance. \nThat was very important. Let small businesses form purchasing pools so \ntheir employees could get a better price for health insurance. There \nwas and is agreement on that.\n  These are basic mainstream principles. I am happy to say that they \nare embodied in the legislation that we have before us today.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation would create major positive changes \nin the health insurance market, and it would do so without imposing new \nmandates on employers or creating new Government bureaucracies. It \nwould give workers the flexibility to change jobs without losing their \nhealth insurance coverage. It would protect families from losing their \nhealth insurance if a family member loses his or her job.\n  Mr. President, according to the General Accounting Office, the bill \nwould provide health care security to 25 million additional Americans. \nThis is genuinely a far-reaching health reform that I believe does in \nfact preserve the bipartisan support it is receiving in the Chamber. I \nam glad today to be able to add my voice in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me, if I could, turn very, very briefly to another issue, and I \nhad intended to speak and still intend to speak sometime today or \ntomorrow or early next week at length on this, but I wish to take a \nminute right now to call my colleagues' attention to this and also the \nAmerican people.\n  Next week is National Organ Donor Awareness Week. I again will speak \nat length about this in the future. But the basic facts are that we \nlose people every day in this country, 7, 8, 9, 10 people, people who \nmedical science, medical capabilities could save, but we lose these \npeople, their families lose them, because they are on a waiting list, a \nwaiting list to get an organ donor transplant.\n  They die because, frankly, there simply are not enough organ \ndonations made in this country every day. The reason that there are not \nenough is very simple. It is that too many families, when faced with \nlife's most horrible tragedy, and that is the loss of a loved one, do \nnot really know what to do when they are asked whether or not they will \ndonate their loved one's organ or organs.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues and families across the country to talk \nabout this issue because I am convinced that the vast majority of \nAmerican people are caring, loving people who want to help other people \nwhen they can and who, if they think about this for any period of time \nat all, will conclude that if, heaven forbid, something traumatic would \nhappen to them and they would be killed, they would want their organs \nto be donated to somebody else, so somebody else could see, so somebody\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\nelse could live, so somebody else could carry on a productive life.\n  As I said, I will speak more about this at length later. I see my \ncolleague from North Dakota is present and ready to speak. I am not \ngoing to hold him up at this point. But I just again call my \ncolleagues' attention to this. National Organ Donor Awareness Week is \nnext week. It is one of the rare times in public office or in public \ndebate in this country where, when we talk about an issue, we can help \nsolve it. It does not cost any money to do it. It is just a question of \ngetting people to be more aware of the tragedy that occurs every single \nday to someone who could be saved, when someone who could remain with \ntheir family and be productive and live a good life dies because other \nindividuals, not knowing really what to do, make a decision not to \nallow their loved one's organs to be donated.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the Chair's indulgence and my \ncolleagues' indulgence, and I will today or tomorrow be talking further \nat length about this important issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I should like to recognize first the \nvaluable work that the Senator from Ohio has done on the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee. Senator DeWine has worked hard to help us \nget this put together. He was worked hard on all the other health \nissues that have come before the committee, and as he mentioned is a \nmajor leader along with Senator Frist on the organ donation issue. So I \nappreciate his assistance with the legislation.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I too commend the Senator from Ohio. I \nknow he has done a great deal of work on the issue of organ donation--\nwork that I support very strongly. I hope we will advance public \nunderstanding and knowledge about organ donation, not only in this \nlegislation but in other pieces of legislation as we move forward.\n  I did want to say as I begin--and I will be very brief since there \nare others in the Chamber who wish to speak--I cannot think of two more \nable Senators to bring a piece of legislation like this to the floor \nthan Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy. This Senate will be \ndiminished when Senator Kassebaum leaves, but she has done outstanding \nwork on this legislation and she and Senator Kennedy deserves to be \ncomplimented for bringing this to the floor. In my judgment, the \napproach we've taken to this legislation--finding the issues that we \nall agree on--is the kind of thing we should be doing routinely. I did \nnot support the Clinton health care plan. I did not cosponsor the \nClinton health care plan because I believed then that it was too \nbureaucratic. But he was asking the right questions. We needed to \naddress health care for two reasons. One, to provide broader access to \nhealth care. And two, to try to do something about the escalating costs \nof health care.\n  I happen to think the proposal that he made was too bureaucratic. It \nwould have not advanced the solution in both of those areas that I \nthink was appropriate. But that does not mean we do not have problems \nin both areas that we must address. This piece of legislation addresses \none of those. It addresses the issue of access to health care.\n  Again, this is exactly what we should be doing when we have a \ndisagreement, a substantial disagreement about a major policy issue. \nWhat we ought to do in those instances is find where is there an area \nof agreement, and that is what happened with this legislation.\n  This legislation addresses the issue of access. It brings together \nthose varying viewpoints in the Senate into one bill on which we can \nall agree that, yes, this advances the issue of access to health care. \nThat is why I am pleased to have been a cosponsor of the legislation \nand am pleased today to speak in favor of it.\n  The health care system in this country is a remarkable system. You do \nnot see very many Americans who get sick and decide to get on an \nairplane and go to some other country for health care. That would be a \nvery unusual thing to see. What you see instead is people getting on an \nairplane or getting on some other means of transportation and coming to \nAmerica to get health care because we have a wonderful system of health \ncare.\n  But we have two problems. One, not everyone has access to it, and, \ntwo, its cost is escalating. It has diminished a little bit in recent \nyears, but it has been escalating double and triple the rate of \ninflation every year for many years, and that prices health care out of \nthe reach of too many of our American citizens.\n  All of us understand that our health care system is a system that \noffers miracles to many Americans--new hips, new knees, cataract \nsurgery, even heart transplants. The list is endless.\n  I would suggest that anyone who wonders about where all of this comes \nfrom might go out to the National Institutes of Health. Take a look at \nsomething they have out there called the ``Healing Garden,'' where they \ndo research on a range of plants and all kinds of other things that \nproduce all of these wonderful new medicines. They do research on a \nwhole range of health care issues and develop new surgical techniques \nand new approaches.\n  We have invested a substantial amount of money that has produced \nenormous rewards for our society. And with all of those miracles and \nall of this wonderful medicine, the two remaining questions are, one, \nhow do we provide to people more access to this wonderful system, and, \ntwo, how do we bring the cost down so it does not rise out of the reach \nof too many American people?\n  This bill addresses that issue of access--not for everybody, but it \ndoes it in a way that pulls together those things that we agree on. \nThis includes dealing with the limits on exclusions for preexisting \nconditions. This bill is a very modest approach that solves part of \nthat problem, a major part of that problem, for many of the American \npeople.\n  A whole lot of people are locked in their jobs because of this issue \nof preexisting conditions. They are unable to move, because if they \nmove they cannot carry that insurance with them and no other insurance \ncarrier will pick them up because they have had a preexisting \ncondition. This piece of legislation deals with that in the right way.\n  This legislation says to insurance companies: if someone has been a \ngood customer of yours, buying your policy for years, you cannot drop \ncoverage simply because that person gets sick. This piece of \nlegislation also addresses the issue of portability, and does it in \nexactly the right way.\n  So I am pleased that we are here on the floor with this piece of \nlegislation. It is exactly the kind of thing we ought to do. Instead of \ncontinually talking about what we cannot agree on, we should find the \nareas where we can agree to begin moving toward a solution to a \nproblem. That is exactly what this piece of legislation does.\n  Let me end where I began, by complimenting the Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Kassebaum. This body will be diminished by your leaving at the \nend of this year, but you will have left your mark here in many, many \nways. You and Senator Kennedy will have left an indelible mark, if we \ncan pass this legislation, by advancing this issue of access to a \nwonderful health care system to millions and millions of additional \nAmericans who ought not be left out of the system.\n  So I compliment Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their \ndiligent work and I hope we can do exactly the same thing on other \nissues in the coming weeks. If we disagree, let us figure out where we \ndisagree, but then let us find the center. We ought to come to the \nfloor to move toward solving problems, rather than being so intractable \nin our own camps and deciding we simply cannot solve problems.\n  I look forward to casting a final vote, an aye vote on this \nlegislation. I hope it does not get too loaded down as it moves along. \nI hope the Senate will act with some haste to try to move this to a \nconference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Idaho, [Mr. \nCraig], is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon in \nsupport of the intent of S. 1028. Let me join my other colleagues in \nthanking the Senator from Kansas for her work in getting this kind of \nhealth care reform legislation to the floor, and also the\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nSenator from Massachusetts for the work that he has done in this area.\n  Health care in some form has been on the congressional agenda for \nseveral years. It is an important issue, and I hope by the end of this \nprocess we will have a health care insurance reform proposal that will \nmake health care insurance more accessible and more affordable.\n  The purpose of S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995, is \nto increase access to health care insurance, improve the portability of \nbenefits, give people greater security, and increase the purchasing \npower of individuals as well as small employers. The bill does this \nthrough a series of insurance market reforms. For example, the bill \nwould reduce the duration of exclusions for preexisting conditions by \ncrediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a \nprevious employer. Another important component would be the portability \nof coverage from a group plan into the individual insurance market.\n  The bill also includes a proposal that would create new State-based \nhealth insurance purchasing cooperatives, or HIPC's, based on a program \nthat was included in the Clinton-Mitchell health care reform bill. \nThese HIPC's are intended to give small businesses and individuals \ngreater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates.\n\n  Many Idahoans complain that they are locked into their current jobs \nbecause they fear losing their health care insurance. Several of my \ncolleagues have been on the floor in the last few hours, giving \nexamples of this kind of very real problem that Americans face. In some \ninstances, entrepreneurs avoid starting their own businesses because \nthey are unsure that they would be able to provide health care \ninsurance for their families in the way that they were covered under \ntheir current employer. This is a problem that has existed in this \ncountry in an increasing way over the last decade, and it simply needs \nto get corrected. This legislation offers that correction.\n  Another problem commonly raised is that individuals who have had \nmajor illnesses or preexisting conditions cannot obtain coverage if \nthey change jobs. In other words, once you have a medical record, \ninsurance companies, by that record, can disallow you coverage for that \nproblem under a new insurance policy. These kinds of fears are real. \nReal life examples are given, and they are faced by individuals and \nfamilies every day. The security issue I mentioned, as part of the \nintent of this bill, is a very important component of health care \ninsurance reform.\n  We must all be mindful that health insurance reform will have an \nimpact on the marketplace. These kinds of reforms that are being \nproposed in this legislation are not without cost. As we cause the \ninsurance market to change, the marketplace will price itself \ndifferently. In our effort to improve access to health care coverage we \nneed to be extremely cautious and ensure that there is a minimal impact \non the cost, or the increased costs of insurance, especially in the \nindividual market.\n  One thing we can do is to address the issue of cost in this bill. A \nnumber of valuable provisions for addressing these consumer concerns \nwere included in the Balanced Budget Act. However, that was vetoed by \nthe President, so they are not yet available to correspond with this \nlegislation when it becomes law.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, while I agree on the intent of S. 1028, to \nimprove access, I do have concern about the issue, of affordability. In \norder to fully address access to health care coverage we must look at \naffordability. While we create potential flexibility in the \nmarketplace, if we drive the cost beyond the reach of the individual, \nthe family or the employer, then what have we solved? What old problems \nhave we only changed into new ones?\n  In order to fully address access to health care coverage, we must \nlook at the whole issue of affordability. There are several key \namendments that I think are going to be offered by the leader which \nwill help us a great deal in solving this potential problem, such as \nincreasing tax deductions and implementing medical savings accounts, or \nMSA's, as the public has grown to know them. MSA's should be a part of \nthis bill. That amendment will be offered. I certainly hope the Senate \nwill respond as they should to the question of affordability, rounding \nout this legislation by addressing the cost component.\n  Title III of this legislation, S. 1028, includes a sense of the \ncommittee language that MSA's should be enacted. If they should be \nenacted--and that is what the committee says and what the legislation \nsays--then why do we not do it? Let me read what the sense of the \ncommittee is.\n\n       It is the sense of the committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources of the Senate that the establishment of medical \n     savings accounts, including those defined in . . . the Public \n     Health Service Act . . . should be encouraged as part of any \n     health insurance reform legislation passed by the Senate, \n     through the use of tax incentives relating to contributions \n     to, the income growth of, and the qualified use of, such \n     accounts.\n\n  That is what the legislation says. That is what the law would say. \nBut, if we do not add an amendment to it, it is fine rhetoric but it \ndoes not address the needs of the American people. And it does not, in \nmy opinion, create the component of affordability that this Senate must \nbe responsive to, if we are to bring about this kind of insurance \nreform.\n  I said the language is supportive, but it does not change anything. \nInstead of using this bill to speak to the issue, we should be using it \nas an opportunity to give consumers this valuable tool to finance \nhealth care costs.\n  MSA's work much like individual retirement accounts, something that \nthe consuming public of this country knows about and likes. They are \noften coupled with a catastrophic health care policy, but some models \nhave been conducted in combination with managed care plans. A limited \namount can be deposited annually, usually equaling the amount of the \nhigh deductible. At the end of the year, the unused amount is rolled \ninto the next year, allowing for savings to accrue.\n  If an individual does experience a catastrophic illness, savings can \nbe used to meet the annual deductible, as well as cover any copayment \nthat may be included as part of the catastrophic plan.\n  MSA's are portable because they belong to the individual. If we are \nreforming health care insurance, why do we not create a vehicle that \nprovides increased opportunity for individuals to possess health \ninsurance?\n  Regardless of your employment status, your MSA's stay with you. So, \nthe job-lock question is less likely to occur. In addition, savings you \naccrue can then be taken with you and used to pay for insurance \npremiums if you are between jobs. If you want to start your own \nbusiness and step away from an employer who provides insurance, the MSA \nstays with you. You can buy your own insurance with it.\n  It certainly creates tremendous choice and flexibility for the \nindividual and families, and that is what we are concerned about here, \nthe freedom of the individual and families to make sure they can \nprovide for themselves. Health care insurance coverage and MSA's can \nplay a tremendous role in doing just that.\n  Because MSA's have a higher deductible and lower premiums, they are a \nworkable alternative for small employers who currently cannot afford to \nprovide insurance as a benefit. So they even offer the small employer \ngreater opportunity to provide health insurance benefits to his or her \nemployees.\n  A catastrophic policy and a deposit in an MSA for the annual \ndeductible are lower in cost than any other type of insurance coverage. \nIn addition to the lowering of cost to the employer providing \ninsurance, MSA's provide the beneficiary greater flexibility in how \nthose health care dollars are spent and limit out-of-pocket exposure.\n  Finally, because savings can accrue, this is an opportunity to save \nover an individual's lifetime for those hefty, late-in-life health care \ncosts such as long-term care. That is real health care reform. That is \nreal health care insurance reform.\n  The cost of long-term care is a big problem that Senators have tried \nto deal with on this floor and that certainly the seniors of our \ncountry have faced themselves for a long time. Many of us at our age in \nlife, who have parents who are nearing a time when they may need long-\nterm care, all of a sudden begin to factor some of those financial \ncosts into our own budget, if we are capable of doing so, in caring for \nthe elderly of our family.\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\n  MSA's could help solve this problem in a generational way if this \nSenate and this Congress would simply quit talking about the value of \nthem and allow them to become available to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I have been frustrated by some of the references about \nMSA's, that they are an extreme idea that will help only the healthy \nand the wealthy. It could not be further from the truth. Rather, I \nargue that MSA's are a commonsense response to the current problems of \nour health care system, incorporating individual choice and \nresponsibility. The American people understand that and I think the \nAmerican people are ready to use this health care insurance tool in a \nway that works to their benefit.\n  The history of this issue has been one of bipartisan support. In both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, MSA bills have been \ncosponsored and supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  I have a copy of an old ``Dear Colleague'' letter on a bipartisan \nbill, S. 2873, the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1992.\n       Dear Colleague: The United States is faced with a crisis in \n     health care on two fronts: access and cost control. So far, \n     most of the proposals before Congress attempt to deal with \n     access but do not adequately address the more important \n     factor--cost control. We have introduced legislation that \n     will begin to get medical spending under control by giving \n     individual consumers a larger stake in spending decisions.\n       We have introduced a bill, the Medical Cost Containment Act \n     of 1992 (S. 2873), which would allow employers to provide \n     their employees with an annual allowance in a ``Medical Care \n     Savings Account'' to pay for routine health care needs. This \n     allowance would not be subject to income tax if used for \n     qualified medical expenses. Any money not spent out of a \n     given year's allowance could be kept by the employee in an \n     account for future medical needs during times of unemployment \n     or for long term care. In order to protect employees and \n     their families from catastrophic health care expenses above \n     the amount in the Medical Care Savings Account, an employer \n     would be required to purchase a high-deductible catastrophic \n     insurance policy.\n       Unlike many standard third party health care coverage \n     plans, Medical Care Savings Accounts would give consumers an \n     incentive to monitor spending carefully because to do \n     otherwise would be wasting their ``own'' money. That is, \n     money that they would otherwise be able to save in their \n     account for future needs.\n       Once a Medical Care Savings Account is established for an \n     employee, it is fully portable. Money in the account can be \n     used to continue insurance while an employee is between jobs \n     or on strike. Recent studies show that at least 50% of the \n     uninsured are uninsured for four months or less.\n       Today, even commonly required small dollar deductibles \n     (typically $250 to $500) create a hardship for the \n     financially stressed individual or family seeking regular, \n     preventive care services. With Medical Care Savings Accounts, \n     however, that same individual or family would have this \n     critical money in their account to pay for the needed \n     services.\n       We feel that, while the Medical Care Savings Account \n     concept does not provide the total solution to the crisis in \n     health care access, it does begin to address the critical \n     aspects of increasing costs and utilization by consumers.\n       We hope that you will join us as cosponsors of this \n     legislation. If you have any questions please contact us or \n     have your staff contact Laird Burnett of Senator Breaux's \n     staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Breaux.\n     David Boren.\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Richard Lugar.\n     Dan Coats.\n     Sam Nunn.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this letter outlines many of the beneficial \naspects of MSA's, or medical savings accounts, in addition. I found it \nquite interesting that as part of his pension simplification proposal, \nPresident Clinton would allow withdrawals from individual retirement \naccounts for catastrophic health care insurance needs. That is a great \nidea. But that is an MSA. Whether Bill Clinton knew it or not, by his \nendorsement of this approach, he has, in effect, endorsed medical \nsavings accounts, and I applaud him for doing so.\n  Since the healthy-and-wealthy assertions have been made, I want to \ntake a moment to address this issue, because it is phony, phony, phony.\n  Anyone who has experienced chronic health problems or a catastrophic \nillness realizes how difficult it is to cover out-of-pocket expenses. \nIf that health care problem is not covered by insurance, you get no \nassistance in helping finance the cost incurred. We have people who \nhave minimal coverage and are making limited incomes, and they cannot \nafford the out-of-pocket costs to get across the deductible threshold \nto get the benefits of their insurance, in many instances. For families \nand individuals on fixed incomes, this is especially problematic.\n  I had a constituent who expressed to me a frustration that even \nthough she had great health care insurance, it did not provide \ncomprehensive dental benefits. She needed to get a tooth capped, which \nwould cost her at least $500 out of pocket. Her alternative was that \nshe should live with the discomfort until more serious problems \noccurred with the tooth that would be covered by her insurance.\n  Her frustration was that this was the only health care problem she \nhad experienced in the last 2 years and the only cost incurred other \nthan her annual physical and dental checkup. She had not met her \ndeductible, but would have to find $500 in her monthly budget to pay \nfor capping a tooth or go take out a loan, if she could qualify, to cap \na tooth and then spread that cost over several months. If my \nconstituent had an MSA, the $500 would have been covered by funds in \nher account.\n  Medical savings accounts would also benefit individuals with chronic \nillnesses, such as diabetes. A few years ago, several individuals who \nlive with diabetes complained to me that many of the health care costs \nthey incurred are not covered by insurance. For example, the glucose \ntesting strips, the syringes for insulin, dieticians or nutritional \nservices, and the pharmaceuticals are not always fully covered by \ninsurance but are necessary in order to avoid more expensive, \ncatastrophic illnesses.\n  With a medical savings account, a diabetic could pay for these \nexpenses from his or her MSA. In addition, if they did experience a \ncatastrophic illness, they would be covered once their high deductible \nwas met.\n  Mr. President, some will claim that MSA's will cause people to forgo \nneeded health care treatment. This is simply not the case. I must say, \nwhile that allegation is made, there is no proof that MSA's would have \nthat effect. Unlike most health care coverage plans, MSA's give \nconsumers an incentive to stay healthy because the money you spend is \nyour own. In addition, they provide access to funds for preventive \nhealth care services which may not be covered by insurance plans.\n  Let me respond to the other half of the argument that MSA's are just \nanother tax break for the rich. Working families will benefit greatly \nfrom MSA's. The United Mine Workers of America have a provision similar \nto MSA's in their current contracts. Mine workers and other working \nfamilies, in my opinion, do not meet the definition of those who claim \nthis is just for the rich. I think those are hard-working people who \nwant and need good health care coverage for their families. That is \nexactly why the United Mine Workers Union negotiated it with their \nemployers, because it was something the employers could afford and it \ngave those working men and women greater opportunities for coverage.\n  I must say I grow saddened by the kind of rich demagoguery that is \nplayed on the floor of this Senate on a variety of issues when we try \nto expand the base and expand the opportunity for all Americans by \ngiving tax incentives or tax breaks that allow them to do certain \nthings beneficial to their well-being.\n  Mr. President, regardless of income, if you get an MSA and \ncatastrophic plan from your employer, your employer will be making the \nsame contribution to your account. In addition, MSA catastrophic plans \nare a less expensive option for an employer, especially small \nbusinesses, providing another affordable option for employers who \ncurrently do not provide insurance. That is what insurance reform \nshould all be about; as I said, to create affordability and to expand \nthe opportunity for access to this kind of coverage.\n  Finally, MSA's give lower income individuals an account to draw from \nfor primary care and other preventive services that otherwise would be \npaid\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nout of pocket. The out-of-pocket issue to those less fortunate in our \ncountry is a very real issue, Mr. President. In other words, MSA's \neliminate the up-front deductible required with most insurance policies \nand provide, in essence, by this very action, first-dollar coverage.\n  For example, with a traditional employer-provided insurance policy, a \ndeductible must be reached before the insurance policy kicks in. A low-\nincome parent with a sick child has to find funding out of his or her \nmonthly budget to pay for the doctor or for any prescription. With an \nMSA, the worry is gone because the money has been placed by the \nemployer in the MSA. Furthermore, if the problem is catastrophic, once \nthe deductible is met from funds in the MSA account, the catastrophic \npolicy provides the coverage.\n  In most cases, out-of-pocket exposure for individuals with MSA's is \nless than with other types of insurance coverage policies. In fact, \nlow-income families have an opportunity to benefit from the savings \nthat would accrue in an MSA over time.\n  Consider the following: Janet earns $13,000 a year. She is 20 years \nold and keeps her MSA through to age 60. If her employer deposits \n$1,800 a year in her medical savings account and she remains in good \nhealth and spends an average of $250 a year from her MSA, by the age of \n60, assuming an 8 percent interest rate per year, Janet would have \n$433,661 in her medical savings account. Now, that is an optimum \nscenario.\n  Let me give a more likely one. Under the same scenario, with Janet \nexperiencing more health problems, and let us say she is spending \n$1,000 a year from her medical savings account for health care, she \nwould still accrue $223,000-plus in her medical savings account by the \ntime she is 60. That is the opportunity that exists today if this \nSenate and this Congress will awaken to what the American consuming \npublic wants.\n  Under a traditional fee-for-service HMO-PPO program, Janet would have \nhealth care coverage as long as she stayed with her employer. She would \nhave to pay her annual deductible out of pocket and a copayment for \nservice once she met that deductible. At age 60, if she retired, she \nwould have no health care insurance and no medical savings account. \nThat is the current law. Even this legislation does not really address \nthat problem upon retirement, for those individuals who are not yet 65. \nMedical savings accounts do.\n\n  So, let us change S. 1028 from rhetoric to reality by amending it and \nputting medical savings accounts in it. While Janet may not be a real \nperson, there are plenty of real Janets waiting to benefit from medical \nsavings accounts.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Idaho was one of the first States to \nimplement a statewide MSA program. Early reports and reactions to \nIdaho's program have been very, very favorable. Ada County, the largest \nmetropolitan county in my State, was the first major employer in Idaho \nto offer the plan. It is saving the county a lot of money and providing \ngreater flexibility for county employees. Passing a Federal MSA plan \nwill enhance what is already a beneficial program in my home State of \nIdaho. It will allow our MSA program to be even more effectively used \nacross the State. In short, Mr. President, passing a federal MSA plan \nwill enhance what is already a beneficial program in Idaho.\n  Let me tell you about one of our county commissioners in Idaho who \nhas been a great advocate of medical savings accounts and was \ninstrumental in bringing that county on line with an MSA policy once \nthe State legislature passed the law. Gary Glenn, an Ada County \ncommissioner, participates in the optional MSA plan, as do about 20 \npercent of the Ada County employees.\n  Ada County's medical savings account plan saves taxpayers' dollars, \nmaximizes patients' choices, and rewards responsible health care \nconsumption. The benefits to Gary's six-member family are illustrated \nin these examples. The county's old indemnity program provided Gary's \nfamily typical coverage, $100 per person deductible, with a maximum of \n$300 per family, plus a 20-percent copay. The monthly premium was $494, \nof which Gary and his family paid $158 a month.\n  Under the new MSA, Gary's family has catastrophic coverage with a \n$2,000 per person deductible--the maximum per family, though, is \n$3,000--and 100 percent coverage or payment above that deductible. The \nnew monthly premium is $194. Gary still pays $158, but the county pays \n$36 per month instead of $336.00 for the old indemnity plan. This is a \ndramatic reduction in the overall cost of insurance on a per month \nbasis. This provides a savings of $3,600 per year. Out of the savings, \nthe county will deposit $2,100 in Gary Glenn's medical savings account.\n  Under the old indemnity plan, Gary's family faced a much higher \nfinancial risk. In the worst case, they would be forced to pay $5,100 \nin deductibles and copays out of pocket and after taxes. Under the \nmedical savings account, with a $3,000 deductible, no copayment, and \n$2,100 in his medical savings account, the most they would have to \nspend out of pocket in 1 year would be $900. That is important to \nremember. Instead of $5,100 out of pocket, they would spend $900. And \nthe county is saving literally thousands of dollars as the employer.\n  In addition, by reducing Gary's out-of-pocket family risk by 82 \npercent and providing them with maximum flexibility in how they spend \ntheir health care dollars, any portion of the $2,100 deposit in their \naccount--Gary Glenn's account now--is left to spend on health care, \nstate income tax-free, or to carry forward and earn interest.\n  So under the Idaho medical savings account plan in Ada County, the \ntaxpayers of that county and Gary's family are realizing real benefits. \nMr. President, why cannot we be smart enough to provide that to all \nAmericans--to give them at least the option, the choice? That is real \ninsurance reform. That is real flexibility. That is real \nportability. MSA's are an idea whose time has come. We ought to do it. \nToday, though, in this bill we only offer the rhetoric. I hope the \namendment that will be offered by the majority leader will pass and \nbecome a part of this important law.\n\n  Let me say in closing that S. 1028 is a good bill. What I have talked \nabout is making it a better bill, a more complete reform of the health \ncare system. Not the adjustments around the edges, but major reform in \na way that fits 21st century Americans. It gives them the freedom of \nchoice, access, the individual decisionmaking authority, the buying \npower they need, and it is effective for all levels of our society, the \npoor and the rich alike. That is what it should be about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nIdaho Statesman be printed in the Record. The headline says ``Congress \nCan Follow County Lead on Medical Savings Accounts.''\n  This editorial urges this Congress, this Senate, and the President \nhimself to become modern, to become thinkers and not prohibitors, and \nadd to this major reform package the concept of medical savings \naccounts. I hope we can accomplish that.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Idaho Statesman, Apr. 1, 1996]\n\n       Congress Can Follow County Lead on Medical Savings Account\n\n       Ada County is leading the way in health-insurance reform by \n     its use of medical savings accounts. Too bad many Democrats \n     in Congress and President Clinton are among those most afraid \n     to follow.\n       The U.S. House endorsed medical savings accounts Thursday \n     as part of its legislative package on health care, but the \n     outcome in the Senate is less certain, especially with \n     Clinton's threat of a veto looming over the whole bill.\n       The nation loses if medical savings accounts are stripped \n     out of the final legislation in a compromise.\n       As local experience shows, they can be an effective way to \n     save insurance expenses and give consumers more control over \n     decisions about their own health care.\n       Instead of traditional and expensive health-insurance \n     policies, Ada County buys only catastrophic policies for the \n     20 percent of its work force signed up for the program. The \n     savings are put into the accounts of participating \n     individuals and can be used for routine medical expenses.\n       The measures in Congress works about the same.\n       Individuals could make tax-deductible contributions of up \n     to $2,000 (or $4,000 for families) in a medical savings \n     account and would be required to purchase a high-deductible \n     health insurance policy for catastrophic illnesses.\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n       The system saves money because workers have an incentive to \n     shop around for medical care. Bargain hunters can motivate \n     doctors and hospitals to compete, which in turn injects \n     needed market forces into the health industry.\n       By eliminating the middle man--insurance companies--the \n     accounts allow people more direct control of how, when and \n     where they spend their medical dollars.\n       Sadly the issue of medical savings account has become \n     embroiled in partisan politics in Congress. But reforming \n     health care and giving consumers more options should not be a \n     partisan issue.\n       It is simply a matter of giving consumers greater clout as \n     the nation seeks an improved health-care industry.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the information of the Senators, \nwe have been on the legislation since 9:30 this morning, 5 hours, and \nwe have not had amendments. In the earlier part of the day, I think \nboth Senator Kassebaum and I were urging our colleagues to come over \nand make comments about it. We have been blessed with so many \nbipartisan comments on the legislation.\n  We are expecting an amendment by the majority leader momentarily to \nbe put down, also a unanimous-consent agreement in the process of being \ncirculated so we might be able to move toward the consideration, or we \nare going to find a situation as the evening time comes that Members \nwill say, ``Why can we not attend to some of our other responsibilities \nin the evening?'' We want to try and accommodate everyone, but we are \nopen for business. But the first business, we had hoped, would be the \nmajority leader's amendment, and then to have a good debate on that. \nPart of the debate will be on the medical savings account, and we will \naddress that issue in a more complete way at that time.\n  I just wanted to at least give some indication to our colleagues \nabout where we are in the course of the debate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I certainly will not take 10 minutes.\n  I want to add my voice to the bipartisan chorus of support for S. \n1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act. I am proud to say I was an early \nsupporter of this one. I signed on as a cosponsor back on July 17, \n1995, just 4 days after it was introduced by Senator Kassebaum.\n  I commend her and I commend Senator Kennedy for their determined \nefforts to advance this legislation through the Senate in the \npolitically charged atmosphere of an election year. She has created a \nbill that deserves the support of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  The provisions of this bill have been well covered--portability, \nguaranteeing availability and renewability of coverage, preexisting \nmedical conditions, and maintaining continuous health coverage, making \nit easier for small employers to voluntarily form purchasing \ncooperatives--and would bring about changes that a vast majority of us \nagree upon.\n  Even President Clinton, in a dramatic departure from his earlier \nproposal for a Government-run health care system, has now embraced \nhealth insurance reforms that are remarkably similar to those which \nPresident George Bush proposed back in 1992. Whatever one might be \nattempted to say about the irony of all of that, it clearly indicates \nthat we now have a unique opportunity to correct the problems that pose \nthe most serious threat to the health coverage of millions of \nAmericans.\n\n  Though each of us can think of various ways in which we would like to \nexpand upon the pending legislation, the reality is that the bipartisan \nappeal of the bill will be lost if we go too far in amending. I intend \nto be very cautious about amendments that are offered for the Senate's \nconsideration, even in cases where I might support the amendment on its \nmerits. I say this because I would rather pass legislation that \nactually becomes law, even if it is not as far reaching and perfect as \nI would like it to be, than to make a legal statement with legislation \nthat ends up in the great scrap heap of unfinished business--and there \nwill be plenty of that in this session of Congress, things that stood \non principle and could not get into law because you did not have the \nvotes to get them into law. Unfinished business--that stack.\n  When I hold town meetings in Wyoming--I do not know how many of us \nstill do that; I do--the message I always come away with is that people \nare thirsty for action. They are not interested in excuses or rhetoric \nor political maneuvers from either party. No matter how clever or \nimaginative we are in explaining ourselves, they just do not buy it. \nThey have had a bellyful of petty partisan squabbles. What they long \nfor is to see a Congress identify areas of agreement, as Senators \nKassebaum and Kennedy have done with this legislation, and then act in \nthe best interests of the American people, without agonizing who will \nwin or who will lose, who will be the top dog, who will be the underdog \nwhen it is finished, or politically, how to simply portray Members of \nthe other party in the worst possible light.\n  The pending bill would allow us to do something beneficial, I think, \nfor millions of Americans who are at most risk of losing their health \ncoverage. The General Accounting Office reports as many as 21 million \nAmericans would benefit if preexisting-condition exclusions are waived \nfor people who maintain continuous health coverage, and, furthermore, \nanother 4 million would no longer experience job lock if portability of \nhealth insurance is insured.\n  I believe it is time to move forward, adopt these protections to the \nextent that more sweeping measures are needed to make health insurance \nmore affordable, more accessible. I will help with that. I surely agree \nthat there is much more we can do.\n  I worked with Senators Chafee and Breaux on issues of a bipartisan \nnature. I think that is very important. Let us consider those items \nseparately that might serve to bring this down and view them at another \ntime in such a way that we do not jeopardize the enactment of the \npending bill.\n\n  I think what we need, sometimes, is an old-fashioned trait known as \nself-restraint. Perhaps we could even adopt self-restraint as the theme \nfor the next several hours as we consider the bill. It would surely be \nan appropriate manner in which to recognize Senator Kassebaum's \ntremendous leadership on this issue, and to preserve a thoughtful bill \nthat will provide important health insurance protections to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Finally, I note the senior Senator from North Dakota is not on the \nfloor. I hope he will have an opportunity to address my remarks. I \nadmire him. He is a friend. We have worked together. He has come \nforward and said that we should put aside our agendas, put aside our \nown causes, work in harmony and concert. I hear that, yet I also hear \neach and almost every day my good friend from North Dakota stirring up \nsome issue in some way, usually with a partisan twist. I think that if \nwe are going to do that, just note the pending business of the Senate \non the calendar. The pending business of the Senate is the illegal \nimmigration bill. It is not moving simply because the Senator from \nNorth Dakota wishes to place an amendment on it with regard to the \nbalanced budget and Social Security.\n  I am not speaking in a partisan way. I have been here before. I \nremember my dear friend Senator John Heinz placed amendments on illegal \nimmigration bills. Even my ranking member has done such heinous \nactivity from time to time, the Senator from Massachusetts. I have seen \nhim do that. I am not talking about partisanship. If we are going to do \nthis--we have a bill that is stalled right now. We will see how long it \nwill stall out. There are three amendments ready to be voted upon. \nWhere it is all held up, that bill is held up for a single particular \nreason: Because of the Senator from North Dakota, because of an eternal \namendment that he has with regard to Social Security, saying that no \nbalanced budget can ever be done, and we do not do anything with Social \nSecurity, which is an extraordinary thing in itself because Social \nSecurity is going broke. The people that are telling us it is going \nbroke are the trustees, the stewards of the system, who are saying the \nsystem will go broke in the year 2020.\n  So how do you keep ducking it, unless you are just carrying water for \nthe AARP and the Committee for the Preservation of Social Security and \nMedicare and other 800-pound gorillas in that particular Social \nSecurity debate.\n  So I hope that we will proceed. I say to my friend from North \nDakota--my friend and sometimes adversary--heed thine own advice. I \nwill be waiting.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, about 2 years ago, this Congress \nblocked attempts to act on comprehensive health care reform. While that \nyear's effort to achieve the major reforms that are so needed and so \nlong overdue did not succeed, the problems that led the President to \nmake that proposal have not disappeared. Far from it.\n  There are over 40 million Americans without health insurance, and \nover 23 million of those are employed. Over a million working Americans \nhave lost health care coverage over the past 2 years; 60 percent or \nmore of all Americans currently worry about losing their current health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Over the last few years, the rate of private health care cost \nincreases has dropped substantially, but there are now increasing \nconcerns about the quality of care. Public health care costs continue \nto increase at an unsustainable rate. The case for reform, therefore, \nis perhaps even more compelling now than it was 2 years ago when we \nfirst took up this issue.\n  I am, therefore, proud to be one of the cosponsors of S. 1028, the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act. It is not the comprehensive reform that we \nlooked at to begin with, but it is a good and important step in the \nright direction. Indeed, this may well be the first step on the road to \nreform that everyone can agree upon. I say to the Senator from Kansas \nand the Senator from Massachusetts that this legislation is brilliant \nin its simplicity, precisely because it cuts to the heart of the issues \nthat concern the American people most about health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, in my view, there are four cornerstones of health care \nreform: Universal coverage, cost containment, maintaining the quality \nof care that we enjoy in this country, and retaining freedom of choice \nfor the American people in terms of health care delivery and the \nproviders of health care.\n  This bill moves us in the direction of universal coverage by keeping \npeople insured who might otherwise not be. If there is any concern \nwhich everyone has regarding health insurance, it is the trap of \npreexisting conditions. All too often, individuals find themselves \nexcluded from coverage because of a preexisting condition. In some \ncases, the individuals themselves are not even aware of the existence \nof that preexisting condition.\n  By limiting exclusions for preexisting conditions, by making health \ninsurance coverage available for small businesses, and by ensuring \nportability and ending job lock, this legislation deals with the \nconcerns of millions of Americans. It will help to make health \ninsurance coverage more available for millions of Americans and for \nsmall businesses, help hold down health care costs for Americans, and \nfurther help to expand access to health care. That, in my opinion, is \nreal reform, or a step in the right direction.\n  In my own State of Illinois, over 2 million people are currently \nwithout health insurance. This bill will make a critical difference in \ntheir lives and in the lives of similarly situated people all across \nour Nation.\n  Those who are now without insurance are far from the only \nbeneficiaries of this legislation. For Americans who might want to \nleave their jobs and start their own businesses, or who might have to \nleave their jobs because of corporate restructuring, but who might have \na preexisting condition or family medical history that would currently \nmake it difficult or impossible for them to purchase an individual \nhealth policy, this bill will make a huge difference. It will guarantee \ntheir ability to access health insurance.\n  This bill will also guarantee that small businesses with only a few \nemployees would not lose their group health care coverage because one \nof the people in the group develops a serious health problem, as is the \ncase now. Moreover, it will make health insurance more affordable for \nthose small groups, making it more likely that more small businesses \nwill provide health insurance benefits for their employees.\n  Families with small children suffering from a serious health problem \nwill no longer face the prospect of being unable to obtain health \ninsurance if the child's parent changes jobs, ensuring that the child's \nparents are not themselves job locked because of the condition of a \nmember of the family. It is tough enough for families to deal with \nserious health problems affecting one of their children without having \nto face the additional problem of losing access to health insurance if \nthey are laid off or restructured out of their jobs or if they want to \nchange jobs for a new, perhaps better paying job that could help their \nfamilies in other ways.\n  Women who have had breast cancer or other diseases will no longer \nface higher premiums or loss of access to health insurance altogether \nif they change jobs once this bill becomes law. And young college \ngraduates starting their first jobs would not be barred from access to \nhealth insurance simply because they suffer from a childhood ailment or \na continuing disability from an unfortunate accident.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act, therefore, represents a practical, \ncaring set of reforms to deal with the real health care problems facing \nso many Americans, based on their everyday realities. It does not \nrequire Americans to radically change their behavior. It does not add \nanother bureaucracy or a huge new paperwork system. It does not require \nnew Federal spending or new taxes. It does not create any new unfunded \nmandate on State or local governments. At most, it will increase the \ncosts for private health insurance companies by less than one-quarter \nof 1 percent.\n  This bill is about incremental reform, but real reform nonetheless. \nIt will help virtually every working American, as well as millions of \nAmericans who are temporarily out of the work force. The bill itself \nwill work because it is based on what is actually going on in the world \nof real people who need health care.\n  Mr. President, it is worth thinking a moment about those everyday \nrealities. Statistics tell us that the average American works at a job \nfor about 4\\1/2\\ years. Over the course of a working career, therefore, \nan average working American could hold seven or more jobs. That fact \nalone makes it all too clear just how important it is for the American \npeople to have portable health care coverage. That fact alone is a good \nindication of how necessary it is to end preexisting condition \nrestrictions that result in Americans having to pay enormous sums for \nnew health care policies, losing access to the one they had, or end up \nwith no access to health insurance at all.\n  Eighty-one million Americans have preexisting conditions that could \naffect their insurability. More than half of all American workers are \nenrolled in health insurance plans that impose some form of preexisting \ncondition exclusion. As I stated earlier, when you consider that most \nof us will change jobs several times in the course of a lifetime, the \npreexisting condition problem affects virtually every American family.\n  Mr. President, every American wants and needs health care security. \nIt is as important to them as retirement security, an objective that \nshould command absolute consensus in this country. That vision and \nimportance of retirement security led to the creation of Social \nSecurity. That is why we provide tens of billions of dollars in annual \ntax incentives to companies to provide pension plans for their workers. \nThat is why we support pension plans and retirement programs and \nsavings.\n  Health care security is no less essential to the American people than \nretirement security, not only because you cannot enjoy retirement if \nyou are in poor health, but because lack of access to affordable health \ncare insurance can literally mean bankruptcy. Being able to roll over \nyour insurance coverage, therefore, is just as important as being able \nto roll over pension savings. Maintaining health security deserves the \nsame level of attention that we give to retirement security, and \nmeasures that protect and enhance that kind of health security deserve \nthe same kind of consensus support.\n  Mr. President, the really good news is that so many of our \ncolleagues--57, in fact--and so many different organizations, and the \nPresident, support this legislation. The American people support this. \nFacing the fear of loss of health insurance, facing the preexisting \nexclusion, those kinds of uncertainties will be resolved when we take \nthis step in the direction of incremental reform.\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n  This legislation has been carefully worked out. It represents a real \ncompromise by both Democrats and Republicans who support it. I \ncongratulate the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Kennedy, \nfor their leadership and for all the hard work they have put into \nbringing this bill to this point. As I said earlier, it really is \nbrilliant in its simplicity. I congratulate them for the bipartisan \nnature of this debate so far and for the efforts in bringing us \ntogether as representatives of the American people, whatever political \nparty, bringing us together to get this badly needed legislation \npassed.\n  If there is one matter that commands consensus, it is what this bill \naddresses because it addresses it so brilliantly, in my opinion.\n  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to put aside partisan \ndifferences, put aside other good ideas, and let us move forward and \npass this legislation so that it can be law and so we will have done \nthe job the American people have every right to expect that we will do.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, [Mr. Gramm], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about the bill that is \nbefore the Senate and the amendment that Senator Dole will offer on \nbehalf of himself and others. I will also cosponsor that amendment. I \nwant to try to explain why it is essential that we have measures which \nwill promote efficiency and cost savings if we are going to adopt this \nbill.\n  Let me say that making insurance portable and permanent is something \nthat I support. But I think that, if we are going to be honest with \nourselves, it is very hard to do this with a straight face, which is \nwhat has been done in virtually every speech that has been given on the \nfloor of the Senate this morning. We are talking about 25 million \nAmericans who are going to benefit from this bill. This is a number \nthat has been established independently of the Senate. We all rejoice \nin it--25 million beneficiaries of this bill, which is supposedly just \na technical amendment. Yet I would point out to my colleagues, if you \nlook through this bill, it does not appropriate one penny. It does not \nprovide one cent.\n  Now ask yourself, how are 25 million people going to benefit from \nthis bill, through greater availability of health insurance and lower \nprices, if the Government and the Congress which passes this bill are \nnot providing one single penny? Is it somehow magic that through \nGovernment edict we can bestow billions of dollars of benefits on our \nfellow citizens at no cost and no dislocation whatsoever? The answer to \nthat is clearly no.\n  I would like to begin by making a prediction. That prediction is, if \nwe adopt this bill as it is written, at the end of the first full year \nof its implementation, the cost of individual private health insurance \npolicies will rise by a minimum of 10 percent. I also believe that this \nis a conservative estimate.\n  I believe that group policy rates will go up because we are going to \nproduce, through this effort, several undesirable effects. I want to go \nthrough them to be absolutely sure that anybody who really wants to \nunderstand can do so, and because I think they make the argument for \nmedical savings accounts and other reforms to try to offset the basic \ncost increase that is going to result from this bill as it is currently \nwritten.\n  First of all, this bill guarantees that if a person wants private \nhealth insurance, they can get it. There may be a delay in the \navailability of benefits, depending on where the person works and when \nthey have private health insurance, but under this bill, anybody who \nwants private health insurance at any time, under some circumstances, \ncan get it. Furthermore, when someone comes into a group plan, no \nmatter what the state of their health, they cannot be charged more than \nany other member of that group and if somebody leaves a private \nemployer, they must be offered an individual insurance policy.\n  What is the result of this going to be? It seems to me there are \ngoing to be positive as well as negative results. The entire debate so \nfar has been about the positive result: 21 million people that do not \nhave private health insurance will be able to get it, because we are \nsaying by law that insurance companies must sell it to them. An \nestimated 4 million people who are locked into their job because they \nfear the loss of their health insurance if they move will benefit since \nthey will be guaranteed the issuance of health insurance when they \nchange jobs. These are the positive impacts of the proposed changes.\n\n  But it is generally true, in the real world we live in, that not all \nimpacts of dramatic changes are positive; let me outline some of the \nnegative impacts.\n  No. 1, we are going to end up, by guaranteeing availability, \ndistorting health coverage. Young, healthy people, knowing that they \nare going to be able to qualify for private health insurance in some \nform--either through a group or as individuals--are going to have a \ngreater incentive to not obtain the coverage that they have today.\n  Why do young workers who are basically healthy buy private health \ninsurance right now? Some might buy it because they are risk averse. \nBut many buy it because they want to guarantee that in the future, when \nthey may not be as healthy, they will have locked in their coverage.\n  What this produces is a balanced distribution of people who are \nbuying private health insurance--many people who are young and healthy \nand who are very modest users of health care as well as many people who \nare older and less healthy and who are heavy users of health care are \nall buying insurance. Since many young people buy private health \ninsurance in order to lock in guaranteed health coverage in the future, \nto the degree that we mandate that insurance companies sell people \nhealth insurance no matter what the state of their health is, we \neliminate one of the primary reasons that young people buy private \nhealth insurance. So the first negative impact of this bill is the \ncreation of a new incentive for young people not to buy private health \ninsurance.\n  Under this bill we also have some rather extreme provisions. Before I \nmention one of them, let me say that I understand, when you are talking \nabout health care, that it is hard to have a rational debate because \nyou are talking about sick people who we can all empathize with. But I \nthink it is important that we understand what we are doing if we are \ngoing to have a real debate in the Senate because, after all, that is \nour job--to understand what the implications are and to try to see that \nwe make a rational decision.\n  Under this bill, not only will young people with guaranteed ability \nat a later point to buy private health insurance have an incentive not \nto buy it today, but in designating a series of health benefits for \nwhich there is no waiting period, we create a special class of people \nwho will buy health insurance when they know they are going to need it, \nsuch as in a pregnancy, and then cancel the policy after they receive \nthe benefit--only to buy another policy when they are ready to use the \nbenefit again.\n  It is very difficult to quantify this, but anyone who read the \narticle in the April 5 issue of the Wall Street Journal knows this is \nhappening in States which have done exactly what we are proposing to \ndo.\n  So the first negative impact of this bill is that it eliminates one \nof the prime incentives for young, healthy people to buy private health \ninsurance, and the second negative impact is that it distorts the risk \npool in the process.\n  The third thing it is going to do, which is part of the positive \nimpact, is that the 21 million people who are sick today and as a \nresult of being high risk have opted not to pay the going market rate--\nor in some cases they simply have not been able to afford health \ninsurance--the positive thing for them will be that they will now be \nable to buy health insurance. The fact that they will opt for coverage, \nwhile younger healthier people, knowing they can get it later, will opt \nnot to get the coverage, however, will further distort the risk pool of \ninsurance. What this will mean is that in America there will be more \nyoung, healthy people who do not opt for health insurance than we have \ntoday, and there will be more\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nolder, less healthy people who do. Given the inherent cost of changing \nthe mix of people who are buying private health insurance, the \ninevitable result of this is going to be that you drive up the cost of \ninsurance premiums.\n  This is not just something that is theoretical, I know we have some \nstudy which says that costs are going to go up by some minuscule \namount. I do not believe, however, that anybody who has looked at the \nexperience of States like Washington could possibly believe this. I \nthink what we are really looking at in this bill, independent of any \nother changes, is younger, healthier people dropping out and older, \nsicker people opting in. The net result of these shifts is going to be \na substantial increase in insurance rates for those who have bought \nhealth insurance, for those who, in many cases, bought it when they \nwere young and healthy in order to have a guarantee of insurability. \nThe net result of this bill is going to be rising insurance costs.\n  Now, this bill, in fact, anticipates this result and sets up a series \nof powers to help the States try to deal with these potential impacts. \nAt some later point I am going to debate and possibly offer an \namendment dealing with a provision on page 40 that gives the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services the power to disallow a State program to \ndeal with rising costs unless it implements a mechanism to spread the \nrisk and to limit rate increases. I do not think we ought to be \ndictating to the States what they can and cannot do in order to deal \nwith a problem that this bill is going to cause.\n  We have before us a bill that is going to help people, 25 million of \nthem, and for these individuals it is going to be a godsend. But \nanother 100 million people, who already have private health insurance \nand who are going to see their rates go up, are going to be losers from \nthis reform. We are going to change behavior by inducing younger people \nto not buy into the system, and as a result rates will be raised. We \nare also going to bring sicker people into the system, and the final \nresult is going to be a spike in insurance rates--just as has happened \nall over the country in States with similar programs.\n  We have now some 29 States that have gone about this in a different \nway by creating risk pools to help people who have a preexisting \ncondition get health insurance. We are, in essence, going to kill that \noff this approach by mandating that the insurance policy be sold in the \nway we dictate at the Federal level.\n  There is a way to get the advantages to the 25 million people who \nwill benefit from the bill and offset the cost to the 100 million who \nwill lose from it. The way to do that is with fundamental reform which, \nit seems to me, can take two basic approaches. No. 1 is with medical \nsavings accounts as will be offered by the majority leader. The idea \nbehind the medical savings account is to change the Tax Code to allow \nan individual or a family to choose a high deductible insurance policy \ninstead of a low deductible policy, and to put the savings from the \nresulting lower premiums into an account which is designated solely for \nthe purpose of paying the policy's deductible. At the end of the year, \nif they do not spend that money on the deductible, they can roll it \nover for their retirement or take it out as income and pay taxes on it.\n  What that means is that for routine type care they are spending their \nown money. Medical savings accounts empower the individual consumer to \nbe cost conscious and provide a mechanism that will save the concept of \nfee-for-service medicine so those who do not want to be members of an \nHMO or a prepaid system can opt to stay in fee-for-service medicine and \nyet have incentives to be cost conscious.\n  If we adopt the amendment of the distinguished majority leader, we \nwill fundamentally change the health care market, and those savings \nwill offset several times over the cost that is involved in driving up \ninsurance rates for 100 million Americans to help the 25 million who \nwill be beneficiaries of this program.\n  A second reform, which is not contained in the Dole amendment, deals \nwith medical liability. We have some estimates which indicate that 20 \npercent of the cost of medical care in America comes from expenditures \nthat are aimed at keeping people out of the courthouse instead of \nkeeping people out of the hospital and out of the grave.\n  If we are going to make the changes envisioned in this bill, which in \nessence transfers costs to the people who have private health \ninsurance--by raising their premiums--from people who do not have \nhealth insurance today, the way to offset that burden on people who \nhave in essence done what we wanted them to do--bought private health \ninsurance--is by allowing for medical savings accounts and dealing with \nmedical liability.\n  If we do not make these two changes, my fear is that 2 years from \ntoday, insurance rates, especially on individual policies outside of \ngroup plans--because under this bill we guarantee the availability of a \npolicy to somebody who leaves their group plan--I am concerned that \nwithout medical savings accounts or without medical liability reform, \nwe are going to see insurance rates spike and we are going to see \nStates try to hold them down with rationing mechanisms and price \ncontrols. I think they are going to fail, as they are failing in \nWashington State today, and I think we are going to be right here 2 \nyears from now debating a health care bill again, and the demand will \nbe made to do something about exploding costs. Yet we will have \nproduced these exploding costs with this bill.\n  We have it in our power to help 25 million people and yet not hurt \nanother 100 million people in order to pay for it. The way to do that \nis with a medical savings accounts and medical liability reform.\n  In and of itself, this bill simply transfers income and assets from \none group of Americans to another, and in the whole you have 25 million \nwinners but you have 100 million losers.\n  With reform, we can see that virtually every American family wins. If \nall we are doing is simply shifting risk, we are not dealing with the \nfundamental health care problem in America.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote for the Dole amendment. I think it \nis very important. I totally reject the idea that this is a simple bill \nand that we ought not to load it up with other items. If we do not have \nfundamental savings, this bill is going to cause insurance rates to \nexplode, and we are going to be right back here 2 years from now \ndebating socialized medicine again. I have debated that once, I am not \neager to do it again, but if it is required, I certainly will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, more than 80 percent of Americans younger \nthan 65 are covered by health insurance, but if one of them changes \njobs, or is laid off, he or she may be denied health insurance because \nof a preexisting problem, or because his health insurance cannot move \nwith him or her. A genuine fear therefore exists that the security of \nhealth insurance could very well be lost. In fact, opinion polls show \nthat as many as one-third of employees fear that if they switch jobs \nthey will be unable to obtain new health insurance.\n  The American people believe, and I agree, that they should be able to \nchange jobs without losing their health insurance. Congress needs to \ninsist that health insurance be made portable so that the fear of \nlosing their health insurance should not plague the American people \nwhen they change or lose their jobs. This bill permits insured \nemployees who leave one employer to be covered immediately upon taking \nanother job that offers employees health insurance, regardless of their \nhealth status.\n  This bill does not establish community rating. Community rating is a \ngrave threat to the insurance market. I have heard many cite the dismal \nfailure of guaranteed issue in States such as New York. These States \ncoupled guaranteed issue with price controls that kept premium prices \nequal for everyone regardless of age, health status, etc. This \ncombination ensures collapse of the health insurance market. However, \nS. 1028 narrowly defines guaranteed issue in order to avoid the \ndevastating effects of pushing healthy people out of the health \ninsurance market.\n  There must be a limit to preexisting condition restrictions that now \nprevent many citizens from obtaining or holding onto health insurance. \nI am convinced, Mr. President, that small businesses should be \nencouraged to form\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\ngroups to build joint purchasing power when buying health insurance for \ntheir employees.\n  These provisions of the Kassebaum bill will be welcome and overdue \nimprovements in the health insurance market, and I wholeheartedly \nsupport them.\n  However, Mr. President, in the debate on health insurance reform, \nperhaps the most innovative solution has been given the shortest \nshrift--the medical savings account. This solution--that will provide \nthe greatest freedom--has been successfully used by many businesses to \nkeep their health care costs down and employee satisfaction up. In a \ntruly American way, medical savings accounts harness the free \nenterprise profit motive to promote sorely needed efficiencies in the \nhealth care economy. MSA's confer upon individuals an incentive, a \nreason, to spend their health care dollars wisely by turning part of \nthe savings over to the employees, in effect rewarding efficiency.\n  Mr. President, many private businesses are already using cash \nincentives and medical savings accounts to reduce their health care \ncosts while, at the same time, achieving great employee satisfaction \nwith the health care afforded them.\n  One company cut its health care costs significantly. In 1992, Forbes \nmagazine was spending $2.3 million per year for health insurance from \nCIGNA at an average cost of about $5,000 per employee. In order to \nencourage employees to be more cost conscious, Malcolm Forbes, Jr., \ndecided to reward his employees with a bonus for not filing major-\nmedical and dental claims.\n  Forbes explained the choice to its employees: If, during the year, an \nemployee minimized the number of claims filed with the insurance \ncompany, Forbes agreed to pay that employee a bonus of up to $1,200. \nEmployees enthusiastically embraced this plan; insurance claims dropped \ndramatically. As of 1994, while premiums for other CIGNA clients rose \nbetween 21 and 25 percent, Forbes' major-medical premiums fell 17.6 \npercent.\n  The obvious lesson learned from the Forbes example is that employees \nwill control their health spending--if they are allowed to keep the \nsavings. Of course, in the case of employees who are really sick, they \nfile the necessary claims and receive bonuses in lesser amounts. \nEmployees choosing to pay out-of-pocket for routine health expenses \ninstead of filing claims, get the bonuses at the end of the year.\n  Consider, Mr. President, how this kind of commonsense incentive will \nchange the public attitudes about health care costs. For example, one \nForbes employee regularly needs four different prescriptions filled, \nbut as a result of the Forbes bonus program, this employee now shops \naround for the best price. Before, he didn't care how much a \nprescription cost because insurance paid it. And when insurance pays, \nwe all pay, in the form of higher insurance premiums and lower income.\n  Forbes is not the only company to benefit from an incentive-based \nprogram. Dominion Resources, a public utility holding company in \nRichmond, VA, has likewise developed an innovative method of reducing \nits health care expenses, a medical savings account.\n  An MSA works: The employer buys its employees a health insurance \npolicy with a high deductible. This kind of policy has two attributes: \nFirst, it protects the insured against catastrophic health care \nexpenses; and second, its premiums are less expensive.\n  The employer then establishes a special account for each employee to \npay for routine medical treatment. What the employee does not spend \nfrom the account, he keeps. This incentive encouraged 75 percent of \nDominion's employees to enroll in a high-deductible plan. And guess \nwhat--since 1990, Dominion's health care costs have risen less than 1 \npercent per year; premiums have not increased in 3 years.\n  Forbes and Dominion Resources are but two examples of private \nindustry enterprise coming up with health care solutions that work. \nIncentive-based solutions work for the company and they work for the \nemployee. As one economist, Gerald Musgrave, put it, ``We have \nthousands of years of experience with how people handle their own \nmoney.''\n  So, why not let Americans continue to handle their own health care \ndollars and help them realize their role in cost savings? Time and time \nagain, Americans have shown that they can and will make cost-conscious \nhealth care decisions when given a sensible incentive to do so.\n  So, Mr. President, insurance can be made more accessible by assuring \nAmericans that their policies will not be canceled because of an \nillness or when they are changing jobs. These are some obvious flaws in \nthe market and I believe further progress can be made by addressing the \nTax Code. But I am convinced that we're on the right track.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an April 17, 1996 Wall \nStreet Journal article entitled ``A Way Out of Soviet-Style Health \nCare'' by Milton Friedman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 1996]\n\n                 A Way Out of Soviet-Style Health Care\n\n                          (By Milton Friedman)\n\n       In a chapter in his novel ``The Cancer Ward'' titled ``The \n     Old Doctor,'' Alexander Solzhenitsyn compares ``private \n     medical practice'' with ``universal, free, public health \n     service'' through the words of an elderly physician whose \n     practice predated 1918. A byproduct is an eloquent statement \n     of the major advantages of medical savings accounts for the \n     U.S. in 1996.\n       Mr. Solzhenitsyn himself had no personal experience on \n     which to base his account and yet, in what I have long \n     regarded as a striking example of creative imagination, his \n     character presents an accurate and moving vision. The essence \n     of that vision is the consensual relation between the patient \n     and the physician. The patient was free to choose his \n     physician, and the physician free to accept or reject the \n     patient.\n       In Mr. Solzhenitsyn's words, ``among all these persecutions \n     [of the old doctor] the most persistent and stringent had \n     been directed against the fact that Doctor Oreschenkov clung \n     stubbornly to his right to conduct a private medical \n     practice, although this was forbidden.''\n\n\n                       ``Easier to Find a Wife''\n\n       In the words of Dr. Oreschenkov in conversation with \n     Lyudmila Afanasyevna, a longtime patient and herself a \n     physician in the cancer ward: ``In general, the family doctor \n     is the most comforting figure in our lives. But he has been \n     cut down and fore-shortened. . . . Sometimes it's easier to \n     find a wife than to find a doctor nowadays who is prepared to \n     give you as much time as you need and understands you \n     completely, all of you.''\n       Lyudmila Afanasyevna: ``All right, but how many of these \n     family doctors would be needed? They just can't be fitted \n     into our system of universal, free, public health services.''\n       Dr. Oreschenkov: ``Universal and public--yes, they could. \n     Free, no.''\n       Lyudmila Afanasyevna: ``But the fact that it is free is our \n     greatest achievement.''\n       Dr. Oreschenkov: ``Is it such a great achievement? What do \n     you mean by `free'? The doctors don't work without pay. It's \n     just that the patient doesn't pay them, they're paid out of \n     the public budget. The public budget comes from these same \n     patients. Treatment isn't free, it's just depersonalized. If \n     the cost of it were left with the patient, he'd turn the ten \n     rubles over and over in his hands. But when he really needed \n     help he'd come to the doctor five times over. . . .\n       ``Is it better the way it is now? You'd pay anything for \n     careful and sympathetic attention from the doctor, but \n     everywhere there's a schedule, a quota the doctors have to \n     meet; next! . . .  And what do patients come for? For a \n     certificate to be absent from work, for sick leave, for \n     certification for invalids' pensions; and the doctor's job is \n     to catch the frauds. Doctor and patient as enemies--is that \n     medicine?''\n       ``Depersonalized,'' ``doctor and patient as enemies''--\n     those are the key phrases in the growing body of complaints \n     about health maintenance organizations and other forms of \n     managed care. In many managed care situations, the patient no \n     longer regards the physician who serves him as ``his'' or \n     ``her'' physician responsible primarily to the patient; and \n     the physician no longer regards himself as primarily \n     responsible to the patient. His first responsibility is to \n     the managed care entity that hires him. He is not engaged in \n     the kind of private medical practice that Dr. Oreschenkov \n     valued so highly.\n       For the first 30 years of my life, until World War II, that \n     kind of practice was the norm. Individuals were responsible \n     for their own medical care. They could pay for it out-of-\n     pocket or they could buy insurance. ``Sliding scale'' fees \n     plus professional ethics assured that the poor got care. On \n     entry to a hospital, the first question was ``What's wrong?'' \n     not ``What is your insurance?'' It may be that some firms \n     provided health care as a benefit to their workers, but if so \n     it was the exception not the rule.\n       The first major change in those arrangements was a \n     byproduct of wage and price controls during World War II. \n     Employers, pressed to find more workers under wartime boom \n     conditions but forbidden to offer higher money wages, started \n     adding benefits in\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n     kind to the money wage. Employer-provided medical care proved \n     particularly popular. As something new, it was not covered by \n     existing tax regulations, so employers treated it as exempt \n     from withholding tax.\n       It took a few years before the Internal Revenue Service got \n     around to issuing regulations requiring the cost of employer-\n     provided medical care to be included in taxable wages. That \n     aroused a howl of protest from employees who had come to take \n     tax exemption for granted, and Congress responded by \n     exempting employer-provided medical care from both the \n     personal and the corporate income tax.\n       Because private expenditures on health care are not exempt \n     from income tax, almost all employees now receive health care \n     coverage from their employers, leading to problems of \n     portability, third party payment and rising costs that have \n     become increasingly serious. Of course, the cost of medical \n     care comes out of wages, but out of before-tax rather than \n     after-tax wages, so that the employee receives what he or she \n     regards as a higher real wage for the same cost to the \n     employer.\n       A second major change was the enactment of Medicare and \n     Medicaid in 1965. These added another large slice of the \n     population to those for whom medical care, though not \n     completely ``free,'' thanks to deductibles and co-payments, \n     was mostly paid by a third party, providing little incentive \n     to economize on medical care. The resulting dramatic rise in \n     expenditures on medical care led to the imposition of \n     controls on both patients and suppliers of medical care in a \n     futile attempt to hold down costs, further undermining the \n     kind of private practice that Dr. Oreschenkov ``cherished \n     most in his work.''\n       The best way to restore freedom of choice to both patient \n     and physician and to control costs would be to eliminate the \n     tax exemption of employer-provided medical care. However, \n     that is clearly not feasible politically. The best \n     alternative available is to extend the tax exemption to all \n     expenditures on medical care, whether made by the patient \n     directly or by employers, to establish a level playing field, \n     in terms of the currently popular cliche.\n       Many individuals would then find it attractive to negotiate \n     with their employer for a higher cash wage in place of \n     employer-financed medical care. With part or all of the \n     higher case wage, they could purchase an insurance policy \n     with a very high deductible, i.e., a policy for medical \n     catastrophes, which would be decidedly cheaper than the low-\n     deductible policy their employer had been providing to them, \n     and deposit all or part of the difference in a special \n     ``medical savings account'' that could be drawn on only for \n     medical purposes. Any amounts unused in a particular year \n     could be allowed to accumulate without being subject to tax, \n     or could be withdrawn with a tax penalty or for special \n     purposes, as with current Individual Retirement Accounts--in \n     effect, a medical IRA. Many employers would find it \n     attractive to offer such an arrangement to their employees as \n     an option.\n       Some enterprises already have managed to do so despite the \n     tax penalty involved. MSAs have proved very popular with \n     employees at all levels of income, and they've been cost-\n     effective for employers. The employee has a strong incentive \n     to economize, but also complete freedom to choose a \n     physician, and the equivalent of first-dollar coverage. There \n     are no out-of-pocket costs. Until the employee spends more \n     than the total amount in the MSA. Such costs are then limited \n     to the difference between the amount in the account and the \n     deductible in the catastrophic policy. Moreover, the employee \n     can use money in the MSA at his or her discretion for dental \n     or vision care that is typically not covered under most \n     health plans. No need to get ``authorization'' from a \n     gatekeeper or an insurance company to visit a specialist or \n     to have a medical procedure--until the catastrophic policy \n     takes over.\n\n\n                          limiting competition\n\n       The managed care industry has come to recognize that MSAs \n     might threaten its growing control of American medicine by \n     offering a more attractive alternative. As a result, the \n     managed care industry has recently become a vigorous enemy of \n     MSAs. Every believer in competition will recognize that \n     opposition for what it is: a special interest using \n     government to limit rather than expand competition.\n       Medical savings accounts are not a panacea. Many problems \n     would remain for an industry that now absorbs about a seventh \n     of the national product. However, I believe that they offer \n     the closest approximation that is currently feasible to the \n     private medical practice that Dr. Oreschenkov cherished.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today is remarkable. At long last--on the \nfloor of the Senate--we are considering health care reform legislation \nthat the American people both want and support. And at long last, it is \nlegislation with significant bipartisan support.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. It will provide health \ncare insurance protection for thousands of Nevadans, and millions of \nAmericans. This incremental bill is our best opportunity to get working \nAmericans the health care access they deserve.\n  We have been close to this point before. It seems like ancient \nhistory when I think back to cosponsoring former Senator Lloyd \nBentsen's small business insurance health care reform. It too had \nincremental insurance coverage improvements that many in this body \nsupported--yet once again, the final hurdle could not be overcome.\n  Many times--and over many years--Nevadans have shared with me their \nheart breaking stories. Families whose children have medical conditions \nthat prevent the family from being able to purchase health insurance, \nbecause no insurer will take a child with a preexisting condition. \nWorking individuals who develop chronic health conditions, and cannot \nleave their current employment for fear of not being able to get health \ninsurance in their new job.\n  Health insurance is often denied for the very illnesses most likely \nto require medical care. Eighty-one million Americans have conditions \nthat could subject them to such exclusions if they lose their current \ncoverage, and sometimes these exclusions make them completely \nuninsurable.\n  People with preexisting conditions are penalized twice. First, they \nhave a serious health care condition that requires medical care--a \nsituation they did not choose. Second, they are at the mercy of \ninsurers who decide whether they will have coverage, or be cut off.\n  For the person with a preexisting medical condition, who has been \nlucky enough to get health care insurance through his or her job, the \nsecondary fear is keeping their job.\n  If the job is eliminated, it may mean no more health care insurance--\never. For the person who wants to better himself or herself by taking a \nnew job, or starting a new business, it may mean no more health \ninsurance--period. We can all imagine that fear.\n  These insurance company decisions affect working people who play by \nthe rules. They pay their insurance premiums when they can get \ncoverage. But they find themselves in untenable situations.\n  They are unable to have the most basic insurance of all--for \nthemselves and their families--to not have to worry about health care \ncoverage.\n  It is demeaning to all Americans if people cannot better themselves \nand their families' situations for fear of losing health care \ninsurance. This legislation will free many working people from the \nstagnation of being unable to accept new job opportunities.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act guarantees that private health \ninsurance coverage will be available, renewable, and portable to \nworking Americans.\n  This legislation will make it easier for individuals and employers to \nbuy and keep health insurance, even when a family member or employee \nhas a pre-existing condition. This legislation makes health care \ncoverage portable so workers would no longer be locked into jobs or \nprevented from starting their own business for fear of losing their \nhealth coverage.\n  Small businesses and self-employed individuals are particularly \nvictimized under the current system, because they lack the bargaining \npower of larger corporations. This legislation addresses their problem \nby encouraging them to form private, voluntary coalitions for purposes \nof purchasing health plans and negotiating with providers. By forming \nthese groups, the costs of health plans would be more competitive for \nsmall employers and individuals, as compared to large employers, by \ngiving them more clout in the marketplace.\n  This bill is the foundation for incremental health reform. Although \nthis insurance reform legislation will not solve all of the problems of \nthe Nation's health care system, it will promote greater access and \nsecurity for health coverage for all Americans. Private insurance \ncarriers will compete based on quality, price and service, instead of \nby their ability to refuse coverage to those who need it the most.\n  We all know there will be attempts to add amendments to this \nlegislation. Some of those amendments are going to be very hard to vote \nagainst.\n  But we must keep focused on what it is we are trying to accomplish \nhere.\n  We have the opportunity to provide access to health care insurance \nfor millions of Americans who each and every day face the uncertainty \nof whether they will have coverage.\n  We can do something to allay those fears.\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\n  Passing this bill is a big step to ensuring health care coverage is \navailable to working Americans. Other steps are needed--but they need \nnot be taken today.\n  Let us first take this big step, and get the job started. And from \nthere, we can and will, work to ensure even better health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, during the 103d Congress many of us \nworked very hard to try to enact comprehensive health care reform. \nDespite our efforts and what felt like endless debate, politics \nprevailed and we came up emptyhanded. Perhaps we were too optimistic to \nthink we could accomplish such broad and sweeping reforms in 1993; but \nunfortunately health reform remains a critical high priority issue for \nevery family in this country.\n  Well, political realities are still very real factors in determining \nthe outcome of legislative initiatives here in Congress. And here we \nare again discussing health care reform, only in a much more limited \nand focused way.\n  I am encouraged that the dialogue is open once again, and that we are \ntaking positive steps toward addressing the many health-related issues \nconfronting people across our country.\n  If I had it my way, we would not just be talking about health \ninsurance reform today. We would be doing more, especially for our most \nprecious resource, children. We should be doing more, like: ensuring \nbetter pre- and post-natal care for women and their babies; boosting \nrates of immunization even higher for children across our nation; \nworking even harder to reduce adolescent health problems like teen \npregnancies, substance abuse and STD's; improving child nutrition \nprograms and strengthening our overall national commitment to children \nand family health and well-being.\n  But, I recognize the realities of the 104th Congress, and realize \nthat sometimes progress comes one step at a time. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act. I believe this \nis a commonsense measure that will directly benefit working families \nacross our country. I sincerely hope we can pass this bill and send it \nto the President for his signature.\n  We should not weigh this bill down with amendments that could undo \nthe broad bipartisan support we so rarely see in this Congress. I \napplaud Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for their ongoing leadership and \ncommitment to enacting this legislation.\n  S. 1028 was carefully crafted so that we could pass it overwhelmingly \nand see it enacted into law with the full support of the White House. \nFor this reason, I will join my colleagues in opposing any \ncontroversial amendments that are offered, even those which I support \nin principle. We should learn from the past, Mr. President, and not try \nto bite off more than we can chew.\n  As I said, this bill is not a cure-all. We need to do more, of \ncourse. But, this is a reasonable, sensible first step and will go a \nsignificant distance toward guaranteeing coverage for millions of \nAmerican workers and their families.\n  Mr. President, we owe it to those families to pass this bill, and \npass it in its current form. To do anything which could jeopardize the \nfragile coalition of support for this bill would be irresponsible and \nbad public policy.\n  I appeal to my colleagues not to try and load up this bill with \namendments that will ultimately kill the bill. Let us show our \nconstituents that we can work together and we can put political \ndifferences aside for the greater good.\n  Much of what we are discussing here will not be news to people in my \nState. In 1993, we passed one of the most comprehensive health care \nmeasures in the country, and even after serious modification the people \nin Washington still have many of these same protections.\n  In some areas, like limits on pre-existing conditions, my State \nactually has a shorter limit of 3 months, which the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill will not preempt.\n  Earlier I said that we owe it to working families to pass this bill. \nI am talking about people across the country who have to worry about \ntheir health care coverage, people who want to work and take care of \nthemselves and their families. People like:\n  The working family of three. Dad wants to change jobs to a higher \npaying company, but his daughter has multiple sclerosis. Under this \nbill, he wouldn't have to worry that she will not be able to get \ncoverage under the new employer's plan. He plays by the rules, he pays \nhis premiums--this family will not be confronted with a preexisting \ncondition exclusion period.\n  By requiring insurance companies and employers to credit prior \ninsurance coverage, this bill will give workers with disabled family-\nmembers peace of mind and the flexibility to change jobs without fear \nof losing their insurance.\n  Or a woman who had breast cancer who is starting a new job. Today, \nshe could possibly be denied coverage or charged a higher premium \nbecause of her cancer history. But, tomorrow--under S. 1028--because \ninsurance companies and employers would be prohibited from \ndiscriminating against workers because of past medical problems, this \nwoman would be treated no differently than anyone else covered under \nthe same plan.\n  And, the new small business owner and her three children. Mom was \nabused in her former marriage and is trying to start over. A woman in \nthis situation is going to need all the help she can get to provide for \nherself and her kids.\n  Today, she could be facing not one but two obstacles to starting her \nnew life for herself and her family. First, she could be denied \ncoverage for herself for any preexisting condition that was caused by \nher years of being abused. Second, she is a new business owner and \nmaybe can't afford to purchase insurance for her handful of employees.\n  S. 1028 will give this woman a chance to succeed. She will not be \ndiscriminated against because of her preexisting condition, and under \nthe provisions of this bill--small businesses and individuals are \npermitted to form cooperatives to purchase insurance and negotiate with \nproviders and health plans. This arrangement will spread administrative \ncosts and empower the participants to negotiate for better prices.\n  In other words, S. 1028 will help this woman and her children put \ntheir troubled pasts behind them.\n  Mr. President, the examples are endless. We have heard many stories \ntoday, and as Senator Kassebaum pointed out--we all know someone who \ncould be helped by this bill.\n  Even though this bill may not be as comprehensive as I personally \nwould like, I want to reiterate my strong hope that we can pass S. 1028 \nwithout any controversial additions and move forward to address the \nmany other issues facing America's families. That's why we're here.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1028, the Health \nInsurance Reform Act, which promises to relieve the anxiety that \nmillions of Americans are feeling that they may lose their health care \ncoverage if they change their jobs, lose their jobs, or become ill.\n  Health care reform is certainly not a new issue for any of us. In \nfact, I introduced my first comprehensive health care reform bill back \nin 1990. It was 76 pages long and it dealt with these same issues--the \navailability and affordability of health insurance.\n  Over the subsequent 6 years, we have spent countless hours studying \nand debating the issue. If we have learned anything, it is that the \nAmerican people want health care reform, but they want something they \ncan understand and afford, and something that builds upon rather than \nreinvents the current system.\n  The American public wisely rejected the big-government approach \nproposed in the last Congress by the administration--that 1,400 page \nproposal literally collapsed under its own weight. More Government \nbureaucracy is clearly not the way to lower health care costs or ensure \naccess to care.\n  But rising health care costs and expanding gaps in coverage are still \nvery much on the minds of the American people. Poll after poll \ncontinues to show that health care remains a top priority. In fact, a \npoll conducted late last year by Princeton Survey Research Associates \nfound that more Americans are concerned about their own health care \ncoverage than they are about crime, high taxes, the political system, \nor the economy.\n  Americans clearly want health care reform. But what they mean when \nthey say that is: ``If I lose my job or get sick, I want to keep my \nhealth insurance and I don't want it to cost so\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nmuch.'' They want Congress to enact sensible, targeted reforms to make \nhealth insurance more affordable and available, and to ensure that they \ndo not lose the coverage that they currently have.\n  We have that opportunity today. Despite the partisan and sometimes \nbitter debate over this issue in recent years, there is now broad-\nbased, bipartisan support for this bill, which would benefit as many as \n25 million Americans each year, at no additional cost to the taxpayers. \nThe legislation currently has 65 Senate cosponsors and is supported by \na wide range of diverse organizations including the National Governors' \nAssociation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Association of \nRetired Persons, and the American Medical Association.\n  The Health Care Reform Act of 1996 builds upon and strengthens our \ncurrent private insurance system to make it easier for individuals and \ntheir employers to buy and keep their health insurance. It contains a \nnumber of common sense, market-based reforms that are designed to \nguarantee that private health insurance coverage will be affordable, \navailable, and portable. Most of these reforms have been included in my \nown health care bills over the years, and they have also been common \nelements of legislation introduced in past Congresses by both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  First, the bill limits the ability of insurers and employers to \nrestrict or exclude coverage for pre-existing health conditions like \nheart disease or cancer, making it easier for workers to change jobs \nand eliminating job lock. Insurers will also be prohibited from \ndropping or denying coverage for an individual when they or a \nfamily member becomes ill.\n\n  The legislation also provides a safety net for people who lose their \nemployer-paid coverage--insurers will now be required to sell them \nindividual policies. Some have expressed concern that this provision \nwill cause premiums in the individual market to skyrocket. However, our \nexperience in Maine--where insurers have been required to sell policies \nto any individual who applies since 1993--shows that this change should \nhave only minimal price consequences. In fact, one Maine insurer \nreduced rates for its individual policies by 16 percent last year.\n  And finally, the bill assists employers and individuals in forming \nprivate, voluntary coalitions to purchase health insurance and \nnegotiate with providers and health plans. These kinds of arrangements \ncan provide small employers and individuals with the same kind of \npurchasing clout enjoyed by large employers, making insurance coverage \nmore affordable.\n  No one pretends that the reforms contained in this bill are the \nanswer to all of our Nation's health care woes. They are targeted and \nthey are specific. But they will provide all Americans with what Robert \nSamuelson of Newsweek has termed ``a little more peace of mind.''\n  We should not underestimate the importance of providing this peace of \nmind to people like Susan Rogan, of Herndon, VA, who testified before \nthe Labor Committee last summer.\n  She told the committee that the experience of obtaining health \ninsurance after her husband's employers had gone bankrupt had been a \nnightmare, even though he quickly found a new job. Insurers were \nreluctant or unwilling to cover the family because their daughter has \ncerebral palsy.\n  She urged us to work together, saying:\n\n       It is your responsibility, in Congress, to find a solution \n     to the insurance problems that have caused so much heartache \n     for so many American families. We voted for you, and we \n     expect no less of you.\n\n  And Susan Rogan is right. She should expect no less of us. It is our \nresponsibility to work together and take this positive step forward to \ntear down the barriers that millions of working Americans and their \nfamilies face in obtaining and keeping essential health care coverage.\n  I therefore join the chairman and ranking member of the Labor \nCommittee in urging my colleagues to resist the temptation to weigh \ndown this important piece of legislation with highly controversial or \nextraneous amendments.\n  Some of the amendments that may be offered today are ones that I \nwould, under other circumstances, support. For instance, I have been a \nlong-time supporter of Senator Domenici's legislation to provide people \nwith serious mental illness with health benefits and coverage that are \ncomparable to those provided to people with physical illness.\n  However, this is neither the time nor the vehicle, and I intend to \nvote against all such extraneous amendments. We simply do not want to \nrun the risk of having this very sensible and eminently doable package \ngrow into yet another 1,400-page bundle of expensive mandates, more \nGovernment bureaucracy, and untested proposals.\n  We should not let the ghosts of health reform past destroy the \npromise that this important piece of legislation holds for resolving \nsome of the most serious problems plaguing our health care system, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, let me make an important point about this \nbill. It is very narrow in scope, addressing portability and health \ncoverage for preexisting conditions. It in no way resembles the \nexpansive Clinton health care proposal this body defeated 2 years ago.\n  In the summer of 1994, many hundreds of Washington state citizens \ngathered in Westlake Mall in downtown Seattle to protest the proposed \nGovernment takeover of their health care. They were outraged by the \nhubris and the arrogance of that health care plan, and rightly so. The \nplan focused on setting up new bureaucracies, that it completely \nignored the people who would have been affected by it.\n  This legislation takes a clear-headed approach, responding to one \nproblem that people face regarding preexisting conditions. It follows \nthe conclusions of the Senate health care task force, of which I am \npleased to have been a member for several years. We came up with the \nlessons learned from the Clinton health care debacle, and topping the \nlist was the fact that there simply cannot be a government-run health \ncare system. Period. The only sane, responsible way to address \nparticular problems that may arise is to take a very narrow, targeted \napproach. In other words, you don't solve a problem with grandiose, \nwholly unworkable schemes. You solve a problem with a commensurate \nresponse.\n  In this case, we have the problem of coverage for preexisiting \nconditions. The goals of this bill are strickly defined and few. They \nare to:\n  First, develop insurance reform legislation that builds upon and \nstrengthens the current private market system;\n  Second, make it easier for individuals to keep and obtain private \nhealth insurance coverage, including measures to limit preexisting \ncondition exclusions and expand portability;\n  Third, increase the purchasing clout of individuals and small groups.\n  With that said, let me enunciate what this bill will not do.\n  It will not require employers to offer or pay for health insurance \ncoverage.\n  It will not require individuals to purchase health insurance.\n  It will not impose new and expensive regulatory requirements on \nindividuals, employers, or States.\n  It will not create new Federal boards, commissions, or regulatory \nbodies.\n  It will not contain a standard benefit package or mandated benefits.\n  It will not subject ERISA plans to state regulation.\n  It will not impose any new taxes.\n  This is not ``Clinton Lite;'' this is a modest, narrow, targeted \nproposal. This is the way health care reform should be accomplished: \nnot consumed with utopian visions and grand schemes of expensive \ngovernment power, but realistic and down-to-earth.\n  I believe we have finally got it right. I know that many of my \nconstituents in Washington State, and many Americans, are concerned any \ntime Congress addresses the issue of health care reform. With the \nmemory of the Clinton plan fresh in their minds, they certainly have \nreason to be wary. But I believe that, once they know what is in this \nbill, they will be pleasantly surprised. This Congress has neither the \nintention nor the desire to let the government take over American \nhealth care, the best health care system in the world. This Congress \nwants to take a very limited approach to specific problems.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is in concert with the beliefs of \nmost\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\nAmericans, who do not want government-run health care, but who do \nexpect Congress to address and resolve certain problems in the system. \nThat is what this bill does, and I am glad to support it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 1028, the Health \nInsurance Reform Act, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this \nimportant legislation, and I urge its passage. I commend Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their leadership in crafting this \nbipartisan measure which will help many working Americans keep \nimportant health insurance protection for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  The purpose of the Health Insurance Reform Act is to ensure that \npeople who have employer-provided health insurance will not lose their \ninsurance if they change jobs, lose their jobs or become sick. This \nlegislation makes changes in the private insurance market to protect \nemployees, and to make insurance more affordable for small businesses \nand individuals.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act requires insurers and health \nmaintenance organizations to provide and renew group coverage to \nemployers with two or more employees who want to purchase it, and this \ncoverage must be available to all employees regardless of their health \nstatus. In addition, this legislation makes insurance portable by \nlimiting pre-existing condition exclusions and by requiring group to \nindividual coverage.\n  S. 1028 limits to 12 months exclusions for pre-existing conditions \nwhich occurred within the 6-month period prior to receiving insurance \ncoverage. This 12-month limit will be imposed only one time for \nindividuals who maintain continuous coverage even if they change jobs \nor insurance plans. Individuals who lose employer-provided health \ninsurance will be guaranteed the opportunity to purchase an individual \npolicy if they had continuous coverage for 18 months in a group plan, \nif they have exhausted their COBRA continuation coverage, and if they \nare not eligible for coverage under another group health plan. These \nprovisions will go a long way toward ending the current problem of job \nlock, and ensuring that people who have been participating in health \ninsurance plans do not lose protection when they change jobs or become \nsick.\n  S. 1028 is not comprehensive health care reform. It does not provide \nuniversal coverage for all Americans, and insurance costs will be \nunaffordable for others. However, it is a very important step forward \nin addressing problems in our current health insurance system, and it \nwill provide peace of mind to many working Americans who have health \ninsurance but fear losing it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Health \nInsurance Reform Act, S. 1028. This important legislation represents a \nsignificant and reasonable step in extending health insurance coverage \nto a larger segment of the American population.\n  I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this bill and would \nlike to take this opportunity to commend the distinguished chairman and \nranking minority member of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, for the outstanding contribution \nthey have made in helping to provide literally millions of Americans \nwith peace of mind that they will not lose their health coverage.\n  As my colleagues are aware, insurance market reform is a bipartisan \nissue and it is something we have been working toward for many years. I \nam thinking back to the Bentsen-Durenberger bill which many of us \ncosponsored 4 years ago.\n  Indeed, as most of my colleagues know, the Senate and House have \nspent considerable time and energy over the past 5 years debating \nvarious proposals designed to address problems with our Nation's health \ncare system overall.\n  Perhaps no other issue in recent years has captured the attention and \nconcern of the American people than the issue of health care reform and \nthe role of the Federal Government in shaping that reform.\n  But I submit that today is not the time to debate measures of such \ntremendous scope.\n  Unlike the President's approach, S. 1028 is targeted and narrowly \nfocused reform aimed at assisting nearly 25 million Americans in \nobtaining health insurance coverage.\n  Most of us in the Senate recall the innumerable hours spent \nconsidering President Clinton's legislation that was ultimately \nrejected by the American people and by the Congress.\n  One of the lessons we learned from that endeavor was the need to \nprovide for greater access to health insurance than what is currently \navailable.\n  And access to health insurance is unquestionably one of the \nfundamental problems facing Americans today.\n  The current health insurance market provides too little protection \nfor individuals and families with significant health problems and makes \nit too difficult for employers--particularly small employers--to obtain \ncoverage for their employees.\n  The health insurance reform bill is specifically designed to address \nthis problem.\n  It will reduce many of the current barriers to obtaining health \ncoverage by making it easier for people who change jobs or lose their \njobs to maintain adequate coverage, and by providing increased \npurchasing power to small businesses and individuals.\n  The bill will not only increase access to health care coverage, but \nwill also provide portability of insurance coverage and increase the \npurchasing power of individual and small employers who wish to seek to \npurchase insurance.\n  Specifically, the bill restricts the use of preexisting condition \nlimitations by insurance carriers.\n  Some insurers today impose preexisting condition limitations or \nexclusions on individuals when they first become covered by an insurer.\n  These exclusions may limit coverage of a medical condition for a \ncertain period or longer or may exclude coverage of a medical \ncondition--forever.\n  Under the provisions of S. 1028, insurers, HMO's, and self-insured \nfirms would be limited in the ability to use preexisting condition \nlimitations to no more than 12 months after the enrollment date.\n  In addition, benefit limits or exclusions could not be imposed for \nnewborns, newly adopted children, children newly placed for adoption, \nor for benefits for pregnancy.\n  Another important component of this bill is the provision regarding \nthe guaranteed issue of health coverage benefits.\n  Under this provision, an insurer or health plan is required to cover \nany group or individual who applies, without regard to health status or \nclaims experience. The bill would require all insurers who offer group \ncoverage to accept coverage for all groups that apply.\n  Insurers would be required to offer individual coverage to all \nindividuals moving from group coverage to individual coverage as well. \nHowever, to be eligible for this guarantee, the individual must satisfy \nthe following four criteria:\n  First, the individual must have been covered under one or more group \nhealth plans for at least the past 18 months;\n  Second, the individual must not be eligible for group health \ncoverage, or, if eligible for continuation coverage under the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA, or a \nsimilar State program, then they must have elected, and exhausted that \ncoverage;\n  Third, the individual must apply for individual coverage not more \nthan 30 days after the last day of coverage under the group plans, or \nthe termination date of COBRA benefits; and\n  Fourth, the individual must not have lost group coverage due to \nnonpayment of premiums or fraud.\n  Accordingly, in order to be eligible for insurance coverage in the \nindividual market, we have incorporated important benchmarks to foster \nindividual responsibility and accountability in the purchasing or \ninsurance plans.\n  We are all aware that this bill has engendered considerable debate on \nhow it would impact existing premiums.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries has studied this issue in great \ndetail and estimates that people who are newly eligible for individual \ncoverage would pay an average of two to three times the standard-risk \npremium rate, unless States restrict premiums.\n  The Academy further states that S. 1028 will have no effect on \nindividual insurance premiums for those currently purchasing coverage \nin the vast majority of States.\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n  In States that restrict premiums, S. 1028 would lead to individual \nmarket premium increases in the range of 2 to 5 percent, spread out \nover a 3-year period.\n  Thus, I believe that fears the bill will lead to large increases in \npremiums are unwarranted. However, I recognize those concerns, and I \nwill be monitoring this situation closely.\n  Another important provision in this legislation addresses insurance \nportability.\n  During our consideration of health care reform, it was clear that the \nuse of preexisting condition provisions in insurance plans has \ncontributed to a problem referred to as ``job lock''.\n  In effect, employees are locked into their current jobs because \nchanging jobs might subject them to periods without health insurance \ncoverage because of a preexisting health condition.\n  For an employee with a medical condition, or a dependent with a \nmedical condition, loss of coverage during a limitation period, or \nworse, exclusion of coverage of the condition forever could mean \nsignificant out-of-pocket health care expenditures.\n  As a result, guaranteed issue and limits on the use of preexisting \ncondition provisions by insurers provide needed portability of coverage \nfor American workers.\n  It is also important to note that the legislation provides specific \nguidance with respect to State flexibility in compliance with this new \nlaw.\n  Federal provisions for group to individual portability only become \neffective if States do not have programs meeting Federal requirements \nfor access.\n  S. 1028 will provide for state flexibility for compliance with \nFederal provisions.\n  State mechanisms could include guaranteed issue or open enrollment \nprograms by one or more plans, a high risk pool, or mandatory \nconversion policies.\n  In my State of Utah, we have already enacted many of these reforms.\n  The legislation would permit a waiver from Federal law if a State \ncould demonstrate that its law achieved the objectives of affordable \nindividual market portability and renewability.\n  And finally, S. 1028 promotes group purchasing by small businesses by \nassisting employers and individuals in forming private, voluntary \ncoalitions to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers \nand health plans.\n  These coalitions will provide small employers and individuals with \nthe kind of clout in the marketplace currently enjoyed by large \nemployers.\n  It's important to note what this bill does not contain.\n  S. 1028 does not impose new, expensive regulatory requirements on \nindividuals, employers or States.\n  S. 1028 does not create new Federal bureaucracies or agencies.\n  S. 1028 does not contain any new taxes, spending, or price controls.\n  S. 1028 does not require employes to pay for health insurance \ncoverage.\n  And, S. 1028 contains no unfunded mandates on State, local, or Indian \ntribal governments.\n  In effect, this bill contains none of the onerous provisions \ncontained in the ill-fated Clinton health care reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I will state in all candor that initially I had \nreservations about supporting this legislation.\n  As a general rule, I believe the Federal Government should not \nintervene in areas where consumer choice and natural marketplace \nconditions determine the level and costs of products and services.\n  And, indeed, in the past I have supported what I believe were true \nmarket-based reform proposals in the health care area. However, the \nproblem of access to health insurance has long been a problem to \nmillions of Americans.\n\n  This problem remains, and it will continue to remain until \nappropriate Federal action is taken.\n  Over the course of the past year, we have worked to develop and fine-\ntune the provisions embodied in S. 1028.\n  Most of these modifications were developed to more clearly reflect \nthe intent of the bill.\n  These revisions were principally designed to provide more certainty \nto States and insurers as well as to respond to concerns that the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services was given too \nmuch discretion over alternative State programs.\n  I am pleased that the manager's amendment deals with concerns \nexpressed to me from constituents in Utah over the need to revise the \nbill's provisions regarding conflict of interest language as it applies \nto purchasing cooperatives.\n  And, I would like to thank Senator Kassebaum's cooperation in \nresolving these issues.\n  This legislation will now permit insurers, agents, and brokers to \nserve on purchasing cooperative boards or be employed by a cooperative \nas long as they do not personally benefit from the sale of services or \nproducts to that cooperative.\n  I believe we have come as close as possible in this present political \nenvironment in developing a viable measure that will appropriately \naddress the problem of access to health insurance for millions of \nAmericans.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that passage of S. 1028 will \nhelp at least 25 million Americans each year.\n  According to the GAO, an estimated 43 million Americans or 18.7 \npercent of the nonelderly population were without health insurance \ncoverage for some period of time in 1995.\n  This bill will truly help people, and I believe it deserves our \nstrong support.\n  It is clear that insurance market reform is one area which enjoys \nwide bipartisan support in both houses of Congress. The fact that the \nbill currently has 65 cosponsors and was reported unanimously by the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee serves as a testimonial to its \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  It is clear that this important piece of legislation with its strong \nbipartisan support has the potential to be signed into law by the \nPresident as he indicated in his State of the Union Address in January.\n  I commend Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy, and all the cosponsors, and \nhope that we can move this key legislation forward today.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nlegislation. Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Kassebaum and \nSenator Kennedy deserve to be commended for there efforts in crafting \nthe bill before the Senate which assures that workers who intend to \nchange jobs will no longer experience the fear of losing their health \ncare coverage. Not only have Senator Kassebaum, other members of her \ncommittee, and their staffs labored many long hours to draft the bill, \nthey have also successfully built a strong coalition of support. Thanks \nto Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy this bill is supported by big \nbusiness, small business, a wide array of advocacy groups, many \ninsurance companies, and many Americans.\n  While I do think the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill could be improved, I \nthink it is a critical step forward. At a later time, I will join the \nmajority leader in offering an amendment which makes health insurance \nmore affordable.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill has an important \nfocus. The bill will assist people who want and need to make necessary \nand correct decisions about their health care needs--people who work, \npeople who join their group health care plans and have paid their \npremiums continuously for no less than 12 months. The bill eliminates \n``job-lock'' for workers who fear they will lose their health coverage \nwhen they change jobs, and the bill eliminates the fear of losing \ncoverage for individuals who have maintained their group coverage and \nhave a preexisting condition.\n  Recently my office was contacted by a lady who has always been \ninsured and paid her premiums. Yet she finds herself today in a \nsituation where she is unable to obtain health care coverage because of \na preexisting condition. Nancy Miller is 56 years old, after a divorce \nfrom a 27-year marriage, she was allowed access to continued group \nhealth coverage through her former spouse's employer plan at the group \npremium rate for 3 years. Mrs. Miller's 36 month COBRA coverage expires \nat the end of May. To make sure she will not have a gap in health \ncoverage, Mrs. Miller has worked with her current insurer, called many \nother insurers, contacted our office, worked with an insurance broker \nand yet she has been rejected from every health plan she has\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\napplied to. Mrs. Miller has a preexisting condition. She can not get \nhealth care coverage because she contracted breast cancer 2 years ago.\n\n  Mrs. Miller's situation could apply to anyone, because anyone could \nget sick. Mrs. Miller has not gamed the system seeking insurance only \nwhen she needed it. For years she was healthy, and for her entire life \nshe has been insured. The letter Mrs. Miller's insurance broker \nrecently wrote her could be a letter received by many women. The \nfollowing is the letter she received from her broker:\n\n       This letter is to inform you that we have contacted all of \n     our standard individual health insurance carriers and are \n     unable to find one that is capable of writing a policy for \n     you because of your pre-existing condition. We have been \n     advised by all of the carriers that they will not consider \n     you for insurance until you are 5 years out from your time of \n     release from the doctor.\n\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will provide assurances to responsible \nAmericans. In particular, the bill provides portability in two \nsettings: When individuals change from one group health plan to another \ngroup health plan (group to group), and when individuals leave their \ngroup health plan and seek coverage as an individual policyholder in \nthe market (group to individual).\n  For group to group portability, the bill establishes uniform Federal \nstandards for insurers, health maintenance organizations [HMO's], and \nemployers who self-fund their health plan. There is a broad consensus \nthat these measures should be enacted, and a very broad coalition of \nbusiness as well as the insurance industry and advocacy groups support \nthese provisions. There is a need to establish uniform Federal \nstandards for the group to group portability measures as the bulk of \nemployer sponsored health coverage is self-funded and exempt from State \nregulation. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA], \nthe Federal Government regulates private self-funded employer plans. \nERISA prohibits States from regulating employer sponsored self-insured \nplans. Therefore, States cannot achieve all the reforms needed to \nassure portability when workers change jobs because the Federal ERISA \nlaw prohibits States from regulating any group health plan which is \nself-funded.\n  For those individuals leaving their group health care coverage and \nseeking coverage in the individual market, the bill provides access to \ncoverage to individuals. The bill also provides States with important \nflexibility to meet the goals of this section of the bill. While there \nhave been concerns raised regarding the bill's provision to guarantee \nthat insurers make health coverage available to individuals, I think \nthis section is important if we are to truly guarantee portability and \naccess to coverage. States currently regulate insurance provided to \nindividuals who are not in a group plan. The Federal role in this area \nof the marketplace has been minimal; therefore I agree with the bill's \ngoal to retain a strong state role in the individual market. This \nsection of the bill provides the needed flexibility for States to be \ncreative.\n  It's important to note that the bill builds on responsible behavior \nbecause it requires that individuals have previous continued group \nhealth care coverage in order to qualify for the portability \nprovisions. This is the case with Mrs. Miller who responsibly \nmaintained her group coverage.\n  The pending bill provides that health plans can not impose \npreexisting condition limits on individuals who had prior group \ncoverage. In fact no preexisting condition limits can be imposed on \nindividuals who join a group health plan if they had continuous group \nhealth coverage for the previous 12 months. For individuals leaving a \ngroup plan, they must have had 18 months of continuous coverage in \norder to qualify for an individual policy without any preexisting \ncondition limits. In either case, if individuals have less than the \nrequired months of coverage, their new plan would have to credit them \nfor the time that they were covered.\n  Most Americans with private health insurance receive their coverage \nthrough their employers, and the majority of the uninsured are also \ntied to the workplace. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will strengthen the \nemployer-based health care system we now have, and it will help \nresponsible Americans like Mrs. Miller retain their coverage. In fact, \nthe General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 21 to 25 \nmillion people per year could be affected by Federal portability \nstandards in all markets. This is a good first step.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic cosponsor of the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act of 1995 and call on my colleagues to keep \nthis straight-forward measure clear of legislative land mines.\n  Passing this bill will help address a problem all too common in our \nhealth care system--the fact that people can lose their insurance \ncoverage when they get sick even if they have paid their premiums.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of bipartisan initiatives that can \nand should be passed before we adjourn this fall. Chief among these \nproposals is this Health Insurance Reform Act.\n  Under the strong bipartisan leadership of Chairman Kassebaum and \nSenator Kennedy, the bill unanimously passed the Labor and Human \nResources Committee 8 months ago. It has since languished in the \nconfounding waste zone between full Committee endorsement and Senate \nfloor action because some are opposed to even narrow health reform.\n  Last Congress the American people called for comprehensive health \nreform. Unfortunately, consensus could not be reached on a single plan. \nInstead, the country watched in disappointment as a golden opportunity \nfor health reform fizzled out. Partisan fights and interest group \ninfluence won the day.\n  It will serve no good purpose to rehash the health reform battles of \nthe past. We now have the opportunity to move beyond party squabbling. \nCongress can clearly demonstrate the will to enact a bipartisan health \nreform bill. Or we can choose to remain gridlocked and at the mercy of \nspecial interests. I believe that choice is an easy one.\n  Fortunately, there still is a broad consensus in this country in \nfavor of health insurance reform. Americans want to know that they \nwon't lose coverage if they or someone in their family gets sick. \nIndividuals and businesses want the ability to pool resources to get \nthe best insurance coverage possible at an affordable price.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act does not seek to change our Nation's \nhealth care structure drastically. Instead, it takes a careful approach \nto remedy widely acknowledged problems in the health insurance market. \nFor the first time, preexisting condition exclusions would be limited, \nhealth coverage availability and renewability would be guaranteed, and \nsmall business group purchasing would be easier. At the same time, \nState flexibility would be maintained.\n  Many States have taken the initiative and made notable progress by \nenacting market-related reforms. But States are unable to achieve the \nmost effective reforms because some businesses have federally protected \nself-insured health plans. This bill provides continuity by applying \nthe same standards to all employment-based plans.\n  The bill is also notable for what it does not do. It won't require \nemployer mandates, limit provider choice, set up new bureaucratic \nhealth structures, or create a global health spending budget.\n  Many strongly believe that health care reform should go farther than \nthis bill. In fact, many Senators, including myself, worked hard last \nCongress on comprehensive measures to control health costs and expand \nhealth coverage. But those efforts turned out too complex to retain \nbroad support.\n  We now have a more narrow consensus measure that can pass. Yet some \nSenators may offer a whole host of amendments to address special \nconcerns. A few of these are popular, others problemmatic. The sponsors \nof this bill have taken careful steps to ensure that the bill is narrow \nand bipartisan. It should remain that way. For that reason, I too will \noppose controversial, special interest amendments.\n\n  As we learned from previous attempts at reform, a consensus bill may \nbe the only way we can pass health reform this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to refrain from condemning this bill under a weight of \ncontroversial additions.\n  Nonetheless, we should not hold out on improvements if they are \nbipartisan and avoid endangering final passage.\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n  As a long-time supporter of health care fraud and abuse legislation, \nI believe it is imperative that we act to tackle rampant abuse. If \nstrong anti-fraud provisions, such as those included in Senator Cohen's \nanti-fraud bill, can be added without stalling the bill, they most \ncertainly should. Similarly, provisions helping the self-employed \nafford insurance and incentives for long-term care may be possible.\n  However, there are other compelling issues that, if attached to the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act, may kill this bill. We should not ingore \nthose issues. They can and should be taken up at a later date.\n  Mr. President, if we keep this bill clean, we will take a huge step \ntoward addressing compelling insurance problems facing the Nation. In \nthe process, Congress will prove that it can act in a bipartisan \nfashion to help hard working Americans.\n  There are over 40 million people without health insurance in our \ncountry. I am proud to say that Wisconsin has one of the lowest numbers \nof uninsured people. However, there are still too many Wisconsinites \nwithout health coverage and still too many who fear losing their \ncoverage.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act will not solve all of the problems \nplaguing our health care system, but it does fill a huge gap by solving \njob lock. Workers will no longer have to live with the fear that if \nthey change their jobs, they may lose their health coverage.\n  No doubt, there is special interest opposition to this bill. It is a \nrare legislative initiative that doesn't have critics. But this bill is \na positive first step.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act does not provide a handout to the \npublic. No one gets a free ride at the expense of insurance companies. \nPeople must maintain their payments for a full year-and-a-half before \nqualifying for coverage guarantees. They also must be ineligible for \nanother group policy and exhaust their COBRA benefits. Finally, people \nwill still have to pay the rates charged by insurance companies. These \nrequirements were added to minimize affects on insurance premiums. \nHowever, it is important to note that States would not be prevented \nfrom going further on insurance reform.\n  Mr. President, you cannot satisfy everyone, but this bill comes \nclose. While there are opponents and critics on both sides, a large \nmajority of Americans support passage.\n  If Senators need more impetus to allow this bill to go forward, the \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that passing the Health Insurance \nReform Act will help 25 million Americans each year obtain or retain \nhealth coverage. That evidence alone is a compelling reason to pass a \nclean bill.\n  Mr. President, Americans have had little proof this session that \nCongress can act to help solve problems plaguing their families. Let's \ngive them one good reason to have greater confidence in their elected \nofficials and this institution. We should get the job done and pass the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill. I am very \npleased to see that today, Congress is putting aside its petty \ndivisions and rivalries to work together on a bill that will help \npeople. Today, when the Senate votes on the Health Insurance Reform \nAct, we show our support for a bipartisan effort that will address the \nhealth needs of millions of Americans and thousands of Montanans.\n\n\n                         Record of the Congress\n\n  That is a truly important step forward for this Congress, and not \nonly on health policy. At the beginning of 1995, a lot of Montanans had \nhigh hopes for this Congress.\n  But those hopes have vanished in the mess of bumbling revolutionary \nexperiments and government shutdowns which the leadership, particularly \nin the House has created.\n  Rather than make people a little more prosperous and secure, the \nCongress seems to have deliberately done just the opposite. It has gone \nfrom closing Yellowstone and Glacier, to a proposal to let Medicare \nwither on the vine, to bills that would set up a Commission on closing \nNational Parks and dump all the public lands on the States.\n  The fact is, the 104th Congress has let our state down pretty badly. \nAll too often, rather than do something good and positive for the \npeople, it has done something irrational and destructive.\n\n\n                            A Second Chance\n\n  But this health insurance reform is a second chance for the Congress. \nA sign that with some more maturity and experience, we can accomplish \nsomething good.\n  This bill, taken as a whole, means some more security and stability \nfor hard-working people.\n  It means that if you lose your job, you won't also face the loss of \nyour health insurance and the constant threat of lifelong debt in the \ncase of an accident.\n  It means that if you own a small business, you will have more ability \nto buy insurance for yourselves, your family and your employees.\n  And it means you can upgrade your skills and change your job without \nbeing denied insurance due to health troubles.\n\n\n                              Belinda Byrd\n\n  Look at the case of Belinda Byrd from Great Falls, Montana.\n  She wrote to me last year to explain her case and that of her sister. \nBelinda suffers from hydrocephalus, or ``water on the brain,'' and she \nis about to undergo her fourth brain surgery.\n  She is fortunate enough to receive coverage through the Government \nChampus program. But she wrote to me about the problem with pre-\nexisting conditions because of the problems her sister is having \ngetting health insurance. Belinda's sister has the same condition and \ncan not get affordable health insurance because of her health problem.\n\n\n                      Montana and Health Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, that is wrong. We should not tolerate it even in one \ncase. And the sad fact is that it is not just one case. Thousands of \nMontanans, and millions of Americans, have concerns just about as grave \nas those of the Byrd sisters.\n  As I have walked across the State in the past 2 years, a few subjects \ncome up everywhere. In towns, on ranches, at small businesses, and in \nroadside coffee shops. The need to raise the minimum wage. The low \ncattle prices. And the fear of losing health insurance.\n  For individuals, today's bill will make a big difference. It will let \nself-employed people deduct most of their health insurance costs. Big \nbusinesses can already do this. Folks who are self-employed and buy \ntheir own health insurance out of pocket should be able to deduct it \ntoo. That is basic fairness and decency. With this reform, we raise the \ndeduction from today's 30 percent of insurance costs to 80 percent. It \nis not all the way to 100 percent, but it is a very big step forward.\n  For farmers, ranchers, and small business owners, health insurance \nwill be available and more affordable. We may have to do more down the \nline, but we are making a good start here.\n  And for people like the Byrd sisters who have pre-existing health \nconditions, this means justice and security. No longer will having an \nillness, no matter how treatable it is, mean going without affordable \nhealth insurance.\n\n\n                        Medicare Fraud and Abuse\n\n  Finally, we take some initial steps to fight health care fraud and \nabuse, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. Today, anywhere from 5 \npercent to 10 percent of our Nation's entire trillion dollar health \ncare bill goes to fraud. We need to step up our Federal efforts to \nfight this problem and I support efforts to do so.\n  However, I would caution that the savings we get from fighting fraud \nand abuse in Medicare or Medicaid must go to guarantee solvency for \nthese essential programs. It should not pay for new tax breaks as last \nyear's Medicare cuts would have done, nor to pay for untested ideas \nlike Medical Savings Accounts.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I am very happy to be here supporting this bill. It is \na sign that Congress is getting the message. Moving away from \npartisanship and revolutionary experiments. And moving toward \npractical, effective steps that makes life better and more secure for \nMontanans and all Americans.\n  I appreciate the work of the Labor Committee Chair, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum and her counterpart, Senator Ted Kennedy. They have done this \ncountry a great service with their\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\nwork on crafting this bill and moving it through the legislative \nprocess. I hope it will get the Senate's support.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to lend my strong \nsupport to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill. At long \nlast, we are actually moving forward on the basic reforms that will \nmake health insurance once again serve the function of insuring and \nprotecting American families against devastating illness or injury.\n  The problem of health insurance is right at the center of the \neconomic insecurity gripping American families. The 40 million or so \npeople who have no insurance live in fear that a headache or stomach-\nache will turn out to be a costly illness. But other workers, who have \nhealth insurance, are hardly blessed with security and comfort. As the \nAmerican economy changes, they know that they can lose their jobs at \nany moment, with no certainty of being able to find new insurance, or \nif they do find new insurance, it might not cover the one medical \nconcern that is most likely to become a problem.\n  We have lost the idea of health insurance as real insurance, in which \nwe all pay premiums to spread our own risks over a lifetime, and to \nshare risks across a larger number of people. Instead, health insurance \nhas increasingly become a short-term privilege, that comes and goes \nwith the job, that only comes with certain kinds of jobs, and that \ncomes with exceptions and uncertainties. When you combine that with the \nincreasing insecurity about jobs, working families can't afford the \nrisk. People are trapped in jobs just to keep their insurance, rather \nthan moving on to find the job that would better use their skills, or \nsetting out as an entrepreneur, as many dream of doing.\n  This bill would restore the original concept of insurance to health \ncare. It would allow workers to change jobs without putting insurance \ncoverage at risk, to move from group to individual plans, and to buy \ninsurance despite a preexisting condition. It will help small \nbusinesses afford insurance, and help people who want to start their \nown businesses to do so without worrying about the arbitrary nature of \nhealth insurance. It will help only some of the 40 million without \ninsurance to become insured, but it will prevent that number from \ncontinuing to increase.\n  Mr. President, I hope that after this legislation becomes law, we \nwill not stop here but continue to closely watch the health insurance \nmarket and make whatever further changes need to be made to keep the \nfocus on health and security. The first such change, which I hope will \noccur by Mother's Day, and perhaps even before this bill gets through \nconference, is to end the practice of insurance companies forcing new \nmothers and their infants out of the hospital within a few hours, even \nagainst the best judgment of the mother's doctor. In general, I am \nconcerned that this bill, because it is so narrowly targeted at certain \ninsurance practices, could have unintended consequences. I hope that if \nrates do increase sharply, or if insurers cut back certain areas of \nbusiness, Congress should be willing to look at slightly broader \nsolutions that would address the health care crisis without unintended \nconsequences.\n  I am generally confident, however, that this legislation will serve \nthe purpose of protecting American families from the double risk of \neconomic and health insecurity. I hope action will be completed quickly \nso that the President can implement these reforms without delay.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Kennedy-\nKassebaum legislation on health insurance reform. This legislation, \nwhile not the comprehensive health care reform called for earlier, \ntakes an important and long overdue step in addressing the insecurity \nmany Americans feel about their health insurance.\n  Americans expect their insurance to be there when they need it. That \nis why we buy it. And yet many Americans find that, just when they need \ntheir health insurance, it is not there, or they are denied coverage, \nor they can't afford the policy premiums.\n  This bill provides a measure of health security in a number of ways.\n  No arbitrary, discriminatory terminations: This bill protects \nemployers from having their policy terminated if their employees incur \nlarge medical costs. Insurers could not impose preexisting condition \nlimitations for more than 12 months. This means that employees could \nchange jobs without fear of losing their insurance.\n  Guaranteed access: Under this bill, insurers are required to offer \ninsurance to all groups, regardless of the health status of any member \nof the group.\n  Nongroup coverage guaranteed: It protects people who leave their job \nfrom losing access to coverage. People who have had 18 months of prior \nemployer group coverage and have exhausted their extended coverage--\nthrough COBRA--would be guaranteed access to an individual policy.\n  Enlarging small groups: The bill creates incentives for small \nemployers to form cooperatives to strengthen their bargaining power \nwith insurance companies.\n  Need for the bill: The need for insurance reform is very real:\n  Over 41 million Americans have no insurance. That is a 4-million \nincrease since 1993;\n  In California, almost 23 percent of the population is uninsured--7.4 \nmillion people. And two-thirds of these uninsured people are under the \nage of 34;\n  Twenty-three million Americans lose their insurance every year;\n  Eighteen million people change insurance policies annually when \nsomeone in their family changes jobs;\n  Employer sponsored insurance is declining, going from 61 percent of \nemployed workers in 1986 to 54 percent in 1996;\n  In California, it's even worse with only about 50 percent of people \ncovered by employer sponsored insurance in 1994; and\n  With California's unemployment remaining above 7 percent for the last \n5 years--employer sponsored insurance is getting more scarce.\n  Preexisting conditions: The problem of people being denied insurance \nbecause of preexisting health conditions is one of the most serious \nconcerns people have today about their health care.\n  As a matter of fact, 81 million Americans have preexisting health \nconditions that could affect their health insurance;\n  Over 9 million Americans changed jobs in 1995; and\n  Millions more want to change jobs. The GAO estimates that as many as \n4 million employees are ``locked into'' their jobs because they fear \nthat the insurer for the next employer would refuse to insure them \nbecause of a preexisting health condition.\n  Take cancer as an example:\n  Over 1 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year. Over 10 \nmillion Americans alive today have a history of cancer.\n  About 184,300 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this \nyear--the most common form of cancer among women. And, 44,300 will die \nof breast cancer this year.\n  We probably all have some condition. And yet most policies sold to \nindividuals, and over half of all plans provided by employers, deny \ncoverage for some period of time for the conditions most likely to \nrequire insurance.\n  This bill addresses this serious problem by prohibiting insurers from \nimposing preexisting conditions for more than 12 months.\n  The Problem for Small Employers: Small employers acting alone often \nlack the leverage to negotiate good prices and benefits that large \nemployers can get. More than half of all uninsured employees work in \nsmall firms.\n  Administrative costs are higher for small groups. One survey shows \nthat health costs for large employers declined 1.9 percent in 1994, \nwhile small employers had an increase of 6.5 percent.\n\n  This bill creates incentives for small employers to form cooperatives \nto strengthen their bargaining power with insurance companies.\n  This approach can work. In 1993, California formed a health insurance \npurchasing cooperative for small businesses; 2,500 small businesses \njoined.\n  One year after formation, rates were 10 percent to 15 percent lower \nthan conventional insurance plans.\n  Individuals: Finally, there are 10 to 20 million individual Americans \nseeking to buy insurance on their own. These people, who are not part \nof a large pool where risk can be offset, often find themselves \nexcluded or unable to afford the premiums.\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\n  Genetic discrimination: I especially appreciate the agreement of \nSenators Kassebaum and Kennedy to include in the managers' amendment \nprovisions barring genetic discrimination by employer-based plans.\n  The language included in this bill is similar to S. 1600, a bill I \nintroduced with Senator Mack, to prohibit health insurers from denying \nhealth coverage based on genetic information of the insured or \napplicant for insurance\n  Last fall, as co-chairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator Mack \nand I held a hearing on the status and use of genetic tests. Witnesses \ntestified about the great promise of genetic testing in predicting and \nmanaging a range of diseases, but they also cautioned about the \npotential for discrimination.\n  In the past 5 years, there has been a virtual explosion of knowledge \nabout genes. Scientists are decoding the basic units of heredity.\n  We know that certain diseases have genetic links, including cancer, \nAlzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and Lou \nGehrig's disease. Altered genes play a part in heart disease, diabetes, \nand may other more common diseases.\n  These advances pose some potential problems. Witness after witness at \nour hearing discussed the potential and the reality of health insurance \ndiscrimination based on genetic information.\n  They recounted actual cases where insurers denied or refused to renew \ncoverage based on genetic information. This type of discrimination \ncould have a catastrophic impact if it is not addressed:\n  About 15 million people are affected by one or more of the over 4,000 \ncurrently identified genetic disorders; genetic disorders account for \none-fifth of all adult hospital occupancy, two-thirds of childhood \nhospital occupancy, one-third of pregnancy loss and one-third of mental \nretardation; and an even larger number of people are carriers of \ngenetic disease. The June, 1994 issue of Scientific American estimated \nthat every person has between 5 and 10 defective genes though they \noften are not manifested.\n  Insurance companies are poised to discriminate:\n  In a 1992 study, the Office of Technology Assessment found that 17 of \n29 insurers would not sell insurance to individuals when presymptomatic \ntesting revealed the likelihood of a serious, chronic future disease.\n  Fifteen of the thirty-seven commercial insurers that cover groups \nsaid that they would decline an applicant; and\n  Underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans said they would \nturn down an applicant if presymptomatic testing revealed the \nlikelihood of disease.\n  The study also found that insurers price plans higher--or even out of \nreach--based on genetic information.\n  Another study conducted by Dr. Paul Billings at the California \nPacific Medical Center, reached similar conclusions.\n  Here are a few examples of real-life cases:\n  An individual with hereditary hemochromatosis--excessive iron--who \nruns 10K races regularly, but who had no symptoms of the disease, could \nnot get insurance because of the disease.\n  An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed at 14 days of age with PKU--\nphenylketonuria--a rare inherited disease, which if left untreated, \nleads to retardation. Most States require testing for this disease at \nbirth. Her growth and development proceeded normally and she was \nhealthy. She was insured on her father's employment-based policy, but \nwhen he changed jobs, the insurer at the new job told him that his \ndaughter was considered to be a high risk patient and ``uninsurable.''\n  The mother of an elementary school student had her son tested for a \nlearning disability. The tests revealed that the son had Fragile X \nSyndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Her insurer dropped \nher son's coverage.\n  After searching unsuccessfully for a company that would be willing to \ninsure her son, the mother quit her job so she could impoverish herself \nand become eligible for Medicaid as insurance for her son.\n  Another man worked as a financial officer for a large national \ncompany. His son had a genetic condition which left him severely \ndisabled.\n  The father was tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the \ngene which caused his son's illness. His wife and other sons were \nhealthy.\n  His insurer initially disputed claims filed for the son's care, then \npaid them, but then refused to renew the employer's group coverage. The \ncompany then offered two plans. All employees except this father were \noffered a choice of the two. He was allowed only the managed care plan.\n  A woman was denied health insurance because her nephew had been \ndiagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and she was found to carry the gene \nthat causes the disease. The insurer told her that neither she nor any \nchildren she might have would be covered unless her husband was \ndetermined not to carry the CF gene.\n  These are real horror stories.\n  If people with genetic conditions or predispositions cannot buy \nhealth insurance on the private market, they usually have nowhere to \nturn. To qualify for Medicaid, the primary public health insurance \nprogram for the non-elderly, families have to ``spend down'' or \nimpoverish themselves.\n  Fear of discrimination can also have adverse health effects. If \npeople fear retaliation by their insurer, they may be less likely to \nprovide their physician with full information. They may be reluctant to \nbe tested. This means that physicians might not have all the \ninformation they need to make a solid diagnosis or decide a course of \ntreatment.\n  This bill can help make health insurance available to many who need \nit and who want to buy it. It can bring peace of mind to millions of \nAmericans. It can restore insurance to what insurance is supposed to \nbe.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in voting for this important \nbill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of The Health Insurance \nReform Act of 1995, and would like to thank the Chairwoman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, for bringing this \ncommon sense health care reform bill to the floor. Her knowledge and \nefforts in the area of health care have made progress on this issue \npossible, and her ability to craft consensus on this complex issue \ndeserves enormous praise from both sides of the aisle.\n  I would also like to compliment the ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, \nand the rest of my colleagues who serve on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee--the strong bipartisan vote that brought this bill \nout of Committee restores my hope that bipartisanship is not completely \nlost in this Chamber.\n  It has been interesting to me, having ``survived'' the health care \nwars of the last Congress, to read some of the things that have been \nwritten about this bill. Talk about role reversal--you now have some \nmembers on this side of the aisle complaining that S. 1028 does not go \nfar enough, and we have members on the other side of the aisle \ncomplaining that the bill isn't small enough. What a difference a year \nmakes!\n  But one thing that has not changed is the fact that the American \npeople continue to demand changes in the health care system. This bill, \nwhile not as large or as complex as the changes we considered in 1994, \nwould provide security to millions of Americans--25 million according \nto the General Accounting Office. It would reassure them that their \nhealth care coverage could not be taken from them if they changed jobs, \nif they became pregnant, if their family situation changed, or if they \nlost their jobs.\n  It does not solve all our Nation's health care problems--but we tried \nthe complicated, complex, approach with a more than 1,000 page bill in \n1994 and we got nowhere. So what is wrong with taking a step in the \nright direction? It doesn't mean that this is the only change that \nCongress can or should make.\n  It is said that every journey begins with a single step. So let us \nconsider the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill before us today as Congress' first \nstep on the road to overhauling our health care reform system so that \nall Americans will have access to affordable, quality health care by \nthe provider of their choice that can never be taken away.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 will achieve part of that \nshared goal by ensuring access to health care that can not be taken \naway. It will ensure that workers who are offered a\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nnew job opportunity with a different company will be able to accept \nit--instead of turning it down because they are afraid that a pre-\nexisting condition will prevent them from obtaining health care \ncoverage at their new firm.\n  It will ensure that workers who lose their job and have had insurance \ncoverage for the last 18 months will be able to obtain an individual \npolicy. They will still have a lot to worry about--but at least they \nwill know that they can obtain insurance for their family.\n  And it will ensure that small businesses will no longer find \nthemselves dropped from the insurance roles because one of their \nworkers has medical problems.\n  Every Senator--every Member of Congress--has received letters or \nspoken with individuals who have been denied coverage or had their \ncoverage--or their firm's coverage--dropped because of a preexisting \ncondition. Yet these are the people who need the coverage most. It is \nestimated that 81 million Americans suffer from a preexisting medical \ncondition that endangers their access to health care coverage. This \nbill will provide them that protection.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill restricts health insurance exclusions on \npreexisting conditions by prohibiting insurers and employers from \nlimiting or denying coverage under group plans for more than 12 months \nfor a medical condition that was diagnosed or treated during the \nprevious 6 months. For example, if an individual had been covered under \nanother employer's plan for 8 months, they would only have to work for \n4 months in their new job before being covered.\n  The bill also prevents group health plans from excluding any employee \nfrom coverage based on health status and requires insurers to renew \ncoverage for both groups and individuals as long as the premiums were \npaid.\n  Once an individual had been covered for 12 months, no new pre-\nexisting condition could ever be imposed, even if they changed jobs or \ninsurance plans.\n  The bill also will help make health care coverage more affordable for \nAmerica's small businesses by lifting barriers to the formation of \nprivate, voluntary coalitions to purchase health insurance. For states \nlike Maine, where small businesses are the backbone of our economy, \nthis provision will be particularly helpful. Banding together to obtain \nhealth insurance coverage will give our small businesses the ability to \nspread the risk among a larger population and to use their negotiation \npower to get quality coverage at the best price. This bill will give \nemployers and employees the ability to obtain quality coverage at a \ncompetitive price.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 is a commonsense approach to \na serious problem in this country--access to affordable, quality health \ncare that can never be taken away. It is not the complete answer to our \nhealth care problems, but it is a big step in the right direction and \nwill help millions of Americans retain their health care coverage.\n  I would like to address one of the arguments being made against this \nbill. Opponents of reform have argued that while the bill ensures \naccess, the practical problem will be that the cost of premiums will \nsoar, making coverage unaffordable for many. The American Academy of \nActuaries, however, has estimated that any premium increases would be \nquite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent. In fact, this potential \nincrease is lower than the increases we have seen in recent years: over \nthe last 10 years the average rate paid for individual insurance \npremiums has increased between 8 and 15 percent annually.\n  And in my own State of Maine, which has had a law on the books \nguaranteeing issue for employers with fewer than 25 employees since \n1992 and guaranteed issue for individuals since 1993, these changes \nhave not resulted in premium increases that are outside the bounds of \nthe normal increases in the cost of health care coverage.\n  By passing this bill we will be renewing our commitment to the \nAmerican public that we have heard and have understood their demand \nthat we act on health care reform. It will provide security for \nmillions of Americans who currently fear losing their health care \ncoverage, and will provide access to more affordable coverage for our \nsmall businesses as they band together to enhance their purchasing \npower. Passage of this bill will leave us with a long road ahead of us \nto address the outstanding issues of health care reform, but at least \nwe will finally be on the road.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for S. \n1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act.\n  Over the past several years, access to health care has been one of \nthe most important issues facing Americans. Far too many Americans--\nover 40 million this year--are uninsured, and an equal number are \naffected each year by preexisting condition exclusions and the job lock \nthat results when workers fear that they will lose all or part of their \ninsurance if they change jobs.\n  Two year ago, I and many of my colleagues spent countless hours \ntrying to find a compromise health care reform bill that would ensure \naccess to health insurance and health care, maintain choice and quality \nfor consumers, and control the skyrocketing growth in health care \ncosts. Given the importance of this effort to millions of Americans, I \nwas disappointed that our effort to find a moderate solution to these \nissues was blocked.\n  The bill before us today takes a modest step in the right direction. \nIt attacks the most egregious barriers to health insurance: the use of \npreexisting condition exclusions to deny coverage to those who most \nneed health insurance, and the lack of portability when workers change \njobs. Addressing these issues will guarantee access to health insurance \nfor an estimated 25 million Americans who would otherwise be subject to \nthese barriers.\n  However, it is important to remember that, although this is an \nextremely important step, it is only a first step. It guarantees access \nto health insurance, but it does not guarantee that the available \ninsurance will be affordable. And, as a representative of a rural \nState, I wish this bill improved access to health care services in \nmedically underserved areas. Thus, when we complete the first step by \nenacting this bill, our health insurance reform journey will not be \ncomplete. There is lots of room for further progress in making health \ncare available and affordable.\n  Mr. President, with that caveat, let me explain why this bill is so \nimportant. Today, millions of Americans are denied insurance because \nthey or someone in their family have so-called preexisting conditions. \nThis means the family of a child born with a heart murmur can't find \ninsurance because no insurance company wants to take the risk of \ncovering the costs of treating this heart condition. And it means that \nsomeone who has paid insurance premiums through an employer-sponsored \nplan but then leaves that job because she needs a major medical \nprocedure--for example, an organ transplant--may not be able to get \ninsurance when she tries to return to the workplace. That's just wrong. \nNo one should be forced to stay in a job she hates because she fears \nshe will lose her health insurance if she tries to change jobs. And no \none who has paid insurance premiums faithfully for years should lose \nhis insurance because he becomes sick and an insurance company refuses \nto renew his employer's policy.\n  This bill fixes these problems. It strictly limits preexisting \ncondition exclusions when a person or a family applies for health \ninsurance for the first time. It prohibits any preexisting condition \nexclusions for people who have faithfully paid their insurance premiums \nfor at least 18 months and then need to get new insurance because they \nchange jobs or lose their jobs. This means that people who change jobs \ncan rest assured that their new insurance policy will fully cover them.\n  The bill also requires insurance companies to provide coverage to any \nemployer with two or more employees. This keeps insurance companies \nfrom denying insurance to certain types of business just because the \ncompany thinks the employees are likely to get sick. It prevents the \ncancellation of coverage for a company just because one of its \nemployees has gotten sick and incurred large medical costs. And it \nallows small businesses and other groups to band together in voluntary \ncooperatives to bargain as a larger\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\ngroup for lower premiums and better coverage.\n  Finally, the bill requires individual insurance companies to provide \ncoverage to individuals who lose their job or become self-employed and \nexhaust their conversion coverage under COBRA. Coming from a State with \nlarge numbers of self-employed farmers and other small business men and \nwomen, I am keenly aware of the fragility of the individual insurance \nmarket. Average premiums in this market are much higher than in the \ngroup insurance markets because of adverse selection.\n  Although critics of this so-called group-to-individual portability \nprovision greatly exaggerate its likely effect on this market, their \narguments are not groundless. This provision will result in more sick \npeople entering the individual market. In order to prevent this from \ngreatly increasing premiums for those who are already in this market, I \nhope States will proceed very carefully in applying rating restrictions \nthat could inadvertently worsen the adverse selection inherent in this \nmarket. I am encouraged that the bill gives States great flexibility in \ndesigning their own approaches to meet the goals of this legislation. \nThis allows them to develop innovative solutions tailored to the \nspecial needs of their population while ensuring that workers still \nhave access to affordable health insurance without unreasonable \npreexisting condition exclusions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation takes a major step forward in \nreforming the private insurance market. It removes the biggest barriers \nto health insurance and will enable Americans to change jobs freely \nwithout fear of losing all or part of their insurance coverage. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject the controversial special-interest provisions \nadded in the House that threaten to kill this important effort, and to \ninstead pass a bill that commands broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to support the \nhealth insurance reform bill, offered by Senators Kassebaum and \nKennedy. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Reforming our Nation's health care system has been a concern for many \nAmericans. I believe the bill before us today, although limited to the \nhealth insurance industry, is a significant step toward addressing some \nof the issues we face with health insurance--cost, portability, and \npreexisting conditions. Although this legislation will not fix all of \nour health care problems, I think we all need to recognize that it does \nmake some progress toward addressing these issues.\n  Currently, reports indicate there are an estimated 40 million \nuninsured Americans. This, in and of itself, highlights one of the \nbiggest problems within the health care industry--the availability of \naffordable, flexible insurance policies.\n  All too often, people are forced into a situation where they feel \nthey must remain in a job they would rather leave just because they \nhave long-term health care needs and have no other source for insurance \nother than through their employer. This ``job lock,'' coupled with \nskyrocketing health care costs, makes the prospect of paying for your \nown medical costs without insurance, a frightening, and financially \ncrippling situation. People simply can't afford to take this risk.\n  Over the past few years, my home State of Colorado has taken a very \nprogressive approach in dealing with the issues of health insurance \nportability and preexisting conditions and has worked cooperatively \nwith the health insurance industry to develop what everyone seems to \nrecognize as a positive step forward. I have often had constituents \ntell me how surprised they are to learn how little other States have \ndone in the area of health insurance reform. The Colorado State \nlegislature was instrumental in making this law, and in conjunction \nwith employers, have forged a partnership that seeks to cover as many \nColoradans as possible in the most cost-effective manner. In fact, many \nof the safeguards and reforms already instituted within the State of \nColorado are very similar to the Kassebaum, Kennedy bill. Currently, \nthere are roughly 20 States that don't have this kind of insurance \nprotection, and I believe that through this bill, we can cooperatively \nwork to mirror at the Federal level some of the provisions the State of \nColorado already enjoys.\n  I feel this bill will establish a much-needed standard for the health \ninsurance industry and will work toward achieving the goal that all \nAmericans have access to more cost-effective and affordable insurance. \nI don't believe anyone can deny the need for this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 1028, The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995. While S. 1028 is not \nthe comprehensive reform of our health system which would be necessary \nto guarantee quality health care for all Americans, it does make \nimportant strides in reducing the barriers to coverage for over 25 \nmillion people in this Nation.\n  The legislation before us today, S. 1028, would attempt to make \nmodest incremental reforms in the health insurance market by addressing \nonly those provisions upon which there is broad bipartisan agreement. \nIn fact, the President and over 65 of my Senate colleagues are in \nagreement, supporting this legislation which would have an immediate \nimpact on the lives of over 25 million people.\n  For these Americans who are unable to change jobs, who cannot leave \ntheir jobs to start a new business, or who lose their jobs, S. 1028 \nwould provide an assurance of continued access to health insurance \ncoverage. It would end the incidence of job lock in this country by \nlimiting the ability of health insurers to deny coverage for people \nwith preexisting medical conditions. Once an initial exclusion period \nof no longer than 12 months was exhausted no preexisting condition \nexclusion could ever be applied to a policy holder again. It would also \nguarantee that a group or individual who purchased an insurance policy \nand faithfully paid their premiums, could never have their coverage \ntaken away from them or canceled.\n  Mr. President, the health care debate is one that goes to the heart \nof the quality of life of all Americans. Access to quality health care \nis a fundamental human need and is in my view a fundamental right in a \ndemocratic society. Our challenge is to achieve a situation in which \nevery American has access to affordable, quality health care. While \nthere is much more that I would like to do to ensure that each and \nevery American is guaranteed the same high quality comprehensive care, \nthe bill before us today makes important steps toward accomplishing \nthis goal and improving the lives of over 25 million Americans and I \nurge its immediate passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I think we have partial agreement here so \nwe can move ahead. I want to associate myself with most of the remarks, \nprobably all of the remarks made by my colleague from Texas. We do not \nwant to have to refight that battle again. I think he raised some \nexcellent points. I hope in part they have been addressed in the so-\ncalled Dole-Roth amendment, that I think does improve this bill \nsubstantially.\n  But I ask unanimous consent that during the consideration of S. 1028, \nthe health insurance reform bill, and following opening statements and \nadoption of the managers' amendment as original text, the majority \nleader or his designee be recognized to offer his amendment concerning \ntax provisions and medical savings accounts.\n  I further ask that during the pendency of the Dole amendment, Senator \nKassebaum be authorized to move to strike the medical savings account \nprovision, there be 2 hours equally divided in the usual form on the \nmotion to strike, and that no amendments be in order to the Dole \namendment or the language proposed be stricken prior to the vote on or \nin relation to the motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Reserving the right to object, I would just like to \nask the majority leader, when we first discussed this we had 2 hours \nequally divided. So much time elapsed since then, I suggest that we \nwould like to have the vote no later than 3:45, and time then be \nequally divided until that time because we have already eaten up\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\nso much. It had been my hope we could get through to some other \namendments as well, since we had some considerable time, and still \nwill, on discussing the provisions of the Finance Committee package. If \nthat would be agreeable?\n  Mr. DOLE. Obviously, I would have no objection to that. I will modify \nthe request to say the vote occur not later than 3:45 p.m., and that \nany time between the time we start the debate on that motion and 3:45 \np.m. be equally divided.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, reserving right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the Senator from Washington would like a \nclarification. I have just presented a small technical amendment to the \nDole amendment to the chairman of the Finance Committee. I want that \namendment to be in order.\n  If the understanding is that second-degree amendments would be in \norder if the Dole amendment is not tabled or rejected, then I will have \nno objection. I just want to make certain that before the Dole \namendment is adopted that it is itself subject to amendment. Is that \ncorrect? Under the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. DOLE. That will be--let me just proceed with the request.\n  Mr. GORTON. I just want clarification my amendment will be in order \nsome time before the adoption of the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is it an amendment to the Dole amendment or a separate \namendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. An amendment to the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the way it is going to work, it would be in order. \nBecause I would hope to have, if the motion to strike fails, we would \nthen get on the Dole amendment. But I could not get that agreement, so \nthe answer would be yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think this could be accommodated \neasily. I have been waiting just to make a 3-minute statement on the \noverall bill. I greatly would appreciate having that opportunity before \nwe get into the debate on the medical savings account.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to accommodate the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The vote will occur then. Also following that vote the \nSenator from North Dakota would like 15 minutes in a general statement. \nPrior to discussion, then, the Senator from California would have 3 \nminutes.\n  I also ask, if the Kassebaum motion to strike is agreed to, then the \nDole amendment be immediately modified to reflect that chapters 2 and 3 \nof subtitle (f) of title IV be withdrawn.\n  Let me explain what that is.\n  In other words, they were ``pay-fors,'' and if the MSA's were \nstricken we will take those ``pay-fors'' out of the bill. I think it \nhas been cleared by both Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will send the amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Roth, and others.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                           Amendment No. 3675\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, first I send to the desk a \nsubstitute amendment and ask it be considered original text for purpose \nof further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] for herself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3675.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the amendment is agreed \nto and is considered as original text.\n  The amendment (No. 3675) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3676 to Amendment No. 3675\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve health \n  and long-term care coverage in the group and individual markets by \n    making health and long-term care insurance more accessible and \n                              affordable)\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Now I ask my amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for himself, Mr. Roth, \n     Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Lott, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Faircloth, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3676 to amendment No. 3675.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will explain, as will the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Roth, explain in some detail what \nthis amendment does. It is a very important amendment. It is about a \n$10 billion amendment. It is paid for. And it does help make health \ncare more available and more affordable. That is the thrust of this \nbill and that is why, even though we certainly want to accommodate \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, as far as amendments are \nconcerned, we think this amendment does improve the bill and it does \nprovide a great deal of opportunity for many Americans who are now \ndenied health care. Let me tell you why.\n  I am committed to passing this bill and the amendment is designed to \nhelp make that happen.\n  For many years self-employed individuals have been uncertain as to \nwhether they could deduct their health insurance premiums. And the \nDemocrat-controlled Congress refused to make the deduction permanent to \nensure that it would apply year after year.\n  Last year, one of the first things Republicans did when we took \ncontrol of the House and Senate was to make this deduction permanent, \nand to increase it to 30 percent.\n  But we said then and we say now that 30 percent is not enough. The \namendment I now offer would raise the deduction for the self-employed \nto 80 percent by phasing in increases over the next 10 years.\n  This will provide equity and much needed tax relief to farmers, small \nbusiness men and women, and other self-employed Americans.\n  My attempts to raise the deduction for the self-employed are not new. \nAn amendment I offered last year passed the Senate with strong \nbipartisan support, but that did not stop the President from vetoing \nit, just as he vetoed our $500 per child tax credit.\n  My amendment will also provide important tax relief regarding long-\nterm care expenses. The Internal Revenue Service has not seen the \nwisdom to allow taxpayers a deduction for long-term care expenses or \npremiums paid on long-term care policies.\n  So this amendment is needed to force the IRS to recognize that \nexpenses to care for those unable to care for themselves are legitimate \nmedical expenses that should be deductible.\n  It is in the best interest of the country to provide appropriate \nincentives for families to give proper long-term care for family \nmembers or to plan for future expenses, such as by purchasing long-term \ncare insurance. Families want to care for their own and the IRS should \nnot stand in the way.\n  This provision is particularly important for Americans who are likely \nto face these expenses in the near future for their parents and \ngrandparents. Expenses to provide long-term care of a disabled or \nelderly relative could bankrupt a family. We cannot and will not let \nthat happen. And neither should my Democratic friends, although they \nhave voted against this relief in the past and the President has \nalready vetoed this tax relief once before.\n  I have also included medical savings accounts in this amendment. You \nmay have heard a lot about MSA's already. But let me tell you about \nthem. First of all, they are hardly a radical new concept. They are \nbeing used today in 13 States and have enjoyed bipartisan support for \nmany years.\n  MSA's provide individuals with choice and flexibility. If an \nindividual\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nchooses to accept an MSA, the individual can tailor his or her own \nhealth care to his or her own needs. Individuals would have their own \npersonal savings accounts dedicated to health care spending--similar to \nthe way they have IRA's for their retirement savings.\n\n  Under the MSA proposal in this amendment, individuals could purchase \na high-deductible plan and then use the money they accumulated in their \nsavings account, up to the deductible limit, for health care expenses. \nThey could deduct the amount they contribute to the MSA and the savings \nwould accumulate tax free.\n  Who could argue against providing additional options and flexibility? \nThe answer is the same people who thought that the best way to reform \nthe health care system was to hand it over to the Federal Government--\nto impose more mandates and Government controls. The American people \nare thankful that the Democrat efforts to turn the health care system \nover to the Government failed, and they hope that Democrats will fail \nin their effort to block this amendment.\n  Let us remember that the Joint Tax Committee recently analyzed this \nMSA proposal and concluded that 88 percent of the MSA tax benefits \nwould go to those making under $100,000 a year, with 78 percent of the \nbenefits going to those making under $75,000 a year.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in \nsupport of substantial tax relief for Americans.\n  Madam President, health insurance reform is, by no means, a newly \ndebated issue in this Chamber. In fact, it predates many individuals in \nthis town. The concern about the availability and affordability of \nhealth insurance goes back as early as the Nixon administration when \nPresident Nixon declared that the American health care system was in \nneed of repair, particularly when it came to affordability.\n  Madam President, that was 25 years ago. Since then, there have been \ndozens of health care bills debated in this Chamber--the Bentsen bill, \nthe Dole-Packwood bill, and others, all of which were drafted with the \nsole purpose of making health care more available and more affordable.\n  To this date, Madam President, none has been signed into law.\n  We now have before us a bipartisan bill that contains the kinds of \ncommonsense insurance reforms that this Senator and many of my \nRepublican colleagues have long advocated. I commend my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum, for her hard work and determination to craft \na health insurance reform bill that could be supported by the vast \nmajority--if not all Members--on both sides of the aisle.\n  Madam President, as I stand here, I have to say that I feel a great \nsense of relief--as I am sure many Americans will feel--that common \nsense has finally prevailed.\n  For nearly a decade now Republicans have been trying to pass an \nincremental health insurance bill that would solve many of the problems \nwith the availability and affordability of insurance.\n  During the Bush administration, however, the Democrat-controlled \nCongress refused to give President Bush's proposal the time of day.\n  And then came the Clinton administration, and President Clinton's \ninsistence that turning the American health care system over to the \nFederal Government was the only solution. It was a solution chock full \nof mandates, Government intrusion, and untold costs. And the American \npublic took one good look at it and said, ``No thanks.''\n  From almost the very first day of the Clinton administration through \nthe entire long national debate over the President's plan, I said the \nsame thing day after day after day. And what I said was this: Fix what \nneeds fixing, makes changes in the insurance market so that more \nAmericans are able to obtain and afford health care, and leave the many \nvery good parts of American health care alone.\n  Here we are, however, 2 years later, and still talking about \ninsurance reforms that are still badly in need. And the tragedy of \nthat, Mr. President, is that there are millions of Americans who could \nhave been helped these past 2 years, had President Clinton not insisted \non his plan or nothing.\n  Madam President, our first priority is to start with portability. \nThis will assure that no American is denied coverage because he or she \nchanges or loses a job. I am committed to passing that change because \nit will help millions of job-locked Americans with preexisting medical \nconditions and their families.\n  As I have said, eliminating job lock should have passed at least 2 \nyears ago. Regrettably it did not.\n  Before we get much further into this debate, I want to underscore at \nthe outset that it is very important that we pass a bill, once and for \nall, that can be signed into law. There is no hidden agenda--no \nsurprises--no smoke and mirrors. This is serious work that we have \npromised to the American public for a very long time.\n  I also want to take a moment now, that I will elaborate on later, to \ndescribe an amendment Senator Roth and I plan to offer to this bill. In \nthat amendment there will be a number of tax provisions that will \nenhance the insurance reforms in this bill.\n  Again, I want to underscore, this amendment is not meant to defeat \nthis bill or diminish its chances of being signed by the President. To \nthe contrary, my amendment will strengthen this bill and help more \npeople obtain affordable health insurance--all without the overdose of \nGovernment control the American people already rejected.\n  My amendment will include an increase in the deduction of health \ninsurance premiums paid by the self-employed and provides deductions \nfor long-term care expenses so that families have real incentives to \nplan for their later years. It also provides for tax-exempt high-risk \npools, and allows for tax-free accelerated death benefits. In addition, \nthis amendment makes medical savings accounts available to all \nAmericans.\n  Medical savings accounts are not a new concept and have enjoyed \nbipartisan support. My view is that medical savings accounts are \nanother choice for Americans. They may not be right for everyone. They \nmay appeal to many others. They are included in this amendment as \nanother option. Choice, after all, is one of the greatest virtues of \nAmerican health care.\n  These are all provisions to help make insurance more affordable \nthereby increasing the number of people who are insured.\n  Madam President, this Congress has worked very hard to keep the \npromises we made to the American people when they gave us a majority. \nThis bill represents relatively noncontroversial needed change--change \nwe have promised for a long time. We owe it to the millions of \nAmericans who need our help to do today what we should have done \nseveral years ago.\n  Passage of this bill will not only improve our health care system, it \ncould very well restore the faith of the American public that the work \nfor the Congress is not just a series of political stalemates. Even in \nan election year, we can work on a bipartisan basis to pass legislation \nthat will improve the lives of so many Americans.\n  Let me indicate that the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nCohen, will discuss his part of this amendment, proposals to clamp down \non health care fraud and abuse. Senator Cohen has been working on it \nfor a number of years, and they save about $3 billion. They are a very \nimportant part of this overall amendment.\n  I will just say, as I said earlier, this is a very important piece of \nlegislation. It is a bill that should be passed. It is a bill that can \nbe signed into law. There is no hidden agenda, no surprises, no smoke, \nand no mirrors. This is a serious work product that we have promised to \nthe American people for a long time. It seems to me we can get this \ndone yet today. The House has passed a different version. We will go to \nconference. In my view, we can come up with a very reasonable proposal \nthat I think President Clinton will sign.\n  We have offered what we believe will be an amendment to strengthen \nthis bill. I happen to believe the medical savings account is another \naddition that will strengthen this bill. I know there is some objection \nto it. But all this is done without an overdose of Government control \nwhich the American people rejected just a few years ago.\n  For all the reasons I can think of, I urge the adoption of this \namendment without anything being stricken from\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\nit. I hope at 3:45 the motion to strike will be defeated, and then we \ncan determine if we can vote on the Dole-Roth amendment or should there \nbe other amendments. Maybe the Senator from Washington has other \namendments or maybe other people. We can then dispose of those \namendments.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you tell me when my 3 minutes are \nup? That is all I really need.\n  I believe we can have a rational debate about this bill. The Senator \nfrom Texas said it is hard to be rational when you debate health care, \nbut I think Senator Kassebaum is a very rational woman, and I think \nSenator Kennedy is a very rational Senator. I think the two of them \nhave come together. They have brought us a bill that I am very proud to \nsupport.\n  In 1993, I authored a bill that would make it unlawful to cancel or \nreduce an employee's benefits because the employee suffered from a \nparticular disease or illness, and it made it unlawful for employers to \nimpose different benefit caps for different diseases.\n  What happened, as we all know, is we got off track with health care \nreform. It was derailed, and it took us some time to mend some frayed \nfeelings, and now we are back here in a bipartisan effort. We are on \nthe brink of a bipartisan success to bring some fairness to this world \nof health insurance coverage.\n  Clearly, millions and millions of Americans are going to be better \noff as a result of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, because we know we will \nhave portability now of health care coverage. Many Americans who are \nlocked in jobs because they fear losing their insurance--and I know so \nmany myself who are in that situation--will no longer be fearful of \nthat.\n  We think that will impact 25 million Americans. This bill will \nprohibit group health plans from excluding any employee based on their \nhealth status. We know that we do not want to encourage people just \nbuying insurance when they get sick, so we require a 12-month waiting \nperiod, and then they cannot be denied for a preexisting condition. We \nthink 81 million Americans, Madam President, have conditions that could \nsubject them to such exclusions, so we are talking about more than 100 \nmillion Americans benefiting from this, as well as small businesses.\n  I strongly urge us to support the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. I think if \nwe can support Senator Kassebaum's amendment to the Dole amendment, it \nwould be far better off, because the medical savings accounts are good \nfor some of the wealthiest and healthiest in our Nation but would be \ndamaging to the vast majority of Americans.\n  So I look forward to voting for this bill. I think it will be a \nbright moment for this U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, the purpose of the leadership amendment to \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill is to help \nindividuals and employers purchase affordable health and long-term care \ninsurance, and it will particularly help small business men and women \ngo a long way toward combating fraud and abuse in the Medicare system.\n  Affordability of health and long-term care insurance has long been a \nmajor problem in our country, and the leadership amendment provides \nconcrete solutions. By eliminating many of the financial barriers to \naffordable health and long-term care insurance, Americans will take \ngreater responsibility for their health and long-term care needs, \nrelying less on the Federal Government.\n  The leadership amendment provides affordable health and long-term \ncare insurance and personal responsibility by increasing the health \ninsurance deduction for self-employed individuals to 80 percent. On \naverage, employers pay about 80 percent of their employees health \ninsurance costs. But under current law, employers can exclude this \nbenefit tax.\n  In comparison, Madam President, under current law, self-employed \nindividuals can only deduct 30 percent of their health insurance. \nRaising the health insurance deduction for self-employed individuals \nwill eliminate this inequity and will be a good first step toward \nputting self-employed individuals on a par with workers who receive \nhealth insurance from their employer.\n  But this is not all this amendment provides. It provides tax \nclarification for long-term care insurance. Under this amendment, long-\nterm care insurance that meets certain consumer standards will receive \nthe same favorable tax treatment as medical insurance. The consumer \nstandards require insurance companies to disclose information to \nconsumers that will aid them in buying a long-term care policy that \nbest fits their individual needs.\n  Long-term care insurance tax clarification will provide the much \nneeded incentive for Americans to buy this insurance. All too often \nindividuals without long-term care insurance end up depleting their \nlife savings for their care and end up on Medicaid. Long-term care \ninsurance will give Americans with long-term care needs the dignity of \nproviding their own care and at the same time reducing the burden on \nMedicaid.\n  Additionally, Madam President, this amendment allows tax-free \nbenefits from the early termination of life insurance. It permits \nterminally and chronically ill individuals to take tax-free withdrawals \nfrom their life insurance. Many terminally and chronically ill \nindividuals end up depleting their life savings for their care and end \nup on Medicaid. This provision will provide an additional source of \nfunds for the terminally and chronically ill to attend to their health \ncare needs and at the same time will reduce the burden on Medicaid for \ntheir care.\n  This amendment also includes tax-favored medical savings accounts. \nOur medical savings account proposal permits an individual with a high-\ndeductible health plan to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA. \nContributions to the medical savings account are limited to $2,000 for \nsingle coverage and $4,000 for family coverage. Distribution from the \nmedical savings account can be used for medical expenses without being \ntaxed.\n  Excess funds in a medical savings account can be carried over to the \nnext year, would be available to pay for unexpectedly high health \ncosts, long-term care insurance, or to continue health insurance during \nperiods of unemployment, often called COBRA coverage. Madam President, \namong the great freedoms that Americans cherish is the ability to make \nchoices and decisions about how to take care of their families. Medical \nsavings accounts will place control of America's health care back in \nthe family. It does so in significant ways that create the right \nincentives for health care.\n  With the medical savings accounts, Americans will be able to choose \ntheir physician, their hospital, and their health care plan. Not only \nwill Americans be allowed to go to the doctor of their choice, but to \nthe optometrist, the dentist, or the chiropractor of their choice as \nwell. Traditional low-deductible health insurance may not cover visits \nto the dentist or optometrist, but the medical savings accounts will.\n  In addition, Madam President, many traditional low-deductible health \ninsurance plans do not pay for preventive care. For working poor \nAmericans, this feature of medical health savings accounts will be \nespecially helpful. That is because Americans with medical savings \naccounts will have the money to pay for preventive care for their \nfamilies, whereas they may not have the money in the absence of a \nmedical savings account.\n\n  Beyond offering patients a choice, medical savings accounts will \nlower health care spending by empowering people to become knowledgeable \nabout health care costs. As a result, medical savings account users \nbecome more effective consumers of health care and reject unnecessary \nor duplicative treatment. Unused medical savings account funds will \naccumulate from year to year, providing an incentive for people to \nremain healthy and consume medical care wisely.\n  In addition, Madam President, medical savings accounts will also \nrestore the physician-patient relationship, something that has eroded \nover time. Patients are finding their choice of health care providers \nbeing limited and bureaucracies are interfering with their doctor-\npatient relationships.\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\n With medical savings accounts, a patient can go to any doctor, nurse, \nor other health care provider of their choice without worrying about \nwhether their insurance will cover the bill.\n  Madam President, we already know about the success of medical savings \naccounts because hundreds of companies, including the United Mine \nWorkers, are experimenting with them with great success. Companies that \noffer medical savings accounts have experienced significant reductions \nin health care spending by their employees. Most of these companies \nfind that medical savings accounts are attractive to workers in both \nlow- and high-income categories and workers in all health conditions. \nIn fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation anticipates that about 78 \npercent of medical savings account users will have an annual income of \nless than $75,000.\n  Madam President, the problem with current medical savings accounts is \nthat employees are treated worse under the tax laws by selecting a \nmedical savings account and high-deductible health plan. At the end of \neach year the employee must include the full amount of the money \ndeposited in his or her medical savings account as income. That is a \ngrossly unfair result when employees with traditional low-deductible \ninsurance do not pay tax on their employer provided insurance.\n  Furthermore, medical savings accounts advance an important goal of \nSenator Kassebaum's health insurance reform bill, and that is health \ninsurance portability. Health insurance portability is something \nAmericans have been requesting for years. The lack of health insurance \nportability is a problem with the current health insurance market and \nresults in job lock for millions of Americans. Medical savings accounts \nwill help end job lock for millions of American workers because they \nwill be able to take their medical savings account with them when they \nchange jobs. This would promote continuity of insurance coverage.\n\n  Another feature of a medical savings account is that it will allow a \nlower cost insurance alternative to millions of self-employed \nAmericans. American farmers and small businesses will be able to buy \nhigh-deductible health insurance and fund a medical savings account to \nprovide for their family's health care needs. This feature has the \npotential of removing millions of people from the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  Madam President, it is interesting to note that 13 States and at \nleast one city have passed medical savings account legislation and \ndozens more are moving to pass similar legislation. For example, Jersey \nCity, NJ, has implemented medical savings accounts as an alternative \nfor their city employees. Ohio is implementing a test program for State \nemployees. Clearly, medical savings accounts offer Americans a choice \nabout their health care that should be fundamental in a country built \non free-market principles. It is the Federal Government that must now \nmove ahead with the idea.\n  Madam President, strong efforts have been made to defeat medical \nsavings account legislation by those who have a vested interest in the \ncurrent health care system that is not working for millions of \nAmericans. The real winners under medical savings accounts will be the \nhundreds of thousands of Americans who will grab control over their \nfamily's health care spending.\n  I hope the encouragement from hundreds of companies with successful \nmedical savings account programs and the many States that are \npioneering in medical savings accounts will serve as strong incentives \nfor my fellow colleagues to join me in supporting the medical savings \naccount provisions and the leadership amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have an editorial in the \nWall Street Journal by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman \nentitled ``A Way Out of Soviet-Style Health Care'' printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 1996]\n\n                 A Way Out of Soviet-Style Health Care\n\n                          (By Milton Friedman)\n\n       In a chapter in his novel ``The Cancer Ward'' titled ``The \n     Old Doctor,'' Alexander Solzhenitsyn compares ``private \n     medical practice'' with ``universal, free, public health \n     service'' through the words of an elderly physician whose \n     practice predated 1918. A byproduct is an eloquent statement \n     of the major advantages of medical savings accounts for the \n     U.S. in 1996.\n       Mr. Solzhenitsyn himself had no personal experience on \n     which to base his account and yet, in what I have long \n     regarded as a striking example of creative imagination, his \n     character presents an accurate and moving vision. The essence \n     of that vision is the consensual relation between the patient \n     and the physician. The patient was free to choose his \n     physician, and the physician free to accept or reject the \n     patient.\n       In Mr. Solzhenitsyn's words, ``among all these persecutions \n     [of the old doctor] the most persistent and stringent had \n     been directed against the fact that Doctor Oreschenkov clung \n     stubbornly to his right to conduct a private medical \n     practice, although this was forbidden.''\n\n\n                         Easier to Find a Wife\n\n       In the words of Dr. Oreschenkov in conversation with \n     Lyudmila Afanasyevna, a longtime patient and herself a \n     physician in the cancer ward: ``In general, the family doctor \n     is the most comforting figure in our lives. But he has been \n     cut down and foreshortened. * * * Sometimes it's easier to \n     find a wife than to find a doctor nowadays who is prepared to \n     give you as much time as you need and understands you \n     completely, all of you.''\n       Lyudmila Afanasyevna: ``All right, but how many of these \n     family doctors would be needed? They just can't be fitted \n     into our system of universal, free, public health services.''\n       Dr. Oreschenkov: ``Universal and public--yes, they could. \n     Free, no.''\n       Lyudmila Afanasyevna: ``But the fact that it is free is our \n     greatest achievement.''\n       Dr. Oreschenkov: ``Is it such a great achievement? What do \n     you mean by `free'? The doctors don't work without pay. It's \n     just that the patient doesn't pay them, they're paid out of \n     the public budget. The public budget comes from these same \n     patients. Treatment isn't free, it's just depersonalized. If \n     the cost of it were left with the patient, he'd turn the ten \n     rubles over and over in his hands. But when he really needed \n     help he'd come to the doctor five times over. * * *\n       ``Is it better the way it is now? You'd pay anything for \n     careful and sympathetic attention from the doctor, but \n     everywhere there's a schedule, a quota the doctors have to \n     meet; next! * * * And what do patients come for? For a \n     certificate to be absent from work, for sick leave, for \n     certification for invalids' pensions; and the doctor's job is \n     to catch the frauds. Doctor and patient as enemies--is that \n     medicine?''\n       ``Depersonalized,'' ``doctor and patient as enemies''--\n     those are the key phrases in the growing body of complaints \n     about health maintenance organizations and other forms of \n     managed care. In many managed care situations, the patient no \n     longer regards the physician who serves him as ``his'' or \n     ``her'' physician responsible primarily to the patient; and \n     the physician no longer regards himself as primarily \n     responsible to the patient. His first responsibility is to \n     the managed care entity that hires him. He is not engaged in \n     the kind of private medical practice that Dr. Oreschenkov \n     valued so highly.\n       For the first 30 years of my life, until World War II, that \n     kind of practice was the norm. Individuals were responsible \n     for their own medical care. They could pay for it out-of-\n     pocket or they could buy insurance. ``Sliding scale'' fees \n     plus professional ethics assured that the poor got care. On \n     entry to a hospital, the first question was ``What's wrong?'' \n     not ``What is your insurance?'' It may be that some firms \n     provided health care as a benefit to their workers, but if so \n     it was the exception not the rule.\n       The first major change in those arrangements was a \n     byproduct of wage and price controls during World War II. \n     Employers, pressed to find more workers under wartime boom \n     conditions but forbidden to offer higher money wages, started \n     adding benefits in kind to the money wage. Employer-provided \n     medical care proved particularly popular. As something new, \n     it was not covered by existing tax regulations, so employers \n     treated it as exempt from withholding tax.\n       It took a few years before the Internal Revenue Service got \n     around to issuing regulations requiring the cost of employer-\n     provided medical care to be included in taxable wages. \n     That aroused a howl of protest from employees who had come \n     to take tax exemption for granted, and Congress responded \n     by exempting employer-provided medical care from both the \n     personal and the corporate income tax.\n       Because private expenditures on health care are not exempt \n     from income tax, almost all employees now receive health care \n     coverage from their employers, leading to problems of \n     portability, third party payment and rising costs that have \n     become increasingly serious. Of course, the cost of medical \n     care comes out of wages, but out of before-tax rather than \n     after-tax wages, so that the employee receives what he or she \n     regards as a higher real wage for the same cost to the \n     employer.\n       A second major change was the enactment of Medicare and \n     Medicaid in 1965. These added another large slice of the \n     population to those for whom medical care, though not \n     completely ``free,'' thanks to deductibles and co-payments, \n     was mostly paid by a third party, providing little incentive \n     to economize on medical care. The resulting dramatic rise in \n     expenditures on medical care\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\n     led to the imposition of controls on both patients and \n     suppliers of medical care in a futile attempt to hold down \n     costs, further undermining the kind of private practice that \n     Dr. Oreschenkov ``cherished most in his work.''\n       The best way to restore freedom of choice to both patient \n     and physician and to control costs would be to eliminate the \n     tax exemption of employer-provided medical care. However, \n     that is clearly not feasible politically. The best \n     alternative available is to extend the tax exemption to all \n     expenditures on medical care, whether made by the patient \n     directly or by employers, to establish a level playing field, \n     in terms of the currently popular cliche.\n       Many individuals would then find it attractive to negotiate \n     with their employer for a higher cash wage in place of \n     employer-financed medical care. With part or all of the \n     higher cash wage, they could purchase an insurance policy \n     with a very high deductible, i.e., a policy for medical \n     catastrophes, which would be decidedly cheaper than the low-\n     deductible policy their employer had been providing to them, \n     and deposit all or part of the difference in a special \n     ``medical savings account'' that could be drawn on only for \n     medical purposes. Any amounts unused in a particular year \n     could be allowed to accumulate without being subject to tax, \n     or could be withdrawn with a tax penalty or for special \n     purposes, as with current Individual Retirement Accounts--in \n     effect, a medical IRA. Many employers would find it \n     attractive to offer such an arrangement to their employees as \n     an option.\n       Some enterprises already have managed to do so despite the \n     tax penalty involved. MSAs have proved very popular with \n     employees at all levels of income, and they've been cost-\n     effective for employers. The employee has a strong incentive \n     to economize, but also complete freedom to choose a \n     physician, and the equivalent of first-dollar coverage. There \n     are no out-of-pocket costs until the employee spends more \n     than the total amount in the MSA. Such costs are then limited \n     to the difference between the amount in the account and the \n     deductible in the catastrophic policy. Moreover, the employee \n     can use money in the MSA at his or her discretion for dental \n     or vision care that is typically not covered under most \n     health plans. No need to get ``authorization'' from a \n     gatekeeper or an insurance company to visit a specialist or \n     to have a medical procedure--until the catastrophic policy \n     takes over.\n\n\n                          limiting competition\n\n       The managed care industry has come to recognize that MSAs \n     might threaten its growing control of American medicine by \n     offering a more attractive alternative. As a result, the \n     managed care industry has recently become a vigorous enemy of \n     MSAs. Every believer in competition will recognize that \n     opposition for what it is: a special interest using \n     government to limit rather than expand competition.\n       Medical savings accounts are not a panacea. Many problems \n     would remain for an industry that now absorbs about a seventh \n     of the national product. However, I believe that they offer \n     the closest approximation that is currently feasible to the \n     private medical practice that Dr. Oreschenkov cherished.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, in his editorial, Dr. Friedman recognizes \nmedical savings accounts can be an important factor in restoring the \nfreedom of choice for both the patient and physician and to control \nhealth care costs.\n  These important provisions in the leadership amendment are not all \nthat we are offering. Our amendment also permits penalty-free \nwithdrawals from IRA's for health and long-term care insurance. The \nleadership amendment encourages people to purchase health insurance by \nallowing penalty-free withdrawals from IRA accounts to buy health and \nlong-term care insurance and to pay for major medical expenses.\n  This provision will allow unemployed workers the ability to access \ntheir IRA funds to continue their health insurance for their families.\n  The leadership amendment provides tax exemptions to State-sponsored, \nhigh-risk insurance pools, a provision that will encourage States to \nset up insurance pools from which high health risk individuals can \npurchase affordable insurance.\n  Madam President, the leadership amendment also contains new tools for \nlaw enforcement to aggressively attack fraud and abuse in health care. \nGAO estimates that as much as 10 percent of health spending in the \nUnited States is lost to fraud and abuse. Law enforcement officials \nbelieve that most health care fraud goes undetected.\n  The leadership amendment makes substantial new funds available to the \nJustice Department, the FBI and the IG of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services for investigation and prosecution of health care fraud. \nThese provisions also create for the first time a criminal statute for \nhealth care crimes, tough new penalties for fraud in Federal health \nprograms, including Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Madam President, these health care fraud and abuse provisions were \ncrafted by Senator Cohen over the past 3 years. I commend him and his \nstaff on their tireless and important work. Madam President, the \nleadership amendment is actually paid for. The offsets are, first, \nlarge corporations will no longer be permitted to borrow corporate-\nowned life insurance and deduct the interest. The provision is a major \ncorporate tax loophole that will be closed. The same proposal was \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and is similar to the \nadministration's proposal in its fiscal year 1997 budget.\n  Second, expatriates, those persons who leave the United States for \ntax avoidance purposes, will be subject to taxation upon exit from the \nUnited States. The proposal is similar to the expatriation provision in \nthe Senate version of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Third, starting in 1996, thrift institutions will calculate their tax \ndeduction for bad debts the same way as banks. This provision will \nfacilitate future legislation to harmonize the bank and thrift \ncharters, and has widespread support. A similar proposal was included \nin the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 as well as an administration revenue \nproposal in the fiscal year 1997 budget.\n  Fourth, a measure to combat fraud and the earned-income credit \nprogram. This proposal is identical to the earned-income credit \ncompliance provisions in the House health care bill.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there are many other popular tax \nproposals championed by other Members that would likely find their way \ninto this bill. However, this is a health insurance reform bill. The \nfocus of this and other amendments should be on expanding the \naffordability of health and long-term care insurance for Americans. To \nstray from the purpose of this amendment may doom the entire health \ninsurance reform effort. I suggest that no Senator wants to do that.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, the Congressional Budget Office reported \nthat health care spending, rather than cost, is the major problem in \nU.S. health care. The report states that ``a major reason for high and \nrapidly rising health cost is the failure of the normal discipline of \nthe marketplace to limit the quantity of services supplied.''\n  Today, nearly 80 percent of medical expenses are paid by somebody \nother than the patients themselves.\n  Out-of-pocket expenditures have declined from 60 percent of the \nNation's total health bill in 1960 to 20 percent today. Since that \ntime, the Government's share has doubled to 46 percent.\n  This means that most health care expenditures in the United States \ntoday are paid for by someone other than the consumer of health care--\nby the Government or by insurance carriers. Unlike any other purchase, \nwhen Americans receive medical care, they use someone else's money.\n  Our health care system has effectively insulated Americans from the \ncost of care. There is little incentive to spend wisely. There is no \nneed to look for the best buy for the health care dollar.\n  Six years ago, I introduced the first MSA legislation in the Senate. \nMy plan provides a financial incentive for Americans to choose a \nhealthy lifestyle and to be better consumers of health care. Under my \nplan, employers provide an umbrella catastrophic policy and invest the \nrest of the money in a tax free account for each employee. I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor of the Finance Committee amendment which builds on \nthese same principles.\n  For example, the average employer spends $4,500 on health benefits \nfor an employee. Under the typical MSA, an employer would buy a \ncatastrophic policy--with a $3,000 deductible--at an average cost of \n$1,500. The remaining $3,000 would be given to the employee to cover \nout-of-pocket medical expenses. Whatever is unused would be given to \nthe employee. We would provide a financial incentive both to stay \nhealthy and to shop for bargains in the system.\n  I was discussing this idea with some constituents in Indianapolis. \nOne woman told me she knew exactly what I was driving at. She called \nher local hospital to inquire how much a mammogram would cost. When \ntold $300,\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nshe asked if they ever offered any sales. Sure enough, Mother's Day \nweek, the screenings cost only $50. However, because her insurance \ncovered the cost, she had no incentive to purchase the care at the \nreduced price.\n  This sounds complicated, but the effect would be simple. People would \nbe allowed to choose their own doctors, make their own health care \ndecisions, have a financial incentive to live a healthier life, and \ncontrol medical costs through increased competition.\n  Medical savings accounts are working. People with these plans are \nlooking for and finding bargains. And they are getting more \npreventative care from their doctors.\n  Listen to a letter from one woman in Indiana:\n\n       When the MSA account became an option at my company, I \n     decided to try it with my family. For the last half of [the \n     first year], our family will be receiving a refund for our \n     unused portion. With five on our policy, this was a nice \n     surprise.\n  ``I was told I would be needing surgery performed in the near future. \nI have already made arrangements to pay our [catastrophic] deductible \nin full * * * the total surgeon's charge was $9,843. However, they have \nagreed to take off $3,797. With this account I have realized there is \nno set doctor's charge.''\n  This Indiana woman has become a wise consumer of health care \nservices. She bargained and saved nearly $4,000 in surgery costs. She \nscrutinizes her bills and makes sure that she is getting what she pays \nfor.\n  Another Hoosier had this to say:\n  ``The MSA plan has helped me become a more frugal shopper of health \ncare for myself and my family. I now ask the doctor for generic \nprescriptions when available, and try to utilize our family doctors \nwhen available, instead of the more expensive immediate care centers.''\n  Another Indiana resident was surprised to learn that the price of \ntreatment does vary depending on the status of her insurance. Treatment \nto an ear damaged in an auto accident was $900 through insurance, but \nonly $200 since she paid out-of-pocket.\n  A resident of Indianapolis writes, ``I am a single parent who \nreceives no outside support. Therefore, it is very important for me to \nhave insurance coverage for my 12-year-old daughter and I. I made the \ndecision to try the medical savings account because although vision and \ndental expenses were not covered under the traditional plan, I would be \nable to use the MSA money for these expenses * * * both my daughter and \nI wear glasses. Both our prescriptions had changed this past year, \ntherefore I incurred the cost of the exams along with the cost of new \nglasses.\n  ``I did have necessary medical expenses last year that used all but \n$37 of my MSA fund. While I may have received less than others who had \nMSA's last year, I gained a great deal more than those who had the \ntraditional plan. I had no out-of-pocket expenses and still had $37 \ncome back to me. There was nothing to lose, and everything to gain.''\n  In addition to empowering people, medical savings accounts help \ncontrol the costs of providing coverage for many companies.\n  In Indiana, 81 percent of employees at Golden Rule Insurance elected \nthe medical savings account option the first year it was offered. These \nworkers got $468,000 in reimbursements from their MSA's. Not \nsurprisingly, the next year, 90 percent of the employees selected the \nMSA option. Golden Rule benefited as well--the company saw no increase \nin health care costs for 2 straight years, with $734,000 refunded to \nemployees, an average of $1,000 per employee.\n  Dominion Resources has encouraged workers to opt for a high \ndeductible plan and to place the monthly premium savings into a health \naccount. Some 80 percent of Dominion's employees have selected this \nplan and the company has seen no increases in premiums since 1989.\n  Knox Semiconductor in Rockport, ME, has experienced only one rate \nincrease in the last 4 years under its Health-Wealth Program. Its \npresident, John Marley, claims that the program saved his company more \nthan $100,000 in 3 years--a significant savings for a small business.\n  These savings are particularly impressive given the cost increases \nexperienced by companies in conventional plans. The Clinton-Mitchell \nbill, for instance, claims it will achieve its major savings through \nencouraging HMO styled delivery of services. But even HMO costs are \nrising--13.6 percent a year between 1988 and 1992. In 1993, they jumped \nanother 6.5 percent.\n  MSA's could potentially achieve savings in another significant way. \nNot only would they unleash the collective bargaining power of the \nAmerican consumer, but they could significantly reduce the \nadministrative burden on our health care system. Less than 15 percent \nof all Americans spend $3,000 a year on medical care, and therefore the \naccumulated cost of paperwork processing are for small claims. By \npaying these bills directly, our health care system would realize \nsignificant savings in paperwork reduction and substantially reduce the \n$90 billion in administrative costs we spent each year.\n  Forbes magazine has experimented with this concept. In order to cut \ndown small claims, they give each employee an annual account of $1,200. \nFor every dollar filed in medical claims, the employee loses $2 from \nthe account. Employees can keep what is left in the account at the end \nof the year. This system obviously encourages employees to pay for \nsmall claims out-of-pocket. After the system was implemented, the \npaperwork on routine claims fell dramatically. The company's health \ncosts fell by 17 percent in 1992 and by 12 percent the following year.\n  We are paying a high price for our social and behavioral attitudes, \nour personal lifestyle choices. The United States pays $52 billion each \nyear on illnesses related to smoking. Unhealthy eating habits \ncontribute directly to 5 of the 10 leading causes of death in the \nNation. Two out of three deaths in the United States can be linked to \ntobacco use, alcohol use and abuse, controllable high blood pressure, \novereating, traumatic injury, and lack of preventative care.\n  One man in Indiana commented, ``the plan has also given me a better \noutlook on staying healthy. It provides financial incentive for not \nover utilizing health care, but at the same time provides a way to \ncover the more routine expenses which one would incur at regular \nintervals. Getting a regular check up could help prevent more costly \nhealth care bills. Its nice to have an outlet to pay for expenses when \nyou really should go to the doctor instead of waiting to the last \nminute because our deductible is not satisfied.''\n  The MSA is the only health reform plan that provides incentives to \nremain healthy. Indeed, the Kennedy bill entitles those at high risk of \nsexually transmitted disease more health care than it does to others \nnot considered at risk. The Kennedy bill requires all Americans to pay \nfor smoking cessation classes regardless of whether or not you smoke. \nSo smokers get more care than nonsmokers under the Kennedy bill. Under \nthe MSA, non-smokers, who likely will remain healthier than smokers, \nreap the rewards of their behavior.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently editorialized, ``Most of the health \nbills before Congress remind us of Henry Ford's philosophy behind the \nModel-T car: ``You can have any color you want as long as its black.'' \n[but] health care reform that includes medical savings accounts would \nrepresent real consumer sovereignty; patient self-interest would be \nharnessed to keep costs down, and workers would build up tax-free \nhealth care funds for when they were between jobs. Health care security \nwould be enhanced, but not at the cost of quality or freedom of \nchoice.''\n  This Congress faces a fundamental choice. We can use the lessons of \nour experience--Americans empowered choose wisely--competition in the \nfree market enhances quality and drives down costs--principles which \nguide reform through medical savings accounts. Medical savings accounts \nleave health care choices where they belong--in the hands of \nindividuals. I urge my colleagues to support real reform--and to retain \nmedical savings accounts.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3677 to Amendment No. 3676\n\n             (Purpose: To strike medical savings accounts)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3677 to amendment No. 3676.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike subtitle C of title IV.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nstrike the portion of the package put forward by Senator Dole and \nSenator Roth regarding medical savings accounts. It is difficult for me \nto stand and do so because I think the rest of the provisions in the \npackage that have been put forward are ones that are generally agreed \nto on both sides of the aisle. Senator Dole has been a long-time leader \nof efforts to increase the deductibility for those who are self-\nemployed. It is a very positive amendment. It will be a very positive \npart of this bill.\n  Also, Senator Dole has been a long-time leader in wanting to address \nlong-term care and to be able to provide some means of helping those \nwho have high costs for family and long-term care. This will provide \ntax credits to do so.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, has also been a \nlong-time proponent of such measures. I think the way in which the \nmeasure is crafted is a very constructive addition to the legislation \nbefore the Senate.\n  When the ranking member of the Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, and \nmyself completed the work of the committee in a unanimous vote last \nAugust, we agreed that we would not support any additional amendments \nthat were highly contentious. This included ones that individually we \nwould support, as well as those that we would oppose. Cumulatively, \nthey could cause a real collapse if they carried too much baggage, plus \nor minus. Therefore, we have agreed, whether we individually supported \nthose amendments or not, to not support any amendments which were going \nto prove to be controversial.\n  I would like to speak for a moment about medical savings accounts and \nmy own concerns regarding them. As has been pointed out, 13 States have \nnow in place such savings accounts and I think that is going to be \nuseful to analyze the effect of medical savings accounts. The \nproponents say it will bring down health care costs by encouraging \nconsumers to shop more wisely for health care, that they will increase \ncoverage by making health care that is affordable for individuals, and \nthey will reduce health care spending for employers.\n  Nevertheless, we are not really certain, and I still believe that we \nneed to carefully consider what medical savings accounts are about. I \nthink it is not a question of either/or. Medical savings accounts \nshould be considered and we should debate the merits of medical savings \naccounts. I strongly question whether they should be attached to this \nparticular bill as they do not really enhance the provisions of this \nbill that we are debating today.\n  I do believe that medical savings accounts are of benefit, \nparticularly to the healthiest and most financially secure Americans. \nThey do not really address those with preexisting conditions, nor those \nwith catastrophic illnesses at the time, nor those without a job or \nincome who need coverage the most.\n  I think the medical savings accounts could provide a false sense of \nsecurity because it does offer choices to individuals. It lends \nencouragement to invest wisely. It lends to a shelter in the Tax Code \nwhich would allow one to build up support that could be used at times \nthat are important. However, it is a false sense of security, Madam \nPresident, I believe.\n  They are sold as giving Americans freedom to exercise choice and that \npeople will be protected when they get catastrophic illnesses. However, \nas our colleague, Senator Jeffords knows, most so-called catastrophic \npolicies have very low lifetime limits. He will be offering an \namendment, as a matter of fact, to address that concern. So, people are \nnot protected for truly catastrophic illnesses. Medical savings \naccounts are an experiment, not without merit. From the States that are \nalready experimenting with the accounts and have passed legislation, we \nwill be able to gather data which will be useful to us.\n  I suggest that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ohio has shown that MSA's \nwould increase, not decrease, employer costs because there would be \nless money in the pool to cover above average costs of high-risk \nindividuals. There needs to be the ability to have a risk pool, to have \nreinsurance, so that those costs can be spread, of which all of us \nwould have to pay. That is not going necessarily to lead to escalating \npremiums so much as spreading the costs across the board.\n  Blue Cross and Blue Shield has observed that there is a concern that \nMSA's will segment the market into people who are very healthy and \npeople who are not healthy. If that happens, you lose the ability to \nspread the risk pool. Senator Breaux spoke to that earlier this \nmorning. So for all those reasons, Madam President, I have some serious \nreservations. Senator Cohen from Maine, as Senator Roth pointed out, \nhas legislation regarding fraud and abuse that helps provide savings, \nwhich has been incorporated in this amendment. I think that is a \npositive part of the package put forward by Senator Dole and Senator \nRoth.\n  But as long as medical savings accounts have such a high degree of \nuncertainty, I think it is a package that should be viewed with some \nskepticism as we regard this particular proposal before us, which has \nuniversal support and will continue to have if we give some care to the \namendments that are added to it.\n  I have the highest regard for the efforts of the majority leader, as \nhe has put forward what I believe are positive additions to our bill. \nIt is my hope that those additions can be accepted and that medical \nsavings accounts, with my motion to strike, will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time does the Senator from \nConnecticut need?\n  Mr. DODD. Seven minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, 2 years ago the 203d Congress spent a \ngreat deal of time discussing the merits of comprehensive health care \nreform.\n  The Committee on Labor and Human Resources held more than 40 hearings \ndebating the issue.\n  And in the end those opponents of comprehensive reform, who said we \nneeded to go slow, won the day.\n  I, for one, thank that was a mistake.\n  But, at the same time, I understand the apprehension of my colleagues \nabout comprehensive reform.\n  Well today, the legislation before us today--the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nHealth Insurance Reform Act--gives us the opportunity to pass sensible, \nincremental and common-sense health reform measures that will help \nmillions of Americans.\n  This bill may not solve every problem in our health care system. But, \nit is good public policy.\n  And it will make a real difference in the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  And if we, as a body, believe that American workers should not live \nin fear of losing their health care when they change their job, then we \nmust pass these sensible reforms.\n  In fact, recollecting our debates from 2 years ago, it's hard to \nimagine that this bill would not pass on a unanimous vote.\n  Not once in our many committee meetings did any member argue for the \npreservation of exclusions based on preexisting conditions.\n  Not once did anybody argue against insurance portability. Even while \nwe were debating health care reform on the Senate floor, not once did \nanybody raise objection to the sort of market reforms that are included \nin this bill.\n\n\n                        the health care problem\n\n  And, I think we all recognize the huge scope of the problem.\n  Almost 40 million Americans have no health care insurance.\n  Approximately 12 million of those uninsured are children under the \nage of 21.\n  In my State of Connecticut, 300,000 people were uninsured in 1993.\n  That is 12.1 percent of the population, up from 9.7 percent in 1992. \nThat's a 25 percent increase.\n  In fact according to a recent poll, 22 percent of Connecticut \nResidents who needed health care did not go to a doctor or receive \nhealth care services because it was either too expensive or simply \ninaccessible.\n  These are unacceptable statistics, and they make clear the need for \nreform.\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\n                                job lock\n\n  And, throughout Connecticut and the Nation as a whole, millions of \nothers live in fear that if they change their job, they will lose their \nhealth care as well.\n  Various surveys have found that as many as 30 percent of Americans \nreport that either they or a family member suffer from job lock.\n  Too many Americans are being forced to stay at a job because they \nsimply can not afford to lose their health care coverage.\n  But if this legislation passes, the provisions in this bill would \nrelieve as many as 3 to 4 million Americans from the burden of job \nlock.\n\n\n                 kassebaum-kennedy is a good first step\n\n  While I think that even my colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator \nKassebaum would agree that this bill will not solve every problem with \nAmerica's health care system, it is a crucial step in the right \ndirection.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy would limit exclusions for pre-existing \nconditions.\n  It would allow small businesses to form purchasing alliances, which \nwould be a difference for the 30 percent of employees at firms with 10 \nor less workers who do not have health insurance.\n  And most important it would guarantee to every American worker that \nif you change your job, you will not lose your health insurance.\n  The GAO estimates that 25 million Americans would be helped by this \nlegislation.\n  These are common sense reforms and I believe that is one of the main \nreasons this bill is receiving huge bipartisan support.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill not only has more than 60 cosponsors, of \nwhich I am one, but it also passed our committee unanimously.\n\n\n                               clean bill\n\n  With this clear level of bipartisan support it is hard for me to \nunderstand why many of my colleagues are insisting on offering \namendments to this bill, that they know will make it impossible for it \nto pass.\n  Unfortunately, over the past few years it has become increasingly \ndifficult for this body to reach compromise on any issue.\n  I think all my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, bemoan this \nlack of bipartisan agreement.\n  And today we have a bill with over 60 cosponsors, with wide \nbipartisan support and with endorsement from much of the health \ninsurance industry and yet several of my colleagues stubbornly insist \nthat we allow amendments to be tacked on to this bill.\n  In particular, the insistence of some of my colleagues to add medical \nsavings accounts, or MSA's, to this bill threatens the enactment of any \nhealth reform measure this year.\n  We all have provisions we would like to see included in this \nlegislation. I, for one, would like to see greater health care coverage \nfor our Nation's children.\n  But, this is not the time to be focusing on our individual projects, \nparticularly at the expense of genuine reforms that we can all agree \nupon.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to help 25 million Americans with the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill and applying MSA's or any other provision to \nthis bill will only undermine that effort.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill truly represents common sense, effective \nreform.\n  These are reforms that will spare millions of Americans the pain and \nsuffering of losing their health care or being denied coverage because \nof pre-existing conditions.\n  Today, we have a historic opportunity to make a real difference in \nthe lives of millions of Americans.\n  As I do not need to remind most of you, cynicism toward Congress runs \nrampant in this Nation.\n  Too often the American people look to Washington and they shake their \nhead at the partisan political games we play.\n  In the last two elections they have demanded that we start working \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, and pass legislation that makes a \nreal difference in their lives.\n  And I believe that if we polled the American people and asked them: \nShould Congress remove preexisting conditions in the health insurance \nindustry?\n  Should Congress make health insurance more portable?\n  Should Congress guarantee that if you lose your job you do not lose \nyour health insurance?\n  I think, the vast majority of the American people would respond with \na resounding yes.\n  So today, let us uphold our responsibility to the American people and \npass these sensible and commonsense reform measures.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter dated today from Cecil E. Roberts, international \nPresident of the United Mine Workers of America.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               United Mine Workers of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 1996.\n     Senator Bob Dole,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: In recent days, certain special interest \n     groups have wrongly portrayed members of the United Mine \n     Workers of America as recipients of Medical Savings Account \n     akin to those that would become more widely available under \n     an amendment you are slated to offer to S. 1028.\n       The UMWA has been grossly misrepresented by these groups \n     who have wrongly counted us as supporters in their effort to \n     weaken the health care system through Medical Savings \n     Accounts.\n       In recent collective bargaining agreements, we have \n     negotiated a comprehensive health care plan for our members. \n     Our members also receive a bonus and are responsible for pay \n     equivalent deductibles under their medical plan. This plan is \n     not an MSA.\n       Representing more than 200,000 working and retired coal \n     miners and their dependents, the Mine Workers know that MSAs \n     are not a panacea for the health care crisis. It would be \n     unthinkable to leave such a group of people, many of whom \n     suffer from injuries or disease brought on from working in \n     the mines, dependent on MSAs for their health care coverage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cecil E. Roberts,\n                                          International President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commend our two colleagues. It has been \na long ordeal, dealing with this very important piece of legislation. \nThey deserve our universal acclaim for their efforts. It was a very \ngood process in our committee. As the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, pointed out, this particular proposal was \nunanimously voted out of committee. To the credit of all of our members \non the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, we all have ideas \nthat we would have liked to have incorporated in this legislation. But \nthe agreement was that we would try and limit the bill to those areas \nwhere there was consensus, so that we could deal with the problems that \n25 million Americans face today. With the passage of this legislation, \nand a Presidential signature, we would solve the problems immediately \nfor 25 million Americans. It would immediately solve the problems they \nface with portability and preexisting conditions--not to mention some \nof the proposals in the leadership amendment, which the Senator from \nKansas pointed out we all agree with and go back many years supporting.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity here. It has been almost since last \nAugust that this bill came out of committee. We are almost in May now, \nand the weeks are rolling by. Here is a chance to do something for 25 \nmillion Americans, without getting into a real disagreement and \nargument over a controversial proposal--the medical savings accounts.\n  Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes on that \nparticular subject matter. I will leave the remarks I have inserted in \nthe Record that go to the general provisions in the bill, which have \nbeen discussed today at some length. I compliment my colleague from \nKansas and my colleague from Massachusetts for doing a remarkably fine \njob in putting those provisions together.\n  I have inserted the letter from the United Mine Workers because there \nhas been some discussion here on the floor that this was one \norganization that has a medical savings account. Without reading the \nentire letter, let me read paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the letter:\n\n       The UMWA has been grossly misrepresented by these groups \n     who have wrongly counted us as supporters in their effort to \n     waken the health care system through Medical Savings \n     Accounts.\n       In recent collective bargaining agreements, we have \n     negotiated a comprehensive health care plan for our members. \n     Our members also receive a bonus and are responsible for \n     paying equivalent deductibles under their medical plan. This \n     plan is not an MSA.\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\n       Representing more than 200,000 working and retired coal \n     miners and their dependents, the Mine Workers know that MSAs \n     are not a panacea for the health care crisis. It would be \n     unthinkable to leave such a group of people, many of whom \n     suffer from injuries or disease brought on from working in \n     the mines, dependent on MSAs for their health care coverage.\n\n  I think that is important, since their names have been used as an \nexample of an organization with an MSA, and by implicit suggestion that \nthey are supporters of MSA's. I voted twice for medical savings \naccounts, back when we considered the larger health care package. I am \nproud of those votes. I have no inherent objection to the idea of a \nmedical savings account. But they need to be, as the Senator from \nKansas suggested, in the context of a larger discussion of health care.\n  Whether you agreed or disagreed with the large health care proposal \nof a year or so ago, in that context, medical savings accounts make \nsense. In the absence of it, you are running the risk of leaving people \naside who cannot afford to get into these programs.\n  It is very controversial, too. As many have pointed out, the major \ninsurance groups and consumer groups, which rarely agree on these \nmatters, all agree on this point--that this could create some real \nproblems. They all agree that this would segment and undermine the \ninsurance market. They would divide the health care system and cater to \nthe healthier and wealthier people at the expense of those with \nfinancial constraints, leaving those in traditional plans to pay a \nhigher price tag on health care costs, as their risk pool shrinks and \nas the percentage of individuals with serious health conditions \nincreases.\n  They point out that according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, it \nwould cost taxpayers about $1.8 billion.\n  Again, I am not talking about one group versus another. The insurance \nindustry, consumer groups, the Blues, are not saying that they are \ntotally opposed to this, but that in this context, it does not make a \ngreat deal of sense.\n  I also point out there have been some studies done on the medical \nsavings accounts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, medical \nsavings accounts could threaten the existence of standard health \ninsurance, placing a far greater burden on lower-income patients, \nindividuals with chronic ailments, and patients with disabilities, who \nhave larger out-of-pocket expenses. The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ohio, \nas the Senator from Kansas pointed out, says, ``MSA's would bankrupt \nour current system of financing health care and significantly add to \nthe cost of medical care.'' That is their language, not mine.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries said, ``Less healthy individuals \nwill likely pay more for their coverage, since the most healthy and \nhighest persons in the group are likely to select MSA programs.'' That \nis not the Senator from Connecticut, or the Senator from Massachusetts, \nor the Senator from Kansas. That is the American Academy of Actuaries \nspeaking.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity to deal with something we all agree \non, in a bipartisan way. The current bill is bipartisan, as we have \nsome 60 cosponsors. Why take on an MSA issue that is highly \ncontroversial with major private sector groups and consumer groups that \nare saying, ``Please do not do this''? This is not the right suggestion \nat this hour. It jeopardizes what we could do for 25 million Americans, \nby eliminating the problem of portability and preexisting conditions, \nissues that we all agree on.\n  I do not know of anybody who stood up and suggested that we ought not \nto make those changes. We have the chance to do that in a bipartisan \nway. If you add the MSA's, given all the arguments raised by the \nprivate sector, consumer groups, and others, including the American \nAcademy of Actuaries, and the Blues, who have looked at this issue \ncarefully, then you do great damage and jeopardize what we can \naccomplish this afternoon by passing a good bill and showing the \nAmerican public we care about their concerns and we are determined to \nsee to it that they are addressed.\n  I strongly urge the adoption of the Kassebaum amendment to strike the \nMSA provisions, adopt the other provisions, and then adopt this overall \npiece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator has 24\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes of our time.\n  Mr. President, our distinguished colleague and friend, Senator \nKassebaum, has outlined, I think very effectively, the reasons why we \nshould reject the part of Senator Dole's proposal that deals with \nmedical savings accounts. Senator Kassebaum has outlined the principal \nissues which are at stake--both the cost and the health implications of \nMSAs, and I am in total agreement. My friend and colleague from \nConnecticut has expanded on those thoughts in a very effective way.\n  I think many of the provisions that the majority leader has \nintroduced are useful and, by and large, helpful. He brings focus on \nthe need for long-term health care for the American people. If there is \na part of our Social Security system that has been really left out over \nthe period of the recent years, it has been the failure to deal \neffectively with long-term care for our parents, for neighbors, for \nfriends, for communities, and for the American people. We are blessed \nand fortunate to have people living longer lives and more productive \nlives. That is an increasing phenomenon. The fragile elderly \nincreasingly are an important concern before us. To be able to attend \nto their particular needs in a thoughtful way either through long-term \ncare, through nursing homes, or through home care is immensely \nimportant. The idea that we have long-term care insurance included in \nthis legislation, I think, is commendable.\n  The leader as well has identified additional areas--providing the \ndeduction for the self-employed; the small businesses around this \ncountry, in rural towns and in cities as well, have a particular \ndisadvantage in terms of the cost of health care for their employees. \nAnd certainly there is a strong justification for that provision.\n  I believe the provisions which apply as well in terms of terminal \nillnesses, to help those that have terminal illness, to give them at \nleast some assistance in terms of the tax system, again, to give them \nsome tax relief, is a commendable system.\n  So I hope at the time we have an opportunity to address those \nparticular issues that we will find broad bipartisan support throughout \nthe Senate on those measures. There may be a feature or two that we \nmight discuss, but I commend the leader for bringing attention to that \nand for adding that particular measure.\n  Mr. President, I agree that those issues have been debated and \ndiscussed. There is broad understanding of them and broad support for \nthem, and we are certainly justified in accepting those. But the issue \nin terms of the medical savings account is another matter entirely.\n  For the reasons that have been outlined, the overall Kassebaum/\nKennedy legislation has broad support. Senator Kassebaum and I are in \nagreement that we will resist amendments that do not have the \noverwhelming support of the Members. There are many different \nprovisions that I would like to see which I think have been tried and \ntested and for which there is a very important need.\n  My good friend from Vermont has talked about lifting the lifetime \nlimits in terms of health insurance because many of those that have \nserious disabilities run up against the top limits in their health \ninsurance. I would like to support that measure. Senator Jeffords spoke \npassionately about it, and he believes in it, and I look forward to \nworking very closely with him on a different health care proposal. I am \nconvinced that we will pass that proposal here in the U.S. Senate and \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I agree with my friend, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, who is one \nof the real leaders in this body in terms of mental health issues. \nDuring the course of the debate the last time we addressed the \ncomprehensive issues of health reform, one of the real important \nfeatures that we effectively worked out was that we were going to \nconsider the challenges of mental illness as well as physical illness \nsimilarly and treat them equitably. They are not treated equally under \ncurrent law. I have supported that. We debated\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\nit. There is broad support for it. It is justified as a health \nimprovement measure.\n\n  I support mandatory preventive services for children. That has been \nan issue where there has been broad support. It passed overwhelmingly \nin the Finance Committee as part of our previous discussions. There is \nstrong justification for providing the range of services--\nimmunizations, preventive, screening, and attention for children in our \nsociety. It is not costly. We have the expenditures for that proposal. \nOut of the list that is included in here, we certainly could have \nworked on that measure. There is broad support. But we have resisted \nthat. Why? Because, as has been pointed out before, the range of \ndifferent supporters that we have been able to gather for this \nmeasure--we have said that on this issue, on this bill, we will not \naccept provisions which are going to be untested, untried, and \ncontroversial in terms of their health implications and their cost \nimplications.\n  There is not a lot of difference in this body--Republican and \nDemocrat--about providing preventive health care services for children. \nThere is not a lot of difference in this body in trying to equate \nmental health with other physical challenges. There is not a lot of \ndifference I say in raising lifetime limits.\n  Those are measures that I feel strongly about and that I would like \nto support, but we do not have those measures up here. The reason we do \nnot have them up here is because we have an understanding; we have an \nagreement that we are going to keep this legislation as close to the \ntarget as we possibly can in trying to deal with the problems of \npreexisting conditions so that individuals who are working and are \nplaying by the rules of the game and are paying their premiums are \ngoing to be able, if they lose their job or change their job, to take \ntheir insurance with them. We are going to provide the incentives in \nterms of small business so that they can pull together and develop the \neconomic advantages that the major corporations have. We have agreed to \nmove in that area.\n  Now we have medical savings accounts. I have myself serious problems \nwith that issue. Others have expressed support. The question should not \nbe so much how we stand on these particular issues, but I want to just \nexpress very briefly my very serious concerns about it. But, \nnonetheless, it is highly divisive, highly controversial, and highly \nunacceptable. I think all of us understand that if this measure is \nincluded in the proposal, school is out--school is out in terms of \namendments; school is out in terms of what may be added or what may be \nsubtracted; school is out in terms of the focus and attention on a very \nimportant proposal that has the broad support and the unanimous support \nof Republicans and Democrats out of our committee.\n  So I hope that the proposal of Senator Kassebaum to strike this \nprovision will be acceptable.\n  Let me mention briefly why I am opposed and others are opposed to \nmedical savings accounts. First of all, over 10 years this is $3.2 \nbillion. It is going to cost $3.2 billion. The fact of the matter is, \nwe have to ask ourselves: Are we going to raise the deficit by $3.2 \nbillion when many of us were around here trying to increase education \nprograms, trying to even increase the various programs on Head Start? \nWe were told we did not have the money when we tried to expand support \nfor education on the Goals 2000, increasing academic achievement. We do \nnot have that money. When we were out here trying to do something about \nincreasing child care, we did not have the money. Now suddenly we have \n$3.2 billion. That is the cost, $3.2 billion.\n  So we have to ask ourselves: Well, $3.2 billion, who is going to \nbenefit from the $3.2 billion? Is this going to be something that is \ngoing to be across the board in terms of beneficiaries? We can start \nright out and say, as the Joint Tax Committee has pointed out, no one \nwhose income is below $20,000 will benefit one nickel--not one. Only \none percent of all the benefits from the MSA proposal, will go to \nindividuals who earn less than $30,000--only 1 percent of the benefits. \nNinety-seven percent of the benefits will go only to people above the \nmedian family income in this country--only 3 percent of the benefits \nfrom MSAs will go to those below the median family income.\n  Who benefits from this? Who benefits are the wealthiest individuals. \nSound familiar? Sound familiar? The higher income individuals are the \nones that will be participating in this program.\n  So we ask ourselves at the beginning: Can we afford the $3.2 billion? \nIf we get it, not according to my estimates, not by the various actuary \nand other groups, but by the Joint Tax Committee, Republican and \nDemocrat alike, it has been pointed out that the great majority of \nAmericans will not be eligible.\n  And why? It is quite understandable. They do not have the income to \npay the deductibles for the MSA's. So therefore it does not do them any \ngood. In order to be able to benefit from an MSA, an individual has to \nbe able to afford the deductibles, and ordinary working Americans \nsimply will not be able to do that; they won't be making enough money.\n  Secondly, we can ask, what is going to be the impact on our whole \nhealth care system? Well, the various reports that we have received--\nand we will have a chance perhaps to get into them in greater detail--\ndemonstrate that what is going to happen in this situation is that the \nyounger people and the wealthier people are going to take this \nopportunity to participate in the MSA's. They are going to take the \nopportunity. Why? Because they know they are not going to need to spend \nup to $3,000 for a sickness over the period of that next year. That is \nthe deductible, $3,000. They know that by and large they are not going \nto get sick during that period of time. So they are not really at risk. \nThey know they only need help if something serious is going to happen \nto them.\n  So the healthy and the individuals who have the resources are going \nto be the ones who use those MSA's. What about everyone else? Are they \ngoing to use it? Probably not. Because they know they are going to have \ndeductibles and they know that they are going to have particular health \ncare needs like every family has.\n  And the health implications of this are profound. It means that the \ngeneral insurance pools are going to continue to include the sicker \npeople, and the premiums are going to go up for everyone because they \nare going to have the sicker Americans and they are going to have the \nworking Americans who can't afford the MSA's. And what is going to \nhappen, the premiums are going to go up and therefore workers are going \nto begin to disband their commitment to health care for themselves \nbecause the costs are going up.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Does this really have an advantage in terms \nof savings? Is this a new process of delivering health care that many \nof us had hoped the HMO's would be? We hoped that by having the payment \nfor health care at the beginning of the year and the incentives on the \nvarious kinds of HMO's to develop preventive programs that they would \nkeep people healthier so they save money through prevention. But with \nMSA's, this won't happen.\n  To the contrary, every time a woman goes and gets a mammography test, \nthey are going to have to pay out. Is that covered by your health \ninsurance? No. Because you are not up to $3,000. Every time a woman \ngets a pap smear, she has to pay out. Is that going to be offset by \nhealth insurance? Absolutely not. They are going to have to pay out. \nAll the screening for children, for the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies, are they going to be encouraged to go to preventive health \ncare? Absolutely not, because they are going to have to pay out.\n  Finally, make no mistakes--medical savings accounts are also part of \nthe long-term Republican anti-Medicare agenda. Every senior citizen and \nevery Senator who cares about Medicare should be aware of this Trojan \nhorse. The special interests who are urging this provision now are part \nof the ongoing effort to undermine Medicare by turning it over to the \nprivate insurance industry. If we open the door to medical savings \naccounts for the non-elderly today, we will be opening the door to \nmedical savings accounts for the elderly tomorrow and that is not a \nstep Congress should take.\n  So, Mr. President, in summary, this proposal is skewed financially. \nThe financial benefit goes to the wealthiest\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nindividuals and to the healthiest people. It is poor health policy \nbecause it is going to disadvantage the incentives in the areas where \nyou can provide true savings on health care, and that is going about \nthe business of providing preventive health care.\n  One of the extraordinary ironies in terms of our budget policy here \nis you do not get any credit in terms of CBO when you move towards \npreventive care. Even though you save the Government millions and \nmillions of dollars over the period of years, you cannot get credit for \nany kind of preventive care. That is where savings come about--when you \nimmunize children, when you give well-baby care, when you give an \nexpectant mother good kinds of care and nutrition so the child is going \nto be healthy rather than have medical complications at birth.\n\n  This vote is not just about medical savings accounts. It is also \nabout whether Americans will get the genuine health insurance reform \nthey deserve. Senator Kassebaum and I have pledged that we will resist \ncontroversial amendments, because they will kill this bill. We intend \nto vote against even controversial amendments that we support. Many \nother Senators on both sides of the aisle have made the same pledge. \nThis vote is the test. If Senators insist on their narrow agenda, this \nhealth reform will die.\n  This is an unwise, untested, unjustified measure. It is effectively a \npoison pill. There are many other, more deserving health care issues \nthat we ought to be accepting or addressing ourselves to that are a lot \nless costly than this particular measure, and I hope that Senator \nKassebaum's amendment is accepted.\n  I would be glad to yield 12 minutes----\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twelve minutes to the Senator, 12 minutes to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twelve minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma have an \ninquiry?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe that both the Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Massachusetts have control of the time, \nand I also think the Chair has usually recognized Senators seeking \nrecognition, and then the Senators delegate how they allocate that \ntime, I think is the normal procedure.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, not to intervene here, but I would \nsuggest that I think the Senator from Oklahoma has been waiting quite \nsome time to speak. And while I am not in charge of the time at this \npoint, it would seem to me best to let that back-and-forth proceed.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes of the leader's time to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank you. I thank my colleague from \nWest Virginia. I will be happy to accommodate my friend as well. I \nthink it would be better if we go back and forth a little bit, if that \nis possible. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, that was my \ninterest because my colleague from Massachusetts has generated a little \ninterest in me to respond.\n  I also compliment the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from \nKansas for their work, but particularly I wish to compliment the \nSenator from Delaware and the Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, \nfor this amendment. This amendment is probably the most significant \nhealth care provision that the Senate has considered in a long time.\n  I have heard a lot of people say we want to make insurance more \nportable; we want to make insurance more affordable. If you do, then we \nneed to support Senator Dole and Senator Roth's amendment. That would \ninclude some tax equalization. The Tax Code is really skewed. It is \nreally inequitable. It is not fair.\n  Let me just give you a couple of examples. The amendment that we have \ndealing both with the medical savings account and deductibility for \nself-insured help fix the problem--not totally, but they certainly \nimprove it.\n  The Tax Code right now discriminates against people who do not work \nfor generous employers. If you work for a generous employer, they can \npay for your health care benefits and the individual can receive that \ntax free benefit, does not have to pay anything for it. It is nice. If \nyou work for General Motors, they can deduct 100 percent for health \ncare costs.\n\n  What if you do not work for a generous employer? What if you work for \nan employer who maybe cannot afford it or does not subsidize your \nhealth care? Then as an individual you have to pay for your health care \nwith after-tax dollars. That is not fair.\n  What if you are self-employed? Right now, if you pay for your health \ncare, you get a 30-percent deduction. Let me make sure everybody \nunderstands that. If you work for General Motors or a generous \ncorporation, they get a 100-percent deduction, the company does. If you \nare self-employed, you get a 30-percent deduction.\n  That is not right. I used to run a manufacturing company, and at one \ntime we paid 100 percent of health care costs. It was all deductible, a \ntax-free benefit for employees. I also used to be self-employed. Right \nnow, they get 30 percent. I used to have a janitor service when I was \nself-employed. They only get 30 percent. But a big manufacturing \ncompany or a little manufacturing company, a corporation, they get 100 \npercent.\n  Now, what is right about that? That makes no sense, no sense \nwhatsoever. This bill is going to help fix this.\n  What about an individual who maybe does not work, is unemployed. They \nneed health care just as much as anybody else. This bill helps fix \nthat. And the Senator from Massachusetts does not want to allow it to \nhappen. He said, well, school is out if we allow medical savings \naccounts. Medical savings accounts are the only thing, the only thing, \nthat will benefit somebody who does not have a job and wants to get \nhealth care. We do not help them in other areas. We are going to help \nthem. We are going to say, yes, you can get health care; you can have \nyour medical savings account; it is yours; it is portable; you do not \nhave to have a job; it goes with you. It is not contingent on a job.\n  We use the Tax Code to encourage homeownership and so we say, you are \nentitled to an interest deduction on your home. And we do not say you \nhave to have a job to get the interest deduction; it is yours; you \ndesigned the house, or you can buy the house. That is your decision, \nand it is your deduction. We do the same thing for other things. You \nmake that decision. But we do not do it on health care. We say, well, \nyou have to work for a generous employer. You get a real nice benefit. \nYou work for yourself, you only get a third as much. You get a 30-\npercent deduction.\n  This bill takes it up to 80 percent for self-employed. And that is \nabout what the average of a lot of companies is. So that is pretty \nequitable. It takes some time to get there, I might mention. We do not \ndo it overnight. But at least it gets it up to 80 percent. That is a \ngood move.\n  I compliment Senator Dole. When we passed this originally in the \nBalanced Budget Act, it only went to 50 percent and Senator Dole said, \n``Let's make it 80 percent.'' He was right. That is equitable, and that \nmeans that Don Nickles' janitor service gets just about as good a deal \nas a manufacturing company in 7 years.\n  That is a good provision. It needs to pass. But equally as important \nis that individual who does not have a job or that individual who is \nunemployed or that individual who works for an employer that does not \ngive anything to their health care. Right now, they have to buy their \nhealth care with after-tax dollars. And they need health care as much \nas somebody working for any company in America. Let us help them. \nMedical savings accounts will help them, and they are not something \nuntested and untried, as my colleague from Massachusetts said. We have \nsomething like 3,000 firms right now offering those.\n  Seventeen States now have MSA laws, an additional 11 States have \ncalled on Congress to enact MSA legislation. We ought to do it. \nEverybody ought to have the opportunity to have this choice. We are not \nmandating it on\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nanybody, but it should be a choice. They should have the opportunity.\n  What is the choice? Yes, they can buy insurance, I think pretty good \ninsurance. They can buy insurance that is for the catastrophic illness. \nWe say a medical savings account is very comparable to an Individual \nRetirement Account. Individuals can put in $2,000, families or couples \ncan put in $4,000, and then use it for medical expenses. They have to \nbuy at least catastrophic coverage, to cover the really expensive care. \nThat makes sense.\n  We are encouraging this with medical savings accounts. A lot of the \nprivate sector is doing the same thing. In our company we used to \nensure the first dollar coverage on anything. That is very expensive \nand it is not what insurance is for. When you buy car insurance you do \nnot buy car insurance to fill the car up with gasoline or fill it up \nwith oil. You buy car insurance for collision or something that is \nreally expensive that you need insurance for. That also makes sense in \nthe medical field, to let people use their own dollars for the small \nthings, the routine things, the doctor's office visit. And they will \nuse their own money. If they do not use it they can save it. It is not \nuse it or lose it. They can save it, accumulate it. We encourage \nsavings and they can use that money later for something that really is \nserious, that is problematic. Or they can use it for long-term health \ncare.\n  This is a good provision. This will help countless middle-income \nfamilies. Mr. President, 88 percent of the benefit falls to individuals \nwho make less than $100,000. It is not for wealthy people, it is for \nAmerican families and it will help people who get no help whatsoever \nfrom the present Tax Code. If we want to eliminate a lot of this tax \ninequity, medical savings accounts will go a long way to doing that. \nLet us give them some benefit. Right now they get zero. An individual \nwho is unemployed, an individual who works for a corporation that does \nnot subsidize his or her health care, they get zero tax benefits. \nFinally, if we pass this they will get something and to me that is a \nvery positive contribution.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let us not make this a partisan issue. I \nknow Senator Breaux introduced a MSA bill in 1992. Senator Daschle, \nSenator Nunn, Senator Boren, Senator Dixon--they cosponsored the bill. \nRepresentative Gephardt, in 1994--almost all Members but one of the \nDemocrat Party on Ways and Means supported Mr. Gephardt's provision \nthat had medical savings accounts. So why all of a sudden are we being \npartisan? This is a good provision. It is a bipartisan provision. It \nshould be passed.\n  We should help individuals. We are not helping individuals. We should \nmake insurance truly portable and we do that with medical savings \naccounts. It is not contingent on a job. If they lose their jobs they \nstill have their medical savings account. It is portable. It stays with \nthem. It is not contingent on employment. It is a good provision. So I \nam very disappointed in some of the comments that have been made.\n  This is a good provision. It will make health care more portable. It \nis the most portable health care plan you can have. It goes with the \nindividuals. It is theirs. If they save the money and they do not spend \nit, it grows, it accumulates. They can use it for later times.\n  Also, it makes it more affordable. People are a lot more frugal with \ntheir own money than they are with employer money or than they are with \nGovernment money.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to pass the medical savings \naccount provision, to vote against the amendment to delete this \nprovision, and then also to pass the underlying Dole-Roth amendment. It \nis an excellent amendment that will help expand coverage to countless \nAmericans that right now, because of inequities in the Tax Code, really \ncome up short.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Delaware for his leadership. And \nalso Senator Dole for proposing this amendment. I hope my colleagues \nwill agree to it.\n  Mr. ROTH. Before we conclude action on the measure before us, I want \nto specially commend the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for \nhis invaluable contribution to this effort. His introduction of S. \n1658, the Family Choice in Long-Term Care Act, along with his behind-\nthe-scenes advocacy on this issue, has made the difference in getting \nlong-term care on the must-do list of health care reforms. Senator \nMcConnell has shown tremendous concern for the long-term care needs of \nelderly Americans and their families, and he has played a key role in \nproposing common sense and compassionate solutions to the problem. We \nall know how some people just talk about an issue; the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky works issues, and the legislation before us reflects the \nwork that Senator McConnell has devoted to this crucial health care \nconcern.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me thank the chairman for his generous remarks and \nfor his tremendous work on this legislation. The need to provide \nmeaningful long-term care coverage cannot be overstated. It is \nestimated that at least 40 percent of those aged 65 and over will \nrequire nursing home care at some point, costing an average of $38,000 \nper year. As the chairman knows, this poses a terrible Hobson's choice \nfor most seniors and their families. Many seniors are forced to \nliquidate their life savings and sell off family heirlooms just to pay \nfor this expensive care, and only when they have depleted nearly all of \ntheir assets will Medicaid pick up the tab. Because of the massive \ncosts involved, private insurance has thus far played a negligible role \nin the financing of long-term care, accounting for less than 2 percent \nof long-term care payouts. The dearth of private planning options for \nlong-term care is also having a devastating impact on strained State \nMedicaid budgets. Long-term care costs are draining away Medicaid \nresources that are needed to provide health care for indigent and \ndisabled Americans. We cannot continue to rob Peter to pay Paul much \nlonger. America's elderly population is expected to increase by almost \n25 percent between 1993 and 2011, and this will place an unbearable \nburden on the Medicaid Program unless decisive action is taken. This \nbill provides essential private financing options for long-term care, \nand takes a positive step toward meeting the long-term care needs of \nfuture generations of Americans. Again, I want to thank the chairman \nfor addressing this issue in his amendment, and look forward to having \nit signed into law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to take some time to discuss a \nspecific provision included in the majority leader's amendment.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with the long term care industry \nin Pennsylvania during my service in Congress. I am extremely pleased \nthat the leadership amendment included long-term-care provisions which \nwill fill a void in the security of older Americans. I wrote my Senate \ncolleagues this past week as well as the majority leader directly \nurging the inclusion of the long-term-care language. The long-term-care \nsection will improve this bill by giving long-term-care insurance the \nsame Federal tax treatment as health insurance and by establishing \nFederal long-term-care insurance standards and consumer protections.\n  The cost of long-term care is easily the biggest financial threat \nfacing elderly Americans. The average cost of nursing home care has \nrisen to $38,000 per year. We also know that more than 40 percent of \nthose who turn 65 this year will require nursing facility care at some \npoint in their lives. Medicaid does pay for nursing home care, but only \nafter the costs of long-term care makes the recipient destitute. \nBasically, people in need of long-term-care services must pay for the \ncare out of pocket until they spend down all their assets to the point \nof poverty. Then and only then do they qualify for Medicaid.\n  The real crime here is that people do not know that they will have to \nlose all their assets to obtain long-term-care services. They think \nMedicare covers it.\n  Even after 30 years of Medicare, many Americans remain confused \nregarding what Medicare does and does not cover--particularly regarding \nlong-term care. Year after year, public surveys show that nearly half \nof Americans believe that Medicare covers long-term care. Because of \nthis misconception, many Americans come to a rude awakening when they \nneed long-term care for which they have not prepared. Helping \nindividuals and families understand the limits on Government long-\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nterm-care assistance and giving them incentive to prepare for their \nneeds will encourage more Americans to plan for, save for, and insure \nagainst the costs of long-term care.\n  We currently allow acute health care expenses and insurance premiums \nto be deducted. State laws require car insurance, home or flood \ninsurance, and other protections for individuals and families. Yet we \ndo not require, much less encourage, people to plan for something that \nmore than likely will impact them--the need for long-term-care \nservices.\n  The language in the leadership amendment would correct this. \nSpecifically, the provisions will give long-term-care insurance the \nsame Federal tax treatment as health insurance and link tax provisions \nto Federal long-term-care insurance consumer protections. This second \npart is so important because it ensures that policies offer value to \nconsumers and pay appropriately and adequately for quality long-term \ncare when needed.\n  Not only would greater use of long-term-care insurance help protect \nindividuals and families from impoverishment due to long-term-care \ncosts, but it would also help control Medicaid costs. Mr. President, in \nthe long run this will save money for the Medicaid program.\n  In a 1994 article in Health Affairs, Marc Cohen, Nanda Kumar, and \nStanley Wallack estimated that having a long-term-care insurance policy \nreduces the probability of spending down to Medicaid eligibility levels \nby some 39 percent. The authors estimate that, in the aggregate, \nMedicaid expenditures would be reduced by $8,000 to $15,000 for every \nnursing home entrant who had a long-term-care insurance policy. \nAccording to the analysis, this translates into cutting what Medicaid \npays per nursing home entrant in half for long-term-care policy \npurchasers. It is in our best interest to encourage people who can meet \ntheir long-term-care needs to do so. Medicaid will then take care of \ntruly needy individuals.\n  The majority leader's amendment assists America's elderly and their \nfamilies with long-term care by putting policies in place that help \nassure the affordability and value of long-term-care insurance. Giving \nAmericans tax incentives to insure against the potential costs of long-\nterm care will also save Medicaid dollars in the long run. Since we \ncannot continue to rely so heavily on scarce Government dollars to pay \nfor long-term care, individuals and families should be encouraged to \nplan for, save for, and insure against the potential long-term-care \ncosts. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and to support \nthis specific language.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n10 additional minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. I am sorry, I did not hear.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. There will be 10 additional minutes added, equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask whether, because we agreed to a very brief time, \nwhether at least on our side we could have another 10 minutes, total of \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will give you my 5.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. That gives you 10 minutes additional.\n  Mr. ROTH. Can I have 15?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I think maybe you better take it. A bird in the hand \nis worth two in the bush.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 14 minutes \nand 55 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nOklahoma that this could be the most significant health care \nlegislation that we have passed in a long time, which is why I think it \nis terribly important that we pass it. What has been made very clear, \nvery distinct throughout this discussion, is that we are in an argument \nnow on MSA. We have not been in an argument on anything else. We are in \nan argument on MSA. The agreement, from the very beginning, was to take \nthe controversial stuff out; leave that for now, and do it later. It \nwill probably pass on its own, but now is not the time.\n  To back that up, I have a letter from the NFIB. This NFIB letter, \nsigned by Dan Danner, says, ``The NFIB opposes the adoption of any \namendment to S. 1028 which would draw a Presidential veto or cause the \nbill to be defeated in the Senate.''\n  I repeat the statement of administration policy from the White House, \nin which they indicated, as their first priority, that for the bill to \ninclude medical savings accounts would, as they say, ``create grave \nrisks to the passage and enactment of this bipartisan legislation.'' I \nthink those who are pushing the MSA, for whatever the various \ninteresting reasons that have floated around here for the past several \ndays, ought to bear very carefully in mind that they are putting the \nentire bill in jeopardy. If the amendment passes with MSA's, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts said, ``school is out.'' Everything else \ncomes in. The bill is down. The bill is gone. An opportunity is \nfinished.\n  I hope people will take moral responsibility in considering the \ndecision which they are making. In fact, every single serious health \npolicy analyst--and you can laugh at them, except when you realize they \nare just about the whole gamut--they all say that giving a tax break \nfor medical savings accounts is a very bad idea. I repeat--it is a very \nbad idea. Medical savings accounts, they say, would cherry pick the \nhealthy people --yes--and drive up health care costs for the sick--yes. \nMedical savings accounts would further destabilize an already seriously \nfragmented insurance risk pool. And of course we understand what that \nmeans.\n  The insurance risk pool gets fragmented when companies self-insure; \nmany big companies do that now. They did not 25 years ago. That puts \nmore pressure on the small business market where you have individual \ninsurance. It is a very, very risky business in any event, without \nthrusting MSA into it.\n  Another thought worries me. The Republicans put MSA's into \nreconciliation, with respect to Medicare. CBO has determined that only \nabout 1 or 2 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would, in fact, select a \nmedical savings account. But let there be no doubt in the mind of \nanyone here that what is hoped is that the MSA's would spread, indeed, \nto the whole concept of Medicare. This should represent to every one of \nmy colleagues a very severe threat to the future of Medicare. That, I \nthink, is what is in mind here. Furthermore, CBO concluded that healthy \nseniors would opt in and out of traditional Medicare based on whether \nthey thought they would be using health services in that particular \nyear. In other words, there would be no predictable pattern.\n  Lewin-VHI, a well respected consulting firm, concluded that ``An \noptional health coverage program that promises potential cash benefits \nto persons who are able to keep their health spending low will \nexperience extreme selection bias.''\n  The American Academy of Actuaries has also been quoted. This is an \ninteresting quote from them. ``Those who have little or no health care \nexpenditures. . .would save money on MSA's. The greatest losses will be \n     for those employees with substantial health care \n     expenditures. Those with high expenditures are primarily \n     older employees and pregnant women.\n\n  A report from the Congressional Research Office, written by the \nnonpartisan folks there says, ``If MSA's only attracted the healthy, \nthe cost of insurance for everyone else would increase due to adverse \nselection.''\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation has concluded that, ``Enrollees who \nleave the traditional Medicare plan would be healthier on average than \nthose who remain in the traditional plan.''\n  Again, notice that threat--the Medicare beneficiaries lost to MSA's \nwould\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nbe healthier on average than those who remain in the traditional \nplan.''\n  That foreshadows an ominous future for Medicare. And you have this \nbroad, broad coalition that is saying exactly the same thing.\n  Mr. President, I do not think it is any secret that there have been \nspecial interests working very hard on this in the last several days, \nand those who are in the process of making up their mind at this point, \nI think, might consider that there is really one group that is \nespecially interested in this particular medical savings account \nactivity. Their president was working the entire Capitol yesterday and \nsaw a number of people. In exchange, they are hoping to win approval of \na special tax break that they hope will throw millions of dollars in \nnew insurance business their way. Is that a crude thing to say? I do \nnot know. I think it is a major part of this debate, and I think it is \na major part of the reason that we are in a debate we should not be in \nat all. Debate on this bill was to be based on the clear premise that \nwe agree that controversial stuff should be left out--so we can take, \nas the Senator from Oklahoma said, 25 million kids and adults and \nimprove their lives substantially, in terms of health care.\n  This is a bill which enjoys strong bipartisan support. MSA's do not \nenjoy strong bipartisan support. I have to conclude that the vote on \nthis will be very close, and I hope as people vote, they will consider \nthe pressures which have been brought, particularly by one single \ncompany, on Members on both sides of the House and the Senate.\n  Are we really going to do their bidding, or are we going to help 25 \nmillion people in this country when we have a historic chance to do it? \nI think the answer is easy. I hope my colleagues will move to strike \nthe MSA provision. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Faircloth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor up to 4 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, what a difference 2 years makes. All of us remember \nthat at this time 2 years ago, the Clinton administration was \nstruggling to keep afloat their Health Security Act--the Clinton plan \nfor a nationalized health care system.\n  In case anyone's memory needs refreshing, I have reproduced the chart \nthat Senator Specter used to illustrate the workings of the Clinton \nplan. Once Members of Congress and the American people saw what was \nbehind the President's rhetoric, nothing could save the Clinton plan. \nOnce the American people realized that the Clinton plan was a big-\ngovernment power grab on the most enormous scale ever attempted in this \ncountry, they rejected it.\n  Mr. President, in contrast, the general philosophy of Republicans in \nCongress supports health care reform that benefits and empowers \nAmericans and their families on an individual scale. As these charts \nillustrate, this philosophy is about improvements for individuals, not \nbig government.\n  On my chart, I have included four principles: affordability, \navailability, flexibility, and portability. In the bill we are now \ndebating, Senator Kassebaum has done a fine job of addressing two of \nthese principles. In the provisions for insurance reform and for \ninsurance purchasing pools, Senator Kassebaum's bill takes important \nsteps to improve the availability and portability of health care \ncoverage.\n  It is my strong and sincere hope that we can further improve this \nlegislation by amending it to include provisions that enhance the \nflexibility and affordability of health care coverage for all Americans \non an individual basis. The provisions I have in mind include those \nthat I have placed on my chart: medical malpractice reform, increased \ndeductibility of insurance for self-employed individuals, and medical \nsavings accounts.\n  The majority of uninsured Americans are adults who work full-time \njobs, usually in small businesses. Measures like more favorable rules \nfor the formation of voluntary purchasing pools, increased deductions \nfor health care expenses, medical malpractice reform, and medical \nsavings accounts would give small employers more options at lower costs \nto help them offer the health coverage they currently cannot afford. \nUnder these proposals the decisionmaking will remain where it belongs, \nwith individuals and their employers.\n  To reduce the number of uninsured Americans, President Clinton \nproposed an employer mandate that would have required all businesses to \ncover their employees with a Cadillac plan designed in Washington. The \nresult of this policy would have been hundreds of thousands of lost \njobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars in increased costs for \nbusinesses.\n  President Clinton also proposed that his nationalized health care \nsystem would have been run by a system of health alliances. Through a \ncomplex system of cost controls and rationing, the bureaucrats who ran \nthese alliances would have decided what Americans spent health care \ndollars on, and how much they spent individually and collectively. If \nmedical savings accounts were available to Americans, any individuals \nwho chose them would gain full control of their own health care \ndecisions.\n  As chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Kassebaum has done a \ncommendable job of advancing the difficult issue of health insurance \nreform within the jurisdiction of her committee. But, medical savings \naccounts fall within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, the rules of the Senate should not deprive the \nAmerican people of the most meaningful free-market health care reform \nmeasure that we could give them.\n  Perhaps the most important debate that we can have is a debate on \nmedical savings accounts. It is unfortunate that the administration has \nalready tried to poison this debate by threatening to veto a health \ncare reform bill that contains them. Their accusation is that anyone \nwho wants to include medical savings accounts wants to kill the \nKassebaum bill. That simply is not true. The truth is the President \nknows that if medical savings accounts become law, they will drive the \nfinal nails in the coffin of the Clinton plan, and bury his dream of \nnationalized health care.\n  Once individual Americans have the power to control how their own \nhealth care dollars are spent, they will never allow the Government to \ntake that power back.\n  In his last State of the Union Address the President stated that \n``the era of big-government is over.'' I wonder if he really meant it, \nor if he was just echoing a decision already made by the voters in the \nlast elections. Regardless, the decision has been made. We should pass \nhealth care reform that ensures that the power to make health care \ndecisions is placed in the hands of individual Americans, not big-\ngovernment. That means health care reform that includes medical savings \naccounts.\n  I applaud the decision of Chairman Roth and the majority leader to \nbring an amendment to the floor that contains medical savings accounts. \nJust as he has done so many times in the past Senator Dole has shown \nthe leadership necessary to make the difficult decisions, and push \naside the administration's rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, there are very different goals involved in this \ndebate. Our goal should be health care reform based on improvements for \nindividuals, not health care reform based on big-government solutions.\n  I plan to strongly support the Dole-Roth amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I plan to support the Dole amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that.\n  As I always like to say, I was one of the first Members of Congress \nin either the House or Senate to introduce a medical savings account \nbill. I introduced a bill with John Kasich, Tom DeLay and John Miller, \na former Member from Washington, back in January\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\n1992. I have followed it for a long, long time prior to corporate \nlobbyists being up here on the Hill, and I believe very strongly in its \nconcept.\n  Let me explain. I guess we had a lot of talk about what is going on \nhere with this specific MSA bill. Let me explain the concept behind \nmedical savings accounts and the fear many of us have with, the best \nway I can put it, the ``corporatization'' of the health care field and \nhow we see medical savings account as, really, the last chance for \npatient choice and for compassion in an industry that is becoming more \nand more regulated by third parties in the fundamental relationship \nbetween doctors and patients.\n  If I can, let me just walk back to the system we had before managed \ncare came into place. What we had was a doctor/patient relationship. \nThat was the problem. There was nobody in this relationship who had any \nincentive to control costs. As a rule, costs escalated out of control. \nWhy?\n  If you were the patient and had first-dollar coverage, who asked how \nmuch things cost? Who asked whether you needed one or two or five of \nthese? You took whatever the doctor suggested and you did not pay for \nit, so why did you care?\n  So, on the other side is the doctor, and what is the doctor's \nincentive in this doctor/patient transaction? The more the doctor does, \nthe more money he gets paid. The more the doctor does, the less chance \nthe doctor gets sued. So you have a doctor who gets more money, with \nless chance of being sued, and you have a patient who does not pay for \nanything.\n  Then we sat back and wondered several years ago, gee, why are health \ncare costs going up? It was very simple. There was nobody with any \nincentive to control costs. We understood that and companies understood \nthat and insurance companies understood that, and they did a very \nlogical thing. They brought someone in to control costs, the \ngatekeeper, the insurance company, who came in; and now they are \ngoverning the relationship between the doctor and patient. If you want \nsomething done, you go through the insurance company. You get approval, \nand it can be done. That is now the governor, the one who is in charge \nof this relationship.\n  What many of us believe is that that is not the most compassionate, \nand some would suggest that it may not result in the best quality of \ncare. It certainly does not result in the maximization of patient \nchoice. So what we have put forward is a concept called medical \nsavings. I think it is really misnamed. I think we should call it \n``patient choice accounts,'' because that is what is left. If we do not \ndo medical savings accounts, if we do not do patient choice accounts, \nthe doctor-patient relationship which we know will disappear in \nAmerica. It will disappear. It is disappearing, has disappeared, in a \nlot of communities already in this country.\n  We hear so much from so many people on both sides of the aisle about \nbeing compassionate, about caring for people, about doing things to \ngive people choices and to give people the ability to do what is best \nfor them and their families. What we have here is a situation going on \nin the private sector in America where that choice is going away. \nPrivate practice is almost a thing of the past in many communities and \nis growing more apparent in all States across this country.\n  What medical savings accounts do is provide a chance, an opportunity, \nfor the traditional doctor-patient relationship to be restored where \nnow the incentive is on the patient to be cost conscious. How? Because, \ninstead of the old system where you had first-dollar coverage and the \ninsurance company pays for everything, we are going to say, look, we \nare going to take a higher deductible policy like an auto insurance \npolicy--we do not pay, as Senator Nickles said, for gasoline or oil \nchanges--but you pay for the incidental costs of health care, the day-\nto-day costs, and we insure you for the catastrophic illness or for a \nyear where you had a lot of serious problems.\n  So you take a high-deductible policy and you pay for the out-of-\npocket expense and you afford that because, when you take a higher \ndeductible policy, the cost of that policy is less.\n  Senator Craig gave an example earlier where a policy with a $250 \ndeductible and a $500 cap and a 20-percent copay cost $458 a month for \na family. A $3,000 deductible policy, same coverages, no copay, costs \ntwo-thirds less, costs under $200 a month. Where did that savings go \nbetween the $200 and $450? It went into the pocket of the person who \nhad the medical savings account.\n\n  It would go, under this bill, tax free into an account you set up at \nyour bank. You get a little debit card. You could then use it to \npurchase health care. You could use it to make choices about what \ndoctor you wanted to go to, what hospital, and how much you wanted to \nspend.\n  I always ask people, ``Who are the lowest paid doctors in this \ncountry?'' Well, they are pediatricians and family practitioners and \ndentists because they are not covered under insurance. Why? They have \nto charge people who pay out of pocket, so they have to keep their \ncosts down. Just imagine if we did that to most of the health care \nsector in this country. It would be an enormous contraction, I believe, \nin costs in our society. It would not lead to higher costs in other \nareas, in other insurance pools. I think this is a dramatic step \nforward. This is the reason that I applaud Senator Dole for fighting to \nthe end because this is the kind of dramatic reform that this country \nneeds to preserve freedom of choice for patients.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for up to \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the chairman's generosity in letting me talk on this \nvery important issue. I wanted to speak on two points on the amendment. \nFirst, the deductibility for the self-employed is such an important \nstep forward that the people who are self-employed will be encouraged \nto get health care coverage for themselves, and that is what we are \ntrying to do here. It is what we have been trying to do for 2 years. To \nincrease the tax deductibility for them to 80 percent from 30 percent \nis a big step in the right direction to encourage more people to get \nhealth care coverage.\n  The issue of medical savings accounts--``patient choice accounts'' is \na great name for it because it really will make a difference for so \nmany people and so many small businesses in this country, giving them \nan opportunity they would not have had.\n  Senator Kennedy's bill in 1994 had language saying that they hoped \nthere would be medical savings accounts included in the health reform \nbill passed by the Senate. This is not a partisan issue. Congressman \nJacobs and Congressman Torricelli today wrote the President of the \nUnited States asking him to support MSA's.\n  Let me give you some examples of companies that have benefited from \nMSA's, medical savings accounts, patient choice accounts.\n  Dominion Resources in Richmond, VA. Since 1989, the company's health \ncare costs have risen less than 1 percent a year while other health \ncare costs all over this country have risen over 10 percent. Here we \nare at 1 percent a year. Not only have their costs come down, but their \nemployees are happy because they have had improved and expanded medical \nbenefits under their medical savings accounts.\n  Knox Semiconductor in Rockport, ME. Their president says they have \nsaved the company $100,000 over 3 years. That is with just 42 \nemployees.\n  The National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas, TX, has been on \nthe leading edge of giving their employees the choices. They have been \nable to contain their health care costs, and their employees are \nhappier with their coverage.\n  Mr. President, medical savings accounts are a key part of the reform \nthat is necessary to give more health care coverage to more people, \nmore working people, in our country. That is why it is important to \nkeep this amendment, the medical savings account, in the bill. Thank \nyou, Mr. President. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware controls 2 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. With 1\\1/2\\ minutes of leader time, we have a total of 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the best thing we can do for health care \nreform is to let the marketplace operate to a greater extent in the \ndelivery of health care. This issue is the most important one that \nfaces us today. You know how strong our argument is from the weakness \nof the argument made by those on the other side of this question.\n  The other side's argument is that we should leave this medical \nsavings account provision out of this bill because it happens to be \ncontroversial. Well, that is the strength of their argument: it is \ncontroversial in Washington, DC; that is, inside the beltway. Well, Mr. \nPresident, medical savings accounts are not controversial outside of \nWashington, DC.\n  The people who oppose this amendment are some of the same people who \nbelieve that Washington knows best, that Washington knows how to \ndictate the delivery of health care better than the people themselves \ndo, particularly people at the grassroots. It seems to me a weak \nargument when the strongest argument against this legislation is that \nit is controversial. Since when is giving people more choice in health \ncare controversial? That is what people want. That is what people know \nwill work better. This is the usual big Government argument against any \nchanges.\n  It is the argument in favor of big government versus letting the free \nmarketplace work. It is the old in favor of big government making \ndecisions for people, as opposed to letting people themselves make \ndecisions.\n  Medical savings accounts give people choice. It is letting people \ncontrol their resources for health care. Quite frankly, it is going to \nsave us a lot of money and reduce health care costs.\n  I am very happy that the leadership puts forth this amendment, \nbecause allowing medical savings accounts is a step in the right \ndirection. They are basically like IRA's, giving people an opportunity \nto save for their retirement. Medical savings accounts are giving \npeople an opportunity to save for themselves and to control their \nresources for their own medical expenses.\n  There is a widespread use of medical savings accounts already in this \ncountry that speaks better than any of us can to their legitimacy and \nto their hope for success. They should reduce health care costs. \nAdministrative costs are lower. Consumers with MSA's should use health \ncare services in a more discriminating manner. Consumers with MSA's \nshould be more selective in choosing providers. This should cause those \nproviders to lower their prices to attract medical savings account \nholders as patients. Medical savings accounts can also help to put the \npatient back into the health care equation.\n  Patients should make more cost-conscious choices about routine health \ncare. Patients with medical savings accounts would have complete choice \nof providers. Medical savings accounts should make health care coverage \nmore dependable. Medical savings accounts are completely portable. \nMedical savings accounts are still the property of the individual, even \nif they can change jobs.\n  Hence, for those reasons, I support medical savings accounts. I very \nmuch thank the leadership for providing this amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that we want to have a vote by 4 \no'clock so I will divide the time remaining with the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 3 minutes to our side and leave the Senator from \nDelaware the final 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, given the very short period of time we have remaining, \nand the fact that all of the arguments have been made, let me simply \nsummarize the case against including MSA's on this bill.\n  Two years ago we all agreed that comprehensive health care reform \nwould not pass. In the last year and a half we have all agreed that we \ncan only pass something which enjoys broad bipartisan support. It was \nwith that understanding and with the remarkable leadership of the Chair \nof the Labor Committee, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we now have a bill that we all agree is the \nonly health reform legislation that can pass this Congress with broad, \nbipartisan support. This narrowly drafted bill some of the most \npressing health problems facing Americans.\n  Portability and coverage for preexisting conditions are two of the \nmost important issues we face. So let there be no mistake, we have an \nopportunity today to pass something, but we also have an opportunity to \nkill that very bill with this MSA provision in this amendment. The NFIB \nclearly stated in a letter dated today, and they have said very \nclearly, ``We oppose any amendment which will bring about a defeat of \nthe legislation before us.''\n  They recognize the importance of this moment. They recognize what an \nopportunity we have before us. We should not blow it. We should not \nkill this bill. Let us recognize there will be another day to have yet \nanother debate about many other health care issues. But let us not \ndestroy the golden opportunity we have today to pass meaningful \nlegislation, by adding something as controversial as MSA's. We can do \nbetter than that. We will do better than that if we can, on a \nbipartisan basis, strike the MSA portion of the Dole amendment and pass \nthis bill intact, as we know we can.\n  If we do that we can look back on this Congress with some \nsatisfaction that we have done our best under these circumstances to \naddress some of the real health care problems working Americans face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, medical savings accounts are among the most \nimportant steps that must be taken to address this country's health \ncare needs, particularly the need for portability. MSA's are of such \nimportance in our effort to address our health concerns that on \nSeptember 8, 1992, several of my distinguished colleagues signed a \nletter calling for the introduction of MSA's as part of their bill.\n  Let me quote a portion of that letter:\n\n       Unlike many standard third-party health care coverage \n     plans, Medical Care Savings Accounts would give consumers an \n     incentive to monitor spending carefully because to do \n     otherwise would be wasting their ``own'' money. . . Once a \n     Medical Savings Account is established for an employee, it \n     is fully portable. Money in the account can be used to \n     continue insurance while an employee is between jobs or on \n     strike. Recent studies show that at least 50 percent of \n     the uninsured are uninsured for four months or less. . . . \n     Today, even commonly required small dollar deductibles \n     (typically $250 to $500) create a hardship for the \n     financially stressed individual or family seeking regular, \n     preventative care services. With Medical Savings Accounts, \n     however, that same individual or family would have this \n     critical money in their account to pay for the needed \n     services.\n\n  Mr. President, these are important arguments that were made for MSA's \nover 3 years ago. They are equally, if not more, important today. That \nletter was signed by Senators Breaux, Boren, Daschle, Lugar, Coats, and \nNunn, a formidable bipartisan coalition of Senators taking a necessary \nstand on a critical issue.\n  Mr. President, I have a copy of a letter received from the Vice \nPresident of the NFIB that makes it clear that they are supporting the \nMSA. This letter, dated today, April 18, 1996, to the Honorable Don \nNickles says, ``Overall, NFIB members need health care reform. It has \nbeen a top priority for years. MSA's are among the provisions we have \nconsistently supported. These also include portability, no preexisting \ncondition exclusion, deductibility, and small business purchasing \ngroups. We will continue to fight for all these provisions of \nimportance to small business.''\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to vote against the motion to strike. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Kassebaum amendment No. 3677.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] and the \nSenator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] are necessarily absent.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Roll Call Vote No. 72 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Campbell\n     Mack\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 3677) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we had hoped that we might have a vote on \nthe Dole amendment, a rollcall vote here. I need to check with one \nSenator on this side. Is there any objection on the other side to \nhaving a vote at this time or not? Are you prepared?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would say with reference to the last vote, I think it was \na close vote. As one of the conferees on the tax side, I think there \nwill still be opportunities in conference. We wanted as many votes as \nwe could have. We have one absentee so I think we have about 47 or 48 \nvotes, which puts us in a strong position in the conference.\n  But, in any event, the outcome here may permit us to conclude action \non this bill today, hopefully. I trust that is what the managers have \nin mind.\n  So, perhaps maybe Senator Dorgan might proceed at this time so we \nwould not lose any time, if he wants to take his 15 minutes now while \nwe are checking to see if we can go ahead and have the vote?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the majority leader, if the majority leader \nwishes to proceed I will defer my time until after the vote. I do not \nneed to intervene at this point. All I want to do is get the \nappropriate time following the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if it is too early for the \nmajority leader to tell us if plans have been made for a session \ntomorrow and, if so, will votes be included tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOLE. If we can complete action on this bill tonight I do not \nanticipate any votes tomorrow. We will probably move to term limits, \nunless we could have some agreement. There would not be any votes.\n  I do not believe there are that many amendments left on this bill. \nSo, as soon as I check with the Senator from Texas, we will be able to \nproceed.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield? I inquire whether or not he \nincluded the antifraud provision in his amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. We included the Cohen antifraud provision, which I think \nwill save $3 billion.\n  Mr. COHEN. According to the CBO, they scored a $3 billion savings. I \nwant to commend Senators Dole and Roth for including it in the package. \nWe are losing roughly $18 billion a year just out of the Medicare \nProgram itself, and we are losing about $100 billion itself throughout \nthe health care system. It works out to about $275 million a day, $11.5 \nmillion an hour. I would also like to thank Mary Gerwin, Helen Albert, \nand Priscilla Hanley from the Aging Committee for all their hard work \non the fraud legislation.\n  Mr. President, last spring the Medicare trustees, on a bipartisan \nbasis, issued an urgent warning that the Medicare hospital trust fund \nwill go broke by the year 2002, unless major changes are made to \nprotect the system. Since that alarm was sounded, the Congress has been \nwrestling with ways to bring Medicare spending under control, in order \nto forestall impending bankruptcy and to strengthen Medicare for both \ncurrent and future beneficiaries.\n  The debate over how--and how much--to control the unsustainable \ngrowth of Medicare spending was part of the budget reconciliation \nprocess which now remains stalled.\n  A major step we can and must take toward Medicare reform is to crack \ndown on the fraud and abuse that drives up the costs of health care for \nsenior citizens and taxpayers. Estimates are that Medicare loses over \n$18 billion each year to fraud and abuse, and that fraudulent schemes \ncost the entire health care system and our economy over $100 billion \neach year.\n  The investigation of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I \nchair, has revealed that it is shockingly simple to commit health care \nfraud, and that the size, complexity, and splintering of the current \nhealth care system creates an environment ripe for abuse.\n  Health care fraud is equal opportunity employer that does not \ndiscriminate against any part of the system. All Government health care \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMP- US, and other Federal and State \nhealth plans, as well as private sector health plans, are ravaged by \nfraud and abuse.\n  Similarly, no one type of health care provider or provider group \ncorners the market on health care fraud. Scams against the system run \nthe gamut from small companies or practitioners who occasionally pad \ntheir Medicare billings because they know they'll never get caught, to \nlarge criminal organizations that systematically steal millions of \ndollars from Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers. According to the \nFBI, health care fraud is growing much faster than law enforcement ever \nanticipated, and even cocaine distributions are switching from drug \ndealing to health care fraud schemes because the chances of being \ncaught are so small--and the profits so big.\n  Of particular concern is the growing evidence that health care fraud \nhas infiltrated the health care industries providing services to our \nnation's elderly and disabled Americans, and in turn, contributing to \nthe runaway costs of these entitlement programs.\n  The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nfor example, has cited problems in home health care, nursing home, and \nmedical supplier industries as significant trends in Medicare and \nMedicaid fraud and abuse. Padding claims and cost reports, charging the \ngovernment and patients outrageous prices for unbundled services, and \nbilling Medicare for costs that have nothing to do with patient care \nare just a few of the schemes that are occurring in these industries.\n\n  Unscrupulous providers are enjoying a feeding frenzy on Medicare and \nMedicaid, while taxpayers are picking up the tab for their feast.\n  It is time that we crack down--and shut down--these schemes that are \nbilking billions of dollars from Medicare and other health care \nprograms. If we have asked honest health care providers to take cuts in \nreimbursement and asked Medicare and Medicaid recipients to pay more \nout-of-pocket costs to bring spending under control,\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nwe have an absolute duty to ensure the American public that their \nhealth care dollars are not lining the pockets of criminals and greedy \nproviders who are manipulating the system through fraud and abuse.\n  I was very pleased that the budget reconciliation bill includes anti-\nfraud legislation that I introduced last year as a result of an \ninvestigation of the Special Committee on Aging and I am pleased that \nmy legislation is included in the leadership amendment on the Kassebaum \nbill.\n  Specifically, the proposal creates tough new criminal statutes to \nhelp prosecutors pursue health care fraud more swiftly and efficiently, \nincreases fines and penalties for billing Medicare and Medicaid for \nunnecessary services, overbilling, and for other frauds against these \nand all Federal health care programs, and makes it easier to kick \nfraudulent providers out of the Medicare and Medicaid Program, so they \ndo not continue to rip off the system.\n  Most importantly, the bill establishes an antifraud and abuse program \nto coordinate Federal and State efforts against health care fraud, and \nsubstantially increases funding for investigative efforts, auditors, \nand prosecutors.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, these provisions will \nyield over $3 billion in scorable savings to Medicare--without costing \na penny to senior citizens. I am convinced that the long-term savings \nare much greater, and that billions more will be saved once dishonest \nproviders realize that we are cracking down on fraud, and that they can \nno longer get away with illegally padding their bills to pad their own \npockets.\n  The legislation has received the support of the FBI Director, the \nAttorney General, the HHS' Secretary, and the Congress, which passed it \nas part of Budget Reconciliation. We should not let an opportunity to \npass this bill go by. We lose as much as $275 million per day or as \nmuch as $11.5 million per hour to health care fraud and abuse. Every \nday we wait, will be a victory to those unscrupulous providers who are \nbankrupting our public health programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important endeavor and I would \nlike to thank Senators Roth and Dole for including this proposal as \npart of the leadership amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. If my colleague would yield for a moment, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to discuss some concerns I have with the section \nwhich pertains to establishment of a new health care fraud and abuse \ndata collection program.\n  Mr. COHEN. I would be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. As you may be aware, the alternative medicine community \nhas expressed concerns about this provision. I have received \ncommunications from, for example, the American Preventive Medical \nAssociation and the National Nutritional Foods Association. In general \ntheir concerns--which I share--focus on the potential abuse of the \nfraud provisions we are passing today. I am sure my colleague is aware, \nfor I know he shares my strong support for alternative medicine, that \nproviders of alternative medical treatments sometimes find themselves \nin the cross hairs of the more traditional medical establishment. \nPersonally, I believe that both alternative and traditional medicine \nare important and that both can benefit patients. But, this cooperative \ncoexistence has not been fully realized it seems.\n  While we are all supportive of strong efforts to weed out health care \nfraud and abuse, I hope the Senator from Maine will agree that we do \nnot want to create an opportunity for those who might want to eliminate \nor discourage such alternative treatments by threatening fraud actions \nunder the new language we are considering today.\n  Mr. COHEN. My colleague is correct. I have long been interested in \npromoting alternative medical treatments and I do not have any desire \nto enact a new law which might treat such providers unfairly. Could the \nSenator from Utah share with me specific concerns?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be glad to. I have concerns in four specific \nareas. First of all, would the Senator agree that the mere practice of \nunconventional or non-standard therapies would not fall within the \ndefinition of fraud? I am not asking you to amend the bill here, but \nrather to give me your assurances and the implementing agencies your \nguidance that such is the case.\n  Mr. COHEN. I agree with my colleague that the practice of alternative \nmedicine in itself would not constitute fraud.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you. My next concern relates to creation of the \nhealth care fraud and abuse data collection program. As you know, some \npeople are concerned about the very establishment at the Federal level \nof this new program. I understand those concerns, but I also am very \nsympathetic to my colleague's argument that this would be a strong \nweapon in our Federal arsenal to fight the fraud and abuse which are \ncosting our health care system so many billions of dollars each year \nand robbing us of valuable resources which would be better used for \npatient care.\n\n  The specific concern I want to raise now is that the program not \nduplicate existing data bases which already collect information about \ncredentialing, licensing, and malpractice violations against providers. \nIs that the Senator's intent?\n  Mr. COHEN. My language does not cover malpractice at all. Further, it \nis my intent that the new data collection system be coordinated with \nexisting data bases, so that there is no costly and burdensome \nduplication of effort. I have revised the language to reflect my \ncolleague's concerns in this area. The new language makes it clear that \nthere should be coordination with existing databases.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague's actions to accommodate my \nconcerns here. Turning to another concern I have with respect to \nreporting action on licensing and certification of health care \nproviders, suppliers and licensed health care practitioners, I \nunderstand that the Senator intends that the actions to be reported are \nfinal actions, after completion of due process. Is my understanding \ncorrect?\n  Mr. COHEN. That is correct. I would want to make certain that \nparticipants in the system can avail themselves of due process \nguarantees, and that only final actions be included in the new \ndatabase.\n  Mr. HATCH. The last issue I wish to raise is with respect to a data \nbase requirement of reporting providers, suppliers, and licensed health \ncare practitioners who are excluded from participation in Federal or \nState health care programs. This is my concern. Increasingly, managed \ncare organizations are excluding providers from participation solely \nbecause of economic concerns, not because of any wrong-doing or program \nviolations. For example, a physician could be excluded from a managed \ncare organization certified by the State to care for the Medicaid \npopulation solely because that provider may have ordered more services \nthan the managed care plan allows. If a provider were excluded from \nparticipation in such a plan because of such ``economic \ndecredentialing,'' could that provider be reported to the data base?\n  Mr. COHEN. That is certainly not my intent. I have revised the \nlanguage in the bill to state specifically that only exclusions for \nprogram violations are to be reported.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank Senator Cohen very much for his work in this area, \nand specifically for his efforts to clarify the bill with respect to \nthe treatment of alternative medical providers. I think that his \nchanges have improved the bill greatly. I appreciate his efforts in \nthis regard.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 4 or 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3503-6", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3569-S3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE TRAGEDY IN LEBANON\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. president, I am deeply upset by this morning's news \nfrom Lebanon. As many of my colleagues have heard, Israeli shells hit a \nUnited Nations base in the village of Cana near the city of Tyre, \nwithin which approximately 500 Lebanese civilians had taken refuge from \nthe recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. According to early \npress reports, the shelling caused the death of at least 75 Lebanese \nrefugees--and perhaps many more than that--including men, women, \nchildren, and the elderly. At least 120 have been wounded, and two \nFijian peacekeepers were killed.\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\n  Both the United Nations and Israel agree that minutes before the \nIsraeli attack, Hezbollah guerrillas had fired Katyusha rockets at \nIsrael from a position roughly 300 meters from the refugee camp. \nClearly the Israelis were responding to the Katyusha attack, and \nunintentionally hit the refugee camp. Israeli officials, including \nForeign Minister Barak, have issued assurances that Israel is not \ntargeting civilians and would not have fired intentionally on a U.N. \nbase.\n  If today's early news reports are correct, then we have witnessed a \ntragedy in the classic sense of the word--the deaths of these innocent \ncivilians need not have occurred. Hezbollah has no right to launch \nrockets in such proximity to a refugee camp, apparently hoping to use \nthe refugees as a shield against Israeli retribution. Israel, by the \nsame token, has no right to respond as it did if it had any inkling \nthat civilians would be harmed. If either party had put the best \ninterests of the refugees first, then some 75 innocent noncombatants \nwould be alive right now.\n  I do not dispute that Israel has a right to its own self-defense. I \nhave taken care not to criticize Israel for its actions in Lebanon for \nthe past 8 days because I understand well the threat that Hezbollah \nposes to Israel's security. I am keenly aware of--and condemn--\nHezbollah's actions and intentions towards Israel. There can be no \ndoubt that Hezbollah aims squarely to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and I, in fact, agree with the widely held public sentiment \nthat Israel was prodded into this latest operation in Lebanon. The \noverwhelming carnage of the past 8 days, however, compels me to call \nattention to what increasingly looks to be a disproportionate Israeli \nresponse. We cannot wring our hands about Hezbollah attacks against \ncivilians and say nothing of Israeli excesses, whether or not they were \nintentional. Human life, after all, means as much on one side of the \nborder as the other.\n  In the effort to root out Hezbollah, the Israelis appear to be \nattempting to cripple Lebanon's civilian economy and infrastructure. \nBut as it tries to turn Lebanon against Hezbollah, Israel is running \nthe risk that Lebanese Government and people will lose any stake in \nsettling their differences with Israel peacefully. I fail to see how \nsuch an outcome serves Israel's long-term interests.\n  In being critical of Israel, I do not wish to absolve the Lebanese \nGovernment or Syria of their own responsibilities. Lebanon does not \nhave the luxury of throwing up its hands and saying that it has no \ncontrol over Hezbollah, and then complaining when Israel takes matters \ninto its own hands. That is having it both ways. And I reserve special \ncriticism for Syria. Syria has both the power and the means to shut \ndown Hezbollah, but cynically lacks the will and has allowed \nHezbollah's terrorism to go unchecked.\n  President Clinton has just announced that U.S. Special Middle East \nCoordinator Dennis Ross--and subsequently Secretary of State \nChristopher--will go to the region to try to end the violence. I join \nthe President in calling for an immediate cease-fire. After today's \ntragedy, I would urge Israel--our friend, ally, and presumably the most \nadvanced democracy in the region, to show greater restraint. As the \nstronger and more enlightened party, Israel even should contemplate a \nunilateral cease-fire. I understand fully that Israel faces enormous \nsecurity risks, but its obligations to avoid miscues such as today are \nequally great.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I was not \ngoing to take the occasion today, but in light of the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island speaking on this issue, I do not take issue \nwith what he said but emphasize a very important point, from my point \nof view: this issue of sovereignty in Lebanon and whether or not there \nwas a tragic mistake made in this particular raid. I do not deny there \nwas a tragic mistake that was made.\n  I know we all know and heard that the Israeli military had no \nintention of striking the target they, in fact, struck. That happens in \nwar. But the full responsibility, in my view, falls on the Lebanese \nGovernment and the Syrian Government. How can we talk about \nsovereignty, how can we talk about the notion that you cannot violate a \nnation's borders when, in fact, one nation--and the nation in this \ncase, Lebanon--has within its borders Hezbollah that is, in fact, not \nunder its control but within its mandate, and take no action to stop \nthe action they are taking, firing Katyusha rockets into civilian \npopulations into Israel and Syria, which has control of much of that \narea, refusing to do anything to stop it, and then criticize Israel for \nacting.\n  I just ask you all, what would happen if across the Mexican border \nKatyusha rockets were being fired into El Paso, TX, on a regular basis \nand the Mexican Government did nothing whatsoever to stop the \nterrorists from that action? Is there any American who would say we \nshould withhold taking action on the grounds that we are crossing an \ninternational border? I think we would not even think twice about it.\n  I regret deeply the mistaken target that was, in fact, hit. I am \nconfident the Israelis do as well. But we should be putting \ninternational pressure on Syria and Lebanon to act and deal with the \nHezbollah operating almost in plain view across the Israeli border \nterrorizing Israeli citizens.\n\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3570-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3570-S3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n          Vote on Amendment No. 3676, As Amended, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Senate debated \nPresident Clinton's massive, 1,400-page proposal to radically \nrestructure America's health care system. After great fan fare, this \nbig-government era proposal faltered under the crushing weight of its 8 \nnew entitlements, 17 new taxes, 50 newly-minted government \nbureaucracies, 177 new State mandates, and nearly 1,000 new Federal \npowers and responsibilities.\n  Republicans promised then that we would provide the focused, \nconsumer-based health care reform plan that Americans have asked for by \nan overwhelming margin. Today, under the leadership of Senator \nKassebaum, Senator Roth, and Senator Dole, we deliver on that promise.\n  S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act, focuses on alleviating key \nburdens that restrict the ability of Americans to obtain and maintain \nhealth care coverage--a lack of portability and the barrier of \npreexisting conditions. Today when Americans change jobs or face \nlayoffs, they are at-risk of becoming uninsured or subject to \npreexisting condition exclusions. When employers are forced to \nfrequently change health care plans to control costs, employees with \nmedical conditions find themselves further exposed to coverage gaps.\n  S. 1028 presents reforms that definitively address these problems. \nThis bill limits the ability of insurers and employers to impose \npreexisting condition exclusions. It prevents insurers from dropping \ncoverage when an individual changes jobs or a family member becomes \nsick. It helps small companies gain more purchasing clout in the market \nby allowing them to voluntarily form purchasing coalitions. According \nto GAO, S. 1028's portability reforms will help 25 million Americans \neach year.\n  By alleviating job lock and providing States with greater flexibility \nto address the coverage needs of high-risk consumers, S. 1028 presents \nbroadly supported, commonsense reforms that build upon successful State \nhealth care initiatives.\n  I am proud to join with 64 of my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 1028's \nreasonable plan to promote private sector competition and market-driven \ninnovation. This proposal fulfills Americans' request 2 years ago for \nsound, focused solutions to our Nation's health care concerns.\n  S. 1028's reforms to enhance the availability of health care coverage \nis further supported by the Finance amendment's provisions to address \nthe affordability of health care insurance.\n  First, the Finance amendment increases the tax deduction for self-\nemployed who purchase health insurance by 5-percent increments from the \ncurrent 30 percent to 80 percent.\n  Second, it provides tax exemptions to State-sponsored risk pools \nwhich help bring down the cost of health insurance for businesses and \nhigh-risk individuals.\n  I am particularly supportive of the long-term care provisions \nincluded in the Finance package. The ability to access quality, private \nlong-term care insurance plans is pivotal to families facing the \nemotional and financial challenges of long-term care.\n  Traditionally, a family member, most likely a wife or daughter, has \ncared for an ailing spouse or parent at home. However, today's \npressures of work, child-rearing, and family mobility greatly restrict \nthe ability of adult children to administer to the day-to-day needs of \na chronically ill parent. In addition, the rigors of home-based care \ncan have a debilitating impact on the health and well-being of a caring \nspouse.\n  As America's population ages, the need for long-term care increases. \nIn 1993, almost 33 million Americans were over the age of 65, and by \n2011, the elderly population is estimated to number close to 40 \nmillion. While the opportunity for a happy and healthy retirement is \nbetter than ever, an October 1995 long-term care survey by Harvard/\nHarris revealed that one in five Americans over age 50 is at high risk \nof needing long-term care during the next 12 months.\n  Today, a variety of long-term care services are available, from help \nin cleaning one's home and getting groceries to skilled nursing care \nwith 24-hour supervision. However, the means to pay for long-term care \nare still very limited and the expense can be overwhelming. For \nexample, $59 billion was spent on nursing home care for the elderly in \n1993, and 90 percent was covered by out-of-pocket payments and \nMedicaid.\n  The cost of paying out-of-pocket for 1 year in a nursing home is more \nthan triple a senior's average annual income. Long-term care expenses \nput a lifetime of work and investment at risk. To gain Medicaid \ncoverage, seniors must ``spend down'' their assets in order to meet \nState eligibility requirements. While Medicare takes care of hospital \ncosts and home care, it provides only limited coverage for short-term \nstays in skilled nursing facilities.\n  The medical side of long-term care has seen enormous advances over \nthe years in new technologies, facilities, treatment methods, and even \npsychological studies of the effects of long-term care on patients. But \nthe financing side of long-term care has simply failed to keep up, and \nas a result it is ill-prepared for seniors' future needs. Today, \nprivate insurance pays for less than 2 percent of long-term care costs. \nAs Federal mandates for Medicaid coverage have increased, States have \nattempted to contain costs by restricting services for the elderly. \nState-imposed caps on the number of Medicaid-sponsored nursing home \nbeds has separated families from their loved ones because the only \nMedicaid beds available were hundreds of miles away from their \ncommunity. Most disturbingly, the remaining assets of a deceased \nelderly couple can be tapped through an estate recovery action to \ncompensate the State for the couple's Medicaid expenses.\n  Since 1990, Medicaid expenditures for long-term care have been \nincreasing by almost 15 percent annually, causing costs to double every \n5 years. Medicaid's service as the sole long-term care safety net for \nmiddle class seniors may seriously impair the program's ability to \nserve the underprivileged. While low-income families accounted for 73 \npercent of Medicaid's beneficiaries in 1993, nearly 60 percent of \nexpenditures went to nursing home care and other long-term care \nservices. For example, in 1993, Kentucky's Medicaid spending per \nenrollee for children was $964; while the cost for elderly \nbeneficiaries was $6,540. Without relief, a harsh battle between \ngenerations may emerge.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that my work with Senator Roth has \nproduced a sound plan in response to this critical health care need. \nThe Finance amendment includes several reforms which I supported \nthrough my own long-term care bill: providing long-term care insurance \nwith the same favorable tax treatment now available to medical \ninsurance; allowing tax-free withdrawals from life insurance policies \nfor terminally and chronically ill patients; and establishing sound \nconsumer protections.\n  Private long-term care insurance translates into quality, flexible \ncare for seniors, more Medicaid funds for low-income families and the \ndisabled, and essential support for families who want their loved ones \nto be safe and secure. These are priorities that all members of \nCongress share. We should not miss this opportunity to help America's \nfamilies prepare for the challenges of long-term care.\n  I regret that the Senate was unsuccessful in retaining Finance's \nproposal to provide Americans with the choice of Medical Savings \nAccounts, better known as MSAs. Today, we have witnessed a full-court \npress against MSAs by those who favor greater government management of \nhealth care rather than the expansion of private-sector health care \nchoice. They raise the specter of how MSAs would wreck havoc across our \nNation's health care system, and present the threat of a Presidential \nveto of any health care bill that contains MSAs.\n  Mr. President, I find this attitude starkly contrasts the promotion \nof MSAs by the Democratic leadership just a few years ago. In 1992, \nSenator Daschle viewed MSAs as a means to effectively control medical \nspending by allowing employers to provide their employees with an \nannual allowance through a MSA to pay for their routine health care \nneeds. During the 1994 consideration of the Clinton health care plan, \nRepresentative Gephardt offered a MSA plan in his leadership proposal, \nand all but one Democratic member of the House Ways and Means Committee \nsupported it.\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\n  Just last week, President Clinton called for an expanded use of \nretirement accounts to pay for certain health care expenses. \nIronically, Democratic members tell us today that the President firmly \nrejects the specific establishment of a medical account to pay for \nhealth care costs.\n  This inconsistent rhetoric blurs the potential benefits of a MSA \noption. In 17 states, 3,000 businesses as well as state and local \ngovernments are using MSAs. Based on a recent survey by Blue Cross/Blue \nShield, 67 percent of employers surveyed were interested in MSAs. For \nemployers who can not afford conventional coverage, and particularly \nfor lower income workers, MSAs offer an affordable option to securing \nmuch-needed health care insurance.\n  As the House health care bill contains MSAs, it is my hope that this \nprovision will be included in the conference committee's final \nlegislative proposal for health care reform.\n  Mr. President, in sum, S. 1028 and the reforms included in the \nFinance amendment provide sensible, fundamental solutions to America's \nhealth care concerns. President Clinton has promised that ``the Era of \nBig Government is over.'' In fulfillment of his promise, the President \nshould support S. 1028's effort to provide health care security through \ngreater consumer choice, not greater Federal regulation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a little after 5 now. We started \noff early today at 9:30. We had a number of speeches, a good debate, \nand, I think, we had two enormously significant votes here which, I \nbelieve, open up the way for an early conference. Hopefully, if our \ngood friends in the House view the medical savings accounts the way it \nwas reflected here in the Senate, we can have this bill on the \nPresident's desk in very short order.\n  The leaders have instructed that we will stay here through this \nevening. We want to deal with these various measures. Earlier today, we \nasked Members, if they had amendments, to come up and see us. We are \nworking through some, which are effectively universally accepted. We \nwill try and make sure they are. If they are controversial and not \nunanimously supported, we will resist them. We want to try to move this \nalong.\n  We have had a good day. We still have some outstanding amendments, \nbut there is no reason we cannot finish this by 8 or 9 o'clock this \nevening. So we hope the Members who have amendments will come in now. \nThere are some people that will just wait and see. But Senator \nKassebaum and I are committed to trying to get this finished up in \nshort order. We will ask those that planned to offer their amendments, \nif they would, to contact us right away. Otherwise, we will move to \nthird reading.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate and underscore what the \nSenator from Massachusetts just stated. We want to complete action on \nthis bill. If we do, we will not have votes tomorrow. We may have \ndebate on term limits, but no votes. We need to complete this to keep \non schedule here. We still have to go back and finish illegal \nimmigration. We have a day or two to make up there. Maybe we can do \nthat next week, and, if not, the following week.\n  I hope anybody who has amendments will come to the floor. I know the \nSenator from North Dakota wishes to speak. That will be 15 minutes. So \nanybody that has an amendment, if you can be on the floor at, say, \n5:30, it would be helpful to the managers.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to talk about a needed addition to \nthe Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation.\n  If you are an employee of a Fortune 500 company, you will probably \nmake out okay under Kennedy-Kassebaum. If you are a union member, \nyou'll definitely come out ahead.\n  But there is not enough in Kennedy-Kassebaum to address the needs of \nworking families and small businesses. How can you have health care \nportability when you cannot afford health care, like many small \nbusinesses cannot afford to provide for their employees?\n  In the House-passed health portability bill, there was a pro-small \nbusiness provision that I think we should include in any bill sent to \nthe President.\n  The provision, which the House called the Health Coverage \nAvailability and Affordability Act of 1996, clarifies existing law. It \nallows small employers to join together to purchase health insurance \nfor their employees. This act also included provisions allowing \nindividuals to open medical savings accounts--something I support.\n  But let me dwell on the small-business pooling aspect of this act. \nRight now, before we pass any bill in this Chamber, certain groups can \npool their resources to buy lower cost insurance for their members or \nemployees. These certain groups are large corporations and unions. For \nyears, these groups could bargain for lower prices with insurers. If \nyou are bigger, you can dictate better terms. That is just economics.\n  Unions and big business also could exempt themselves from burdensome \nState regulations. Each State has a different list of benefits that \ninsurers usually must pay for.\n  Back in 1974, there were only 158 State-mandated benefits. Now, there \nare over 1,000 State-mandated benefits that insurers usually must \ncover. Some benefits covered in various States included massage \ntherapy, acupuncture, hairpieces--and there are more exotic treatments. \nMany of these mandates are expensive. No wonder health costs are going \nup each year.\n  I said that insurers usually must cover these benefits. Under the \nFederal ERISA law, unions and large corporations are exempted from some \nState rules, and can set their own benefits. They also have less \npaperwork--complying with one general standard as opposed to 50 \ndifferent State standards saves a lot of trees.\n  So we see that unions and big business have it easy when it comes to \ncovering their members or workers. What about the small businessperson?\n  Well, the self-employed or small business owner does not have the \nbargaining power of a large corporation or union. They do not qualify \nfor ERISA exemption. They have to comply fully with State regulations.\n  So, says the National Federation of Independent Businesses, small \nbusinesses' premiums are 30 percent higher than large corporations due \nto State mandates. Also, small businesses pay 30 percent more for \nsimilar benefits than larger corporations.\n  We talk a lot about the uninsured in this body. The Kennedy-Kassebaum \nbill is one way of addressing part of the problem. A large source of \nuninsured Americans though, is the inequity between small businesses \nand large businesses and unions. Kennedy-Kassebaum does not adequately \naddress this issue.\n  Any final bill should include what the House did, and allow small \nbusinesses to form groups to purchase full health coverage or cover \ntheir employees under self-insured health plans. Allowing small \ncompanies to join together would give them bargaining powers similar to \nbig businesses or unions. They would be exempt from certain burdensome \nState mandates.\n  Also, the House proposal allows States that allow small employers \naccess to the small group market to opt out of the bill. The House bill \nbalances the need for uniformity of laws across States, while \nmaintaining States' rights.\n  The House bill is a good bill, and would have an immediate effect.\n  About 85 percent of the 40 million uninsured are in families with at \nleast one employed worker, many of whom work for small businesses. That \nis a lot of people who could be covered if we changed the rules.\n  The National Center for Policy Analysis says that one in five small \ncompanies that do not now offer health insurance would do so if they \ncould get free of heavy State mandates.\n  If these companies could have the same opportunity as big companies \nand unions, 6.3 million people would have access to health care. \nImmediately, you would take care of almost 16 percent of the uninsured \nin America. Others say 50 percent of the uninsured could probably have \naccess to health care.\n  Whatever the number, we can take a substantial leap toward providing \nhealth care for all Americans--all without new taxes or unfunded \nmandates.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this is a good idea. Mr. President, \nI will soon submit for the Record two letters to the House leadership \nfrom the National Association of Manufacturers\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nand the National Restaurant Association in support of the House bill.\n  Also, the chamber of commerce, National Association of Independent \nBusinesses, National Retail Federation, and other groups supported the \nbill I have been talking about here.\n  So there is much support for this, and I hope at least in conference \nwe can look at this issue, and provide some relief for small business \nand the self-employed. I personally believe that we have been unfair to \nthe job creators and those who want to be their own boss.\n  Right now, self-employed people can only deduct 30 percent of their \nhealth care costs. Big businesses and unions can deduct 100 percent. \nThis year, Congress passed a bill that would have raised this 30 to 50 \npercent. Guess what? The President vetoed it! Is this fair? Is this \npro-business? Is the President for entrepreneurship in this country?\n  I think it is high time that the President signs the bill he vetoed, \nand we should eventually pass the House bill that expands health care \nfor Americans who work for small businesses.\n  The large companies and the unions have had the benefits and \nadvantages for too long. If they can do it, a small businessman in \nPascagoula should be able to cover his family and employees.\n  Let us help small business in this chamber. Remember them in this \ndebate we are having about health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I mentioned be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 1996.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Chief Deputy Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Hastert: I am delighted to hear that \n     the House Republican leadership has put together a package of \n     realistic and achievable health care reforms and will pursue \n     them as part of the 1996 legislative agenda. It is my \n     understanding that these reforms include:\n       Portability reforms to ensure that employees won't be \n     denied health coverage if they change or lose their jobs;\n       Medical malpractice reforms so that valuable dollars \n     intended for health care won't be wasted on frivolous \n     litigation;\n       Increased health insurance deductibility for the self-\n     employed to further mitigate unfair differences based solely \n     on the form of doing business;\n       Reforms to facilitate small group pooling and thereby \n     improve both affordability and access for small businesses;\n       Medical savings account provisions to further improve both \n     choice and affordability for all Americans; and\n       Accountability provisions to curb fraud and abuse, leading \n     to lower costs throughout the system.\n       These are all provisions which NAM has supported in the \n     past and continues to support. In our view, this kind of \n     targeted, incremental approach, which retains the private, \n     voluntary health system while improving and strengthening it, \n     is exactly the right approach. The NAM is therefore pleased \n     both to endorse and to enthusiastically support your plan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jerry Jasinowski,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               National Restaurant\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 739,000 foodservice units nationwide, we \n     urge you to support H.R. 3103, the Health Coverage \n     Availability and Affordability Act.\n       As you may know, our industry has been working to enact \n     healthcare reform legislation for years. Our research \n     continues to demonstrate that the basic reason why employers \n     and individuals do not purchase health insurance is because \n     of the cost. This legislation takes a major step forward by \n     eliminating some of the barriers that prevent people from \n     purchasing health insurance, while at the same time helps \n     keep down the cost.\n       The restaurant industry is dominated by small businesses. \n     More than four out of ten eating and drinking places are sole \n     proprietorships or partnerships. Nine out of ten eating and \n     drinking places have less than 50 paid employees. Seventy-two \n     percent of eating and drinking places have sales of $500,000 \n     a year or less. While many would like to offer their \n     employees health benefits, the cost has proven to be \n     prohibitive.\n       In addition to addressing key concerns about portability \n     and preexisting condition limitations, H.R. 3070 would \n     increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-\n     employed from 30 percent to 50 percent. For small businessmen \n     and women--and their families--deductiblity of health \n     insurance premiums is a must. Other important components of \n     the legislation tackle medical malpractice reform, fraud and \n     abuse and administrative simplification. Also, this \n     legislation will allow small businesses to form voluntary \n     purchasing pools which would help level the playing field by \n     giving them some of the negotiating tools of large businesses \n     and reducing the cost of providing coverage.\n       The National Restaurant Association is strongly opposed to \n     any amendment that would raise the cost of health coverage \n     with federal mandates or by expanding COBRA coverage. If \n     employers cannot control the costs of their own health care \n     plans because Congress mandates certain types of coverage, \n     employers will be forced to drop their coverage altogether.\n       We urge you to support H.R. 3103, the Health Coverage \n     Availability and Affordability Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elaine Z. Graham,\n       Senior Director, Government Affairs.\n     Christina M. Howard,\n       Legislative Representative.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had an amendment that I drafted, which I \nwill not offer at this time for a variety of reasons. I do want to move \nthis legislation along. But in the House-passed bill, there was a pro-\nsmall-business provision, and I think we should include that in any \nbill that we send to the President. The provision, which the House \ncalled the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, \nclarifies existing law. It allows small business employers to join \ntogether to purchase health insurance for their employees.\n  This act also included provisions allowing individuals to open the \nmedical savings accounts that we have already dealt with this \nafternoon. I really do think there is a real justification for small \nbusinesses to be able to join pools and provide coverage for their \nworkers. That could be a pool through the Restaurant Association, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, or within their own \ncorporation.\n  I realize that it is not as simple as it sounds, but it is something \nthat should be done. I think it would help a lot of people now that \nwork for small businesses--particularly fast food services--be able to \nget access to insurance through these pools.\n  So I will be working with the conferees to try to get them to take a \nlook at this and see if we cannot perhaps perfect some of the language \nthat was in the House bill and allow this coverage to be available.\n  I know of many instances where people are working for hamburger \nplaces or pizza places, where most employees have no coverage. They \ncannot afford it, and the employer cannot provide it. This would give \nthem a way to get it through pools.\n  I hope we will look at this approach in the conference, since it is \nin the House bill. If we cannot work it out there, let us see if we \ncannot find an opportunity to give serious consideration to this at the \nearliest opportunity.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have some provisions in here to \nencourage pooling among small businesses. We would be glad to work with \nthe Senator from Mississippi in reviewing that language, since the \nHouse has similar language, to find out how we may be able to make that \nmore effective. And we will certainly be glad to visit with him prior \nto the time of the conference and see if we cannot find ways of making \nit more effective. He has identified a very important problem and \nchallenge, and we attempted to make some important, modest steps, but \nvery important steps, I think, to encourage this kind of activity and \nprograms. He has additional ideas, and we look forward to talking with \nhim.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. I will be glad to work with him on \nthis issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3678\n\n  (Purpose: To provide equitable relief for the generic drug industry)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3678.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . EQUITABLE TREATMENT FOR THE GENERIC DRUG INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the generic drug industry should be provided equitable \n     relief in the same manner as other industries are provided \n     with such relief under the patent transitional provisions of \n     section 154(c) of title 35, United States Code, as amended by \n     section 532 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 \n     (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4983).\n       (b) Approval of Applications of Generic Drugs.--For \n     purposes of acceptance and consideration by the Secretary of \n     an application under subsections (b), (c), and (j) of section \n     505, and subsections (b), (c), and (n) of section 512, of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355 (b), (c), \n     and (j), and 360b (b), (c), and (n)), the expiration date of \n     a patent that is the subject of a certification under section \n     505(b)(2)(A) (ii), (iii), or (iv), section 505(j)((2)(A)(vii) \n     (II), (III), (IV), or section 512(n)(1)(H) (ii), (iii), or \n     (iv) of such Act, respectively, made in an application \n     submitted prior to June 8, 1995, shall be deemed to be the \n     date on which such patent would have expired under the law in \n     effect on the day preceding December 8, 1994.\n       (c) Marketing Generic Drugs.--The remedies of section \n     271(e)(4) of title 35, United States Code, shall not apply to \n     acts--\n       (1) that were commenced, or for which a substantial \n     investment was made prior to June 8, 1995; and\n       (2) that became infringing by reason of section 154(c)(1) \n     of such title, as amended by section 532 of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4983).\n       (d) Substantial Investment.--For purposes of this Act and \n     section 154(c)(2)(A) of title 35, United States Code, with \n     respect to a product that is subject to the requirements of \n     subsections (b)(2) or (j) of section 505, or of subsections \n     (b)(2) and (n) of section 512, of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2) and (j), and 360(b)(2) and \n     (n), the submission of an application described in subsection \n     (b), and only the submission of such an application, shall \n     constitute substantial investment.\n       (e) Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Unless the notice required by this \n     subsection has previously been provided, when an applicant \n     submitting an application described in subsection (b) \n     receives notice from the Secretary that the application has \n     been tentatively approved, such applicant shall give notice \n     of such application to--\n       (A) each owner of the patent which is the subject of the \n     certification or the representative of such owner designated \n     to receive such notice; and\n       (B) the holder of the approved application under section \n     505(b) or section 512(c)(1), respectively, for the drug which \n     is claimed by the patent or a use of which is claimed by the \n     patent or the representative of such holder designated to \n     receive such notice.\n       (2) Certification of notice.--The applicant shall certify \n     to the Secretary the date that such notice is given. The \n     approval of such application by the Secretary shall not be \n     made effective until 7 calendar days after the date so \n     certified by such applicant.\n       (f) Equitable Remuneration.--For acts described in \n     subsection (c), equitable remuneration of the type described \n     in section 154(c)(3) of title 35, United States Code, as \n     amended by section 532 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n     (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4983) shall be awarded to a \n     patentee only if there has been--\n       (1) the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or \n     sale, within the United States of an approved drug that is \n     the subject of an application described in subsection (b); or\n       (2) the importation by the applicant into the United States \n     of an approved drug or of active ingredient used in an \n     approved drug that is the subject of an application described \n     in subsection (b).\n       (g) Applicability.--The provisions of this section shall \n     govern the approval or effective date of approval of all \n     pending applications that have not received final approval as \n     of the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is not a new subject for Members of \nCongress. This is one we have considered before. I will make my remarks \nvery succinct. I know other Members are waiting to speak.\n  What this does is complete our consideration of GATT. In the GATT \nagreements, the provisions with regard to exclusive use of drugs was \nextended. But the GATT provided specifically for exceptions where \npeople have made substantial investments in generic drugs. This goes \nalong with the language in the GATT agreement. It puts us in conformity \nwith what other countries are considering. It allows us to provide the \noriginal length of protection that was planned for drugs.\n  Without action on this amendment, what we stand to have is American \nconsumers lose roughly $5 million a day. The impact on U.S. consumers \nis roughly $5 million. Every day we delay enacting this means a day in \nwhich consumers are denied generic drug alternatives, which can save \nthem $5 million a day. We have already delayed to a point where, by the \nend of this month, U.S. consumers will have lost over $700 million, and \nthe price tag rises dramatically.\n  A bill we had up in committee was put off. It is, thus, imperative \nthat we offer this on this vehicle. It is an enormous savings to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Mr. President, it is fairness because it gives drug companies the \nsame protection for which they planned on all along. But it does not \ngive them a windfall, or more than what was planned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased and honored to join with my friend \nfrom Colorado, Senator Brown, in the introduction of this amendment. \nThis is the so-called GATT Glaxo amendment. The issue has been \npresented here on the floor. In fact, this is a simple way of \ncorrecting a major mistake that Congress made in adopting the GATT \nTreaty. It was an oversight. It has been testified to time and time \nagain by Mickey Kantor--our then U.S. Trade Representative who \nnegotiated this particular treaty--that it was a mistake, and that it \nneeds to be corrected. The Patent Office said it was a mistake, and all \nup and down the line people agree that this was an enormous mistake \nthat we need to correct at this time.\n  The first time we brought this issue to a vote on the floor was \nDecember 7, 1995. On that particular vote, the vote cast in the Senate \nwas 48 to 49. There was one abstention. There was one absent Senator. \nAnd since that day, since that particular delay, I think it might be \ninteresting to note that very few--a handful of drug companies--Glaxo \nspecifically, have made a profit, or a gross income, because of this \nvariation in the GATT Treaty giving a particular exception, a \nparticular benefit, to a handful of drug companies. There has been an \nextra $5 million per day in income to these companies. Since December \n7, 1995, we have seen an income of $665 million extra to these drug \ncompanies that is being paid out of the pockets of the consumers \nespecially for drugs such as Zantac; $665 million--a windfall profit \ngift that we have given to these particular companies, and especially \nto a company called Glaxo.\n  We also note that Senator Hatch wrote a letter to us, the sponsors of \nthis amendment, on December 13. He said he promised hearings on \nFebruary 27, 1996. So we waited and waited and waited around for that \nhearing. According to his promise, the distinguished chairman, Senator \nHatch, held a hearing. By that time another $310 million had been given \nto the drug companies in a windfall profit situation.\n  We waited another month--until March 28, 1996. The Judiciary markup \nwas scheduled, and it was abruptly canceled. So once again there was a \ndelay.\n\n  This morning, on April 18, 1996, another Judiciary markup on S. 1277 \nto correct this egregious error in GATT was held. And, when the \nSenators arrived at the markup, it was noted that a Senator had put a \nhold on the markup, that there would be no actual vote on S. 1277. And, \ntherefore, Mr. President, another $665 million in profits for a very \nfew drug companies.\n  Now it is noted that the chairman this morning stated that if \npossible we will have a hearing in the Judiciary Committee next week on \nthe 25th of April, and possibly we could mark this bill up, S. 1277.\n  But in the meantime, Mr. President, the clock is running. We feel \nthat this is a health bill, that this is the proper way to bring this \nbill to the attention of our colleagues, and it is the proper measure \nto attach this correction to the GATT Treaty.\n  We hope that our colleagues will support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, although I understand that the Senator from \nColorado plans to withdraw his amendment, I want to take this \nopportunity to express my opposition to both the Brown/Pryor/Chafee \namendment and the idea that it should be included as part of the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform measure.\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\n  I said it on December 7, and I say it today: ``Here we go again.''\n  Four months ago, we considered the Pryor language in this chamber. \nThat time, it was an amendment to the partial birth abortion ban bill \nthe President just vetoed. We agreed then, by a vote of this body, that \nthe Judiciary Committee should hold hearings on the issue.\n  On December 13, I sent a letter to Senators Pryor, Brown, and Chafee, \nand I made a commitment to hold a hearing on February 27 and a markup \nby the end of March.\n  In fact, the committee did hold the hearing on February 27, as I \npromised. I agreed to hold a markup the week of March 25, but had to \ndelay that because of lengthy committee consideration of the \nimmigration bills. I rescheduled the markup at the first opportunity. \nIn fact, it was to have been today, but as my colleague may have heard, \nwe did not get a quorum.\n  I still intend to press forward expeditiously for consideration of \nthis issue in the committee. It will be on the agenda for the next \nmarkup and that is my commitment.\n  I find it ironic that proponents of this amendment are using the same \ntimetable as I. There is no disagreement here. The process is moving \nforward.\n  In sum, I have lived up to my word.\n  As a matter of fact, I have bent over backwards to accommodate the \ninterests of this body in a full and fair examination of the issue.\n  We had 10 witnesses at the February 27 hearing, 5 on each side. It \nwas a good session, one during which I believe we all learned a lot.\n  I plan to go ahead with the markup. We will try to work out a \nresolution. I hope we will be able to. I don't think that the Brown \namendment today meets that test.\n  The GATT/pharmaceutical patent issue is unquestionably one of the \nmost complicated we have seen, as it involves the confluence of patent \nlaw, trade policy and food and drug law and regulations.\n  Its resolution has potentially enormous consequences, both on the \nfuture of biomedical research in this country and on the ability of \nconsumers to have access to the most safe, effective, and low cost \ndrugs possible.\n  The proponents of this amendment argued today, as they have in the \npast, that this is a case of Congress making a simple mistake and that \nnow we should act to fix this mistake by adopting this technical \nmistake.\n  This is the type of argument that is often made when this body acts \nthrough unanimous consent.\n  I wonder how many times we have debated a purported technical \ncorrections bill for 3 hours--as we did on December 7--then split \nalmost down the middle on a 49-48 vote that cut across party lines.\n  There is no foundation for the argument that this is a simple \nperfecting amendment that would achieve a result which is clearly \nintended by Congress.\n  Again today we heard the now familiar litany on the issue of intent. \nWe heard about Ambassador Kantor, FDA Deputy Commissioner Bill Schultz, \nand all the other Administration representatives who attend the school \nof revisionist history on this issue.\n  What has become apparent to me during this debate, a fact which has \nnot been revealed today by any of my colleagues, is that the argument \non intent has been rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit, which could find no definitive evidence of intent.\n  In the November, 1995 Royce decision, the Federal Circuit stated:\n\n       The parties have not pointed to, and we have not \n     discovered, any legislative history on the intent of \n     Congress, at the time of passage of the URAA, regarding the \n     interplay between the URAA and the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n\n  Perhaps some day my colleagues can explain why it is that the Federal \nCircuit, a neutral judicial tribunal, is having so much trouble finding \nany evidence on the question of intent, a question that seems to lie at \nthe center of this debate.\n  Perhaps some day my colleagues can explain why, in their quest to \n``level the playing field,'' they have created a special benefit for \none industry. I challenge them to identify any industry that has \nattempted, let alone succeeded, to use the GATT transition rules to \nreach the market prior to expiration of the newly extended patents. It \njust hasn't happened, and it probably will not unless anyone can \nidentify acts that would not have been infringing before we enacted the \nURAA that continued and became infringing after the URAA was enacted.\n  It is curious to me that a lawyer for the generic drug industry would \nargue to the Supreme Court that ``the most obvious intended beneficiary \nof this statutory licensing system was the generic drug industry . . . \nIn fact, since the adoption of TRIPS and the URAA, no industry other \nthan the generic drug industry has emerged as being potentially \naffected by the equitable remuneration system.''\n  I will not prolong my remarks today. I look forward to exploring \nthese and other issues in much greater detail at the markup.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate my strong opposition to the \namendment, and my disappointment that we are considering it here today \nprior to the Judiciary Committee's scheduled markup.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I request to be able to use the 15 minutes \nthat I am allotted under the former UC that was decided by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3570-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3575-S3577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MINIMUM WAGE AND SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to yield some of that time to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, everyone has a right to characterize or \nmischaracterize the activities of the Senate. A colleague of mine \nduring the previous debate on the motion to strike came to the floor \nand in that debate characterized the series of things that had happened \nearlier this week--or rather mischaracterized them--and described the \ncertain circumstances as highly partisan, just politics, and so on.\n  I felt it necessary that I correct the Record and not allow this \nmoment to pass without responding. I want everyone to understand that \nthere are times here in the Chamber when amendments are offered that it \nis not convenient for people, amendments are offered that just are \nuncomfortable for people. But the way the system works here is \nsometimes you do not have an opportunity to offer an amendment except \nin the certain circumstance, and then you must offer it, or you are \nnever going to have a chance to have the Senate consider it.\n  We had a circumstance earlier this week where a bill was brought to \nthe floor of the Senate. Senator Kennedy, I, and some others were \nintending to offer an amendment. Senator Kennedy was going to offer an \namendment on the minimum wage, which I support. That is inconvenient \nfor some people. They do not want to debate the minimum wage. Some in \nthis Chamber say we do not want to deal with the minimum wage issue. \nSome of us do. Some of us think when you have gone 6 years without a \nchange in the minimum wage that at least those on the lower rung of the \nladder have lost one-half dollar of their purchasing power from the \nminimum wage, and maybe people in this Chamber ought to care a little \nabout that. I know there are no high-paid lobbyists out beyond this \nChamber saying, ``Yes, we care about the people at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder.'' If we are working on issues that dealt with the \npeople at the top of the ladder, you can bet the halls would be full of \nhigh-paid lobbyists. But not for the minimum wage.\n\n  Some of us insist that these are issues that we ought to be debating.\n  Is it partisan? No. It is public policy.\n  The second issue which I introduced as an amendment on Monday dealt \nwith the Social Security issue. It is mischaracterized as totally \npartisan, irrelevant, and a troublemaking amendment.\n  Let me describe what this issue is. Let me go back to 1983. In 1983 \nthis Congress passed the Social Security Reform Act. I know that \nbecause I helped write it. I was a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the U.S. House. If anybody wants to go back to the record \nof the markup, you will find that I offered the amendment in 1983 \nduring the markup that said let us not\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\nuse the Social Security revenues we are going to begin to save to meet \nour needs when the baby boomers retire. Let us not use them as other \noperating revenues. Let us truly save them. So let us create a \nfirewall. Let us prevent people from misusing, or taking, the Social \nSecurity trust funds and using them for other purposes. In 1983 I \noffered that amendment. It was defeated in the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  I have tried since repeatedly. The Senator from South Carolina has \ntried, and in some cases successfully. The fact is we have a law that \nprevents the Social Security funds from being misused for other \npurposes, and the law is ignored.\n  My intention was to bring to the floor on Monday an amendment that I \noffered that angered some people, an amendment that said, if we are \ngoing to consider a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nwhich the majority leader said he will require us to do under \nreconsideration, a procedure that will allow no amendments and no \ndebate--if we are going to do that--I said let us have the Senate vote \non a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to create a firewall between the \nSocial Security trust funds and other revenues because, if we do not do \nthat, what will happen is $600 to $800 billion of Social Security trust \nfunds will be misused. That is not trivial, and is not partisan. It is \npolicy.\n  I understand that for some it is a nuisance. For some it is \ninconvenient. For some it is troublesome to have to deal with this.\n  So the result was people got in a pique and decide to put the Senate \ninto a recess so one person or another cannot speak. It is not the way \nthis place works.\n  We will vote on that sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We did not on \nMonday. But we will vote on it. We have the right to offer it, and we \nhave the right to insist on a vote on it.\n  The same will be true with minimum wage, and the same will be true \nwith several other issues that we think are important matters of \npolicy. This is not about individuals on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for a moment, will \nthose Members in the Senate who are having discussions please retire to \nthe Cloakroom, and members of staff as well?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish, and then I will yield to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina under the 15 minutes.\n  My only point is this: I respect any Member who stands up and \nascribes motives to others, but if they are motives that, in my \njudgment, do not comport with what we are trying to do, then I think we \nhave a right to say that is not the case.\n  With respect to Social Security, Social Security is going to have \nproblems beginning in the year 2018. That is the point at which the \nsurplus discontinues accumulating. From 2019 down to 2029 or so we run \nout of surplus. The fact is in order to accumulate that surplus, we \nmust set the surplus trust funds aside.\n  That is what the Senator from South Carolina and I have been trying \nto do for a long while. I encourage those who wonder about motives to \ngo back to 1983 and the Ways and Means records and see who was making \nthose motions 13 years ago on this very issue, and then call them \npolitical today, if you will. But you are wrong.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has been on this floor many times and \nI have been on the Senate floor and the House floor many times in the \nlast 13 years on this subject, and I will continue to do so. It might \nbe inconvenient to have offered the sense-of-the-Senate resolution last \nMonday, but we will vote on it at some point. I said then I would agree \nto a 20-minute time limit; it does not matter to me. I just want this \nSenate to go on record on those issues. Maybe that is partisan in the \nminds of some. To me it is a very important public policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota. We have been working in the vineyards together in trying \nto end the practice of applying Social Security surpluses toward the \ndeficit. Everyone is interested in balancing the budget. But what \nhappens in all of these budgets, both the Republican and the \nadministration budgets, is that they use Social Security trust funds to \nobscure the size of the deficit.\n  This minute, we owe $502 billion to Social Security. Over the next 6 \nyears, we will borrow another $600 billion from that trust fund. So \neven if we succeed in enacting these so-called balanced budget plans, \nby 2002 we will have destroyed the Social Security program; we will owe \nSocial Security over $1 trillion. No one is going to raise taxes some \n$1 trillion to make good on the Social Security trust fund.\n  The time to stop that nonsense is here and now. In order to do so, 98 \nSenators in this Chamber, as the Senator from North Dakota stated, \nvoted for the Heinz-Hollings-Moynihan amendment on October 18, 1990. \nPresident George Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed section 13301 of the \nBudget Enforcement Act into law.\n  Republicans charge that offering the Dorgan amendment is delaying \naction on the immigration bill. But what is good for the goose is good \nfor the gander. On yesterday afternoon, in the middle of the terrorism \nbill, the distinguished majority leader saw fit to come to the floor to \ntalk about balancing the budget through spectrum auctions. Fine. That \nis his privilege and no one disrespects it. But we should not cry foul \nwhen other members talk about Social Security and balancing the budget.\n  The truth of the matter is that we are in a Catch-22. This Senator \nhas produced balanced budgets. I had a AAA credit rating as the South \nCarolina's Governor. I voted for a balanced budget in 1968-69. Since \nthat time, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I have proposed \nfreezes, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and, yes, tax increases to try and \nbalance the budget. So this is not a casual political maneuver to get \nhigh ground in any political campaign. It is done in an attempt to get \nus to keep our word--to not use Social Security trust funds in \ncalculating the deficit. We cannot keep it when the leadership, in \nconsidering the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which \nthis Senator has voted for already three times----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, let the Chair try \nto get order in the Senate. If those Members who are having \ndiscussions, please, could retire to the cloakroom. The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  I voted for a balanced budget. I wish to vote for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. But I will not vote to repeal the \nfirewall that we have in the law for the Social Security trust fund. \nLet us have really truth in budgeting.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from North Dakota in bringing his \namendment up in this particular fashion. It is unfortunate that we had \nno other option. We are not trying to delay the immigration bill. I \ncommend the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Massachusetts on \ntheir leadership on immigration. I am ready to vote for their bill. We \nare ready to agree to a time agreement. But we want to vote on this \nissue to really fix into the conscience of the body that when we say it \nis a trust fund, we mean to protect it and not dip into those \nsurpluses. That is what the chairman of the Budget Committee on the \nHouse side said they did last evening. They dipped once again into our \nchildren's piggy bank.\n  That piggy bank is there to protect retirement. Senator Thurmond and \nI, we are going to get ours. In fact, we are getting ours now. But I \ncan see some young folks around here; when their time comes, they are \nnever going to be able to receive it. Why? Because we have got this \nnonsense about a unified budget.\n  Here is the budget law. If you can find the word unified in there, \nI'll jump off the Capitol dome. There is no such thing as a unified \nbudget in the budget law, but the administration goes along with it; \nthe Congress goes along with it. They violate the law. Let us join with \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota and stop violating the law.\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just going to take one moment and then yield the \nfloor. We have a measure that is before us, and I see the Senator from \nVermont, who has an amendment, who had spoken to us earlier today and \nis waiting to move towards that amendment.\n  We are going to, in just a few moments, ask unanimous consent to \nfinalize the list of amendments. We have been able to work through many \nof them. So we are expecting probably some votes that will be \ncontinuing along until we are able to hopefully get this concluded. We \ncan do that in a period of time, but I hope that our membership will \nnot be coming to us at 7, 7:15 asking for windows and other kinds of \nthings, because we were able to really move this and follow the \nadmonition of both the majority and minority leaders. So we are going \nto ask for a consent that we have received all the amendments in just a \nfew moments. So if any of the Members are interested, this is really \nthe last call.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3575-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3577-S3578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGETS AND SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I just want to speak for a few moments on \nthis issue of Social Security and balanced budgets. I have the greatest \nrespect for Senator Fritz Hollings and my colleague Senator Kent \nConrad, who sits there, and his friend and mine Byron Dorgan. They are \na very remarkable duo from North Dakota, and they have been working \nhard on this issue a good long while, and so has my old friend Senator \nHollings.\n  If we are going to debate this issue of Social Security, we are going \nto have to deal with reality. The reality has come to me and should \ncome to everyone in this Chamber simply by studying the work of the \nentitlements commission, the Bipartisan Entitlements Commission, where \nSenator Bob Kerrey and Senator John Danforth of Missouri sat for a year \nand presented to 32 Americans, including many of us in this Chamber, \nwhat is going to happen to Social Security.\n  There is no way to duck it. There is no way to finesse it. There is \nno way to demagog it. That is no way to go. Because if you are going to \ntalk about something that is worth $360 billion and leave it ``off the \ntable'' in a fashion that no one in this body is supposed to touch it \nor say a word about Social Security while the senior citizens groups \nbeat your head in and my head in and not allow us to even touch a \nsystem and keep telling us, and warning us, ``Oh yes, it will need to \nbe corrected'' and, ``Oh yes, we have a way to tell you how to do \nthat''--and their solutions always have to do with raising the payroll \ntax, ladies and gentlemen, and guess who pays the payroll tax? Not the \nsenior citizens.\n  Now, if we are going to deal with this issue, then I am going to \nbegin to come to the floor each and every time we come to this issue of \nSocial Security and balanced budgets concepts and begin to get one \nsingular thing across. Hear it. There is no Social Security trust fund, \nladies and gentlemen. There is no Social Security trust fund. None. And \nthe reason there is none is because, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt and \nthe Congress put this package together, they said that if there is any \nsurplus in the Social Security system it will be invested in the \nsecurities of the United States Government, secured by the full faith \nand credit of the United States. And every shred of this surplus--and \nit is big and it is going to get a lot bigger--every shred of it is \ninvested in the securities of the United States Government in a series \nof IOU's.\n\n  You know that and I know that. But, better yet, the trustees know \nthat. And who is this group of people telling us about this? They are \ncalled the trustees of the Social Security system, three of whom are in \nthe President's Cabinet: Robert Rubin, Donna Shalala, and Robert Reich; \none Republican, one Democrat, and the Commissioner of Social Security. \nAnd they are the stewards of Social Security. There are no other \ndesignated stewards of it.\n  In the trustees little booklet of their annual review which is about \nthat thick, and I hope you will read it, it says that in the year 2029, \nwithout doing something for Social Security, it will go broke. It will \nbe out of business. But, more important, in the year 2012, when the \npayments coming in will not cover the payments going out, you are going \nto start cashing in the bonds. And then you begin to use up the \ninterest. And between the year 2012 and the year 2029, it is history.\n  So, every time we hear this old saw, I want to be right here too and \ntell the American people, just as the trustees would if they were \nhere--I will speak for them--that there is no Social Security trust \nfund. It is a floating pile of IOU's. You know it and I know it. So, \nwhen we come here to this Chamber to talk about cooperation, \ncoordination, subjugating our own obsessions or our own agenda's to the \nbody work of this then let us talk about that fact every time.\n  I have been through this plenty of times in this Chamber. I do not \nkeep score of how many times I may have come to the floor on any issue. \nBut I can tell my colleagues I do know how many times some people have \ncome to the floor on this singular issue--time after time after time; \nand fully knowing that there is no trust fund.\n  We were just involved in a bill, talking about a rather interesting \nissue called illegal immigration reform. Several years ago--and I have \ndone this too long, remember for 17 years--my dearest friend, Senator \nJohn Heinz, proposed an amendment on--guess what? Social Security. What \nwas it that time? Listen to this one. I said to John Heinz, my old \nfriend--and remember, we put together a package that said that the COLA \nwould always be paid out, but if the inflation was ever 3 percent or \nless that we would not increase the COLA. If it was less than 3 percent \nwe would not give a COLA on Social Security.''\n  It was that year at 1.5 percent or something, or perhaps 2. And we \ncame to the floor and Senator Heinz, who really was spectacular--in \nfact--if he were here today we would not be in the health care \nconundrum we are in. He was that good. He could have led us out of \nthat.\n\n  I said, ``John, you know it will pass. All you have to do is mention \nSocial Security or a COLA and you know it will pass--or if you mention \nveterans, you know it will pass.'' We have all been there. We are all \nbright people. We know this.\n  So, there it was. An impasse. And finally he removed it from the \nimmigration bill, placed it on another one, and so it is much like this \none. We all know what this is. There is not a soul in this building, a \nsoul in this city, a soul who follows this, like Bob Kerrey and Jack \nDanforth did, who does not know that there is no Social Security trust \nfund--zero--zip--nothing. To hear it continued to be bandied about is \nan extraordinary adventure in fantasy.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. With respect to Senator Kerrey and Senator Danforth's \nrecommendations, fine--I support their particular report. It is not a \nquestion of fixing Social Security. It is a question of not using the \nsurpluses to obscure the size of the deficit and using them for Social \nSecurity.\n  I am sure the Senator was with me, on October 18, 1990. And I am sure \nhe supports that law.\n  You and I act like there is some difference. There is no difference \nin our belief that changes will have to be made to protect the \nintegrity of social security. But the law says thou shalt not use the \nSocial Security moneys to obscure the size of the deficit? That is the \nlaw, 13301. The chairman of the Budget Committee is here, he is totally \nfamiliar with it. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do not think anybody would try to \nobscure anything--at least this Senator is not. The obfuscation and the \nobscuring is to tell the American people that there is a trust fund \nthat we are using moneys from. There is not any trust fund there to be \nusing. It is not there. It is a series of IOU's. So, when we say, ``Oh, \nyou are doing a terrible thing. You are hiding something or you are \nusing the money that should have been there for us,'' that is simply \nnot the case.\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n  Let me just review just for the body in 4 more minutes eight rather \nrecent votes on this issue. I can only find eight in the last 30 \nminutes, since I knew that this would come up on the floor. The \namendments are not always offered up by the same Senator. They are \noffered by different people each time. It is kind of like we do with a \n``rolling hold.'' You kind of fire the one barrel and then you fire \nanother barrel. So here it all is, of recent vintage.\n  On January 26, 1995, Senator Harkin offered an amendment. Senator \nKempthorne made a second-degree amendment on it. The Kempthorne \namendment said that implementing legislation should not cut Social \nSecurity. We all agree with that. You cannot miss on that one. If you \nsimply, each time, want to talk about the balanced budget and add to it \nthat we will never ``cut'' Social Security, that is a snapper in here--\nexcept for a few of us who will cast that opposite vote and know very \nwell that it just does not fit.\n\n  Then Senator Reid tried to table that. That failed. Senator \nKempthorne's amendment then passed. Then Senator Harkin tried a \nperfecting amendment to add his language back, saying that the balanced \nbudget itself should exempt Social Security. That was tabled.\n  On February 10, 1995, Senator Dole offered the amendment to ask the \nBudget Committee to report instructions not affecting Social Security. \nThat passed 87 to 10, like we all knew it would. Then it was done.\n  Then Senator Reid presented an amendment, February 14 of 1995, saying \nSocial Security is now counted in the balanced budget amendment. And \nSenator Dole tabled that, 57 to 41.\n  On February 28, 1995 Senator Feinstein offered a substitute for the \nbalanced budget amendment with the exclusion of Social Security. That \nwas tabled 56 to 39.\n  On February 28, 1995, Senator Graham put forward an amendment to \neliminate ``held by the public'' from the debt limit, so as to get the \nbalanced budget to exclude Social Security. That was tabled 59 to 40.\n  Another Graham amendment was tabled 57 to 43.\n  This issue has been voted on time and time and time again. I think it \nis time that it not be voted on again, especially for this issue, on \neither illegal immigration or health care. Find a new line of work.\n  Several Senators addressed the chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one brief question? I wonder \nif the Senator will yield for a brief question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate that. I guess it is the Senator's contention \nthat there is no Social Security trust fund. I just ask this question.\n  We were told early on that the Social Security trust fund was not \nbeing used for any other purpose. Then we were told by those who wanted \nan affirmative vote on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget that the Senator supported that, even though they had argued \nthat it was not being used to balance the budget, they would stop using \nit to balance the budget by the year 2008.\n  How does one reconcile that if there is not a trust fund? If there is \nnot a trust fund, how can you stop using it in the year 2008?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota that \nthe travesty is that it is not being used. It is a series of IOU's. \nThere is no Social Security trust fund. And the money is being \ninvested.\n  You can say we will cut it back. You cannot. It is in T-bills. Some \npeople here own T-bills. Banks own T-bills. There is no Social Security \ntrust fund. I have never gone to my people and said we are stealing \nfrom the Social Security trust fund because I just stepped up to the \nplate and said there is none. So, when you bring that up, you are \nbringing up a fiction.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how would it be if we had IOU's for the \nsame time, I ask the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How can it be invested and become an IOU? If it is \ninvested, it is presumably going to be paid back? That is our problem, \nit is being spent on the deficit. That is my point.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, not only the fiction of it, but since \n1938, by law, the trust fund buys T bills which are IOU's that the \nGovernment must pay back. FDR did that, and that is what it is. There \nis no mystery to it. It is a series of IOU's, and when those are \noutstanding and then the revenue from Social Security will not cover--\nit is a pay-as-you-go, do not forget, Social Security is pay-as-you-go, \nand if it does not cover, you have to cash in the IOU's and you have to \nget more money through the payroll tax, or reducing benefits or issuing \nsome new kinds of securities.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3577-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3578-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH.

It is my understanding that he will make his arguments \nand then withdraw the amendment; am I incorrect on that?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, prior to returning to Senator Brown's \namendment, if I may propose a unanimous consent request on behalf of \nSenator Dole.\n  Let me yield and say, evidently, this has not been cleared fully on \nboth sides, so we will return to Senator Brown's amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we want to try and accommodate the \ngreatest number of Members. We have several Senators who are here with \ntheir amendments ready to address them and ready to act on them. We \nbelieve that if we are able to do that, we can afford, whoever wants to \nspeak, as much time as they want to speak on other kind of matters. But \nwe are here to deal with this legislation.\n  We have been urging Senators to come over here and offer their \namendments. They are here now, and we can either do this later--I plan \nto stay here until it is done, but the greater numbers of Members would \nlike to have at least some finality to the legislation. I believe we \ncan do it. It is 6 o'clock now and we had the chance for general \ndiscussion during the course of the day. Many of our colleagues have \ncome over here to address these issues and to vote on them, and they \nhave been waiting as well.\n  I hope we will urge our colleagues who are not going to talk on these \nmatter--we know they can; people can get up and address any other \nmatters--but out of consideration of other Members, please try and see \nif we cannot focus on the matter that is at hand, and that is the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, which is of enormous importance to many \nAmerican families.\n  I see other Members here, and I am sure they will do what they have \nto do, but we are trying to conclude this and then to let others speak \nso that at least others will not be here tomorrow. We are going to end \nup being here tomorrow as sure as I am standing here unless we are able \nto make progress. That is fine with me, if that is what it is. But with \nsome cooperation of the Members, we have a very good chance of \nfinishing this. Otherwise, Members ought to understand we are going to \nbe here late tonight voting and end up starting the votes later this \nevening and tomorrow.\n  We are just about to ask for the final list so that we can agree with \nthat. But in the meantime, we have the Senators who are here who are \nprepared to move ahead. Senator Brown is here, and Senator Jeffords was \nhere just a few moments ago to deal with an extremely important measure \nand has been here now for an hour and a half trying to gain the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3678\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am going to address the amendment that \nis before us, the Brown amendment,\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nbut I say to the managers of the bill, I join with them in their \nenthusiasm to finish it up. I do not see why we do not seek time \nagreements, in case we get off on another Social Security argument, \nwhatever it might be. But that is up to the managers.\n  Mr. President, I have a statement that I wish to make that deals with \nthe subject Senator Brown has been addressing, and Senator Pryor, \nlikewise, and which I joined in the past.\n  All I can say, Mr. President, is I just wish we would address this \nmatter, both in the committee, and I understand Senator Brown has been \ntrying to achieve that, but also on the floor of the Senate. We have \nhad one vote. It was a one-vote margin difference. Perhaps people's \nminds have been changed since then. Nonetheless, I support the efforts \nof Senators Brown and Pryor.\n  Congress and the administration made a simple--but costly--error in \ndrafting the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994. That inadvertent \nerror is costing consumers, State governments, and the Federal \nGovernment millions of dollars, while providing an unintended windfall \nto a handful of drug companies. I don't believe we should let that \nerror stand.\n  What happened? The facts of the case are straightforward. Back in \n1994, Congress was drafting omnibus trade legislation designed to bring \nthe United States into conformity with the important new global trade \nagreement known as the GATT. As part of our commitment to fulfill our \nnew GATT obligations, the United States pledged to increase patent \nprotection for future patents. In addition, the United States also \npledged to boot protection for patents already in existence--a key \npoint that goes to the heart of the issue before us today.\n  Accordingly, the trade bill that Congress wrote, boosted existing \npatent terms by up to 3 years, giving current patentholders a valuable \nextension on their patents. To be fair to generic manufacturers who had \nbeen preparing to go to market on the old patent expiration date, \nCongress fashioned a compromise: generic companies who had made a \nsubstantial investment in preparing for market would be allowed to \nproceed as planned, but would have to pay equitable remuneration--that \nis, a royalty--during the extended term. This carefully balanced \ncompromise became law as part of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n  However, in drafting this 653-page bill, Congress and the \nadministration made a small--but very costly--mistake. A simple \nconforming amendment to an FDA statute was omitted. Yet the impact was \nenormous: the omission singlehandedly prevented the generic drug \nindustry from going to market during the extended term. The result is \nthat a handful of brand-name drug companies have received a staggering \n$4.3 billion windfall, at the expense of consumers, that Congress, \nUnited States trade officials, and even the brand-name companies \nthemselves, neither intended nor expected.\n  The cost to consumers is enormous. The drugs that are covered by the \nwindfall are widely prescribed, and are used for everyday ailments that \naffect millions of Americans. Keeping the generic version off the shelf \nfor up to 3 years means that Americans--including and especially older \nAmericans--are paying far more than was ever intended for their \nmedications.\n  Not only are consumers paying for this error, but so are State \ngovernments and the Federal Government--in the form of higher \nreimbursements for prescription drugs for the elderly, veterans, and \nlow-income Americans.\n  This is not right. We made a mistake. We should fix it. In this case, \nthe solution is obvious and easy: simply enact the missing conforming \namendment. That is exactly what Senator Pryor, Senator Brown, and I--\nand many others--have been working to do.\n  Let me take a moment to put to rest a few red herrings. Our amendment \nwould not affect our GATT commitments or our efforts to promote patent \nprotection worldwide. Our amendment would not upset the balance in U.S. \ndrug patent laws, nor impede research and development of new drugs. If \nany of these misrepresentations were true, we simply would not be \nsponsoring this amendment. It is that simple.\n  It is time to correct this injustice--an injustice to consumers in \nour Nation, an injustice to the Federal and State governemnts that are \npaying extra and needless sums into Medicaid and Medicare and an \ninjustice to the generic manfuactures who made the investment in \nreliance on the law as it was supposed to be.\n  It is time we fixed this unfairness.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is my intention to try and expedite the \ndeliberations here tonight. In that regard, my thought would be to make \na statement, hopefully, shedding some light on this amendment. I know \nSenator Pryor has worked so hard in this area. He wants to make a \nstatement, and then it will be my intention to withdraw the amendment. \nI withdraw it reluctantly, because I think it needs to be considered \nand dealt with as soon as possible. But I am persuaded that we will not \nhave some votes that we need to adopt it if we insist on attaching it \nto this measure.\n  Having said that, let me simply outline the issue that is before us. \nIt is well described in a New York Times editorial of February 28. I \nwill quote a portion of that, because I think it is quite succinct and \nto the point:\n\n       Congress finds it hard to remedy the simplest mistakes when \n     powerful corporate interests are at stake. In 1974, when \n     Congress approved a new trade pact with more than 100 other \n     countries, it unintentionally handed pharmaceutical drug \n     companies windfall profits. More than a year later, Congress \n     has yet to correct the error. The trade pact obliged the \n     United States to change its patent laws to conform with those \n     of the rest of the world. They had the effect of extending \n     some American patents for up to 20 months.\n\n  Mr. President, those are the opening lines of the editorial.\n  The simple fact is this. We had people research drugs and put the \ninvestment into it and receive the full length of their exclusivity \nthat this Congress has supported and put into statute. The GATT \nagreement gave a serendipitous extension to that. In other words, under \nthe GATT agreement and the conforming changes of law that this Congress \nadopted, people who had invested in and relied on our laws got a longer \nperiod of patent protection than they have ever planned for. But the \nGATT agreement also had a provision, an exception for that extended \nprotection when someone had made a substantial investment in reliance \non our laws in providing competitive products.\n  In other words, what we propose in this amendment is nothing more \nthan absolutely the process that was contemplated and planned for under \nGATT. And, I might mention, Mr. President, many countries have done \nexactly the same thing. As a matter of fact, this country has done a \nsimilar kind of thing with other products.\n  What this amendment simply suggests is that where we have given \nsomeone an unexpected, unplanned extension in their patent protection, \nthat we make an exception for that extension where someone else has \nmade a substantial investment in producing and providing a competitive \nproduct--in this case, a generic drug.\n  If we do not adopt this, we will have said to people who produce \nproducts in reliance to our laws, ``After you have made the investment, \nafter you have put the money into it, after you have made under the \nterms of what will be the statute a substantial investment on reliance \nof our laws, we are going to pull the rug out from under you and change \nthe rules retroactively.''\n  Mr. President, that is not right. That is not honest. That is not \nfair. That is not a good way to do business. We have talked about the \nhorrible damage--and it is enormous damage--done to consumers by this \nunjustified quirk of the ratification document.\n  But I want to focus the Members' attention on what is unfair to \nbusiness. I believe it is unfair to business to say, ``Look, here are \nthe laws. Here is how long you have for patent protection. And by the \nway, we're going to change the law retroactively, and even though you \nmade substantial investment in producing a competing product, we're not \ngoing to let you compete.'' Now, that is what has happened.\n  If we do not pass this bill as it is in committee or the amendment as \nwe offer it on the floor, what you are going to do is not only impact \nconsumers to the tune of billions of dollars, but you are going to say \nto businesses that have relied on the law, that it is tough luck, you \nshould not have believed us. You should not have relied on what we did.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  Why is it important to pass it on this bill or pass it quickly? I \nthink that is a fair question. I must tell the Members, I am \ndisappointed I have not been able to persuade all the other people who \nsupport the concept that it is important to pass it on this measure.\n  It is important because the impact of this, if it goes uncorrected, \ncould be over $2 billion, according to the Washington Post. It is \nimportant because this costs consumers up to $5 million a day while we \ndelay. Mr. President, let me repeat that because I am not sure people \nhave focused on the impact of delay. It costs up to $5 million a day to \nconsumers in this country if we do not act. Some estimates indicated it \nmay have cost consumers already $700 million.\n  Mr. President, this is not anything other than fairness. This is not \nanything other than saying the patent protection that was planned in \nthe law ought to be delivered as it was planned in the law.\n  Mr. President, I will not prolong the argument. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas has worked on this and has some \nremarks, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \neditorial from the Washington Post, a letter from The Seniors \nCoalition, a letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare, a letter from the National Women's Health \nNetwork, a letter from the Citizen Action, a letter from the Gray \nPanthers, a letter from the Generic Drug Equity Coalition, a letter \nfrom the Consumer Federation of America, and a letter from the Citizen \nAdvocacy Center, all pertaining to this subject and advocating the \nposition of this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that all of these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 1995]\n\n                          The Zantac Windfall\n\n       All for lack of a technical conforming clause in a trade \n     bill, full patent protection for a drug called Zantac will \n     run 19 months beyond its original expiration date. Zantac, \n     used to treat ulcers, is the world's most widely prescribed \n     drug, and its sales in this country run to more than $2 \n     billion a year. The patent extension postpones the date at \n     which generic products can begin to compete with it and pull \n     the price down. That provides a great windfall to Zantac's \n     maker, Glaxo Wellcome Inc.\n       It's a case study in legislation and high-powered lobbying. \n     When Congress enacted the big Uruguay Round trade bill a year \n     ago, it changes the terms of American patents to a new \n     worldwide standard. The effect was to lengthen existing \n     patents, usually by a year or two. But Congress had heard \n     from companies that were counting on the expiration of \n     competitors' patents. It responded by writing into the trade \n     bill a transitional provision. Any company that had already \n     invested in facilities to manufacture a knock-off, it said, \n     could pay a royalty to the patent-holder and go into \n     production on the patent's original expiration date.\n       But Congress neglected to add a clause amending a crucial \n     paragraph in the drug laws. The result is that the \n     transitional clause now applies to every industry but drugs. \n     That set off a huge lobbying and public relations war with \n     the generic manufacturers enlisting the support of consumers' \n     organizations and Glaxo Wellcome invoking the sacred \n     inviolability of an American patent.\n       Mickey Kantor, the president's trade representative, who \n     managed the trade bill for the administration, says that the \n     omission was an error, pure and simple. But it has created a \n     rich benefit for one company in particular. A small band of \n     senators led by David Pryor (D-Ark.) has been trying to right \n     this by enacting the missing clause, but so far it hasn't got \n     far. Glaxo Wellcome and the other defenders of drug patents \n     are winning. Other drugs are also involved, incidentally, \n     although Zantac is by far the most important in financial \n     terms.\n       Drug prices are a particularly sensitive area of health \n     economics because Medicare does not, in most cases, cover \n     drugs. The money spent on Zantac is only a small fraction of \n     the $80 billion a year that Americans spend on all \n     prescription drugs. Especially for the elderly, the cost of \n     drugs can be a terrifying burden. That makes it doubly \n     difficult to understand why the Senate refuses to do anything \n     about a windfall that, as far as the administration is \n     concerned, is based on nothing more than an error of \n     omission.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n        The Seniors Coalition, Protecting the Future You Have \n                                                       Earned,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: The Seniors Coalition urges you to \n     support legislation offered by Senator Brown in the Judiciary \n     Committee to correct an egregious mistake made in the \n     implementation of the GATT treaty. This mistake has cost the \n     consumers, and primarily the elderly, of this nation millions \n     of dollars. This loophole has allowed a few drug companies to \n     take advantage of a situation that was unintended and to line \n     their pockets with unearned money from American citizens.\n       I ask you to read the article ``What you don't know about \n     brand name drugs is costing you millions'' (pp. 4-5) in our \n     latest edition of The Senior Class which outlines the problem \n     and then to vote to support the correction. Your support for \n     this effort is critical to the financial well being of \n     thousands of senior citizens.\n       I submitted testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     this issue when the committee held hearings on this issue in \n     February. At that time I called for the Congress to correct \n     the mistake and reject the efforts of brand name companies to \n     thwart the correction. The so-called ``compromise'' that has \n     been drafted by Glaxo and may be offered by a member of the \n     Judiciary Committee is nothing more than a thinly veiled \n     effort to codify the mistake that was made. A careful reading \n     of the language will find that it does even more damage to \n     the ability of consumers, especially seniors, to find safe \n     and affordable pharmaceutical products in the marketplace.\n       Again, please support Senator Brown and his effort to \n     correct this mistake. Now is the time for the Congress to do \n     something for the American public.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thair Phillips,\n     CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     Honorable Hank Brown,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: We understand the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee plans to mark-up legislation addressing and General \n     Agreement of Tariff and Trade (GATT) patent pharmaceutical \n     issue tomorrow. We urge you to support legislation (S. 1277) \n     sponsored by Senators Chafee, Pryor, and Brown to correct an \n     oversight in the GATT implementing legislation that will save \n     consumers and taxpayers billions of dollars in prescription \n     drug costs. We urge you to oppose any alternative measures \n     that would maintain this costly and unintended loophole under \n     GATT.\n       As you know, because of an oversight in patent changes \n     approved under the GATT treaty implementing legislation, the \n     availability of lower-priced generic versions of more than 25 \n     widely-prescribed drugs must be delayed for up to an \n     additional three years. As a result, seniors and other \n     consumers will wait longer for access to less-costly generic \n     drugs.\n       Every day Congress delays in correcting this oversight \n     costs consumers $5 million dollars in additional prescription \n     drug costs. In fact, the delay has already cost consumers an \n     additional $500 million dollars. The biggest losers among \n     U.S. consumers are senior citizens, as older Americans \n     consume about one-third of the prescription drugs sold in the \n     United States. On fixed incomes and with no pharmaceutical \n     coverage under Medicare, three out of four seniors cite \n     prescription drugs as their largest out-of-pocket expense.\n       On behalf of our millions of members and supporters, the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n     urges you to support and report out of Committee the Chafee/\n     Pryor/Brown generic drug legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              National Women's Health Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 1996.\n       Dear Judiciary Committee Member: In this time of federal, \n     state and local budget-cutting, threats to Medicare and \n     Medicaid, and continually rising medical costs, health care \n     savings are more important than ever to the American public. \n     Given the seriousness of skyrocketing health care costs, it \n     is unconscionable that Congress has so far failed to address \n     an error that needlessly increases the cost of health care \n     for millions of Americans, and unnecessarily boosts costs to \n     the federal government, as well.\n       More than a year ago, Congress discovered that the \n     legislation implementing the GATT Treaty contained an \n     unintended loophole for some pharmaceutical drug companies. \n     An error of omission granted the manufacturers of brand-name \n     drugs treatment unique in all of American industry.\n       By failing to include generic drugs in its rules concerning \n     transition to new patent terms under the GATT Treaty, \n     Congress has done a disservice to women's health, \n     specifically, and to consumers and taxpayers, generally. \n     While the mistake was unintentional, the consequences are \n     grave. Each day that passes without Congressional action to \n     correct this error costs millions of dollars; the total cost \n     is expected to exceed $2 billion.\n       The beneficiaries of the current situation are the handful \n     of giant pharmaceutical corporations that will enjoy windfall \n     profits for three additional years. Their glee at this \n     unanticipated windfall is evidenced by the fierceness with \n     which the lobbyists for these companies are fighting to \n     preserve their protected status.\n       The exemption of drug companies from the GATT transition \n     rules was a mistake. It\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\n     would be intolerable to compound this mistake by failing to \n     correct it. Please support the solution proposed by Senators \n     Brown, Chafee and Pryor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Cynthia Pearson,\n     Program Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1996.\n       Dear Judiciary Committee Member: On behalf of Citizen \n     Action and our three million members, I would like to ask \n     your support for a proposal which will shortly be offered by \n     Senators Brown, Chafee and Pryor. This proposal would undo a \n     legislative error which, if not corrected, will cost U.S. \n     consumers hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary \n     prescription drug costs.\n       When Congress passed new patent terms under the GATT \n     Treaty, it failed to include prescription drugs under its \n     transition rules. GATT extends patent terms of U.S. products \n     from 17 to 20 years. Because many manufacturers had already \n     invested millions of dollars in competing products in \n     expectation of the 17-year limit, Congress adopted transition \n     rules to allow those companies to introduce generic \n     alternatives on the date that the 17-year patent would have \n     expired.\n       The omission of prescription drugs in the transition rule \n     means that makers of lower-cost generic drugs will be unable \n     to bring their products to market until the full 20-year term \n     of patent protection has expired. This loophole will allow a \n     few large pharmaceutical companies to reap more than $2 \n     billion in windfall profits. Because lower-cost generics will \n     be kept off the market, consumers will be forced to pay \n     higher prices for more than a dozen drugs, including big-\n     sellers Zantac and Capoten.\n       Without a correction, taxpayer-funded federal and state \n     health programs, as well as individual purchasers of \n     prescription drugs, will be forced to pay higher than \n     necessary costs. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates \n     that it alone will spend $211 million in additional costs \n     over the next three years.\n       The Judiciary Committee has an opportunity to correct a \n     provision that will have grave consequences for consumers. \n     Again, Citizen Action urges that you act now to remove this \n     unique loophole which rewards certain large pharmaceutical \n     companies at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Cathy L. Hurwit,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Gray Panthers Project Fund,\n\n\n                                      Age and Youth in Action,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 1996.\n     Hon.

In \n     addition, attached are copies of the testimony submitted to \n     the Judiciary Committee from Ms. Black and myself, as well as \n     Wednesday's New York Times editorial on the issue.\n       With the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on GATT now \n     behind us, Senators Chafee, Brown, and Pryor have vowed to \n     introduce legislation within the next few weeks that will \n     correct this loophole and bring relief to millions of \n     consumers like the Blacks who rely on the savings that \n     generic pharmaceuticals offer.\n       In December, an effort to bring the Chafee-Brown-Pryor \n     amendment to the Senate floor was narrowly defeated by one \n     vote. When the Chafee-Brown-Pryor amendment is introduced in \n     the near future, I urge you and your colleagues to do the \n     right thing and correct this Congressional oversight and save \n     American taxpayers from a costly mistake.\n       Please support the Chafee-Brown-Pryor amendment and close \n     the GATT loophole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dixie D.

Everyday that passes costs consumers and taxpayers \n     $5 million more.\n       By the time you return in two weeks, the cost to consumers \n     and taxpayers will have reached $650 million.\n       Yet, despite written commitments to markup a bill to close \n     the GATT loophole in the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, \n     nothing has happened.\n       A few companies continue to reap unintended windfall \n     profits at the expense of American consumers, taxpayers and \n     generic drug manufacturers.\n       While you are away observing the Easter and Passover \n     Holidays be sure to think about Americans like 69-year old \n     Eleanor Black and her 89-year old mother Sally who spend $339 \n     a month, one quarter of their monthly income, for Zantac \n     because of the GATT loophole.\n       The Generic Drug Equity Coalition urges you to support the \n     Chafee/Pryor/Brown proposal and close the GATT loophole.\n       The Judiciary Committee leadership has missed its own, \n     self-imposed deadline. It is time for a vote on the Senate \n     floor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n       Dear Senate Judiciary Committee Member: The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee plans this week to examine the loophole \n     in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which \n     exempts the pharmaceutical industry from patent transition \n     terms. We urge you at this time to support the efforts of \n     Senators Brown, Chafee, and Pryor to redress this unintended \n     and potentially costly, effect of the GATT Treaty.\n       As you know, an error of omission in the legislative \n     language implementing the GATT Treaty has exempted the \n     pharmaceutical industry from the patent transition terms. As \n     a result, the pharmaceutical drug industry--alone among all \n     industries--enjoys a 20-year patent term, and generic \n     manufacturers are unable to market long-planned products.\n       The unintended effects of the patent extension include \n     diminished market competition, an undeserved windfall to pre-\n     GATT patent holders, and further inflated costs to millions \n     of Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \n     estimated that this simple mistake will cost consumers and \n     taxpayers as much as $2 billion as drug companies reap \n     windfall profits in the absence of competition. This windfall \n     was not intended by Congress, nor envisioned in the GATT \n     treaty itself.\n       Senators, Brown, Chafee, and Pryor have proposed closing \n     the loophole, thereby protecting consumers' health and \n     taxpayers' wallets. This solution would not convey special \n     status on the generic drug industry; instead, this amendment \n     provides for equal treatment, and would compel brand-name \n     drug manufacturers to live under the same rules as every \n     other American industry.\n       In the interest of consumers, taxpayers and fairness, we \n     urge you to support the efforts Senators, Brown, Chafee, and \n     Pryor have made to redress this costly error.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Mern Horan,\n\n                                       Legislative Representative,\n     Consumer Federation of America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Citizen Advocacy Center,\n\n                                     Elmhurst, IL, March 25, 1996.\n       Dear Judiciary Committee Member: An oversight in the \n     legislation implementing the GATT Treaty has granted the \n     pharmaceutical industry a privileged status at the expense of \n     consumers and taxpayers. More than a year after the \n     implementing legislation was adopted, Congress has yet to \n     correct this windfall benefit. Now, Senators Brown, Chafee, \n     and Pryor have developed a solution that is fair and \n     reasonable and deserving of your support.\n       GATT is premised on opening world markets to competition. \n     Under our implementing legislation, however, manufacturers of \n     generic drugs, alone among all industries in the United \n     States, are prohibited from bringing products to market until \n     the full twenty-year patent term has expired for brand-name \n     drugs. This anticompetitive windfall is estimated to be worth \n     two billion dollars in profits. Health care consumers are \n     thus forced to pay higher costs, as will taxpayers, who fund \n     drug purchases through a number of government programs. The \n     City of Elmhurst has a high percentage of Senior Citizens, a \n     group that is disproportionately harmed by high health care \n     costs, and the adverse effects of the as yet uncorrected \n     legislation.\n       Congress did not intend to bestow this windfall on drug \n     companies when it adopted the transitional rules for GATT. We \n     urge you, in the interest of consumers, seniors, and \n     taxpayers, to correct this oversight and to not be lulled \n     into inaction by the multi-million dollar lobbying blitz of \n     the companies enjoying this windfall daily.\n       Senators Brown, Chafee and Pryor have proposed a simple \n     solution that would protect the balance of interest between \n     generic and brand-name manufacturers envisioned in the Hatch-\n     Waxman Act of 1984. It's time to support their proposal.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                                Theresa Amato,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                          Citizen Advocacy Center.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, my apologies to the Senator from Colorado. \nHas the Senator from Colorado finished his statement?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will take but a few moments of the \nSenate's time this evening. We need to move on. The distinguished \nmanagers have requested that we move to final resolution of this very \nimportant measure. But I would like to take, Mr. President, in opening, \na few moments to discuss our particular concerns over this uncorrected \nerror in our laws which has led to unnecessarily high drug prices.\n  I would like to quote from my good colleague who is departing the \nSenate and is a great friend, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. Senator \nSimon recently spoke on the issue of correcting\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nthis problem in the GATT treaty. I quote from Senator Simon when he \nsaid, ``This is a classic example of special interests versus the \npublic interest.''\n  Mr. President, that is what this debate, I am afraid, has boiled down \nto. I know my friend from Colorado, Senator Brown, in his eloquent \nstatement has placed into the Record a recent editorial of December 4, \n1995 from the Washington Post. I will read a paragraph from that \neditorial:\n\n       All for lack of a technical conforming clause in a trade \n     bill, full patent protection for a drug called Zantac will \n     run 19 months beyond its original expiration date. Zantac, \n     used to treat ulcers, is the world's most widely prescribed \n     drug, and its sales in this country run to more than $2 \n     billion a year.\n\n  I continue quoting from the Washington Post editorial:\n\n       The patent extension postpones the date at which generic \n     products can begin to compete with it and pull the price \n     down. That provides a great windfall to Zantac's maker, Glaxo \n     Wellcome, Inc.\n\n  That is the beginning paragraph, Mr. President, of the Washington \nPost editorial. To conclude from that editorial, let me read:\n\n       That makes it doubly difficult to understand why the Senate \n     refuses to do anything about a windfall that, as far as the \n     administration is concerned, is based on nothing more than an \n     error of omission.\n\n  Well, once again, this issue is with us. We failed by one vote back \non December 7 to rectify this mistake. Since that time, a few companies \nlike Glaxo Wellcome have earned more than $600 million in extra \nrevenues because of a congressional error. It also means that the \nVeterans Administration, the Medicaid programs, the consumers of \nAmerica, and especially the elderly of America are having to pay double \nfor Zantac than what they would be paying had we allowed a generic to \ncome into the marketplace and compete.\n  This is not fair, Mr. President. We know that this is not fair. The \nJudiciary Committee this morning had scheduled a markup, one which has \nalready been delayed from last month. They continue to promise that \nthey are going to mark up S. 1277, the measure offered by Senator Brown \nand Senator Chafee and myself to correct this mistake in the GATT \ntreaty.\n  But, once again, this morning an unnamed Senator objected to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee marking up this measure, and, once again, it \nmeans more and more windfall profits for undeserving companies at the \nexpense of consumers. These delays are completely unacceptable and \nunwarranted. The American public simply cannot abide further delays on \nbehalf of special interests.\n  What is at stake? Back on November 27, 1995, an editorial in the Des \nMoines Register stated that:\n\n       A month's supply of Zantac ordinarily sells for around \n     $115; the generic price--meaning the same drug without the \n     Zantac label--would be around $35, the generic makers \n     contend.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that Des Moines \nRegister editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n                           A Costly Oversight\n\n\n        fine print in gatt law could cost zantac users millions\n\n       The nation's prescription drug makers are at war again, \n     with a $1 billion-plus purse going to the winner. If the \n     brand-name drug manufacturers win, the losers will include \n     the millions of Americans who suffer from ulcers or \n     heartburn, and take the drug Zantac regularly to combat the \n     problem. It's going to cost each of them about $1,600.\n       Zantac is made by GlaxoWellcome, the biggest in the \n     business.\n       Here's what started the current war:\n       When a new prescription drug hits the market, generic drug \n     manufacturers await the patent expiration so they can enter \n     the market with the same drug. They offer it for sale without \n     the brand name, usually at a fraction of the brand-name \n     price.\n       The new international GATT treaty signed by the United \n     States and 122 other countries sets the life of a patent at \n     20 years from the date of application. Former U.S. law \n     provided patent protection for pharmaceuticals for 17 years \n     from the date of approval. Because the difference could have \n     a significant impact on the number of years a firm could \n     market its patented drug without competition. Congress made \n     special provisions for drugs under patent at the time GATT \n     was approved last summer.\n       But when the legal beagles got done reading all the fine \n     print, it turned out that Zantac was granted a 19-month \n     extension of its patent life--and it is such a hugely popular \n     drug that that translates into a multimillion-dollar \n     windfall.\n       Generic drug makers call the windfall a congressional \n     oversight, and estimate the difference is worth $2.2 billion \n     to Glaxo, because the generics can't enter the market for 19 \n     more months. Glaxo counters that Congress made no mistake, \n     that the extension was part of the compromise with generics. \n     It won't wash. Nothing in the GATT treaty was intended to \n     further enrich the happy handful of brand-name drug makers \n     who hold lucrative patents--or to personalize the users of \n     the drugs.\n       A month's supply of Zantac ordinarily sells for around \n     $115; the generic price--meaning the same drug without the \n     Zantac label--would be around $35, the generic makers \n     contend. Unless Congress changes the wording of the law \n     regarding transition to GATT provisions, Zantac users will \n     pay the difference for 19 months longer.\n       Some generic drug manufacturers had already spent a bundle \n     preparing to enter the market before the GATT treaty took \n     effect. They lose. So do taxpayers, who pay for Medicaid \n     prescriptions. The Generic Drug Equity Coalition estimates \n     that the higher costs of Zantac and some other drugs affected \n     by the mistake (such as Capoten, for high blood pressure) \n     will cost Iowa Medicaid $3.5 million. Further, say the \n     generic drug makers, it will tack another $1.2 million onto \n     the cost of health-insurance premiums for Iowa state \n     employees.\n       Glaxo's political action committee has doubled its \n     contributions to Congress in recent months. Glaxo wants the \n     mistake to stay in the law. Generic drug manufacturers want \n     it out.\n       So should ulcer sufferers. So should taxpayers. So should \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, finally, let me say we all know what this \nissue is about. We have debated this issue to some extent on the floor \nof the Senate and to a great extent in the Judiciary Committee. We \nheard our U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Kantor conclusively \nexplain the situation, and I quote:\n\n       The provision was written neutrally because it was intended \n     to apply to all types of patentable subject matter, including \n     pharmaceutical products. Conforming amendments should have \n     been made to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and \n     section 271 of the U.S. Patent Act, but were inadvertently \n     overlooked.\n\n  One other quote from Ambassador Kantor:\n\n       We intended to apply this grandfather provision to the \n     pharmaceutical area. S. 1277 would result in a level of \n     protection that is consistent with our original intent.\n\n  Mr. President, let me say, Senator Brown, Senator Chafee and myself \nhave tried to proceed in good faith. There are Members on each side of \nthe aisle that have stated their concern about, and in some cases their \nobjection to, certain language that we had in this legislation. We have \nattempted to meet with them. We have attempted to compromise. We have \ncertainly gone to the negotiating table and attempted to bargain in \ngood faith and see what their concerns are.\n  Truly, Mr. President, I believe that we now have come together and \ncrafted an amendment that is acceptable to all those concerned with \ndoing what is right for consumers, businesses which have relied upon \nthe law in good faith and for our compliance with a very important \ntreaty. The amendment represents the simplest and best means for us to \ncorrect the egregious flaw that persists today because of \nunconscionable delays and the efforts of special interests.\n  Mr. President, I want to say in conclusion that I have thoroughly \nenjoyed working with Senator Brown of Colorado and Senator Chafee of \nRhode Island, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I hope we \ncan bring this matter to a resolution in the very near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the vote on this measure was close, as has \nbeen noted. Since that time, I believe we have persuaded others to join \nus in advocating this amendment. The amendment has been compromised to \nthe point that specifically we have spelled out in the compromise \nversion that is before the Senate right now a very clear, bright-line \ntest of what substantial investment is. It is easy and clear to work \nwith. I think we have addressed the problems. I am confident we have \nthe votes.\n  However, because of the urgency of the particular underlying measure \nthat is here, some Members whose votes we need and count on are unable \nto support this amendment because they fear\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nit would bring controversy to the bill. It is, therefore, necessary for \nme to reluctantly withdraw this measure.\n  I must mention, Mr. President, it does seem to me this is the \nappropriate kind of thing that ought to be considered on a prompt \nbasis. Literally, to fail to act costs consumers $5 million or more a \nday, and literally if we fail to act very promptly, the issue becomes \nmoot because the time simply runs out. I believe in fairness to \ncompanies that have reinvested, and, in fairness to consumers, we \nshould and must act quickly.\n  I simply want to serve notice that we will be looking for other \nvehicles to offer on this floor in a rather prompt fashion.\n  With that, I reluctantly withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw the \namendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 3678) is withdrawn.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the sponsors of \nthe amendment withdrawing it. Senator Brown and Senator Pryor are very \npersuasive in their arguments, as Senator Chafee was as well. I am \nsympathetic to the purpose of the amendment.\n  As was noted by the sponsors, it is controversial. For that reason, \nwe would have to oppose it on the health insurance reform bill. I \nappreciate the thoughtfulness in their withdrawal.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I put forward on behalf of the \nmajority leader a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent during the remainder of the Senate's \nconsideration of S. 1028, the following amendments be the only first-\ndegree amendments in order, that they may be subject to relevant \nsecond-degree amendments, and following the disposition of the listed \namendments and the committee substitute, the bill be advanced to third \nreading, and the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, that \nall after the enacting bill be stricken, the text of the Senate bill be \ninserted, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed \nto vote on passage of H.R. 3103, as amended, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The list that I have of the amendments would be: Nickles, relevant; \nJeffords, lifetime caps; Thomas, rural health; McCain, biological \nmedical devices; Gramm, relevant; Coats, medical volunteer liability \ncoverage; Domenici, mental health; Specter, public health; pecter, \npublic health; Specter, public health; Gregg, choice care; Helms, study \nof access by HHS; Senator Brown has withdrawn his amendment; McConnell, \nmedical malpractice; Bond, administration simplification; Pressler, \nCRNAS; D'Amato, fair tax treatment; Kassebaum, relevant; Dole, \nrelevant; Roth, relevant; Simpson, commission; Bennett relevant; Burns, \ntelemedicine; Boxer, ban HMO gag rules; Conrad, nurse practitioner, \nnurse anesthetists, advance nurse practitioner; Feinstein, nonprofit \ninsurance; Graham-Baucus, Medicare fraud; Harkin, fraud and abuse; \nHarkin, fraud and abuse; Kennedy, relevant; Pryor relevant; Wellstone, \ntwo domestic violence; Simon is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution; \nDorgan, organ donations; Lieberman, MM data banks; Kennedy, nursing \ncare; Daschle, relevant; Boxer, biomed devices.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator add Wellstone, relevant, sense of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I believe Senator Jeffords has been \nwaiting, and I believe he is next to be recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if we could ask a question, Mr. President, \nwhile the two distinguished managers are on the floor. It is 6:15; I \ndid not realize there were quite as many amendments.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Neither did we.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Are we planning to go on into the evening?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes, Mr. President, I say to the Senator from \nArkansas, I think it is the hope not only of the managers but also of \nthe minority leader and the majority leader that we finish tonight.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Good night, Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3679\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a minimum amount that may be applied as an \n  aggregate lifetime limit with respect to coverage under an employee \n              health benefit plan or a group health plan)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3679.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n       At the end of section 103, add the following new \n     subsection:\n       (g) Limitation on Lifetime Aggregate Limits.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), an \n     employee health benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering \n     a group health plan may not impose an aggregate dollar \n     lifetime limit of less than $10,000,000 (such amount to be \n     adjusted for inflation in fiscal years subsequent to the \n     fiscal year in which this subsection becomes effective) with \n     respect to coverage under the plan.\n       (2) Small employers.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a \n     group health plan offered to or maintained for employees of a \n     single employer that employs 25 or fewer employees.\n       (3) Rule of construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be \n     construed as prohibiting the application by an employee \n     health benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering a group \n     health plan of any limits, exclusions, or other forms of cost \n     containment mechanisms with respect to coverage under the \n     plan other than the aggregate limit permitted under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (4) Disclosure.--Any limits, exclusions, or other cost \n     containment mechanisms permitted under paragraph (3) shall be \n     disclosed as provided for in section 105(c).\n       (5) Application of subsection.--This subsection shall not \n     apply to a health maintenance organization that meets the \n     requirements of title XIV of the Public Health Service Act.\n       (6) Effective date.--This paragraph shall become effective \n     with respect to health plans on the date that is 2 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       At the end of section 105, add the following new \n     subsection:\n       (c) Disclosure of Limits and Exclusions.--An employee \n     health benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering a group \n     health plan shall disclose, as part of its solicitation and \n     sales materials and in a form and manner that is conspicuous \n     and understandable to a reasonable individual, any limits, \n     exclusions, or cost containment mechanisms with respect to \n     coverage provided under the plan.\n       Section 3711 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(g)(1) If a nontax debt or claim owed to the United \n     States has been delinquent for a period of 180 days--\n       ``(A) the head of the executive, judicial, or legislative \n     agency that administers the program that gave rise to the \n     debt or claim shall transfer the debt or claim to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury; and\n       ``(B) upon such transfer the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall take appropriate action to collect or terminate \n     collection actions on the debt or claim.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply--\n       ``(A) to any debt or claim that--\n       ``(i) is in litigation or forelosure;\n       ``(ii) will be disposed of under an asset sales program \n     within 1 year after the date the debt or claim is first \n     delinquent, or a greater period of time if a delay would be \n     in the best interests of the United States, as determined by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury;\n       ``(iii) has been referred to a private collection \n     contractor for collection for a period of time determined by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury;\n       ``(iv) has been referred by, or with the consent of, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to a debt collection center for a \n     period of time determined by the Secretary of the Treasury; \n     or\n       ``(v) will be collected under internal offset, if such \n     offset is sufficient to collect the claim within 3 years \n     after the date the debt or claim is first delinquent; and\n       ``(B) to any other specific class of debt or claim, as \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of \n     the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency or \n     otherwise.\n       ``(3) For purposes of this section, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury may designate, and withdraw such designation of debt \n     collection centers operated by other Federal agencies.

Mr. President, I know that we have had a difficult day \ntoday. We are having a difficult time trying to face the facts of life \nthat the bill we are amending is a very important one, one which I have \nbeen an original cosponsor and one which part of the bill is mine. It \nis something that I worked very hard on. I believe it is an excellent \njob.\n  However, I also believe that it has a very serious flaw in it. Thus, \nat the time the committee was meeting--and I want to point out that we \nhave already made an exception today--the Finance Committee came and \nsaid, ``Hey, we have a bunch of amendments.'' Most of them have been \naccepted. So we have already made several exceptions to the \nnonamendment rule. I want to remind people of that.\n  Now, I submitted this amendment, which I have before this body, at \nthe committee. I am a member of the committee, ranking Republican on \nthe committee. At that time it was said, ``Hey, we want to get out of \nhere a unanimous bill. We may have problems.'' So I said, ``OK, I will \nwait until the floor.'' So I come to the floor to offer an amendment, \nwhich I think about everybody agrees ought to be on it, and they said, \n``No. No amendments--except for the Finance Committee amendments.''\n  I understand that the ranking Republican and the chairman of the \ncommittee are bound by their commitment to no amendments, but nobody \nelse is. Nobody else is in this body. So I hope Members would say he \ndeserves to be heard. He has told me I could raise this amendment on \nthe floor, and here it is.\n  Now we will talk about what the amendment is and why we are here. The \nbill is one which provides, if a person is working for a business and \nchanging jobs, or whatever else, has a health problem, that they are \nguaranteed an issuance of a policy or a continuance of a policy, \nnotwithstanding the fact that they are sick. That is very important. \nThis is an important breakthrough. That is why I supported the bill.\n  However, what we were not aware of at the time and I brought to the \ncommittee's attention, but perhaps there was too little time to \nconsider it, is the fact that there is no requirement now under the \nFederal law for any kind of a certain level of cap.\n  Now, what could happen to us is, OK, we require the insurance company \nto take a sick person, but then the insurance company has the right to \nchange its benefits, or it can say, ``OK, we will lower the lifetime \ncap. So when we take you on, as soon as we pay whatever level of funds \nwe reduce the limit to, you are gone, finished, you have no more \ncoverage.''\n  Well, this amendment would rectify that and say we have to put--as a \nnationwide standard, with the exception, we admit it could cause some \nproblems with small businesses, so we exempt 25 and under. We say you \nhave to have $10 million of coverage. Why the $10 million? The $10 \nmillion lifetime cap is because the standard for the industry for many \nyears was a million dollars. But that was 20 years ago. That million \ndollars is worth about $100,000 now. So we say, let us go back to the \nstandard of 20 years ago and put on that cap.\n  I want to point out that when we do this, we are obviously going to \ncause some costs. I will explain that later. But let us take a look at \nwho we are talking about when we are talking about those covered under \nthis provision. We are talking about those that are working for \nbusinesses, as I say, that get sick. All of a sudden they have some \npretty big bills. Remember, some of the lifetime caps out there on \nthese insurance plans are $50,000. That is one day in a hospital \nsometimes. So you go in there sick, and all of a sudden you have no \ncoverage. We are trying to correct that.\n  Now, let me point out to you, again, what we are talking about from a \nnational policy perspective. What happens now to that sick person? That \nperson is sick. They have been allowed to be covered and then chopped \noff because they have reached the lifetime limit of, say, $50,000. What \nhappens? Under the law right now, in order for them to qualify for \nMedicaid, they cannot have resources beyond a certain level. So what we \nare talking about--and I will give some examples in a minute--is middle \nincome people, or even higher income people, who suddenly are placed in \na position where the only way they can get care for their loved one is \nto get rid of all of their assets and then they will qualify for \nMedicaid. So the household has to go through that--getting rid of its \nassets--and then they qualify for Medicaid. Should our policy in this \nNation do that? I say no, and I am sure you will, too. This is not good \npolicy.\n  Let me talk a little about some of the people involved. I think all \nof you have probably heard the ads of Christopher Reeve, or watched \nthem on television, or read the editorials in the newspapers and the \nstories that have covered this. If you want an example as to whether or \nnot it could happen to you, here is ``Superman,'' who was involved in a \nvery serious accident. He was thrown off his horse and he becomes a C-\n2, which is a broken neck. He has lost the functions below the neck \nlevel, without some assistance. He has a cap of $1.2 million, and it is \ncosting him $400,000 a year. In 3 years, he will be past that cap.\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\n  Let us take Jim Brady, who is another one--not an example of the \nlifetime cap, because he is on worker's compensation, but he had a head \ninjury caused by a bullet when he was with President Reagan. He would \nbe far beyond a million-dollar cap, to say nothing of a $50,000 cap at \nthis time.\n  Let me talk about some of the people that do not have the resources \nof a Christopher Reeve, or the protection of the law with respect to \nworker's comp, like Jim Brady. Let me go through some of these so that \nyou understand better what kind of people we are talking about.\n  This story is about Donelle and Kyle Meniketti, from the Washington \nPost. For 4 years, Donelle Meniketti waged a tremendous fight to save \nher son Kyle from suffering death or severe brain damage as a result of \na rare breathing disorder that struck when he was 18 days old. It says:\n\n       When he sleeps, said the Livermore, CA, woman, his airway \n     collapses and his brain does not tell him to breathe. \n     He needs a breathing machine at night and an oxygen \n     monitor. When he sleeps, he must have someone there all \n     the time to make sure he is breathing.\n  Home nursing care costs alone can be $10,000 a month, and even though \nMrs. Meniketti has spent sleepless nights watching over her son rather \nthan pay for a nurse, his medical care is making constant claims on the \nhealth insurance plan of her husband Keith. As these claims mounted, \nthey face the terrible prospect of the child's expenses soon reaching \nthe million-dollar cap.\n  He is 4 years old. So far he has escaped it. But they will be forced \ninto Medicaid if this amendment does not succeed.\n  Then there is Heather Fraser. I wish you would have seen her. She \nappeared at our press conference the other day. She is 23 years old and \nsuffers from cystic fibrosis. She has suffered already many times. She \ndoes not know from one day to the next whether she is going to have one \nof these respiratory infections. She has had chronic problems of all \ndifferent kinds and will continue to do so. She graduated from college, \nis 23, and is looking forward to the future. What is going to happen? \nThe average cost per year to treat a moderate case of cystic fibrosis \nis $46,000. More severe cases cost roughly $79,000. To date, Heather's \nmedical expenses have exceeded $800,000. Research is going on, but \nright now she will be beyond the cap and on Medicaid.\n  Another one is Lauren Yandell of Williston, VT. Her policy has a cap \nof $1 million. Lauren has a son who has suffered from a chronic and \nvery rare neurological disease since birth. Because of medications and \nfrequent surgery and personal care, his medical expenses are extremely \nhigh--last year alone, over $70,000. He is only 5 years old. At this \nrate, Lauren believes her son will exhaust the limit within 10 years.\n  Barbara Church, in Shelburne, VT--these are Vermonters, but there are \npeople like this all over the Nation. Barbara has a 12-year-old son who \nwas in a car accident 3 years ago. He has a very similar condition to \nChristopher Reeve. Since the accident, medical expenses have ranged \nfrom $20,000 to $50,000 annually. Her policy through her employer does \nnot have a cap, and she is wary because if she loses her job, as it is \nunder this law now, and she tries to go somewhere, she will not have \nthe cap, or it may be only $50,000. There is no protection for her.\n  These are the kinds of real-life situations. Is it appropriate for us \nto say that the way these people should get their continuous care is to \nget rid of all their assets and live in poverty for the rest of their \nlives, as long as their child survives? No, that is not what the policy \nof this Nation ought to be. This amendment would make sure that those \noccurrences do not occur.\n  I hope that people will take into consideration that this is an \namendment which will correct the deficiencies in the bill before us by \nsaying that there will be a cap out there, which will be sufficient to \ntake care of the expenses of these people to whom we are saying, ``You \nhave a good deal because you can continue your coverage.'' Right now, \nthe expectations are not there, and they can be changed at any moment.\n  So I want to urge you to consider that this is something that is \nimportant to the bill before us. It is an amendment to the bill before \nus. It is to correct the serious problem in the bill before us. What we \nare talking about here, as far as the impact, is, obviously, if \nsomebody is paying some money, somebody is going to have to shell out \nsome money somewhere else. If they are being paid to have their health \ntaken care of--first of all, let me review for a moment the kinds of \ncosts involved with these actions.\n  Look at this chart. It will show you about children with hemophilia. \nThere are about 7,000 children with hemophilia, not many in terms of \n250 million. The average cost per year per person is $100,000. Life \nexpectancy is 40 years. Lifetime cost per person for hemophilia is $4 \nmillion. Do you want to put them all under Medicaid?\n  Cystic fibrosis, the case I talked about earlier; the prevalence is \nabout 4,000 in this country. That is not many relative to the huge \npopulation. It is easy to spread around the cost. The average cost per \nperson per year is $18,000, and the average life expectancy is 30 \nyears; $2.5 million.\n  This is the kind of situation which we are talking about.\n  Let us take a look. There are other examples. Spinal injury and head \ntrauma, you can also see where the costs are--around $5 million for a \nlifetime situation.\n  Now let us review the question of why this is going to be a \nreasonable cost with respect to the existing situation. Again, \ninsurance--the main purpose of insurance is to spread costs over a \nlarger population so that the cost is small to the employer and to the \nemployee with the insurance policy. But because of the huge number for \nwhich we spread it, it makes it reasonable for a family to afford.\n  Let me remind all of my colleagues that we all have no lifetime cap. \nNone of the Federal employees have anything to worry about. We are all \ncovered, whatever the costs are. In addition to that, as this chart \nshows, we are one of the 20 percent in this country that have no limits \nwhatsoever. There are those that have more than $1 million, about 6 \npercent. The biggest group is that one that has been carrying the $1 \nmillion forward for the last 20 years as long they have been in \nbusiness. That is 46 percent. So already we are at over 70 percent. \nThen we go on down.\n  I will be candid with you. The lower, of course, your lifetime caps, \nespecially when you get to the really low levels, you obviously start \ncovering more things than normally, and you end up with more cost. But \nthe thing I am trying to make sure you understand is the cost that is \nspread around is not that high.\n  Let us take a look at what some of the people say about what those \ncosts would be. First of all, let me run through some of these that \nhave given us some costs.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries, for instance, has given us a cost \nanalysis which demonstrates what we are talking about. Let me go to \nPrice Waterhouse first. Price Waterhouse is a noted accounting firm, \nwhich we often look to give us accurate information, estimates that the \nJeffords amendment would save $7 billion in Medicaid costs--$7 \nbillion--over 7 years. And more importantly, the cost to businesses \nwould be somewhere in the area of--especially those in the larger \nareas--would be somewhere around 1 percent of their premiums.\n  Let us go to another one. We have several on this.\n  Also the National Taxpayers Union; let me tell the people on my side \nof the aisle what the National Taxpayers Union says. They are \nsupporting it. They say it will be scored as a direct spending \nreduction in the Medicaid Program by approximately $2.8 billion over a \n5-year period. In addition, $2.1 billion may be saved through State and \nlocal Medicaid Programs.\n  How can you say that this is not something that should be done when \nwe know what it is going to do to help us address the budget problems \nwhich we have? Do you know what that amount of money means? That is \ngoing to be replaced by the insurance premiums? But it does not even \ncover the money that is drained out of all those families that went out \nfor expenditures on health care.\n  The Consumers Union, the other side of the aisle usually looks \nforward to the lifetime cap amendment which would significantly benefit \nconsumers. The Consumers Union agrees that, if\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nhealth insurance policies have lifetime caps, it would be no lower than \n$10 million to the people exposed. They say it is important and \nessential.\n  Then, of course, we have to look to the Congressional Budget Office \nand we have CBO's estimates. This came to us today. The Congressional \nBudget Office says the amendment would increase the Federal deficit. \nThey are the only ones who say it is a cost after you balance out the \ndeductions for taxes--$120 million. So by the worst-case scenario we \nhave an offset for this. You could have a tiny, itty-bitty negative \nimpact of $120 million over 5 years.\n  So it is almost a no-brainer. It is hard to find out why anybody is \nagainst it.\n  This is the Congressional Budget Office again. The proposal would \ninitially raise private insurance premiums by 0.4 percent. You want to \nkeep in mind that, if you are an employer, you have options. You can \nincrease your premiums, or you can increase your deductibles.\n  So it may not even cost the businessman anything. So again, the \nCongressional Budget Office says that we have something here which \neither costs nothing or something which is going to save the Treasury \nbillions of dollars over 7 years.\n  So it is just hard for me to figure out why there can be any \nopposition to do this. Not only that. But Senator Kennedy, and I think \nSenator Kassebaum, have suggested that this is a great amendment and \nthat it ought to be on some other bill. What other bill? Why not the \none it is most relevant to? Why not on the one with which we are trying \nto make sure is helping people with their transfer from job to job?\n  I understand the complexity of trying to get a bill through without \nany amendments on it. But I remind everyone that we have already \ngranted exceptions to the Finance Committee, and I asked the committee \nthat be one of those exemptions because I offered it at the committee \nlevel, and they said, ``No way. Take it to the floor.'' I come to the \nfloor. They say, ``Sorry. No amendments even though it is relevant to \nthe bill.'' It will save the middle-income people billions of dollars. \nIt will not cost employers hardly anything, and it will establish for \nthe first time a good policy in this situation so that we do not drive \npeople through poverty to qualify for Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jayson \nSlotnik, a fellow on my staff, be permitted to be on the floor during \nthe action on S. 1028.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Jeffords' \namendment. I am blessed to be a cosponsor of that. He mentioned the \ncase of Christopher Reeves. Christopher Reeves and an actor named Robin \nWilliams, when they were students, made a pact that they would support \none another if they ever faced this kind of an emergency. Robin \nWilliams, as an actor who makes a great deal of money, is able to help \nChristopher Reeves. But what about the thousands of Americans who do \nnot have a Robin Williams?\n\n  It is very interesting. Senator Jeffords talked about the cost. We \nchanged the Federal insurance. In other words, all Federal employees, \nincluding everyone here in the Senate right now--all of us--had some \nchanges. We had two major changes. The most costly was adding mental \nhealth coverage for all Members--not only Members but all Federal \nemployees. Do you know what that cost? It costs 27 cents each pay \nperiod. That is the additional mental health coverage cost. Twice a \nmonth we pay 27 cents. I tried to find out what taking the $1 million \ncap off cost us, and nobody knows what it cost. It is such a small \namount.\n  My guess is, if you took that chart that Senator Jeffords has there \nof companies that have a $1 million limit and the 22 percent that do \nnot have any limit, that you would find really no difference in the \nrates charged; no pattern of difference. You are talking about \nsomething that does not affect very many Americans. So the total cost \nis very limited.\n  I talked earlier today--four reporters stopped me out here, as they \nstop all of us. I said to the reporters, when they were asking me about \nthis, ``Do you know what kind of limits you have on your insurance?'' \nWell, Adam Clymer of the New York Times knew, but the other three \nreporters did not know. I think very few Americans have any idea what \nkind of limit they have. They just know they are covered by insurance \nor they are not.\n  We should not impoverish people before we protect them. That is what \nwe do with Medicaid. I think the Jeffords amendment makes a great deal \nof sense, and I am proud to support it and proud to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it grieves me greatly to rise to indicate \nmy reservation about this amendment on this particular bill. I know how \nhard the Senator has worked on this project, and in any other forum I \nwould be a strong supporter. I am very familiar with Chris Reeves. He \nis a resident of my State out in the Berkshires. He was a strong \nsupporter of mine in the last campaign, a personal friend as well. I am \nvery familiar with the real challenges--first of all, the extraordinary \ncourage of this absolutely incredible human being. It is what I think \nof first when I think of Christopher Reeves. As he has pointed out so \nwell, the human tragedy of others who are facing these kinds of \nsituations is incredible and incredibly difficult, and all of us are \nfamiliar with stories of families being bankrupt because of these \nceilings which are out there. Most of them were about $1 million just \nuntil very recently, some of them as high as $2 million.\n  I agree with the Senator, and it pains me to oppose him on this \nparticular measure. I was mindful of that during his presentation.\n\n  I ask the Senator what his disposition is, whether he might take a \nvoice vote here. Does he prefer that we make a tabling motion, or is he \nwilling to take----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That, of course, is the Senator's option. I cannot \nstand here representing 100 groups who support this amendment and \ntaking into consideration the tremendous effort that Christopher Reeves \nhas put into this personally to try and convince this body to do this \nreasonable thing, and not, unfortunately, from the Senator's \nperspective, ask for a recorded vote. I do not mean to embarrass the \nMembers on this, but I just remind them that I was told I could come to \nthe floor and offer it, and I am being precluded. But I understand that \nall got changed as we went along the way, and I do not hold any grudges \nagainst anybody. I understand you have to stand by that no amendment \noutside of the Finance Committee. I just would suggest to my colleagues \nthat they are not bound by any such thing and would urge them to vote \nin favor of the amendment.\n  Incidentally, I have now heard something which occurs when you get \npeople nervous here, that there has been a rush to find a new cost from \nCBO, and apparently they are ready to rush over and claim I do not have \nenough money.\n  Well, I am always ready for those circumstances, and we are rushing \nover with an amendment which will put a sufficient amount of money in \nit so I do not get into a budget problem. If they are not around, if we \ncan just get the yeas and nays without going through the necessity of \nme amending the amendment, that is fine, too.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to be very clear. I had joined with the chairman \nof the committee in indicating I would oppose amendments on this that \nvirtually were not unanimously accepted. I should like very much to \naccept it.\n  As I mentioned earlier in the day, there are many different features \nwhich I should like to add.\n  I can remember very well I had a son who was in an NIH program, and \nthey terminated the NIH support. It was $3,200 for the treatment they \nhad to give those children every 3 weeks for 3 days for 2 years, and I \nwas able to afford it. Mothers and families were out there saying, \nwell, my child only gets 5 months, 6 months. What chance does that \nchild have to live?\n  I am very mindful of these situations. I feel very strongly about \nthem,\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\nand I feel very sympathetic, too. But I am also mindful that we need \nthis legislation, and we have made a commitment at the time which I \nhope the Senator from Vermont will understand. I joined with the \nchairman of the committee to that effect. But I will be glad to join \nwith him at another time. But we are going to abide at least by the \nassurances we gave to the other members of the committee. At the \nappropriate time I will, or the chairman of the committee can, make a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I cannot speak for the chief sponsor, but when you ask for \na voice vote, the Senator from Massachusetts has a strong voice. If he \nwill be fairly silent in that voice vote, I would be willing to take a \nvoice vote, but I cannot speak for the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may, I, too, am very sympathetic \nto the issue that Senator Jeffords is addressing. I think we all \nrecognize--I believe the figures are almost 1,500 Americans at least \nthat would benefit from this legislation. It is more than just the \nenormous financial cost. It is an emotional and difficult issue.\n  However, our agreement was not just with the Finance Committee. \nUnless there is a consensus of support on both sides of the aisle, then \nwe have to oppose the amendments. I think the Senator from Vermont \nknows there are many in the business community, particularly the small \nbusiness community, that have been opposed to this, who worry a great \ndeal about the implications of it and have said they would oppose the \nwhole bill if amendments like this one would be added. We felt that the \nunderlying amendment offered so much that we then had to also oppose \nthose other amendments which I think have much merit, and it is with \nregret that I would, too, have to oppose it. I certainly am willing to \nhave a rollcall vote. I think it will be up to the sponsor of the \nlegislation to determine that.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I make a motion to table the Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to amend my amendment first to have plenty \nof money in there so nobody can----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not going to make that argument. That is fine.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. All right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it is all right with Senator Kassebaum. I have no \nobjection to either doing it--we are not making a point of order on the \nmoney or questioning it at this time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3680 to Amendment No. 3679\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce delinquencies and to improve debt-collection \n          activities government-wide, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to preclude that objection from being \nregistered, so, Mr. President, I have an amendment to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment.\n  Is this an amendment to the amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is an amendment to the amendment. I \nwill ask to have it reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3680 to amendment No. 3679.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with or we will be here the rest of the \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. What this does, Mr. President, is take an amount of \nmoney which has been verified by CBO, which has yet to be utilized and \nalso verified by OMB, that will cover any conceivable cost of this \nbill, to make sure someone does not come back and say I failed to cover \nany cost of that.\n  I understand there will be maybe a motion to table. Let me just urge \nmy colleagues to please remember what we are trying to do here. You \nhave 100 disability groups of people who are in favor of this \namendment. You have estimates which indicate that we have eliminated \nall the small businesses 25 or under. We have not pulled lifetime caps. \nWe have gone to $10 million, which is exactly the value of what they \nwere many years ago when the million dollar cap was in fashion.\n  What we are trying to do is prevent people going into bankruptcy in \norder to qualify for Medicaid in order to take care of their sick ones. \nIt also improves this bill because this bill would allow an insurance \ncompany--although they are forced to take somebody on the policy, they \ncan lower the lifetime caps and chop them off after a year again, and \nthen they are back out on the street looking for care and back onto \nMedicaid.\n  With that, I would suffer the indulgence of a tabling motion at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3680) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Does any Senator wish further debate on the \namendment, as amended?\n  If not, I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has moved to table the \namendment of the Senator from Vermont, as amended.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask if there could be about a 5-\nminute delay to notify everybody to come.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask that we now proceed to vote on \nthe motion to table the amendment of the Senator from Vermont. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, No. 3679.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] \nand the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 74 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simpson\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Helms\n     Jeffords\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Campbell\n     Mack\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3679) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Domenici has been seeking \nrecognition, and I believe he is willing to enter into a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Wellstone, how much time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think I need about 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From the standpoint of proponents, we will settle on 35 \nminutes. You all can take whatever you would like.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that we have 40 minutes on the \nDomenici-Wellstone amendment, 35 minutes to be under the control of \nSenators Domenici and Wellstone, and 5 minutes under the control of \nSenator Kassebaum.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator from Massachusetts know how many \namendments and when we might expect to finish tonight?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On our side there would probably be--we have Senator \nBoxer's amendment, which I think will take a very short period of time. \nWe have Senator Conrad on visa, which I think we can work out. We are \nwaiting for the report of the chairman on the immigration control. \nSenator Simon, a sense-of-the-Senate which I think will be very short. \nWe are on the Domenici-Wellstone now. There is one by Senator Dorgan on \nthe organ cards, which hopefully we can accept.\n  I do not think we have any amendments here that would require very \nmuch time to deal with.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwould yield, there may be some amendments offered that will be \nwithdrawn--not all have been agreed to or cleared. I think we are \nmoving forward. We wish to complete this by 9:30 or 10 o'clock tonight \nat the latest. We need to know exactly who will be wanting a rollcall \nvote on their amendments. I think that is what everyone would like to \nknow.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment will be next. There will be a rollcall \nvote I believe. At that point, we should know how many more votes would \nactually be ahead of us.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would it be out of the question to stack some votes \ntonight?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. We thought not. We thought it best to move forward. \nAfter the next vote, we will be able to tell you exactly how many more \nrollcall votes there will be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When you ask the Senator from Kansas a direct question, \nshe gives you a direct answer, right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous-consent agreement before \nthe Senate. The Senator from Massachusetts was propounding one, but it \nwas not formally propounded.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the \nDomenici amendment that there be 40 minutes, with 35 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senators Domenici and Wellstone, 5 minutes under the control \nof Senator Kassebaum and the Senator from Massachusetts, and that there \nbe no second-degree amendments in order to the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3681\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that parity is provided under health plans for \n                    severe mental illness services)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself and \n     Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3681.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes and ask that I \nbe advised when I have used 9 minutes of that time.\n  Mr. President, it is with a degree of regret that I have to bring \nthis amendment to the floor on this bill because I understand that \nSenators Kassebaum, Kennedy, and the committee of jurisdiction have \nworked very hard on the basic bill that is before us. They have made \nsome commitments, which I gather, based on the last vote, that they \ntake very seriously. They are going to try to keep this bill clean.\n  I have to say to my fellow Senators that when you are involved and \nunderstand what is going on out there in America with reference to the \nmentally ill people and their inability to get adequate insurance \ncoverage, which I will explain in a little more detail to the Senate, \nyou have to take every opportunity you can to try to effect some major \nchange.\n  The country, in terms of insuring people for various physical \ndisabilities has come a long way. But this country, in terms of \ninsuring mentally ill people, is going backward instead of forward, \nbecause as insurance costs go up, insurance company after insurance \ncompany is finding a way to try to write cheaper and cheaper insurance, \nand they look for ways to drop groups of people from coverage by saying \nthey are not covering them, or are covering them so inadequately that \nthey are left back in the arms of their parents or relatives. So this \nis happening dramatically across America. When it comes to mental \nillnesses, I submit that I know a little bit more about severe mental \nillnesses because I have worked actively in committees on that issue \nfor a long time.\n  But if you happen to be a parent of somebody who has schizophrenia, a \nvery serious mental disease, and not some figment--it did not come \nbecause somebody's mother did not take care of them properly; it is a \nsevere disease of the brain. If you happen to have one of those kinds \nof persons in your family and you have an insurance policy that is \ntypical in America, it will, for the most part, not cover very much, it \nwill have a cap that is very insignificant, and it will be very \ndistinct from the rest of the policy coverage. In other words, they \nwill go out of their way to cover mental illness differently and with \nless coverage than the basic coverage they are giving to physical \nailments, diseases that we all understand.\n  The time has come--and we can wait once again, but I believe it is \ntonight--to send a signal that while we have a bill before us that is \ngoing to alter some serious shortcomings in insurance coverage in \nAmerica--and we understand what they are and we compliment the \ncommittee for taking one good bite at this problem--but those of us who \nare worried about the problem of mental health and mental illness, \nincluding severe mental illnesses, like manic depression, severe \ndepression, bipolar or serious depression, we understand that there is \nmedication available, there is treatment available. But, occasionally, \nthey have to be treated in an atmosphere that costs a lot of money, in \nan environment that costs a lot of money.\n\n  This amendment is very simple. I am offering it with my friend, \nSenator Wellstone. Essentially, Mr. President, it prohibits insurers \nand health plans from imposing treatment restrictions or financial \nrequirements on services for the mentally ill that it does not impose \non services for the physically ill.\n  We offer this today, although this country has come a long way in \nunderstanding and recognizing the special problems of people suffering \nfrom mental illness. We understand that structural and institutional \ndiscrimination continues and persists in our society. Stigmas are \nrampant in this area, and I am referring to another kind of \ndiscrimination--that is, the way health insurers and health plans treat \nthese individuals, and I believe this situation represents one of the \nreal continuing injustices in America today.\n  Although we now understand that mental illnesses are, in fact, for \nthe most part, physical illnesses, they are still treated differently \nthan other physical conditions. The only difference between the other \nphysical ailments and mental illness is that mental illness is a \ndisease of the brain, and it may be more complicated, but we are making \nexcellent strides at understanding it. Because this disease manifests \nitself in our centers of thought, reason, and emotion, many find it \neasy to deride those problems and to deride those who are afflicted, or \nturn their back on the problem, or act as if the problem does not \nexist. Mental illness is not due to sinful behavior. It is not due to a \nweakness, or frail character. These illnesses are real, and they are\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\ndebilitating, and there are many who suffer from them. Nearly 5 million \nAmericans suffer from severe forms of mental illness. I will repeat \njust a few of them.\n\n  Schizophrenia affects about 2 million adults a year. And I repeat, \nnobody is at fault because somebody has schizophrenia and acts \ndifferently and reasons differently. They are just as sick as your \nneighbor who has cancer.\n  Yet only 2 percent of all individuals with mental illnesses are \ncovered by insurance which provides benefits equal to the coverage for \nphysical illnesses. I stated that in generalities a while ago. Now, \nhere is the objective number. Through narrowing down the definitions \nthrough caps that are irresponsible but save money so insurance \ncompanies do it in their own self-interest, only 2 percent of Americans \nwith mental illness are covered with the same degree of coverage as if \nthey got tuberculosis or cancer instead of manic-depression or \nschizophrenia.\n  You can walk down any street in urban America and you will find them. \nIt is time to give these people access to care they need, and as you \nsee them in urban America sleeping on grates and other things, you \nshould realize that they probably started out as wonderful teenage \nchildren in some beautiful family. And when the costs got prohibitive \nand the behavior uncontrollable, they are abandoned. In fact, you find \nmore of them in jails than in the institutions which we ought to have \nto help them. Most studies reveal that most of the severely mentally \nill are in prisons or county or city jails because of misbehavior than \nin places we put together to treat them. Part of that is because \nresources are not applied, and part of the reason resources are not \napplied is because the insurance companies--I am not here angry at \nthem, I am not here fighting with insurance companies. Because what \nthey say is, ``How do we make money? So if we lessen the coverage for \nmental health, we get a better bargain for people who want coverage for \nthe other things.'' But I am submitting that sooner or later we have to \nsay to them that you all have to cover them. If you are covering \nphysical illness and they get 6 months of hospitalization, you have to \ndo the same for mentally ill people. If not, nobody is going to care \nfor them.\n  Let me tell you, I have seen purposely and intentionally how this \ndestroys families. I have been to the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill meetings with 1,000 of the finest people in America who \nare there talking about their children, and in many cases they are lost \nbecause they could not afford to pay for them when they were 19 and 20, \nand they do not even know where they are. Somebody in this society is \npaying for that. For the most part, the ill are paying for it, for they \nare not getting taken care of right.\n\n  I thought a bill that was aimed at correcting the lack of coverage in \nthe private insurance industry of America--because you choose and pick \ninsurance companies to cover what you want and what you do not want you \ndo not cover--we came today to the Senate and in 1 day or 2 are going \nto pass a marvelous bill that says, in two areas, you are all going to \ncover something. I am just asking tonight that, in three areas, you say \nyou are going to cover something.\n  I know the motion to table will be made, and the argument will be \nmade that this is not the right time. And, of course, I am taking a \ngamble, because with that kind of power, I might lose this amendment. \nBut let me suggest, if we do--and I hope we do not--you can count on \nit, we are going to be back here, and we are going to find and look \nuntil we find a vehicle that sets this thing straight.\n  Mr. President, when that bill was sent to the desk, I saw some \nSenators watch it go up there and they saw this very thick bill. I do \nnot want you to think there is all kinds of language in there about \nmental illness. What we have to do is pay for this.\n  So much of that bill is to defer the cost in the first 5 years of \nthis bill, and we have used offsets that are acceptable, which Senator \nWellstone and I have used at other times here but have not become law. \nSo we have offset it as best we could. That is what most of that is.\n  It is a rather simple bill. We could narrow it down. We chose not to. \nWe talk about mental illness. That includes all of the severe ones, but \nit includes more, and it says as part of treatment, no more \ndiscrimination, no more treating them differently.\n  We have cost estimates. If it was done across the board in all \npolicies, it would add about 1.6 percent net to the insurance coverage \nacross the land. It obviously would not happen overnight. It would take \nsome time. But, essentially, we want to give the Senate an opportunity \nto vote on this tonight.\n  That is my explanation for now. I want to say thanks to Senator \nWellstone. He has been kind of my friend working on this for a long \ntime. There are some other Senators on board.\n\n  I want to yield to him now 7 minutes of my time for him to tell us \nhis version of why we ought to do that.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here with my \ncolleague, Senator Pete Domenici, to introduce an amendment on an issue \nthat I feel very strongly about. Our amendment deals with one issue, \nand we hope that we have our colleagues' vote tonight: equitable health \ncare coverage for mental illness services.\n  Mr. President, let me say it has been a real honor to work with \nSenator Domenici on this issue. He has been a real leader, as has his \nwife, Nancy, and I personally appreciate all of their efforts.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, which would require that \nhealth plans to provide coverage for mental health services \ncommensurate with what is provided for other physical illnesses.\n  For too long, mental health has been put in parenthesis; we did not \nwant to talk about it, and we did not take it seriously as a country. \nThe stigma of mental illness has kept many in need from seeking help, \nand it has prevented policymakers from providing it. And for too long, \npersons in need of mental health services who reach private coverage \ndiscriminatory limits have been dumped onto Government-funded programs.\n  Mr. President, I support a universal health coverage plan, and \ncomprehensive benefits for mental health services. While we failed to \nenact legislation to achieve this during the 103d Congress, we did \nincrease awareness. But now we are talking about parity, and awareness \nis not enough.\n  Our amendment would require health plans to provide parity in their \ncoverage of physical and mental health. Plans would be prohibited from \nrequiring copays, or deductibles, for mental health benefits, or \nestablishing lifetime limits for mental health benefits, or \nestablishing visit limitations for mental health services unless the \nsame restrictions apply to other health services.\n  All we ask for is equitable treatment. That is all this amendment \ndoes. All this amendment does is say, please let us stop this \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. President, many people, or most people's instinctive reaction is \nto assume that this amendment would be expensive. This is not the case. \nAs a matter of fact, in my State of Minnesota, where we have already \npassed legislation requiring full parity for mental health and \nsubstance abuse services, this was implemented August 1, 1995, and the \ncost of the parity mandate was estimated to be 26 cents per member \nprovided. Minnesotans who were unable to work full time either because \nthey were too sick or they were forced to impoverish themselves in \norder to qualify for Medicaid benefits, are now able to work and pay \ntaxes and be productive. Because of this discrimination, all too often \npeople cannot work so that they can receive medical assistance. People \nare forced to impoverish themselves in order to qualify for the medical \nassistance they need.\n\n  Now, in Minnesota--this is what we propose to do for our Nation, \nbecause we have parity and we have ended this discrimination--these \nsame Minnesotans are now able to work, to live a life with dignity, and \nto pay their taxes.\n  Mr. President, we have a tremendous body of evidence, new evidence, \nproving that, without a doubt, mental health disorders can be diagnosed \nand treated in a cost-effective manner.\n  In fact, we can show that within a very short period of time it costs \nless\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\nto treat those disorders directly and appropriately than not treat them \nat all. We can say that this is true based upon studies of every sector \nof our population--insured and employed, uninsured and unemployed, \npeople who now use the private system and those who now use the public \nsystem.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, there are several arguments for \nrequiring parity for mental health services. First, we now have cost-\neffective treatments for mental illnesses and high rates of success are \nbeing achieved across the spectrum of diagnosis. For example, 80 \npercent of individuals with depression respond to treatment. Second of \nall, mental illness results in physical illness, inability to work, \nimpaired relationships, and sometimes crime and homelessness.\n  Would it not be better to end the discrimination and have less of the \nhomelessness? Would it not be better to end the discrimination and \nenable people to work and be productive citizens? And finally, Mr. \nPresident, mental health services are already part of health delivery \nin the United States.\n  Let us have no doubt about it, this amendment leaves all decisions \nabout the delivery of services to the private marketplace. The \namendment does not require the provision of mental health services to \nemployees, specify what care should be provided, interfere with the \ndiscretion of employers and health plans to negotiate reimbursement \nrates as they see fit, or mandate the use of any particular kind of \ndelivery of needed care.\n  What this amendment calls for is just parity. Mental illness has \ntouched many of our families and many of our friends. It is for this \nreason and many others that it is not a partisan issue. Mental illness \nis a problem affecting all sectors of American society. It shows up in \nboth the rural and urban areas. It affects men and women, teenagers and \nthe elderly, every ethnic group and people in every tax bracket. It can \nbe effectively treated just like heart disease or diabetes. Treatment \nnot only saves lives but it also saves dollars. That is why this \namendment is so important.\n  I look forward to the adoption of this amendment and to continuing to \nwork with Senator Domenici to end discrimination against this very \nvulnerable population and their families. It is only old data and old \nideas that keep us from covering mental health, the same way we cover \nany other real illness, whether it is acute or chronic.\n  I know there has been some agreement on amendments, but I plead and \nimplore my colleagues to please vote for this amendment. Senator \nDomenici is right. Tonight is just the beginning. If we do not win \ntonight--and I hope we get a very significant vote, and I hope we do \nwin--then, of course, we will come back.\n  Colleagues, please support us. Please end the discrimination. That is \nwhat this amendment is all about.\n  I do not usually do this on the floor of the Senate, but I would like \nto dedicate my remarks to my brother who has struggled with mental \nillness almost his whole life. He is doing great now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator from New Mexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes and 5 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My good friend, Senator Simpson, desires to speak, and \nI yield him 5 minutes. And then, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, I will yield him some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I hope that all Members will read the \namendment. I know sometimes we forget to do that from time to time, it \nis perhaps one of our failings. It is a very simple amendment. It is \ndescribed as ``parity.'' I think the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Minnesota have covered it very well.\n  The important thing that you want to hear regarding it is about the \nrule of its construction. It is just one construction because people \nsay that it is going to be tremendously costly; or that this is going \nto ``open the doors'' or that this is the first step toward incurring \ntremendous cost. But what the amendment says is this:\n\n       Nothing in [the subsection previous] shall be construed as \n     prohibiting an employee health benefit plan, or a health plan \n     issuer offering a group plan, or an individual health plan \n     from requiring preadmission screening prior to the \n     authorization of services covered under the plan or from \n     applying other limitations that restrict coverage for mental \n     health services to those services that are medically \n     necessary.\n\n  I think that is a very important thing. That is a very critical part \nof this.\n  Let me just tell you that about 4 years ago a most beautiful girl in \nour family, the niece of my wife--my wife's twin sister's daughter, \nwhom we had watched grow and mature from her birth--left our midst. She \nwas a dancer; she was an artist; she was a poet; she was a guitarist; \nshe was a singer; she was the rainbow of life.\n  We did not get or understand the signals in time, and the signals \nwere very clear as we all look back now out of sheer guilt and anguish. \nShe was tough minded, independent, loving, strong, and forceful. She \nwould come into your kitchen and just cook up a batch and leave the \nstuff in the sink, and family would say, ``Why doesn't Susan clean up \nafterwards?'' And then, ``Why doesn't Susan work? How old will she be \nbefore she ever works?''\n  She began to withdraw, and then she went into some religious and \nalmost cultish activities, and she had a child. And that is a beautiful \nchild. I know that child. That is the wonderful part of it now--because \nSusan is gone. And after years of reaching out to us in her way and us \nnot hearing and us not knowing, she one day decisively purchased a \npistol and a few hours later purchased the ammunition and went to an \nisolated field, removed her shoes, sat in a the crouched position in \nBowling Green, KY, and blew her chest away.\n  That is what sometimes happens to these people, and we think, \n``well, but they should have tried to do something for themselves.\n\n  We thought we were doing something for her. We thought she was \nfinally doing it for herself. She was taking medication, and it was \nworking. But then something, something unknown, entered her mind and \nher life and she decided not to take the medication --knowing what \nwould happen if she did not--and then her tragic plan of ultimate \nrejection came to pass.\n  There is a group of humans--a particular vulnerable group in society \nthat the mental health workers and professionals tell us about who now \nare in their 37th to their 45th year, who somewhere along the line were \nperhaps those involved in the early experimentation with drugs, yes. \nYes, of course, but that penalty should not be something visited upon \nthem forever. So I say there is not a soul in this Chamber that has not \nbeen grievously affected in some way by these things. It is time for \nhealing. It is time for understanding more than anything. It is time to \nminister. It is time to love and to be compassionate and time to learn \nso much more about these tragic things. For these are the people who \nyou know and see every day, and they are making it, and they never did \nbefore, but they are now. If we can put this in this bill in this way \nwith this language, I think it would be a tremendous benefit to them--\nand they are our first charge--and to the rest of us in society.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I personally thank Senators Domenici and \nWellstone for bringing this amendment to the Chamber tonight.\n  I rarely take the time of my colleagues, in the evening hours, to \nspeak, because I often feel that it is an imposition on their time. \nTonight, I think this amendment is so important that it requires all of \nus to speak. This amendment simply asks that mental illnesses be \ntreated on a parity basis with other illnesses. It is inescapable: An \nillness is an illness. There should be no differentiation between how \nwe treat those who have a mental illness and a physical illness.\n  When I was the assistant tax commissioner in North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan was the tax commissioner. We had a young woman who was our \nreceptionist. She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman. She was \nsomebody\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nwho absolutely lit up an office. One day, she just went off the deep \nend with a mental illness that none of us knew that she had. Pictures \nwere speaking to her. She had all kinds of aberrant thoughts. It led to \nher institutionalization. It led to her attempting to take her own \nlife. That was a young woman, because of a suicide attempt, who did \nenormous damage to herself from which she will never fully recover.\n  That young woman had a mental illness, and that illness deserved to \nbe treated like any other illness. She is not alone. There are millions \nlike her all across America. As we sought to reach out and help this \nyoung woman, I became somewhat educated about what was happening in our \ncommunities. One thing I learned is that we actually treat differently \nthose with a physical illness and those with a mental illness, and it \nis a tragedy.\n  In our State, we have taken the step to recognize that there should \nnot be discrimination between illnesses. What we have found is it does \nnot cost more money. Oh, it does as you begin, but as you go forward, \nit does not cost more money, and it does not cost more money because, \nif you fail to treat, the physical ailments mount and become much more \nexpensive.\n  I would say to my colleagues, we passed this amendment. We passed \nthis in the Finance Committee on Medicaid, during reconciliation. I \noffered the amendment. It was adopted. It passed here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. It was only taken out in conference.\n  We passed it in the Finance Committee based on the best evidence that \nshows over time this will not cost money. I submitted detailed studies \nfrom North Dakota that demonstrate that.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment tonight. It is the \nright thing to do. I hope my colleagues will agree to the Domenici-\nWellstone amendment. They will be proud the rest of their lives that \nthey did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I have difficulty in not commending, which I do, my good friends and \ncolleagues with whom I have worked over a very considerable time on the \nissues of mental health. This is obviously an awkward position for me \nto have these amendments come up and to be fighting these issues. One \nof the first pieces of legislation passed during President Kennedy's \nadministration was the community health programs which got people out \nof institutions, and into the community. I worked with Senator Domenici \nand Senator Wellstone in 1990 to move the whole mental health research \nout to NIH, against strong opposition at that time. In the health \ninsurance bill that we passed last year, we had effective equivalence \nbetween mental health and physical health, though there were some \naspects of hospitalization that were phased in over a period of time.\n  So I am strongly sympathetic. I just regret this. Hopefully, it will \nbe defeated. Maybe we are going to continue to have these votes so \npeople are able to speak to them. Once again, I can understand the \nfrustration because we have not gone ahead on it.\n  It is painful for many of us who are strongly committed to the whole \nissue of eliminating preexisting condition and our strong commitment to \nthat, to have to go on record in opposition to these amendments. But if \nthat is the cost, and Members of the Senate feel that is what they want \nto do to many of us who have been out there working on precondition \nyear in and year out, we are prepared to do it.\n  I will join in urging that the Senate table this at the first \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 4 minutes 26 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I certainly do not intend by my action \ntonight to make it painful for Senator Kennedy, who has been a staunch \nadvocate. I hope that is not what he said tonight. I just believe very, \nvery sincerely that the time is now to get something done.\n  I want to explain one more time in just a brief, few words what this \namendment does not do, because I think there could be some confusion. \nLet me clear up what it does not do. It does not provide an open-ended \nentitlement to whatever mental health services an individual wants. It \ndoes not limit the ability of an insurer or health plan to limit \nservices to only those who are medically necessary. It does not \ninstitute a service-by-service equivalency between physical and mental \nillness. It does not mandate a benefit package.\n  It simply makes the following common situations illegal. Let me cite \na few:\n  Policies that allow 365 days in-patient care for physical illness \nallow only 45 days for in-patient psychiatric care.\n  Policies that provide a lifetime cap of $1 million for physical care \nhave a $50,000 cap for mental illness.\n  Policies providing unlimited outpatient visits for physical care \nallow only 20 outpatient visits for mental illnesses.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of employer-sponsored plans impose such \nlimits, despite the proven efficacy of treatments for mental illness. \nTreatment for schizophrenia has a 60 percent success rate; manic \ndepression, 80 percent; major depression, 65 percent. Yet commonly \nreimbursed procedures such as angioplasty and arthrectomy have only a \n41-percent and a 52-percent ratio, and nobody seeks to treat them with \nlimitations that are imposed on mental illnesses.\n  The era of managed care is upon us, making tight management of \npatient care the norm, and artificial cost measures to reduce \nutilization are a thing of the past.\n  I have a number of examples of companies that have covered with \nparity of treatment and, believe it or not, they have saved money and \nadded to their work force in ways that are measurable and objectively \nbeneficial to the companies that have so seen fit.\n  So, from my standpoint, from the standpoint of the Senator from New \nMexico, I do not seek to kill this bill. I think it is a marvelous step \nin the right direction. But I ask my fellow Senators when, if not \ntonight, will we ever get around to this issue? If I thought there was \nanother bill coming down this year, I would probably have made an \nagreement so that I could have the full support of my friend from \nMassachusetts and my colleague and friend from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum. But I do not see that coming.\n\n  I believe there is plenty of evidence that the discrimination \ncontinues. It grows more rampant. The stigma, since that discrimination \nis rampant, is growing instead of diminishing, in an era when knowledge \nis beginning to grow almost exponentially.\n  So, now is the time. Tonight is the time to send this to conference. \nDeny the motion to table. Let our Senate colleagues take this to \nconference. Let us work on the various interests that will be part of \nthat conference and see if we cannot make this a better bill because it \nwould have this amendment attached than it would if it fails tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I know that many here would like to \nvote in favor of this amendment offered by Senator Domenici, and \nSenator Wellstone is one. It has been carefully crafted.\n  There is no greater dedication to this legislation than from those \nwho have spoken to us, as well as Senator Kennedy who, for a long time, \nhas been a great supporter.\n  So it is with real disappointment, if all debate is over, that I will \nhave to move to table, as it is not an amendment that has consensus of \nsupport. And so for that reason, I only hope we can find some other \navenue later through which we can address this.\n  I move to table the Domenici-Wellstone amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 14 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from Kansas has 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 3681.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado, [Mr. Campbell] \nand the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 33, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 75 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--33\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Smith\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Campbell\n     Mack\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3681) was \nrejected.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we are making progress. I wonder if \nthe managers might be able to identify those amendments that would \nrequire rollcall votes and have the debate on those amendments, and \nthen we can advise our other colleagues that did not have amendments \nthat we would probably be voting, say, at 10 o'clock or 9:30, or \nwhatever it might be. That would save everybody from having to stay on \nthe floor. When you stay on the floor, sometimes you get excited and \ntalk.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, on our \nside, I understand that Senator Specter would like to have a vote. He \nhas two amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. En bloc?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would assume we could vote en bloc.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am right here and ready to go, madam manager.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. All right. I am not sure about Senator Thomas, \nwhether he will want a vote on his, and Senator Gramm. I believe those \nare the only amendments that I have listed that would require--Senator \nBurns, I believe, has one on telemedicine.\n  Mr. COATS. I have one, also.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thought we were going to try to work that out.\n  Mr. COATS. We are not able to work that out, so we are going to have \nto have a vote on it.\n  Mr. DOLE. How many from the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have the Conrad amendment on J-1 visas, which is \nacceptable. We have one other amendment where somebody wants to \nintroduce it, speak, and withdraw it. Senator Dorgan's amendment on \norgan donor, which, I believe, has been accepted, with Senator Frist. \nWe have Senator Harkin's, and we are waiting to see whether Senator \nWellstone wants to work out an exchange of language or a vote. And \nthere is a Senator Boxer sense of the Senate.\n  Some of those, as I mentioned--the Conrad visa amendment, and the \norgan donor amendment--have been worked out. I think they will just \ntake very brief comments.\n  Mr. DOLE. So that will be two votes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Potentially, four. I hope we get it down to three.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me encourage my colleagues, if there is an opportunity \nto work these out on either side, we hope we can do that and not \nrequire a rollcall vote. If you are going to work out your amendment \nand it is accepted without rollcall votes, I will look very kindly on \nthose amendments. I will be a conferee.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated \non the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3681) was agreed to\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Democratic leader \nwanted to add a word.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader whether or not, \nto accommodate a couple of our colleagues, who, I think, were working \nunder the understanding that we might be able to stack votes, whether \nor not it may be possible to stack the next two or three votes so as to \naccommodate some of those who may have left with that understanding. \nWould that be possible?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am satisfied with that. I think it is a good idea.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. As long as there are so few left.\n  Mr. DOLE. We can stack three or four votes back to back, accept the \nrest of them, and have final passage.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we are going to stack them, do we know approximately \nwhen the votes will start?\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time will the Senator from Pennsylvania take?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, responding to the majority leader's \nquestion, I think it can be disposed of in 20 minutes, 10 minutes a \nside.\n  Mr. DOLE. Each amendment, or both?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am going to start with the first amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We would take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let us say an hour from now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Votes will start then, an hour from now?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3682\n\n(Purpose: To reauthorize and expand the healthy start program to target \n areas in need and to implement community driven strategies to reduce \n                           infant mortality)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3682.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . REAUTHORIZATION OF HEALTHY START PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--To enable the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out the \n     healthy start program established under the authority of \n     section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241), \n     there are authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 1997 through 2001.\n       (b) Existing Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the amount appropriated under \n     subsection (a) for a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall reserve $30,000,000 for such fiscal year \n     among demonstration projects that received funding under the \n     healthy start program for fiscal year 1996.\n       (2) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive funds under \n     paragraph (1), an existing demonstration projects shall \n     demonstrate to the satisfaction of Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services that such project has been successful in \n     serving needy areas and reducing infant mortality.\n       (3) Use of projects.--A demonstration project that receives \n     funding under paragraph (1) shall be utilized as a resource \n     center to assist in the training of those individuals to be \n     involved in projects established\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\n     under subsection (c). It shall be the goal of such projects \n     to become self-sustaining within the project area.\n       (c) New Projects.--Of the amount appropriated under \n     subsection (a) for a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall allocate the remaining amounts for such \n     fiscal year among up to 35 new demonstration projects. Such \n     projects shall be community-based and shall attempt to \n     replicate healthy start model projects that have been \n     determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     be successful.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an amendment which provides for \nreauthorization of Healthy Start. This amendment would reauthorize the \nHealthy Start program for an additional 5 years at $100 million a year. \nIt is important that the reauthorization occur on this bill because, \ngiven the Senate calendar, it is highly doubtful that this issue will \nbe raised on any other bill.\n  In my capacity as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for \nHealth and Human Services, I can say with some authority that we need \nthe authorization so that we are prepared to make the appropriate \nappropriations.\n  Healthy Start is a program which is designed to provide prenatal care \nto infants. I saw my first 1-pound baby more than a decade ago at the \nAlma Ellery Clinic in Pittsburgh and, at that time, I saw a baby about \nas big as my hand, weighing a pound. Some babies weigh as little as 12 \nounces, and they are human tragedies, carrying scars for a lifetime, \nand they are very expensive for our society, costing as much as \n$250,000 each.\n  In my position on the Appropriations Committee, I worked to start \nthis program of Healthy Start, and it has had a really remarkable \nsuccess. It has been in existence for 5 years, which is a relatively \nshort period of time. But we already have statistics available that \nshow the success of the program.\n  The 1994 statistics received from the projects demonstrated that from \n1984 to 1988, baseline statistics in Philadelphia show that infant \nmortality had decreased some 28 percent. In Pittsburgh, the infant \nmortality rate decreased 20 percent since the start of the Healthy \nStart Program in 1993.\n  The Maternal and Child Health Bureau reports that for the State of \nNew York, between 1990 and 1994, infant mortality rates decreased by 38 \npercent in the Healthy Start project area, compared to a 22 percent \ndecline citywide.\n  Without going into any greater demonstration of statistics, Mr. \nPresident, I think it is apparent that Healthy Start is an important \nprogram. Dr. Koop commented that with these minimal four prenatal \nvisits, women carrying children would not give birth to low-birthweight \nbabies. It, obviously, has been a very important program. It exists in \nsome 22 cities at the present time: Boston; New York; Philadelphia; \nPittsburgh; Baltimore; Washington, the DCPD region; South Carolina; \nBirmingham, AL; Cleveland, OH. I read these listings so that my \ncolleagues will know how many of these units are in existence in their \nlocales. Troy, IN; Chicago, IL; New Orleans; the Northern Plains Indian \nReservations; communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa; Oakland, \nCA; and special projects in Dallas, TX; Essex County, NJ; the Florida \nPanhandle; Milwaukee, WI; the Mississippi Delta; Richmond, VA; and \nSavannah, GA.\n\n  The plan is to expand these projects from the 17 projects which are \nnow--from the 22 projects which are now in existence, to an additional \n35 projects.\n  Mr. President, I think the value of this program is apparent on its \nface. It has been in existence for 5 years. It has been very successful \nand does not encumber or impede this bill in any way.\n  It is a little hard to understand why it is not accepted, but I think \nit ought to command the attention of this House and the House of \nRepresentatives. And I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, is the Senator from Pennsylvania going \nto offer a second-degree amendment at this time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Is the Senator going to wait until quarter of 10 to \nspeak on that? We are stacking the votes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand we are stacking the votes. At this time I \nam offering this amendment and speaking about this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand the floor is open for amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment which needs to be \nset aside by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand, if I am not mistaken, that we are going to \nstack these votes. Is the Senator getting a vote right now under the \nregular order? The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I understand it, we are stacking the amendments. But \nI am not prepared to set the amendment aside at this point. I would \nlike to see if the managers have contrary argument.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, yes. This is not acceptable. The \nreason is that it is authorizing legislation which I believe needs to \ncome through committee and the committee procedure before we would \nauthorize this on this bill regarding health insurance reform.\n  That would be the objection of the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in response to the comments of the \nSenator from Kansas, it is my strong view that a healthy start program \nis directly germane and directly relevant to the pending legislation on \nhealth care and that it is a jurisdictional question. I do not quite \nunderstand the argument. This program has been in existence, has been a \nsuccess, and there has been no denial by the managers that it is in \nexistence and has been a success. It is hardly the kind of program \nwhich is going to require additional hearings. It seems to me that it \nis right for disposition. That is why I am offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I stated the reasons why we have an \nobjection. It is a program that has had some success. That is very \ntrue. And healthy start is very important. It is part of other programs \nin the public health sector to which that is directed. As I say, I \nthink it should be really reviewed in oversight so we can analyze what \nis being done and what should be done. I just feel strongly that in \nthis instance it needs to be handled through the authorizing process \nrather than an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For clarification, there is no unanimous \nconsent to stack the votes at this time. So the pending business is the \namendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, just so I understand, I thought the \nmajority leader asked that votes would be stacked until 9:45. Did I \nmisunderstand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. My understanding is that it was not posed as a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DOLE. I now make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n Amendment No. 3683 to the Committee Substitute, as Amended by No. 3675\n\n        (Purpose: To reduce health care fraud, waste, and abuse)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 3683.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is offered on behalf of myself and \nSenator Baucus.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deals with the continuing problem of \nwaste,\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nfraud, and abuse in the Medicare system. Over the last several years we \nhave had numerous IG investigations, reports, GAO investigations, and \nGAO reports. The data is overwhelming. No one can dispute the findings. \nThe Director of HCFA himself has testified before the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services Appropriations Subcommittee as to the validity of these \nfindings. No one disputes that there is tremendous waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Medicare. The GAO has estimated that up to 10 percent of \nMedicare funds are lost to waste, fraud, and abuse every year.\n  Out of a $180 billion program, 10 percent, that is up to $18 billion \nlost to waste, fraud, and abuse. That is $500 per beneficiary per year.\n  I know that we are not going to be able to get all of it out. I \nunderstand that. But at least we can make some important strides in \nsaving a lot of this money. The amendment that was adopted earlier--the \nDole-Roth amendment--had some provisions in it to combat fraud and \nabuse that I have pushed and supported for a long time, including \nincreased resources for the HHS Inspector General and increased \nresources for Medicare contractors to fight fraud and abuse, and \ntougher penalties for fraudulent activities. These were in the \namendment adopted.\n  I say that these are positive and long overdue steps. As I said, they \nare steps that I have pushed and promoted for years. However, they are \ninadequate. There is much, much more that needs to be done and can be \ndone right now to really make a dent in the massive amounts of waste \nand abuse in the system.\n  Mr. President, every time I go to town meetings in Iowa and I meet \nwith the elderly--or just basically anyone that has been involved in \nthe Medicare system, like people who have had parents or grandparents \nwho have received Medicare help and assistance--whenever you talk about \nwaste and abuse you get an immediate response. They know it exists all \ntoo well. When you talk about looking at their bills and ask if they \never look at a bill and see an item on there that they did not really \nthink they received, or maybe paid too much for--you watch the heads \nnod--they all have, and they are outraged about it. But what they will \nshow you is they will hold up the form that they got from Medicare, and \nit will have stamped on the front of it, ``This is not a bill.''\n  A couple of years ago a woman by the name of Shirley Pollock from \nAtlantic, IA, got hold of me. She had received one of these for her \nmother-in-law who had been in a nursing home.\n  For something short of 5 weeks' time, she was billed over $5,000 for \nbandages. She was outraged, because she knew there was no way her \nmother-in-law had used that many bandages. But on the front it said, \n``This is not a bill.'' So Shirley Pollock complained to the Medicare \npayor about this and was told: Do not worry about it. You do not have \nto pay it anyway.\n  Well, as Shirley later told me, ``I got so mad because I knew \nsomebody's got to pay it. Obviously taxpayers or people paying into \nMedicare are paying for it. Someone is paying for it. I know we didn't \nreceive $5,000 in bandages, and I want to do something about it.''\n  So she contacted my office, and we worked it through and found out, \nindeed, that she was absolutely right. Her mother-in-law had never \nreceived $5,000 in bandages--maybe $500 worth but not $5,000, and yet \nthe bill was paid. The bill was just paid as if nothing had happened.\n  So we know this is going on. And like I said, you can ask any person \nin a town meeting about this, especially those who have been in \nMedicare, and they will tell you that they know what we are talking \nabout, too.\n  So I am offering this amendment to add what I believe are a few more \nimportant commonsense weapons in this fight against waste and abuse.\n  Now, I will for the benefit of my colleagues state at the outset that \nthere is one provision I have been pushing for for some time that I do \nnot have in this amendment because I know there is opposition to it on \nthe floor. I have offered it before. And that is the idea of \ncompetitive bidding. I am not offering that as part of this package \nbecause I know they want to get the bill through, and I am for this \nbill; I am a cosponsor of it. I wish to get it through. But, obviously, \nunbelievable as it may seem to me and to others, there are some who do \nnot believe that Medicare should adopt competitive bidding when it \ncomes to medical supplies so that seniors and the taxpayers get the \nbest price possible.\n  So I did not include it. I took it out because I know that that some \nhave said it's too controversial. But I am going to be offering that \nagain to get us to competitive bidding, just like the Veterans \nAdministration has been doing for years. It's an outrage Medicare is \nlosing millions because its payment system is prone to abuse and waste. \nOver a period of years I've compared like bills, like items between \nMedicare and the Veterans Administration, same city, same supplier. \nMedicare is often paying 30 to 50 percent more than what the Veterans \nAdministration is. Why is that? Because the Veterans Administration \nengages in competitive bidding and Medicare does not. But as I said, I \nhave not included that in this amendment. I wanted to make that clear.\n  All of the provisions in this amendment that I have offered are the \nresult of extensive hearings held by the Labor, Health and Human \nServices Appropriations Subcommittee over the past several years. They \nare all recommendations of the General Accounting Office, the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Health and Human Services or other private \nsector medical experts. All of them are commonsense steps, and I just \nwant to review very briefly what they are.\n  First, this would provide for improved information to seniors to \nallow them to better help in the fight against Medicare fraud, waste, \nand abuse. Seniors would be guaranteed the right to receive itemized \nbills instead of a summarized report from which it may be difficult to \ndetect billing errors or abuses. Every Medicare payment statement would \nalso have to include a toll-free hotline number to report suspected \ncases of fraud, waste, or abuse.\n  Now, to those who may say this is a burden, let me just point out \nthat those who are sending in the bills have to keep an itemized \nrecord. But when they send it to the beneficiary, they can just \nsummarize it. So the beneficiary can look at it, and a lot of times not \neven know what they are paying for and a lot of times Medicare does not \nknow what it is paying for. They just pay it, but they really do not \nknow what the itemized bill is.\n  The reason I know that you can go back and find the itemized bills is \nthat the investigations we have done by the General Accounting Office \nhave gone after some of these summarized bills, gone back to the \nclaimant, back to the hospital or the nursing home or the doctor or \nwhoever it might be and said, OK, what made up this summarized \nstatement? Well, they had to produce the itemized bill so that the \nGeneral Accounting Office could look at it. So they do have that \nitemized bill. I am saying it is no more of a problem for them just to \nprint that out on the bill they send to Medicare. This amendment would \nguarantee seniors that they could get an itemized bill so that they \nknow exactly what they were being charged for and how much they were \nbeing charged for it. And, as I said, it would also require Medicare to \nput on each explanation of Medicare benefits a toll-free hotline number \nso that a person could report any suspected case of fraud or abuse.\n  That is the first part of my amendment. The second part of my \namendment establishes rewards of up to $10,000 for those providing \ninformation that leads to a health care fraud conviction. Again, it is \nto get people to step forward, to provide the information that we need, \nand if it leads to a health care fraud conviction they would be \nentitled to a reward up to $10,000.\n  The third part of my amendment prohibits Medicare payments for \nwasteful and unnecessary items such as sports cars for corporate \nexecutives, lucrative gifts to executive families and friends, tickets \nto sporting and other entertainment events, and other items not related \nto medical care.\n  In one of the most infuriating cases of abuse we found that health \ncare executives were padding Medicare bills with all sorts of \noutrageous items identified as indirect costs. For example, we found \nthe following items charged to Medicare: $2,433 for a trip to Italy to \ninspect a piece of sculpture; $10,215 billed to Medicare for clocks, \nwatches,\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nand bowls for employees and friends; thousands of dollars for a golf \ntournament that was only held for executives; a $4,200 bill for a \nsporting event, all billed to Medicare as indirect costs. That is \noutrageous.\n  Now, Medicare did take one step after I prodded them at hearings. No \nlonger will they pay for alcohol or for lobbying expenses as indirect \ncosts. Well, that was a good first step, but they still have not \nspecifically excluded these other items. My amendment would change \nthat.\n  Next, my amendment says that we would reduce Medicare waste by giving \nthe private companies that administer Medicare the authority to reduce \npayments for items they identify as grossly overpriced. Currently this \ncan only be done on a national basis by HCFA and has only been done \nonce, a process that took HCFA 3 years.\n  I am familiar with that because I initiated it several years ago. We \nfound a blood glucose monitor, a little device that you can buy at \nKmart or any discount store; it is for people who have diabetes. They \ncan get an accurate check on what their blood glucose level is. It is a \nlittle pocket device with a battery in it. We found that Medicare was \nreimbursing up to $200 for each one of those. I sent my staff down to \nthe local Kmart. They bought one for $49.99--50 bucks. Medicare was \nreimbursing up to $200 for it.\n  So I went to Medicare, to HCFA. I said, ``Okay, we have to stop it. \nYou can go down and buy it for 50 bucks. Why are you paying $200?\"\n  Believe it or not, from that moment to the day that they actually \nreduced the price to $50 took 3 years--3 years for them to do that. \nWell, this amendment would give a private company that administers \nMedicare the authority to reduce payments on items that they identify \nas grossly overpriced. So if they found something like a blood glucose \nmonitor that they were reimbursing $200 for and they could buy it for \n50 bucks, they could reduce the price down themselves. Again, right \nnow, it takes HCFA over 3 years just to do one simple thing like that. \nThis is a change that has been praised both by Medicare and the HHS \nInspector General.\n  Next, my amendment would better assure that rapidly growing home \nhealth services are not subject to abuse by requiring that Medicare \npayments are not inflated by bills being filed in a higher payment area \noutside of where the service was provided, by establishing a fine for \nknowingly providing a false certification that a patient meets Medicare \nhome health coverage criteria and by requiring that bills submitted for \nsurgical dressings are itemized.\n\n  I will just read a little bit from this GAO report that covered \nexcessive payments for medical supplies. Here is what happens. It says:\n\n       Fiscal intermediaries pay medical supply claims without \n     knowing specifically what they are being asked to pay for on \n     behalf of beneficiaries. The claims submitted by providers \n     have no detailed information that would allow fiscal \n     intermediaries to assess the claims' reasonableness. This \n     lack of detail exists because HCFA guidance allows providers \n     to bill all medical supplies under 10 broad codes. Billed \n     items are not listed by type or amount. A code frequently \n     used to record medical supplies is code 270, that is medical/\n     surgical supplies, which we found included many different \n     items such as a $21,437 pacemaker, a 75 cent sterile sponge, \n     and even daily rental charges of $59 for an aqua pad. \n     Consequently, unless fiscal intermediaries identify these \n     claims for review and request additional documentation before \n     payment, they will pay for the claims without knowing what \n     the specific purchase was or whether it was covered or \n     medically necessary.\n\n  Again, my amendment would address that and allow them to get that \nnecessary information so that they would know exactly what they were \npaying for. That change was recommended and drafted by the General \nAccounting Office.\n  Next, my amendment would require Medicare to replace its outdated \ncomputer systems with state-of-the-art private sector computer software \nto detect and stop billing abuse. The General Accounting Office found \nthat this simple change would save about $600 million a year. Again, \nthis provision carries out their recommended changes to save seniors \nand taxpayers money.\n  GAO found, in fact, that a number of the private companies that \nprocess Medicare claims use the more sophisticated computer software on \ntheir private sector business but are not allowed to use it on their \nMedicare claims. They actually have to have two computer systems. They \nhave their own that they submit claims to. Then they have another set \nthat they have to have and another set of software just for Medicare.\n  As I said, the General Accounting Office said that just by making \nthis one change, this one change would save $600 million a year, and \nthe cost for doing that was about $20 million. So, again, it would \nrequire Medicare to replace its computer systems with state-of-the-art \nprivate sector computer technology, just what most private companies \nare using today to detect and stop billing abuse. As the GAO said, the \nprivate sector ones were so much better at detecting fraud and abuse \nthan the Medicare ones were. We have been after Medicare. They say they \nare going to do this; maybe by the end of 1999 they might have it \nchanged. We could change it right now and, as GAO said, save up to $600 \nmillion a year.\n  Last, my amendment saves money and reduces hassle by cutting \nexcessive Medicare and Medicaid paperwork. There would be a uniform \napplication and benefit claims form that would be established and would \neliminate duplicative forms.\n  Mr. President, these are really modest steps. Again, these are all \nsteps that the GAO, the inspector general's office, and other private \nsector health care experts have said are necessary to at least stem \nthis tremendous hemorrhaging of waste and abuse that we have in \nMedicare. When you are talking about up to $18 billion a year, even if \nwe cannot get all of it, if we could just get half of it, that is $9 \nbillion a year. That is a lot of money. I see no reason why we could \nnot get at least half of it with these modest steps that I am proposing \nhere.\n  As I said, I did not include the one on competitive bidding. We will \nrevisit that at another time. But I thought in the spirit of moving \nthis legislation along and offering something that I thought was \nmodest, that would move us in the right direction, that is why I took \nout competitive bidding.\n\n  I offer this amendment to enhance this bill and hopefully make it a \nbetter bill for health care in America. That is what this bill is \nabout, is to help us in health care reform. You cannot have real health \ncare reform until you stop the waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare. It \nis in that spirit I offer this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his strong support over the \nyears, trying to weed out this waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare. He \nhas been a leader on this subject. I am happy to have him as a \ncosponsor on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues listened very closely \nto the Senator from Iowa. The big debate here is how to save Medicare. \nSenators on one side of the aisle say we have to cut Medicare to save \nit. We had this big debate over whether we should cut $270 billion out \nof Medicare in the next 7 years. We spent a lot of time debating this \nissue. Unfortunately, the majority Members in this body ended up \ndeciding that, yes, we should cut that much money out of Medicare over \n7 years. I think every Member on this side of the aisle voted against \nthat.\n  Obviously, if we are going to save Medicare, we ought to first look \nat waste. It is clear there is waste in Medicare. We all know there is \nwaste in Medicare. The General Accounting Office has documented the \nwaste. The Senator from Iowa has listed all the Federal agencies that \ndocumented the millions of dollars lost to waste. Each of us, at home, \ntalks to senior citizens, to providers and others who, on an anecdotal \nbasis, tell us about waste in Medicare. We all know there is waste in \nMedicare.\n  We also know it takes a long time to get something done around here, \nway too long. Too many times we debate issues, not months but years. It \ntakes way too long to get something meaningful accomplished around \nhere. I think tonight we are debating a very important bill. We are \ngoing to pass this bill, hopefully tonight, that will take solid steps \nto provide better insurance coverage for millions of Americans and \nthousands of Montanans. This\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nis important and I strongly support this bill. At the same time, we \nhave the chance to take the steps necessary to cut some of the waste in \nMedicare.\n  Tonight, let us pass this amendment. It is not perfect. There will be \na lot of opportunities to work with it, during the conference \ncommittee, but let us get started. Let us pass this. We all know we \nshould. Let us just do it. It might not be perfect, but we should not \nlet perfection be the enemy of the good. Every Senator here tonight \nknows that this is a good amendment. We all know it is on the right \ntrack. I, for the life of me, do not understand why we just do not \naccept it tonight, work on it in the conference committee, maybe fix it \nup a little bit, get it enacted into law, and begin to attack a lot of \nthe waste that exists in Medicare.\n  I hope Senators listened to the examples the Senator gave tonight. \nThere are many more. They are outrageous--trips to Italy, sports cars. \nYou would be amazed what waste, fraud, and abuse occurs in our Medicare \nprogram. It is outrageous. So, let us begin to do something about it; \njust begin. We heard the figures. GAO says up to 10 percent. That is \n$18 billion.\n  Let us be honest, we are not going to get a full $18 billion \nrecovered. We know that. But, as the Senator from Iowa says, let us at \nleast make a start. Let us not say we are not going to do it tonight \nbecause we have a no-amendments policy. We have already adopted one \namendment, and another one, already tonight. Certainly this is in the \ncategory of amendments that we know should be passed. Otherwise, we run \nthe risk that nothing will happen to fight fraud and abuse in the \nMedicare program this year.\n  What is going to happen next year? We do not know, as we attempt to \naddress the waste that exists in Medicare.\n  I am not going to belabor the issue. It is getting late tonight. The \nSenator from Iowa has listed all the various provisions of his \namendment. I just hope we can leave the partisan fighting and political \nrhetoric behind and do something which we know the people at home whom \nwe represent want. Let us begin to take some very critical and concrete \nsteps to address the waste and fraud that does exist in Medicare. That \nis where we should begin, rather than just cutting Medicare. First, let \nus cut the waste out of Medicare and the fraud out of Medicare before \nwe cut Medicare services and programs that help millions of seniors \nnationwide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas, the majority manager, \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am speaking somewhat on behalf of \nSenator Cohen from Maine. He has worked many years on this issue, and \nhas worked with Senator Harkin as well, trying to address the issues of \nfraud and abuse.\n  The language that Senator Cohen had worked on is now part of the \nbill. It is an important issue, and the very things that Senator Harkin \nraised are issues Senator Cohen raised. But there have also been some \nconcerns, and we have to be careful, if there are some problems, to see \nif we cannot get them worked out or else it poses a problem for the \nunderlying bill.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if we can possibly get a time \nunderstanding. We have several Members here. I know people want to \naddress this, and Senator Cohen wants to speak on it. I am wondering if \nthe proponents of the amendment are willing to agree to a time limit.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. There is very little time we need, Mr. President. My \nguess is, if Senator Cohen says 5 minutes, that is fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry, this is a time agreement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just with regard to the Harkin amendment, can we agree \nthat there be 10 minutes evenly divided? I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, if I can be as brief as I can within the 5-\nminute limitation, the fraud and abuse provisions that we adopted in \nthe leadership amendment is something that I have worked on now for \nover 3 years. It passed both the House and the Senate last year as part \nof the budget reconciliation act. It was included in the \nadministration's budget reconciliation proposal.\n  So the legislation we have passed and adopted is something that has \nbeen completely vetted; it has been negotiated through a lengthy \nprocess; it has been through the hearing process; it has been on the \nfloor on several occasions--in fact, numerous times.\n  Additionally, it has received the endorsement of the administration, \nthe Attorney General, Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nFinance Committee of the House and Senate, as well as many private \ngroups. The Harkin legislation has not gone through any such review or \nscrubbing; it has not received these endorsements, to my knowledge. In \nfact, I am sure we do not know of all the objections to his provisions. \nI do believe that there are several that are the subject of \ncontroversy.\n  I am not here to argue the merits of each of the items I am about to \nraise, but I know that both Health and Human Services and HCFA, the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, object to the section that \nrequires HCFA to acquire commercial software technology for Medicare \nclaims processing. I know HCFA has concerns with the Harkin section \nthat requires Medicare payments for certain items.\n\n  Again, I am not here to argue the merits of these particular items \ntonight. I merely say to my colleagues, they are not without \ncontroversy. If our objective is to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \nbecause we want to see legislation that guarantees access, \naffordability and portability, it seems to me the best thing we can do \nis stay with the legislation we adopted. That is why it was included in \nthe leadership amendment.\n  So we have adopted it on several occasions. There may be some merit \nto Senator Harkin's proposal, but I think because of the items that are \nin controversy, it is only going to jeopardize the legislation. I \nbelieve the fraud and abuse provisions we have adopted are an enormous \nstep forward. CBO has scored the amendment we adopted as saving some $3 \nbillion, and that is going to pay for a number of items in the bill \nitself.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues, when the appropriate \ntime comes, will move to table the Harkin amendment, that we will enjoy \nthe support of our colleagues, because I believe the Harkin amendment \ndoes raise controversial issues, and the last thing we need at this \ntime is more controversy on this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have worked very closely with the Senator from Iowa, \nand I admire all of his extraordinary work in all of this area. I think \nit is very commendable, and I do not think we have really ensured that \na number of the recommendations have been enacted. So I am, again, very \nsympathetic and supportive of the concept.\n  This is a matter really for the Finance Committee, and there has been \nan objection raised on that vote in support of tabling the amendment. \nBut I give assurances to the Senator, as a member of the conference and \ngiven the fact the whole issue of fraud will be a matter of conference, \nI will do the best I can to see that we are able to include some of \nthose measures in the conference. That is the best at least I can do, \nbut I admire his work and look forward to joining with him on another \noccasion.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Kennedy's comments, \nand I hope we can get some of these adopted in conference. I say, \nagain, I appreciate what the Senator from Maine has done over the last \nfew years. He has done a great job of going after these issues of waste \nand abuse. I have no major objections to what was adopted earlier. \nOverall, I think it is a great step in the right direction.\n  We probably have been working along parallel paths. I am on the \nAppropriations Committee and the Senator is on another committee, but I \nfirst started having hearings on this 6 years ago, so we have been \nworking on parallel tracks. I do not think there is any need to debate \nthat.\n  I was just saying I do not know that it is necessary before we pass \nanything\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\naround here that we have to have the approval of the administration. I \nfind that kind of an odd concept at this time in the Senate that we \nhave to have that kind of approval. We are the legislative branch.\n  I point out that every single item I just mentioned has gone through \na process of hearings. We have had numerous hearings on this. We have \nhad the approval of the inspector general's office and the GAO.\n  The Senator from Maine did mention one item. Out of all of these, \nthere is only one item that HCFA opposes, and that is the provision in \nthere that mandates they use state-of-the-art computer technology. That \nis because HCFA has been trying to develop its own. I have had some \npretty fair battles with HCFA on this. I guarantee the Senator from \nMaine is right that they do not want that provision.\n  I am going to tell you they are wrong. There is high quality computer \nsoftware out in the private sector that Medicare can adopt right now. \nThey are wasting money developing their own. And I'm afraid by the time \nthat the system they are developing won't solve the problem. The GAO \nstudy and investigation showed that. I have had Medicare intermediaries \nsay that they have the software that Medicare could adopt, and, in \nfact, I say to the Senator from Maine that Medicare did adopt some \nchanges of the type I've advocated in January of this year. They \nadopted a little bit of it. It will save some money, but much more \ncould be saved.\n  Lastly, let me just say the amendment of the Senator from Maine does \nsave $3 billion over 7 years. We do not have an estimate on how much \nthis would save. All I know is, just on the computer software alone, \nthat was $600 million in savings. I believe this amendment would save \nmuch, much more.\n  Again, I do not see anything here that is controversial but for that \none item where HCFA says they are opposed to adopting private sector \ncomputer technology. As I said every single item in this amendment is a \ndirect recommendation from the Inspector General, the General \nAccounting Office or other experts as effective methods to stop waste, \nfraud and abuse in Medicare.\n  This should be a completely noncontroversial amendment. I hope, \nagain, as the Senator from Montana said, that we will not get caught up \nin jurisdictions.\n  Let us do what is right. What is right is to adopt this and start \nsaving some money in the Medicare system. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom Maine is going to save some money. Darn right it is going to save \nsome money. But we can save much more by adopting these other \nprovisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The minority \nmanager is recognized\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was going to make the tabling motion and then set that \naside. What we had tried to do before is have the few amendments that \nwe have here incorporated.\n  But I am reminded by my chairman that we had one over here and that \nit would be reasonable and fair to do one over there, and then we would \ncome back to try and do all three of these here.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wonder if we can get at least an order that would be \nacceptable so that those of us who have been waiting for an extended \nperiod might get a timeframe so that we will not just be waiting around \nand then find the list somehow gets altered and we wait some more.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was prepared to accept Senator Conrad's amendment. It \nis going to take a minute.\n  Mr. KASSEBAUM. We are accepting it. So if the Senator wants to \nproceed--Senator Coats has been waiting too, but that is fine. It is \nacceptable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I make a motion to table the Harkin \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the Harkin amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3684\n\n  (Purpose: To extend State requested waivers of the foreign country \nresidence requirement with respect to international medical graduates, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes \n     amendment numbered 3684.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WAIVER OF FOREIGN COUNTRY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT WITH \n                   RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL GRADUATES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Waiver Program.--Section 220(c) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1182 note) is amended by striking ``June 1, 1996'' \n     and inserting ``June 1, 2002''.\n       (b) Conditions on Federally Requested Waivers.--Section \n     212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1184(e)) is amended by inserting after ``except that in the \n     case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public \n     Health or its equivalent'' the following: ``or in the case of \n     a waiver requested by an interested United States Government \n     agency on behalf of an alien described in clause (iii)''.\n       (c) Restrictions on Federally Requested Waivers.--Section \n     214(k) (8 U.S.C. 1184(k)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(k)(1) In the case of a request by an interested State \n     agency or by an interested United States Government agency \n     for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement \n     under section 212(e) with respect to an alien described in \n     clause (iii) of that section, the Attorney General shall not \n     grant such waiver unless--\n       ``(A) in the case of an alien who is otherwise \n     contractually obligated to return to a foreign country, the \n     government of such country furnishes the Director of the \n     United States Information Agency with a statement in writing \n     that it has no objection to such waiver;

and\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\n         ``(B) in the case of a request by an interested United \n     States Government agency, if at any time the alien engages in \n     employment for a health facility or organization not named in \n     the waiver application.''.\n\n  Mr. CONARD. Mr. President, this is very simple. It is an extension of \nthe popular J-1 visa program for 6 years. If we fail to do this, the \nauthority runs out June 1. Mr. President, the J-1 visa waiver permits \neach of our States to extend 20 waivers a year. And 21 of our States \nhave already done it. More are interested in doing it. They will not \nhave a chance if the authority runs out June 1.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am sponsoring would extend what has \nbecome known by some as the ``Conrad State 20 Program.'' In 1994, I \nadded a provision to the visa extension bill that allows state health \ndepartments or their equivalents to participate in the process of \nobtaining J-1 visa waivers. This process allows a foreign medical \ngraduate (FMG) who has secured employment in the United States to waive \nthe J-1 visa program's 2 year residency requirement.\n  As a condition of the J-1 visa, FMGs must return to their home \ncountries for at least 2 years after their visas expire before being \neligible to return. However, if the home countries do not object, FMGs \ncan follow a waiver process that allows them to remain and work here in \na designated health professional shortage area or medically underserved \narea. Before my legislation became law, that process exclusively \ninvolved finding an ``interested federal agency'' to recommend to the \nUnited States Information Agency (USIA) that waiving the 2 year \nrequirement was in the public interest. The law now allows each State \nhealth department or its equivalent to make this recommendation to the \nUSIA for up to 20 waivers per year.\n  This law as necessary for several reasons. Despite an abundance of \nphysicians in some areas of the country, other areas, especially rural \nand inner city areas, have had an exceedingly hard time recruiting \nAmericans doctors. Many health facilities have had no other choice but \nturn to FMGs to fill their primary care needs. Unfortunately, obtaining \nJ-1 visa waivers for qualified FMGs through the federal program is a \nlong and bureaucratic process that not only requires the participation \nof the ``interested federal agency'' but also requires approval from \nboth the USIA and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Finding a federal agency to cooperate is difficult enough, \nconsidering that the Department of Health and Human Services does not \nparticipate. States who are not members of the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, which is eligible to approve its own waivers, have had to \nenlist any agency that is willing to take on these additional duties. \nThese agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture or the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, often have little or no expertise in \nhealth care issues. Once an agency does agree to participate, the word \nspreads quickly and soon that agency can be flooded with thousands of \nwaiver applications from across the country.\n  Because states can clearly determine their own health needs far \nbetter than an agency in Washington, DC, my legislation now allows \nstates to go directly to the USIA to request a waiver. It also is \nrelieving some of the burden that participating federal agencies have \nincurred in processing waiver applications.\n  The Conrad State 20 Program is still very new, and not every state \nhas yet elected to use it. But the program is beginning to work exactly \nas I had hoped. At least 21 States have reported using it to obtain \nwaivers. More states are expected to participate in the coming months. \nUnfortunately, the Conrad State 20 program is scheduled to sunset on \nJune 1, 1996, unless Congress approves an extension. The amendment I am \noffering would extend the program for 6 more years. This is not a \npermanent extension. The amendment would sunset the program on June 1, \n2002.\n  My amendment also puts new restrictions and conditions on FMGs who \nuse the federal program. As a condition of using the Conrad State 20 \nprogram to acquire a waiver, FMGs must contract to work for their \noriginal employer for at least 3 years. Otherwise, their waiver will be \nrevoked and they will be subject to deportation. My amendment would \napply the same 3-year contractual obligation for those who obtain a \nwaiver through the Federal program.\n  We all know that State empowerment has been a major issue of the \n104th Congress. The Conrad State 20 Program is one way of giving States \nmore control over their health care needs. States that are using the \nprogram want to keep it operating for a few more years. They understand \nthat this program does not take away jobs from American doctors, but \ninstead is one more valuable tool to help serve the health care needs \nof rural and inner city citizens. The Senate passed my original \nlegislation with strong bipartisan support. I am hopeful the Senate \nwill agree that creating the Conrad State 20 program was very \nworthwhile, and will agree to accept this modest, 6-year extension.\n  I hope we can accept this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have talked to the chairman of the \nImmigration Committee, Senator Simpson. And I, as the ranking minority \nmember on that committee, say this makes sense. It is targeting doctors \nin underserved areas. We welcome this. This is effective. It is time \nsensitive in terms of the reauthorization. We urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3684) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I recognize Senator Coats is going to have \nhis amendment next. But Senator Conrad's point that we would like some \nkind of knowledge as to what order we are going to come in here--some \nof us have been waiting a long time. And it will take a few minutes. I \nwonder if there can be some agreement following the Coats amendment as \nto who is going to be up here with their amendments.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. After the Coats amendment there are only two \namendments I know of at this point that will require votes on this \nside, one is a Gramm amendment and, I believe, perhaps a Burns \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask Senator Coats, how long does he \nexpect to take?\n  Mr. COATS. There are one or two people that may want to speak on it. \nThey are not on the floor. I do not intend to take all that long, 15 \nminutes or so, 10, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right. The Senator from Illinois was just trying to \nget through this. He has been here and has been prepared, and Senator \nBoxer. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nconsideration of Senator Coats' amendment, Senator Boxer be recognized, \nand at the conclusion of Senator Boxer, Senator Simon be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could we get a time, for the benefit of our colleagues \nhere? Could we set a time for the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. COATS. Well, it is difficult for me to determine how much \nopposition there will be to this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the opposition will not take very much time. We \nwould request maybe 4 minutes for the opposition.\n  Mr. COATS. I think we can do this then in a total of 15 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nallocation of 20 minutes, 15 minutes for the Senator from Indiana, and \n5 minutes for this Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate \nthat unanimous consent request until I get agreement on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequest is vitiated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3685\n\n (Purpose: To encourage the provision of medical services in medically \n  underserved communities by extending Federal liability coverage to \n                          medical volunteers)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes amendment \n     numbered 3685.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . MEDICAL VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Medical \n     Volunteer Act''.\n       (b) Tort Claim Immunity.--\n       (1) General rule.--A health care professional who provides \n     a health care service to a medically underserved person \n     without receiving compensation for such health care service, \n     shall be regarded, for purposes of any medical malpractice \n     claim that may arise in connection with the provision of such \n     service, as an employee of the Federal Government for \n     purposes of the Federal tort claims provisions in title 28, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Compensation.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a health \n     care professional shall be deemed to have provided a health \n     care service without compensation only if, prior to \n     furnishing a health care service, the health care \n     professional--\n       (A) agrees to furnish the health care service without \n     charge to any person, including any health insurance plan or \n     program under which the recipient is covered; and\n       (B) provides the recipient of the health care service with \n     adequate notice (as determined by the Secretary) of the \n     limited liability of the health care professional with \n     respect to the service.\n       (c) Preemption.--The provisions of this section shall \n     preempt any State law to the extent that such law is \n     inconsistent with such provisions. The provisions of this \n     section shall not preempt any State law that provides greater \n     incentives or protections to a health care professional \n     rendering a health care service.\n       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n     professional'' means a person who, at the time the person \n     provides a health care service, is licensed or certified by \n     the appropriate authorities for practice in a State to \n     furnish health care services.\n       (2) Health care service.--The term ``health care service'' \n     means any medical assistance to the extent it is included in \n     the plan submitted under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     for the State in which the service was provided.\n       (3) Medically underserved person.--The term ``medically \n     underserved person'' means a person who resides in--\n       (A) a medically underserved area as defined for purposes of \n     determining a medically underserved population under section \n     330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c); or\n       (B) a health professional shortage area as defined in \n     section 332 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 254e);\n     and who receives care in a health care facility substantially \n     comparable to any of those designated in the Federally \n     Supported Health Centers Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 233 et \n     seq.), as shall be determined in regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the amendment I offer extends the Federal \ntort claim coverage to a health care professional if that health care \nprofessional volunteers his or her medical services to a medically \nunderserved person. This is the same type of coverage--this is not new. \nWe are not breaking new ground here. We extend that same type of \nFederal tort coverage for medical services provided in Indian health \ncare facilities, in Federal community, migrant, homeless, and public \nhousing health centers.\n  What I am attempting to do here is extend it to those volunteer \nefforts--not paid--but volunteer efforts on the part of health care \nprofessionals if those medical services are provided to people from \nunderserved areas that are deemed by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices as medically underserved or medically needy.\n  We have built into this significant patient protection, indicating \nthat the patient must receive notice before providing the care, and \nthat the provider has agreed not to charge the party for any health \ncare that is provided, and that the medical malpractice liability is \nshifted to the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n  We are not in any way limiting the plaintiff's right to receive \ncompensation for negligence or for a successful award in a suit. We are \njust simply shifting it from the provider's insurance coverage to the \nFederal Tort Claims Act. The provider is deemed, for the purposes of \nproviding that voluntary service, an employee of the Federal Government \nand therefore covered under the act.\n  The providers have to be licensed in the State in which the care is \nprovided. The care must be covered under Medicaid in that State. In \naddition, the patient must receive the care in a health care facility \nthat is substantially comparable in nature to the Federal migrant and \ncommunity health centers that provide care to underserved populations. \nThis is the protection that is needed in order to ensure that the care \nis provided in adequate facilities. So those facilities that are deemed \nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services as federally certified--\nif they are provided in substantially comparable facilities--the \ncoverage will qualify.\n  What we are attempting to do here is to provide a way that medical \npersonnel can provide medical services to people who otherwise cannot \nafford them, people who are uninsured but where doctors and \nprofessionals and providers in the community come together and \nvolunteer their time.\n  We all know the horrendous cost of medical liability insurance. In \nmany instances these medical providers cannot pay or do not choose to \npay the additional liability cost. One of the primary reasons for this \nis that many of these individuals are retired. They are retired doctors \nor dentists or health care providers. So they do not have umbrella \nliability policies because they are not necessarily practicing on a \nfull-time basis. But we want to encourage these individuals--as many of \nthem already do--to engage in providing medical services.\n\n  I think the amendment is pretty straightforward. There has been a \nquestion about the cost. It is interesting to note that when we \nprovided this liability coverage for community health centers, the \nCongress set aside $10 million a year to cover potential liability \ncosts. It is important to note that none of this money has been used in \nthe 2 years that this has been in operation.\n  People receiving free health care from professional providers \ngenerally are very grateful for the care and obviously are not looking \nto sue, yet we have protected their rights to do so if negligence \noccurs or if any liability occurs under the services. That is provided. \nIt just simply is that the coverage comes under the Federal tort claims \nprocedure rather than under the private insurance liability coverage of \nthe medical provider.\n  Again, the purpose here is to encourage the provision of free medical \nservices to people who either live in underserved areas--and who of us \ndo not represent a State that has underserved areas--or to those people \nof such income level that do not have insurance or do not have the \npersonal wherewithal to purchase the medical service that is needed.\n  This is widely supported. The American Medical Association supports \nthis, the Catholic Health Association, the Christian Medical and Dental \nSociety. Senators Frist and Kassebaum have been cosponsors of this \nbill. And it is supported by professionals throughout our States and \nthroughout our communities.\n  I have seen some marvelous examples of efforts where community \nmedical professionals gather together, provide an acceptable clinic, \nvolunteer their time and provide very needed services to people that \nneed these free services in order to receive medical care.\n  I hope that our colleagues could support this amendment. I thought \nthis was something that we might be able to work out. We were not able \nto do that. I will address any questions that might be raised in \nopposition to this. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  This idea is a good idea. As the author of the community health \ncenters, we had the Tort Claim Act covering all the medical personnel \nin there. Then there was a downsizing of service corps, we had other \ndoctors that came in there, and we had an increase in the insurance \ncosts for the neighborhood health centers as a result of that.\n  About 4 years ago, again, we worked out with the Treasury and the \nadministration an indemnification program for those doctors in the \nneighborhood health centers. It has worked very well. The reason that \nhas worked well\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nis because there is supervision and accountability at the neighborhood \nhealth centers.\n  That aspect is missing in this program. That is why I will vote to \ntable this measure. Then we will come back, one, on the issue of what \nthe funding level would be in terms of it; and second, whether an \noverall program can be worked in terms of the accountability. Without \nan accountability, without some ideas of funding, this is not the \nplace, the time. It is a good idea.\n  I commit to working with my friend from Indiana to try and see if we \ncannot make it a reality in the very near future.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the offer of the Senator from \nMassachusetts to work with us on this. I hardly think this needs \nadditional work.\n  First of all, it is important to understand that the bill itself \naddresses the issue that the Senator raised. In the definition of \n``medically underserved person'' it says the term ``medically \nunderserved person'' means a person who receives care in a health care \nfacility substantially comparable to any of those designated in the \nfederally-supported Health Centers Assistance Act as shall be \ndetermined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary. The Secretary \nof Health and Human Services has a sufficient amount of control by the \npromulgation of regulations to certify the types of facilities, and \nthere is accountability.\n  If you feel that you need to have a Federal agency or a Federal \nsupervisor standing over the shoulder of a health care professional, a \ndoctor who might be earning $200 or $300 an hour performing services \nbut who volunteers his time for free, if you say we cannot trust this \nperson to provide adequate medical care, I think we are selling the \nmedical profession very, very short and we are crediting the Government \nwith an ability to supervise that it does not have.\n  We do not need a Government agency to oversee the efforts of nurses \nand doctors who volunteer their time--volunteer their time--to provide \nneeded free medical services to underserved and low-income individuals. \nAgain, we are not limiting the liability of anybody that is served \nhere. We are not saying they cannot bring a claim. We are simply saying \nthat claim, if brought and if successfully brought, will be paid for \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act and not paid for under the liability \ninsurance of the professional.\n  Why do we need to do that? We need to do that so we can encourage \nthese people to provide the care. Why is it necessary for most? Because \nmany of these people are retired and they are not able or in a position \nto continue to pay the exorbitant medical liability insurance, \nsometimes running $50,000, $60,000, or $80,000, depending on the \nspecialty, in order to cover themselves for the volunteer service they \nget. The last thing we need is more Federal oversight in a program that \ndoes not need oversight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the hour of 9:45 \nhaving arrived the question is on agreeing to the Specter amendment No. \n3682.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask if we could delay this for 15 \nminutes. There are a couple more amendments that need to be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I do not \nwish to object, but I would like to know how much time is left and what \nthe order will be. As I understand it, Senator Kennedy mentioned I \nwould go next, but if you are just going to finish everything up in 15 \nminutes, that would leave virtually no time for Senator Simon and \nvirtually no time for me.\n  I am confused about whether we will continue after the vote, I guess \nis the point. I only wish to take 5 minutes on my amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while we are doing the order here, I \nthink it might be appropriate to spend just a minute on a discussion \nwhich I had with the distinguished manager, the Senator from Kansas, \ntalking about hearings before the Labor Committee, hopefully, by the \nend of May, looking for reauthorization or authorization of the healthy \nstart program.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish the Senator from Pennsylvania \nmight wait until we worked out the order here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to do that.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I suggest at this point perhaps we could go an extra \nhalf hour, which I think will then take care of every amendment that is \nthere to everyone's satisfaction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I respond, if I may, Mr. President, to the Senator \nfrom Indiana. I am a cosponsor, as a matter of fact, of the Senator's \nMedical Volunteer Act. I think it is a very positive step forward. It \nencourages medical voluntarism and brings some small measure of relief \nto the current liability system. There are objections that have been \nraised to this on the Democratic side, principally, and because of our \nneed to try and get as strong a consensus as possible for the \nunderlying measure I have to object.\n  At the appropriate time, after all debate is concluded, I would move \nto table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As a matter of order, I think we request to conclude \nwith Senator Boxer and Senator Simon and then come back to the other \nside. I think that is what is the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Coats \namendment?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If not, I ask for the yeas and nays and ask that the \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered on the motion to table the Coats \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3686\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to be \nadvised when I have utilized 4 minutes and then I will wrap up my side \nof the argument.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration as a sense of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3686.\n       The Senate finds that:\n       Patients deserve to know the full range of treatments \n     available to them and,\n       Patients should know if doctors receive bonuses for \n     withholding treatment from them.\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     thoughtfully examine these issues to ensure that all patients \n     get the care they deserve.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is such a straightforward and simple \nsense-of-the-Senate. It is rather shocking to me that Members on the \nother side of the aisle have objected to it. I have to thank the \nchairwoman of the committee and Senator Kennedy, who were quite willing \nto accept such a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I do not know what \nMembers oppose this. I cannot imagine why they have not identified \nthemselves to me, Mr. President. I just hope that Members will read the \nsense-of-the-Senate.\n  Let me tell you a little story about why it is so important.\n  This is an L.A. Times story, entitled ``HMO `Gag Clauses' on Doctors \nSpur Protests.'' I will read just a few paragraphs:\n\n       The Santa Monica oncologist thought she was being a strong \n     advocate for her patient.\n       In May, she referred the patient--a Los Angeles woman in \n     her forties, who was rapidly losing her battle with \n     metastatic colon cancer--to a Johns Hopkins University \n     specialist using an experimental drug that had proven \n     effective with similar cancers. It was, in the doctor's view, \n     perhaps the best chance of extending the woman's life.\n       But the patient's managed care group had a different view \n     of the oncologist. It saw a doctor who said too much and \n     broke the rules. She received a reproachful letter from the \n     managed care group, stating that the Johns Hopkins specialist \n     was not ``in network'' and that the patient should not have \n     been referred there.\n       ``This occurrence,'' the letter warned, ``had been noted in \n     the computer, and a future occurrence may result in \n     suspension of referral privilege or, in an extreme case, a \n     recommendation for termination.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is what is happening across the country in HMO's. \nDoctors, who refer patients to specialists are being warned that they \nmay be fired. Doctors are receiving bonus payments from the HMO's for \nnot giving care to patients.\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n  Now, all I am asking in this sense-of-the-Senate is that we look into \nthis. Already, we have looked into this in Medicare and, thank \ngoodness, something is being done. Last month, the Department of HHS \nannounced a regulation mandating that managed care plans serving \nMedicare and Medicaid patients reveal any arrangements in which doctors \nmay face financial pressures to limit services or referrals to \nspecialists.\n  What about those who are not on Medicare, who are not on Medicaid? Do \nthey not deserve the same protections, at a minimum? Doctors across the \ncountry are protesting managed care companies' practices that they \ncontend impede their ability to have candid discussions with patients \nabout treatment options.\n\n  In this time of shifting health care needs and our attempt to \nrestructure the health care delivery system, we must not lose sight of \nthe valuable doctor-patient relationship. We should revere it, we \nshould honor it. We should not allow the HMO's, because of the almighty \nbottom line, to interfere in this relationship and gag our physicians \nfrom telling their patients that there are other treatments for cancer, \nor whatever other condition it might be.\n  I really do not understand why we cannot get a simple sense of the \nSenate through this body.\n  In closing, I am going to read it to you one more time:\n\n       The Senate finds that patients deserve to know the full \n     range of treatments available to them, and patients should \n     know if doctors receive bonuses for withholding treatment \n     from them. It is the sense-of-the-Senate that Congress should \n     thoughtfully examine these issues to ensure that all patients \n     get the care they deserve.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a very good bill here. We can make it better, \nI believe, by just pledging to look into this situation and making sure \nthat all of our people throughout this Nation are told all of the \noptions, because if they are not told, they may lose their lives. I do \nnot think we ought to have that on our hands.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3687\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the need to \n  ensure adequate health care coverage for all children and pregnant \n                                 women)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3687.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE \n                   COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health care coverage of mothers and children in the \n     United States is unacceptable, with more than 9,300,000 \n     children and 500,000 expectant mothers having no health \n     insurance.\n       (2) Among industrial nations, the United States ranks 1st \n     in wealth but 18th in infant mortality, and 14th among such \n     nations in maternal mortality.\n       (3) 22 percent of pregnant women do not have prenatal care \n     in the first trimester, and 22 percent of all poor children \n     are uninsured, despite the medicaid program under title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act.\n       (4) Of the 1,100,000 net increase in uninsured persons from \n     1992 to 1993, 84 percent or 922,500 were children.\n       (5) Since 1987, the number of children covered by \n     employment based health insurance has decreased, and many \n     children lack health insurance despite the relative \n     affordability of providing insurance for children.\n       (6) Health care coverage for children is relatively \n     inexpensive and in 1993 the medicaid program spent an average \n     of $1,012 per child compared to $8,220 per elderly adult.\n       (7) Uninsured children are generally children of lower \n     income workers, who are less likely than higher income \n     workers to have health insurance for their families because \n     they are less likely to work for a firm that offers \n     insurance, and if such insurance is offered, it is often too \n     costly for lower income workers to purchase.\n       (8) In 1993, 61 percent of uninsured children were in \n     families with at least one parent working full time for the \n     entire year the child was uninsured, and about 57 percent of \n     uninsured children had a family income at or below 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level.\n       (9) If Congress eliminates the Federal guarantee of \n     medicaid, an estimated 4,900,000 children may lose their \n     guarantee of health care coverage, and those same children \n     may be added to the currently projected 12,600,000 children \n     who will be uninsured by the year 2002.\n       (10) Studies have shown that uninsured children are less \n     likely than insured children to receive needed health and \n     preventive care, which can affect their health status \n     adversely throughout their lives, with such children less \n     likely to have routine doctor visits, receive care for \n     injuries, and have a regular source of medical care.\n       (11) The families of uninsured children are more likely to \n     take the children to an emergency room than to a private \n     physician or health maintenance organization.\n       (12) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n     be appropriately immunized or receive other preventive care \n     for childhood illnesses.\n       (13) Ensuring the health of children clearly increases \n     their chances to become productive members of society and \n     averts more serious or more expensive health conditions later \n     in life, and ensuring that all pregnant women receive \n     competent prenatal care also saves social costs.\n       (14) Although the United States has made great improvements \n     in health care coverage through the medicaid program, it is \n     still the only developed nation that does not ensure that all \n     of its children and pregnant women have health care coverage.\n       (15) The United States should not accept a status quo in \n     which children in many neighborhoods are more likely to have \n     access to drugs and guns than to doctors, or accept a status \n     quo in which health care is ensured for all prisoners but not \n     for all children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the issue of adequate health care for our mothers and \n     children is important to the future of the United States, and \n     in consideration of the importance of such issue, the Senate \n     should pass health care legislation in the 105th Congress \n     that will ensure health care coverage for all of the United \n     States's pregnant women and children.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, all this does, very simply, is say it is \nthe sense of the Senate that in the next congressional session, \nstarting in 1997, the 105th Congress pass health care legislation that \nprotects pregnant women and children. That is all it does.\n  It is very interesting. Two years ago, we were discussing health care \nlegislation, and virtually everyone in this body, including the \nmajority leader, said, ``We are going to work out some kind of health \ncare for all Americans.'' I have to say, in fairness to Senator Phil \nGramm, he said right from the start, ``Over my dead body. We are not \ngoing to have any national health care program.''\n  We are the only western industrialized nation that does not protect \nall of our citizens. Listen to this, Mr. President. I ask my colleagues \non the other side to listen to this.\n\n       In accepting the Republican nomination for President in \n     1928, Herbert Hoover said, ``The greatness of any nation, its \n     freedom from poverty and crime, its aspirations and ideals \n     are the direct quotient of the care of its children. . .There \n     should be no child in America that is not born and does not \n     live under sound conditions of health.''\n\n  That was in 1928, and we have not achieved Herbert Hoover's dream yet \nin 1996.\n  Let me add, providing coverage for children is the least expensive \npart of health insurance. As we get older, it is more demanding in \nterms of expense. But still we do not provide it for all children.\n  All women and children in Italy have health care coverage, but not in \nthe wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children in France have health care coverage, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Canada, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Great Britain, \nbut not in the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Germany, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Luxembourg, but \nnot in the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Belgium, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n  All women and children have health care coverage in The Netherlands, \nbut not in the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Portugal, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Spain, but not in \nthe wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Finland, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Austria, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Denmark, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Norway, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Sweden, but not \nin the wealthy United States of America.\n  All women and children have health care coverage in Japan, but not in \nthe wealthy United States of America.\n  Mr. President, what we are just saying here is, let us in the next \nsession of Congress--and I am not going to be here--at least protect \npregnant women and children. That is all we ask. It is a sense of the \nSenate resolution.\n  I regret that 2 years ago--and I blame myself as much as anyone--that \nwe did not even get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the \nfundamental issue of health care. Today, my friends, we are going to \nget a vote. We do not say how it should be done; we just say it is the \nsense of the Senate that in the next session of Congress, we are going \nto at least protect pregnant women and children.\n  I do not know how we can do anything less than that. That is what my \namendment asks for.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I recognize it is just a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. But it is about 6 pages, and it is a fairly \nextensive direction for the next Congress. While there would be \ncertainly a great deal of support for health care coverage for pregnant \nwomen and children, we are having a hard enough time in this Congress \nfiguring out what we want to do, let alone applying some issues and \ndirections to the next Congress.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I would have to oppose.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That it would be in order to ask for the yeas and nays \non the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator from Kansas will withhold for 30 seconds \nfor me to respond, she mentions a 5-page amendment. These are all \nwhereases. The conclusion is that it is a sense of the Senate. If she \nwants to agree to this, I will knock out all of the whereases and we \nwill just take the sense of the Senate that we ought to, next session \nof the Congress, pass health care legislation for pregnant women and \nchildren.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I very much appreciate that Senator \nSimon is always very accommodating. The Senator from Illinois is a \nsuperb debater. I would still have to object. If there is no further \ndebate, I will move to table the Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, the Senator is also \nasking for the yeas and nays on the tabling motion of the Boxer \namendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. Mr. President, if I may just speak for a moment, \nthis is objected to by the Finance Committee because it deals with \nMedicare. They would like to debate that at another time, even though \nit is just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if my friend will yield for a minute, we \ntook out any reference to Medicare and Medicaid at the Senator's \nsuggestion. It has nothing to do with Medicare and Medicaid. The way it \nreads now is simply that we should look to see whether patients are \nbeing denied the information they need. We deleted all reference to \nMedicaid and Medicare and asked just for the Congress to look at this \nmatter.\n\n  So I tried to be very accommodating, if my friend would try to help \nme. As I say, we do not have any reference in here at all. We simply \nask that the Congress should thoughtfully examine the issue of \npatients, finding out the full range of their treatment, and patients \nshould know if doctors are receiving bonuses from the treatment. It \ndoes not mention Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is not a motion to table now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no debate on a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shall we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a previous order to table the votes in \nsequential order and vote at 10:15.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority manager is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3688\n\n   (Purpose: To encourage organ and tissue (including eye) donation \n    through the inclusion of an organ and tissue donation card with \n       individual income refund payments, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are two amendments which have been \nagreed to dealing with the organ transplants and information on organ \ntransplants, the Dorgan-Frist amendment, in terms of information on the \norgan transplants. I would like to send it to the table and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Dorgan, for himself and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3688.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3  . ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION INFORMATION INCLUDED WITH \n                   INCOME TAX REFUND PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     include with any payment of a refund of individual income tax \n     made during the period beginning on February 1, 1997, and \n     ending on June 30, 1997, a copy of the document described in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Text of Document.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, \n     after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services and organizations promoting organ and tissue \n     (including eye) donation, prepare a document suitable for \n     inclusion with individual income tax refund payments which--\n       (1) encourages organ and tissue donation;\n       (2) includes a detachable organ and tissue donor card; and\n       (3) urges recipients to--\n       (A) sign the organ and tissue donor card;\n       (B) discuss organ and tissue donation with family members \n     and tell family members about the recipient's desire to be an \n     organ and tissue donor if the occasion arises; and\n       (C) encourage family members to request or authorize organ \n     and tissue donation if the occasion arises.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have described what it is. It is \ninformation on organ transplant in behalf of Senator Dorgan and Senator \nFrist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The amendment (No. 3688) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3689\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the establishment of certain health plan \n    requirements based on information relating to domestic violence)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is in behalf of Senator \nWellstone, and it is in regards to information relating to domestic \nviolence. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3689.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 13 insert after evidence of insurability \n     ``(including conditions arising out of act of domestic \n     violence);''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 3689) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is it the Senators' understanding that this language \nthat we have accepted from the House bill ensures that women covered in \nan employment-based health plan, will not be discriminated against \nbecause of a medical condition caused by domestic violence, because of \na history of domestic violence, or because of their status as a victim \nof domestic violence?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes; that is my understanding.\n  Ms. KASSEBAUM. Yes; that is my understanding.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas. We are \nredrafting different language where one committee says the first shall \nbe the last and the last shall be first.\n  I would like to yield the floor to my friend from West Virginia who \nhas, I believe, an amendment to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia would \nask simply for 1 minute to make the following observation.\n  Earlier this evening there was substantial nonpublic discussion as to \nnondiscrimination and long-term care. There was then a very helpful, \nconstructive, and useful colloquy on the floor which agreed that in the \ntax preferential treatment of long-term care, that nondiscrimination \nwould be completely treated. There was some disagreement as to what \nTreasury was saying constituted nondiscrimination and what the Finance \nCommittee staff said constituted nondiscrimination. There seemed to be \na difference.\n  I simply, as a member of the Finance Committee, wanted to go on \nrecord as saying that the nondiscrimination aspect--this is not just \nracial, but we are talking just about the higher employer as opposed to \nthe lowest employer--that nondiscrimination be done in the usual, \ncustomary, and effective manner for the tax preferential long-term care \nmatters that we are now discussing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3690\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I have here a study request that I \ncosponsored with Senator Helms which would ask HHS to study options on \npoint of service. It has been agreed to on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mrs. Kassebaum), for Mr. Helms, \n     for himself and Mrs. Kassebaum, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3690.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amend Title III--Miscellaneous Provisions, Section 302 (a) \n     by striking ``two part study'' on line 19, and inserting \n     ``three-part study'' and adding Section 302 (d):\n       ``(d) Evaluation of Access and Choice.--Not later than June \n     1, 1998, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     prepare and submit to the appropriate Committees of Congress \n     a report concerning--\n       (1) an evaluation of the extent to which patients have \n     direct access to, and choice of, health care provider, \n     including specialty providers, within a network of providers, \n     as well as the opportunity to utilize providers outside of \n     the network, under the various types of coverage offered \n     under the provisions of this Act;\n       (2) an evaluation of the cost to the insurer of providing \n     out-of-network access to providers, and the feasibility of \n     providing out-of-network access in all health plans offered \n     under provisions of this Act.\n       (3) an evaluation of the percent of premium dollar utilized \n     for medical care and administration of the various types of \n     coverage offered, including coverage which permits out-of-\n     network access and choice of provider, under provisions of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one of the many reasons for my having \nopposed the Clinton health plan was the well founded fear that the \nAmerican people would have been denied their right to choose their \nmedical care. The enormous bureaucracy of the Clinton plan made that \napprehension a certainty--which is why the American people rejected it.\n  In the interest of time, I will not offer my amendment to guarantee \npatients the freedom to choose their health care provider.--This \namendment was originally approved by the Senate last October by a vote \nof 79 to 20 when we considered Medicare reform.--I have no doubt that \nthis provision continues to have strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate.\n  However, instead of offering the original amendment I submit this \namendment to require the Department of Health and Human Services to \nconduct a study to make certain that any changes in the health \ninsurance market will not result in the loss of the American people's \nfreedom to choose their health care provider.\n  Whether Congress considers Medicare reform or health insurance \nreform, patients must not be deprived of the right to choose their own \ndoctors. Even when Congress attempts to provide access to health \ninsurance, that is only half of the equation. Equally important is that \npatients must not find themselves unknowingly thrown into health care \ncoverage that limits their freedom to choose their own health care \nproviders.\n  The purpose of my provisions is to provide to Congress the \ninformation Congress may need to evaluate whether patients continue to \nhave direct access to specialist and choice of health care provider, \nboth in-network and out-of-network, as we make changes to the health \ninsurance market place. It will also determine the cost to the insurer \nof providing this freedom to choose, and if the premium dollar \ncollected is effectively going toward patient care.\n  This study will not only go a long way to provide our Nation with \nuseful information about health care delivery, but it will also \nemphasize the importance of preserving the patient's freedom of choice \nwhen it comes to their own doctor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3690) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3691\n\n    (Purpose: To direct the Health Care Financing Administration to \n        determine reimbursement rates for telemedicine services)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself and Mr. \n     Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3691.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On Page 71, line 19, add the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 302.5. REIMBURSEMENT OF TELEMEDICINE.\n\n       The Health Care Financing Administration is directed to \n     complete their ongoing study of reimbursement of all \n     telemedicine services and submit a report to Congress with a \n     proposal for reimbursement of fee-for-service medicine by \n     March 1, 1997. The report shall utilize data compiled from \n     the current demonstration projects already under review and \n     gather data from other ongoing telemedicine networks. This \n     report shall include an analysis of the cost of services \n     provided via telemedicine.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment is sponsored also by my \nfriend from Iowa Mr. Harkin.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration has been reviewing \ntelemedicine demonstration projects across the country. They have been \nstudying them about 2 years now. They are analyzing the cost \neffectiveness of providing health services via telecommunications and \nhow to reimburse health care providers.\n  Telemedicine is a technology that is spreading--thankfully--because \nrural\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nareas and inner-city areas are in desperate need of health care. \nGetting health care services can be a challenge, especially if you are \n180 miles away from a specialist. But even if that specialist is \nwilling and able to visit his patients via telemedicine, HCFA will not \nreimburse him for those services. And as you can imagine, many health \ncare providers aren't too willing to give their time without being \ncompensated.\n  The study is already underway. But there is no anticipated deadline \nto finish the study and put the issue of reimbursement behind us. In \nfact, at a recent telemedicine conference, a HCFA representative stated \nthat there would be no decision until Congress mandated one.\n  My amendment basically instructs HCFA to decide on reimbursement of \ntelemedicine services by March 1, 1997. That gives them almost an \nentire year--in addition to the time they have already spent studying \nthe issue--to compile their data, gather data from other ongoing \ndemonstrations, if they choose, and determine the fee-for-service \nreimbursement for services provided via telemedicine.\n  There is no cost associated with this, since the study is already \nongoing. I am simply asking that they finish the study and let rural \nareas and urban residents access the health care services that are \ncurrently out of their reach.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration has been in this process now \nfor a couple of years and we think it is about time that they bring \nthis to a close and recommend to the Congress how they are going to \ndeal with it. We have this new technology. We passed a telecom bill \nthat allows a lot of things to happen in distance learning, \ntelemedicine, and these kinds of things, and we think it is now time \nthat we move into the next generation of providing health care to our \nrural areas via telecommunications.\n  I appreciate my good friend from Iowa being a part of this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nMontana for offering this amendment. I am proud to join with him in \nthis.\n  When I was chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Specter and I initiated the \nfunding 3 years ago for the demonstration projects for telemedicine. I \nknow Montana was one State, Iowa was another, and there were several \nother States, I think Georgia, West Virginia, others that were involved \nin the demonstration projects in telemedicine.\n  One of the reasons that we had the demonstration projects was so that \nHCFA could develop a reimbursement means and determine how to \nreimburse.\n  We have enough data. They know. We have had 3 years of these \nprojects. The date the Senator has there, they can do that easily. They \ncan actually do that a lot sooner than that. I think the Senator is \ngenerous in giving them that much time.\n  Nonetheless, there is no doubt they have enough data--they have it \nnow--that they can do this.\n  To echo what the Senator from Montana said, telemedicine will improve \naccess to care in rural areas. It will attract more doctors to rural \nareas because then they will have the necessary backup they need for \ncorrect diagnosis and treatment. It will lower costs in rural areas by \ncutting down on travel, and it will allow more services to be done like \nat our rural health clinics where they can reach out over a broader \narea.\n  So this is a very good amendment and one that is going to help a lot \nin a lot of rural areas in the United States.\n  I hope it will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The vote now is on agreeing to the Burns amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3691) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3682 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would like now to have a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. Senator Specter and myself and Senator Kennedy have \ndiscussed his amendment regarding healthy start and my objection had \nbeen it was authorization on this bill which I felt needed to go \nthrough the committee with some hearings, review what has always been \nan appropriations matter rather than an authorization, and I believe \nthis has been agreed to by Senator Specter and we will have a hearing \nif possible by the end of May.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The distinguished Senator from Kansas expresses it \naccurately. I think that will accomplish the purpose and lead to \nauthorization, or a reauthorization. That is acceptable, and I formally \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The minority manager is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3686, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, proposed a sense-of-the-Senate. In her behalf, I have a revised \nsense-of-the-Senate and I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \nsend it to the desk and that it be in order for consideration at the \nappropriate time in the list of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator modifying the underlying Boxer \namendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Chair is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment as modified is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that patients deserve to know \n     the full range of treatments available to them.\n       Congress should thoughtfully examine these issues to ensure \n     that all patients get the care they deserve.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will ask for a vitiation of the yeas and nays on that \nparticular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 10:15 having arrived, the question \nis on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 3683. That is the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wanted to get consent that votes occur in the order in \nwhich they were debated, with 1 minute of debate after the first vote \nto be equally divided for explanation; that all votes after the first \nvote be reduced to 10 minutes in length. I think that is satisfactory \nto the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3683\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, follows:\n         At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE \n                   COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN.\n\n         (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n         (1) The health care coverage of mothers and children in \n     the United States is unacceptable, with more than 9,300,000 \n     children and 500,000 expectant mothers having no health \n     insurance.\n         (2) Among industrial nations, the United States ranks 1st \n     in wealth but 18th in infant mortality, and 14th among such \n     nations in maternal mortality.\n         (3) 22 percent of pregnant women do not have prenatal \n     care in the first trimester, and 22 percent of all poor \n     children are uninsured, despite the medicaid program under \n     title XIX of the Social Security Act.\n         (4) Of the 1,100,000 net increase in uninsured persons \n     from 1992 to 1993, 84 percent or 922,500 were children.\n         (5) Since 1987, the number of children covered by \n     employment based health insurance has decreased, and many \n     children lack health insurance despite the relative \n     affordability of providing insurance for children.\n         (6) Health care coverage for children is relatively \n     inexpensive and in 1993 the medicaid program spent an average \n     of $1,012 per child compared to $8,220 per elderly adult.\n         (7) Uninsured children are generally children of lower \n     income workers, who are less likely than higher income \n     workers to have health insurance for their families because \n     they are less likely to work for a firm that offers \n     insurance, and if such insurance is offered, it is often too \n     costly for lower income workers to purchase.\n         (8) In 1993, 61 percent of uninsured children were in \n     families with at least one parent working full time for the \n     entire year the child was uninsured, and about 57 percent of \n     uninsured children had a family income at or below 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level.\n         (9) If Congress eliminates the Federal guarantee of \n     medicaid, an estimated 4,900,000 children may lose their \n     guarantee of health care coverage, and those same children \n     may be added to the currently projected 12,600,000 children \n     who will be uninsured by the year 2002.\n         (10) Studies have shown that uninsured children are less \n     likely than insured children to receive needed health and \n     preventive care, which can affect their health status \n     adversely throughout their lives, with such children less \n     likely to have routine doctor visits, receive care for \n     injuries, and have a regular source of medical care.\n         (11) The families of uninsured children are more likely \n     to take the children to an emergency room than to a private \n     physician or health maintenance organization.\n       (12) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n     be appropriately immunized or receive other preventive care \n     for childhood illnesses.\n       (13) Ensuring the health of children clearly increases \n     their chances to become productive members of society and \n     averts more serious or more expensive health conditions later \n     in life, and ensuring that all pregnant women receive \n     competent prenatal care also saves social costs.\n       (14) Although the United States has made great improvements \n     in health care coverage through the medicaid program, it is \n     still the only developed nation that does not ensure that all \n     of its children and pregnant women have health care coverage.\n       (15) The United States should not accept a status quo in \n     which children in many neighborhoods are more likely to have \n     access to drugs and guns than to doctors, or accept a status \n     quo in which health care is ensured for all prisoners but not \n     for all children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the issue of adequate health care for our mothers and \n     children is important to the future of the United States, and \n     in consideration of the importance of such issue, the Senate \n     should pass health care legislation that will ensure health \n     care coverage for all of the United States' pregnant women \n     and children.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I urge that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3687), as modified was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. President, I believe I \nmoved to table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, is that \ncorrect, and that I had asked for the yeas and nays at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on rollcall vote 75, I voted ``yea'' and \nintended to vote ``nay.'' I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto change my vote. This will in no way change the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today over 62,000 Vermonters are included \nin the 39.7 million Americans without health insurance. Unfortunately, \nthis number is increasing every year. Health insurance has simply \nbecome less available and affordable, especially for small businesses \nand individuals. I am proud to cosponsor S. 1028, the Health Insurance \nReform Act, that will address some of the issues blocking access to \ncoverage that the uninsured face today.\n  This bill is a good bill and a step in the right direction. The bill \nincreases the availability of insurance by ensuring that anyone who \nwants it, and can afford it, will be able to buy it. I am hopeful that \nprovisions to encourage small employers to form voluntary purchasing \npools will give some relief from rising health insurance premiums by \ngiving them more leverage to negotiate lower premiums and better \nconditions of coverage.\n  To be clear, however, this bill does not address the larger issue of \nthe skyrocketing cost of health care which will continue to be a \nlooming problem that Americans face.\n  What the bill does do is end insurance practices that restrict the \navailability of insurance to people with preexisting medical \nconditions, or avoid enrolling or renewing coverage for older or sicker \nindividuals and groups. The GAO estimates that up to 21 million \nAmericans a year would benefit from federal laws waiving preexisting \ncondition exclusions for persons who had prior coverage.\n  What these reforms add up to is portability of health insurance--an \nend to ``job lock.'' Currently, some employees are ``locked'' into \ntheir current jobs because changing jobs might subject them to periods \nwithout comprehensive coverage while preexisting condition limitations \nwere met. Under this bill, a person with previous group coverage would \nreceive credit from this coverage toward any new limitation period. \nThese portability provisions do not guarantee that an individual \ncurrently insured would be covered after a job change--the new employer \nmust offer coverage for this guarantee to exist. The GAO estimates that \nending job lock will benefit as many as 4 million Americans who have \nstayed in their jobs due to concerns about their preexisting \nconditions.\n  The individuals who will benefit from this bill are real people who \nhave preexisting conditions that they were born with or people who \nbecome sick or have had a severe accident. Without the Kassebaum/\nKennedy bill, insurance companies can continue to impose restrictions \non the coverage they offer to these people whose health conditions are \nbeyond their control. Even worse, someone seeking insurance who has an \nadverse health condition can be denied insurance altogether. These are \nchildren, teenagers, young people trying to get jobs for the first \ntime, our brothers, sisters, parents, and our grandparents. We cannot, \nin good conscience, risk the well being of people whose health could be \ndramatically affected if denied coverage for the care they need.\n  I am proud to say that Vermont has already addressed many of the \nhealth insurance reforms included in S. 1028. In 1991, Vermont was the \nfirst state in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying \ncoverage or charging excessive rates to high-risk groups. In 1992, the \nstate extended this to the individual market. Today in Vermont, no one \ncan be denied health insurance at a reasonable cost from a carrier \ndoing business in the state.\n  However, there is a large exception to this rule. Due to a Federal \nlaw, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA], the State of \nVermont's insurance reforms do not apply to businesses that self-insure \ntheir health benefits programs.\n  For example, during the health reform debate in 1994, I was contacted \nby a Vermont woman who shared with me her husband's experience of \nlosing health coverage due to a preexisting condition. This gentleman \nhad worked for the same business for over 20 years. He had a heart \ncondition, but had always been covered under his employer's health \ninsurance plan. When his employer was bought out by a self-insured \ncompany from another state, the new employer deemed the heart condition \na preexisting condition and denied insurance coverage.\n  Because of stories like this, I have sought to address the issue of \nself-insured employer plans being exempt from State regulation because \nof ERISA in past Congresses. I am very pleased that a key component of \nS. 1028 extends these nondiscrimination and portability requirements to \nself-insured plans. The GAO has estimated that about 44 million \nAmericans are in self-insured health plans that states cannot regulate.\n  S. 1028 is long overdue. Nearly 2 years ago, Congress was engaged in \na great battle over how to get health care costs under control and make \nhealth care services available to all Americans. That battle heeded few \nresults and left millions of Americans frustrated and disappointed that \nhealth care would continue to be out of their reach. The obstacles that \nprevented Americans from buying health insurance have not gone away and \nCongress now owes it to Americans to pass the Kassebaum/Kennedy bill to \naddress some of the issues that these individuals face.\n  We must pass this bill and make the modest changes that will make it \neasier for people to get the health care coverage they need. I hope in \nthe future we will be able to come to agreement on further health \nreforms that will address the skyrocketing cost of health care--simply \nrequiring access to health insurance coverage does not address this \nlooming issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the close of debate during the series \nof rollcall votes, I was prepared to vote in favor of the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from California, Senator Boxer, \nproposing a Senate Resolution that the Congress fully examine \nadministrative practices of Health Maintenance Organizations [HMO's] in \nwhich physicians may be precluded from providing full and complete \nmedical counsel, or referral for specialized care.\n  I am pleased that Senator Boxer's amendment was accepted but wish to \ntake this opportunity to indicate that had there been a rollcall vote, \nI would have voted in favor of the Boxer Amendment.\n  No physician should feel that they are being subjected to a ``gag \nrule'' in the course of their professional practice. Patients are \nentitled to a full and open discussion of all medical options and \nphysicians should not feel restrained in the process.\n\n\n                       liability for biomaterials\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment which \nwould ensure the availability of raw materials and component parts for \nimplantable medical devices. This provision is necessary if Americans \nare to have continued access to a wide variety of life-saving devices, \nsuch as brain shunts, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, and \npacemakers. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain agreement for this \namendment from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Currently, the manufacturers and suppliers of materials used in \nimplantable medical devices are subject to substantial legal liability \nfor\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nselling relatively small amounts of materials to medical device \nmanufacturers. These sales generate relatively small profits and are \noften used for purposes beyond their direct control. Due to their small \nprofit margins and large legal vulnerability for these sales, some of \nthe manufacturers and suppliers of these materials are now refusing to \nprovide them for use in medical devices.\n  It is absolutely essential that a continued supply of raw materials \nand component parts is available for the invention, development, \nimprovement and maintenance of medical devices. Most of these devices \nare made with materials and parts that are not designed or manufactured \nspecifically for use in implantable devices. Their primary use is in \nnon-medical products. Medical device manufacturers use only small \nquantities of these raw materials and component parts, and this market \nconstitutes a small portion of the overall market for such raw \nmaterials.\n  While raw materials and component parts suppliers do not design, \nproduce or test the final medical implant, they have been sued in cases \nalleging inadequate design and testing of, or warnings related to use \nof, permanently implanted medical devices. The cost of defending these \nsuits often exceeds the profits generated by the sale of materials. \nThis is the reason that some manufacturers and suppliers have begun to \ncease supplying their products for use in permanently implanted medical \ndevices.\n  Unless alternative sources of supply can be found, the unavailability \nof raw materials and component parts will lead to unavailability of \nlife-saving and life enhancing medical devices. The prospects for \ndevelopment of new sources of supply for the full range of threatened \nraw materials and component parts are remote, as other suppliers around \nthe world are refusing to sell raw materials or component parts for use \nin manufacturing permanently implantable medical devices in the United \nStates.\n  The product liability concerns that are causing the unavailability of \nraw materials and component parts for medical implants is part of a \nlarger product liability crisis in this country. Immediate action is \nnecessary to ensure the availability of raw materials and component \nparts for medical devices so that Americans have access to the devices \nthey need. Addressing this problem will solve some important aspect of \nour broken medical product liability system.\n\n  This issue came to my attention when I was contacted by one of my \nconstituents, Linda Flake Ransom, about her daughter Tara who requires \na silicon brain shunt. Without a shunt, due to Tara's condition called \nhydrocephalus, excess fluid would build up in her brain, increasing \npressure, and causing permanent brain damage, blindness, paralysis and \nultimately death. With the shunt, she is a healthy, happy and \nproductive straight-A student with enormous promise and potential.\n  Tara has already undergone the brain shunt procedure five times in \nher brief life. However, the next time that she needs to replace her \nshunt, it is not certain that a new one will be available due to the \nunavailability of shunt materials. This situation is a sad example that \nour medical liability system is out of control. It is tragic, but not \nsurprising that manufacturers have decided not to provide materials if \nthey are subject to tens of millions of dollars of potential liability \nfor doing so.\n  It is essential that individuals such as Tara continue to have access \nto the medical devices they need to stay alive and healthy. This \namendment would have helped to ensure the ongoing availability of \nmaterials necessary to make these devices. It would not, in any way, \nhave protected negligent manufacturers or suppliers of medical devices, \nor even manufacturers or suppliers of biomaterials that make negligent \nclaims about their products. However, it would have protected \nmanufacturers and suppliers whose materials are being used in a manner \nthat is beyond their control.\n  Mr. President, we must act to ensure the continued availability of \nbiomaterials to ensure that the lives of Tara and thousands of other \nAmericans are not jeopardized. Because this is a life and death \nsituation, I will do everything I can to assure that the Senate \naddresses this issue in the near future.\n\n\n            health insurance reform and genetic information\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as we are all too aware, the past \nseveral months, it has grown exceedingly difficult for Members of \nCongress to focus their attention on anything other than sad \ncircumstances of our Federal budget. As chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I share in the frustration. Fortunately, I am pleased to see \nthat in the midst of our negotiations, and setbacks, excellent progress \nhas been made in the area of health insurance reform. Senators \nKassebaum and Kennedy are to be commended for their efforts this past \nyear. While compromise may not be in fashion, they have utilized this \ntool with extreme skill, crafting a bill that makes great strides \ntowards improving the infrastructure of health care in the United \nStates.\n  Accessibility to health care was the focus of debate in the 103d \nCongress and it has become our focus again. Many of you know that the \nState of Oregon is already on the cutting edge of improving \naccessibility for many groups. The Oregon Health Plan, with its focus \non providing health care coverage under the Medicaid program, has \nsuccessfully prioritized those health care services most important to \nits citizens. Oregon is therefore able to provide coverage to thousands \nof low-income individuals who would otherwise be uncovered. Oregon is \nalso making progress improving its health insurance system. But issues \nto accessibility, affordability and portability are national issues as \nwell.\n  Several of my colleagues have already discussed the merits of the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act. As one who is about to change jobs, I \nstrongly support the goal of increasing health insurance portability. \nWe must keep this focus in mind. Several amendments are being offered, \nwhich I would normally tend to vote for. However, in light of our need \nto ensure that this reform is passed and signed, I will not be \nsupporting such amendments. Again, several of these amendments being \nconsidered today are excellent. But if their passage only serves to \nmake health insurance reform impossible to pass, my support would be in \nvain and our goal to increase portability would be unmet.\n  Increasing the availability and renewability of health coverage for \nmillions of Americans is a reform Congress has sought for years. \nIndividuals should not be refused the opportunity to renew or change \nhealth plans based on their preexisting conditions. Senator Kassebaum's \nbill addresses this problem and it is estimated it will serve over 25 \nmillion Americans each year. But I also want to thank Senator Kassebaum \nfor clarifying in her bill that individuals with genetic information \nthat predisposes them to a disease will also benefit from the Health \nInsurance Reform Act's portability conditions. This clarifying language \nis a first step toward bringing important issues surrounding genetics \nto their forefront. I would also like to thank Senator Harkin for his \nleadership on the Labor Committee in working to see that genetic \ninformation is protected in the health insurance reform bill.\n  New biomedical technologies have resulted in scientific breakthroughs \nunimaginable just a generation ago. Scientists are working to decode \nour DNA and will ultimately map and sequence every gene in the human \nbody. Such genetic research is our most advanced tool in the search for \ntreatments and cures to diseases such as breast cancer, Alzheimer's or \nHuntington's disease. These are exciting medical frontiers, but if the \nfruit of this labor is to be realized, an unhindered commitment to \ngenetic research must be promoted, and this includes protecting an \nindividual from the threat of genetic discrimination. There have \nalready been cases cited where a physically fit individual, with no \nprevious health problems, is denied insurance on the basis of a single \ngenetic test result.\n  This is a problem for two reasons. First, information about our genes \ntells us much about who we are, but is not accurate enough to tell us \nthe state of our health in the future. Our future medical condition is \na complex puzzle, of which our genetic makeup is just one piece. Health \nplans should not be discriminating on the basis of this single piece. \nSecond, cases have been documented of individuals who wanted\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\nto participate in a genetic test, but when they were told that their \nparticipation may threaten their insurability, they turned around and \nwalked out of the lab.\n  This is not in the best interest of research; this is not in the best \ninterest of society; and it is certainly not in the best interest of \nthe individual. Furthermore, while including genetic discrimination in \nthe Health Insurance Reform Act is a good start, but is just the \nbeginning of a process aimed at protecting the privacy and insurability \nof individuals, regardless of their genetic information or family \nhistory.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it is estimated that this bill will affect \nabout 25 million each year. I have sponsored a separate piece of \nlegislation, the Generic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act, S. 1416, \nwith Senator Mack, which addresses the needs of millions of Americans \nwho may not fit within the boundaries of the bill we are discussing \ntoday. S. 1416 also addresses issues of genetic privacy and employer \ndiscrimination. I am hopeful that the Senate's consideration of genetic \ninformation in this legislation will open the door wider to a deeper \nunderstanding of these important issues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to raise two concerns about the \nlong-term care provisions in the leadership amendment to the Kassebaum/\nKennedy health insurance reform bill.\n  First, under the leadership amendment, long-term care insurance \nreceives the same tax treatment as medical insurance. Since long-term \ncare insurance is treated as medical insurance, I want to make sure \nlong-term care insurance provided to employees by an employer is \nsubject to the same nondiscrimination rules as health insurance.\n  Second, I have a concern that the long-term care provisions in the \nleadership amendment (which includes the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners' model long-term care consumer protections) \nprecludes States from enacting stronger long-term care consumers \nprotections.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, with respect to the first point, long-term \ncare insurance is treated the same as medical insurance for tax \npurposes under the leadership amendment. Since long-term care insurance \nis treated as medical insurance it is intended that it will be subject \nto the nondiscrimination rules applicable to medical insurance provided \nto employees by an employer.\n  On the Senator's second point, it is not the intent of the leadership \namendment to preclude States from enacting stronger long-term care \nconsumer protections. A clarification of this issue can be addressed in \nthe conference report to the bill if necessary.\n\n\n            jeffords-simon and domenici-wellstone amendments\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, tonight the Senate voted on two amendments \nto S. 1028. The first offered by Senator Jeffords and Simon, would \nincrease the maximum lifetime benefit caps in health insurance plans to \n$10 million. The second, offered by Senators Domenici and Wellstone, \nwould require health plans to provide mental health benefits comparable \nto their other medical benefits. I believe both of these amendments are \ngood policy--providing meaningful and equitable coverage for those who \npurchase health insurance. Following the no amendment strategy of the \nbill's managers--Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy--I regretfully voted to \ntable these amendments. It is the unfortunate outcome the no-amendments \nstrategy to have to table good policy such as these. However, the \npurpose is intended to maintain an important yet fragile bipartisan \ncoalition to pass necessary insurance reform. I would otherwise support \nthese policies.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, earlier today I noted the serious problem \nthis Congress faced in 1994 when it tried to take on too many health \ncare-related issues under one bill. We learned that painful lesson \nduring debate on the President's health care reform proposal.\n  For that reason, I mentioned that some amendments that would come up \ntoday, no matter how meritorious, should be considered on future \nmeasures and not impede passage of the Health insurance Reform Act.\n  Several amendments required votes today that, in another context, I \nwould have strongly supported. The issue of life-time caps, and \ntreatment of mental health coverage were passionately debated and \ndeserve the attention of this Congress.\n  My votes on these issues were not intended to approve or disapprove \nof their merits. My overriding concern was that they could complicate \nthis narrowly crafted proposal and jeopardize any chance at health \nreform this year. The sooner we pass this bill to address insurance \nproblems of pre-existing condition exclusions, portability and \nrenewability, the sooner we can address other pressing problems that \naffect the quality of health care in this Nation.\n  In the interest of time, I believe we should pass a clean health \nreform bill. I also believe that Congress should carefully consider \nseveral of the measures that failed today as soon as possible.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, subpart (a)(1)(B) of Section 101, \nSubtitle A of Title I of the bill now before us provides that ``an \nemployee health benefit plan or health plan issuer offering a group \nhealth plan may establish eligibility, continuation of eligibility, \nenrollment, or premium contribution requirements under the terms of \nsuch plan, except that such requirements shall not be based on health \nstatus, medical condition, claims experience, receipt of health care, \nmedical history, evidence of insurability, or disability.'' As I \nunderstand it, this formulation is intended to ensure that, among other \nthings, that participants and beneficiaries are not excluded from \nhealth care coverage because they participate in activities such as \nmotorcycling, skiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling, all-terrain \nvehicle riding, or other similar kinds of activities. I would like to \nask the distinguished manager of the pending bill whether my \ninterpretation of this provision is a correct one.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Americans deserve the security of knowing \nthat they will not lose their health care coverage if they get sick or \nlose their job or if they can change jobs. Currently, our system does \nnot provide this security, and as a result many of our workers have to \nchoose between changing jobs and retaining adequate health care for \nthemselves or their families. Others live in fear of losing their \nhealth insurance if they lose their job. And many who have paid \ninsurance premiums for years cannot get insurance at any price if they \nget sick. Clearly these Americans deserve to know that when they are \nsick or injured, they will get the medical attention that they need \nwhen they need it, without having to worry about losing their homes, \nsavings and financial security.\n  Rather than attempting to change the entire health care system at \nonce, this is an incremental approach which targets these specific \nproblems. It will make it easier for those who change or lose their \njobs to keep their health insurance, and by limiting exclusions for \npreexisting conditions, it will assure access to health care for many \nwho are sick. By making health care portable, the legislation will \nallow millions of Americans to move to better jobs and improve their \nstandard of living. And by ending ``job lock,'' the legislation will \nimprove the fit between workers and their jobs and increase the overall \nproductivity of American workers. Finally, this legislation will make \nit easier for small employers to obtain adequate coverage for their \nemployees. As a result, health insurance will be available to more \nAmericans.\n  In addition to providing portability of health insurance and limiting \nexclusions for preexisting conditions, this legislation contains \ncertain other important provisions. It will increase the tax deduction \nfor health insurance for the self-employed to 80 percent, granting long \noverdue tax relief to the owners of small businesses and farms. The \nlegislation also provides tax deductibility for long term care and \ninsurance, making it possible for more Americans to avoid financial \ndifficulty as the result of chronic illness.\n  Although there is broad bipartisan support for this legislation, I am \naware of the concerns that it may increase individual health insurance \npremiums. The legislation addresses this issue in two ways. First, the \nlegislation imposes no limit on the rate which individual insurers may \ncharge those with\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\npreexisting illnesses, allowing premiums to be set at a level which \nwould not raise costs for others. Therefore any increase in premiums \nwhich does occur will not be the result of this legislation but of how \neach State chooses to regulate its individual insurance market. Second, \nthe legislation gives States considerable flexibility in how they \naddress the requirements of the bill. This will allow States to devise \nstrategies which fit their individual situations.\n\n  In the past several years, many States have taken significant steps \nto reform their health care systems, and they are to be commended for \nthese efforts. For example, my home State of Arizona was one of the \nfirst to use managed care to improve the efficiency of publicly funded \nhealth care, and has passed legislation which encourages the use of \nMedical Savings Accounts. There are certain reforms, however, which \nonly the Federal Government can make. These reforms fall in that \ncategory, and it is our responsibility to make them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3578-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3609-S3613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FUNDING MEDICARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, earlier today we adopted an amendment, \nnow that we have had a chance to review, we find creates a concern.\n  In effect, in our proper and correct effort to address fraud and \nabuse in the Medicare Program, we converted spending that previously \nhad been subject to appropriations into entitlement funding.\n  Because of the consent agreement it is too late to fix this problem.\n  I had an amendment, however, that would have corrected the problem.\n  My amendment would have provided a different funding mechanism for \nthe Medicare fraud and abuse control program. Instead of funding this \nprogram by creating a very large new entitlement program, my amendment \nwould have provided a different funding mechanism.\n  The issue is not whether we should fund the Medicare fraud and abuse \ncontrol program, but how we should fund this program.\n  I strongly support the Medicare fraud and abuse control program, but \nI am troubled by the fact that the bill in its current form would \ncreate $1.5 billion in new mandatory spending for the administrative \nexpenses for three agencies.\n  Congress already addressed this issue on the funding mechanism for \nthe Continuing Disability Reviews [CDR's]. As part of the debt limit, \nwe provided for funding for CDR's by providing a mechanism to give \nthese programs additional funding through the appropriations process. \nMy amendment would have essentially taken the same approach as we did \nwith CDR's.\n  Mr. President, Medicare fraud and abuse control is currently funded \nthrough discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is the funding \nwe provide annually for programs through the appropriations process.\n  My amendment would have replaced the unprecedented new entitlement \nspending for enforcement in this bill with a mechanism that would have \nprovided an automatic upward adjustment for Medicare fraud and abuse \ncontrol spending in the appropriations process.\n  The Medicare Fraud and Abuse Control allowance proposed in this \namendment would have provided an automatic upward adjustment in the \ndiscretionary spending caps to make sure additional funding for the \nInspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the \nFBI, and HCFA is not curtailed by budget limits.\n  However, under my amendment Congress would still have been required \nto annually review and fund these programs.\n  I want to emphasize two important points, Mr. President. First, this \namendment would have done exactly what we did for increasing funding \nfor continuing disability reviews in the debt limit bill.\n  Second, the policy effects for Medicare fraud and abuse control are \nexactly the same as in the current bill. The increased funding for \nfraud and abuse control would have still occurred, and the savings \nwould still have resulted.\n  Mr. President, we will never gain control of Federal spending unless \nwe gain control of entitlement spending. My amendment would have kept \nus from heading down the slippery slope of creating new entitlements \nfor administrative expenses.\n  I hope that laying down this concern now, conferees on this bill will \nattempt to correct his problem before we take final action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the amendment I would have \noffered be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am pleased to support and serve as a \ncosponsor of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995. Senators \nKassebaum and Kennedy have worked together in a bipartisan manner to \ncraft legislation that every Senator should support because it will \nhelp millions of American families. As a member of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, I was proud to join in unanimous support for the \nbill in committee.\n  This is not perfect legislation. It does not fix many of the flaws in \nthe current health care system. But it represents an important step \ntoward reforming health care and injecting some fairness and common \nsense into the system.\n  While supportive of comprehensive health care reform in the last \nCongress I also offered a down payment that would have provided for \ninsurance reform, enhanced tax deductibility of health insurance costs \nfor the self-employed, and increased efforts to crack down on fraud, \nwaste, and abuse in health care--all provisions contained in the bill \nthe Senate is considering today.\n  Millions of Americans would benefit from the insurance reform \nprovisions in S. 1028. Provisions that would gradually raise the \npercentage of health insurance costs that the self-employed can deduct \nfrom 30 percent to 80 percent over the next 10 years would provide \ngreater equity with larger businesses. And, I am pleased that the bill \nincludes provisions to increase funds for the inspector general to \ncombat Medicare fraud and establish tougher sanctions for committing \nfraud.\n  Mr. President, Americans should not be denied health care coverage \nfor changing jobs, getting sick or having a preexisting medical \ncondition. And if someone loses their job, they shouldn't have to lose \ntheir health insurance, too. This legislation is designed to respond to \nthose concerns.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act will provide American families with \nmore security and choices. It will offer some welcome relief for \nAmerican families worried about losing their health insurance. It will \nhelp prevent people from losing their health insurance when they become \nsick. And it will limit preexisting conditions. These are all \nfundamental, necessary reforms.\n  I want to thank both Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for working with \nall the members of the committee to strengthen the bill. I am \nparticularly grateful for their help in making sure that the \nlegislation prohibits group and individual health plans from \nestablishing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements \nbased on genetic information. I offered an amendment on this issue \nduring committee consideration of S. 1028 and am pleased it is included \nin the bill.\n  I am also grateful for their help in ensuring that States are given \nappropriate flexibility. The legislation takes into account the \nprogress already made by States like Iowa which just implemented \nadditional and very significant insurance reforms on April 1 of this \nyear. S. 1028 would allow States to preserve laws such as high risk \npools that help small groups and individuals purchase insurance.\n  The provisions in the legislation related to preexisting conditions \nare important and add some common sense to the current health insurance \nmarket. The bill limits the ability of insurers to impose exclusions \nfor preexisting conditions. Under the legislation, no such exclusion \ncan last for more than 12 months. Once someone has been covered for 12 \nmonths, no new exclusions can be imposed as long as there is no gap in \ncoverage--even if someone changes jobs, loses their job, or changes \ninsurance companies.\n  The bill also requires insurers to sell and renew group health \npolicies for all employees who want coverage for their employees. It \nguarantees renewability of individual policies.\n  It prohibits insurers from denying insurance to those moving from \ngroup coverage to individual coverage. It prohibits group health plans \nfrom excluding any employee based on health status.\n  The preexisting condition provisions will help real people who have \nalready experienced an illness and want to switch insurers or change \njobs.\n  For example, just last week a father from Iowa City called my office \nabout his daughter who has a chronic health condition and will graduate \nfrom college this spring. He was worried that when she graduates and is \nno longer covered under his health insurance policy she will not be \nable to find insurance coverage for her chronic health condition.\n  Because the Health Insurance Reform Act would require insurers to \ncredit prior insurance coverage, his daughter can move to another \nhealth insurance plan without being denied coverage for her preexisting \ncondition.\n  The portability provisions in the bill will help with so-called job \nlock. Workers who want to change jobs for higher wages or advance their \ncareers often have to pass up opportunities because it might mean \nlosing health coverage. The portability provisions contained in\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nthis legislation would benefit at least 25 million Americans annually \naccording to the General Accounting Office. And, these provisions will \nprovide greater security for the millions of Americans currently \ncovered under group health plans.\n  I've heard from Iowans who have had to pass up new job offers or \nforego starting their own small business because they or someone in \ntheir family has a preexisting condition. Workers with a sick child are \nforced to pass up career opportunities because their new insurance may \nnot cover a preexisting condition for 6 months or more. These families \nhave played by the rules and have been continuously insured--they \ndeserve to know that if they pay their insurance premiums for years, \nthey cannot be denied coverage or be subjected to a new exclusion for a \npreexisting condition because they change jobs. The Health Insurance \nReform Act would allow people to switch jobs without worrying about \ndenied coverage for preexisting conditions.\n  Many States, including Iowa, have already enacted standards for \ninsurance carriers. In fact, legislation passed in Iowa is more \ncomprehensive in many respects and includes provisions that help make \ninsurance more affordable for small groups and individuals. But, \nFederal legislation is necessary because States are prevented from \nregulating self-funded health plans--the type of plans that cover the \nmajority of Iowans. This legislation will also provide a national floor \nand a guaranteed level of protection for all Americans.\n  I support this bill and urge my colleagues to not offer amendments \nthat will weaken it. We should keep this bill free of the objectionable \nprovisions that were included in the House bill--provisions which will \nsurely prompt President Clinton to veto the bill, and that will \nultimately deny long-needed assistance to millions of middle-class \nAmerican families.\n\n\n                     Organ Donation Insert Card Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first and foremost, I would like to thank \nthe distinguished managers on both sides for agreeing to include this \ncritical provision in the Health Insurance Reform Act.\n  The Senate's passage of the Organ Donation Insert Card Act is \nparticularly timely. Next week is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week, and the need for organ and tissue donors is more \ncrucial than ever. Right now, the national waiting list for an organ \ntransplant has topped 45,000 people, and a new name is added to the \nlist every 18 minutes.\n  The Organ Donation Insert Card amendment represents a simple, cost-\neffective way for the Federal Government to help save the lives of \nthose who are waiting for an organ transplant. The amendment will \nprovide millions of Americans with organ and tissue donor information \nwith their income tax refund checks in 1997. This one-time insert will \ngive taxpayers the opportunity to learn more about this important \nsubject and to fill out cards to become donors.\n  Each year, we miss thousands of opportunities for organ \ntransplantation because of a hesitancy among next-of-kin to authorize \ndonation when they do not know their loved ones wishes. Of the 20,000 \ndeaths each year that fulfill the medical criteria for becoming organ \ndonors, only about one-fourth actually become donors.\n  As a result, eight people die every day while waiting for a \ntransplant. At least some of these deaths could be prevented through \nthe information campaign authorized by the Organ Donation Insert Card \nAct.\n  I understand that authorizing donation is a difficult decision for a \ngrieving family to make, and their task is made much harder when they \ndo not know their loved one's wishes. For that reason, I would like to \ntake a moment to acknowledge a few of the families I have heard from \nwho authorized donation.\n  Gary and Bobbie Schroeder say they did not give a lot of thought to \norgan transplantation. I suspect that is true for many of us.\n  But on November 26, 1989, their 21-year-old son Jeff was in a fatal \ncar accident. Gary wrote to me,\n\n       Jeff was a 4th year pre-med college student in Southern \n     California, when he and his roommate, returning from playing \n     in a college basketball tournament, ran into wet and slippery \n     roads and had a single car accident. Jeff sustained a head \n     injury, even though wearing his seat belt, causing brain \n     death. * * *\n\n  Jeff was on life support, but tests showed absence of brain activity, \nand he was declared brain dead 4 days later.\n  We were then given the opportunity of making a decision that would \ngive some purpose to a tragic situation. * * * Donating Jeff's organs \ngave us the opportunity to start the healing process. * * *\n  Jeff was a giver in life, always helping others; we know he would \nwant to continue helping others, even in death.\n  Jeff's organs helped sustain life to four other individuals, by \ngiving his heart, liver, and kidneys. He helped give hope and extended \nlife to the recipients and their families. Our decision to give has \nbeen a step toward healthy grieving, and we would make the same \ndecision again.''\n  Patrick Pins, a high school Social Studies teacher in Mandan, ND, \nalso knows firsthand the difficult decision that families face when a \nloved one dies. In 1992, his wife Barbara was attending a family \nreunion with her family when she developed a severe migraine, nausea, \nand neck pain. Although she was rushed to the hospital, she had \nsuffered severe brain trauma and died within 24 hours of arriving at \nthe hospital.\n  While only a machine kept Barbara's body alive, Patrick and the \ncouple's three children struggled with their grief and talked and \nprayed. Ultimately, they decided to donate Barbara's organs.\n  Today, like the Schroeders, Patrick says that confronted with the \nsame decision again, ``I'd do the very same thing.''\n  Throughout her life, Barbara's family and friends say the popular \nHead Start teacher constantly gave of herself and taught the children \nin her care and the people around her important lessons. Through the \ndonation of her organs, she has been able to do the same even in death.\n  As I have worked for the enactment of this bill, I have also been \nmotivated by the many families who have shared with me their stories of \nagonizing months spent waiting for a suitable organ and of the joy of \nreceiving a chance to live. I think it would be appropriate to share \nsome of those stories to remind us all that there are names and faces \nbehind the statistics.\n  Donna Grendahl is a Minnesota mom whose son, Robby, received a heart \ntransplant in 1986. In her letter to me, Donna wrote:\n\n       My son received the gift of a new heart in transplant \n     surgery 9 years ago. * * * Now 9 years later, he is a 24-\n     year-old college graduate. He teaches American history/civics \n     and coaches hockey and baseball at the high school level. * * \n     *\n       Thanks to the availability of a donor, he has been able to \n     enjoy the gift of his second chance at life to the fullest.\n\n       Bonnie Simonet, a wife and mother and a double-lung \n     transplant recipient, told me: ``I suffered for 10 years with \n     a disease to my lungs. . . .\n       Oxygen kept me alive, but my lips and fingernails were \n     blue. I was on oxygen 24 hours a day, and I was only 47-years \n     young, which I consider too young to die. I had a life left \n     to live. . . .\n       When my doctor suggested a lung transplant, it seemed so \n     drastic, but I wanted to live. I went through a week of \n     evaluation, many tests and had to get approval from my \n     insurance company. When this was set in motion, I was put on \n     the waiting list for a double lung transplant. . . .\n       On August 4, 1994, after waiting on the list for 9 months, \n     I was called. . .. I was in surgery 6 hours and came out a \n     new person with a 2nd chance at life and a new attitude about \n     what is important.\n\n       Janet Johnston's 19-month-old grandson, Colton, is alive \n     today because he received a new liver. According to Janet,\n\n       My grandson, Colton, went through his first surgery at a \n     month and a half old, which didn't take care of his problem. \n     He was put on a list in January for a liver transplant. We \n     waited six long months, always worried if he was going to \n     live long enough before a liver became available. On July \n     16th we got our gift.\n       We are pleased to support your proposed ``Organ Donation \n     Insert Card Act. Please continue to work hard. There are \n     people who do benefit and have happy endings.\n\n       Finally, Gary Rux, a heart transplant recipient shares his \n     story:\n\n       I recently received a copy of your proposed legislation for \n     an ``Organ Donor Insert Card.'' I want you to know that I \n     support this legislation with all of my new heart. . . .\n       I have firsthand knowledge of what it is like to spend over \n     2 years dying, not knowing for sure if I would be around to \n     provide\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\n     for my family. In spite of the time I spent waiting for a \n     heart, I ask that you offer no sympathy to me. I am one of \n     the lucky ones. . . . There are many, however, who are not so \n     lucky. It is they who need and deserve our sympathy. \n     Fortunately for them, you are in a position to do more than \n     simply offer sympathy. I thank you on behalf of the many \n     individuals who are waiting, and dying, at this very moment. \n     Bear in mind as you promote this legislation that some of \n     these individuals who are dying are just children. I believe \n     they deserve a chance, and with your and our support, perhaps \n     they can have that chance.\n\n       Fortunately, these stories all have happy endings and they \n     are heartwarming to hear, but we must also remember the many \n     families who do not have a happy ending. In my view, the most \n     common tragedy of organ transplantation is not the patient \n     who receives a transplant and dies, but the patient who has \n     to wait too long, dying before a suitable organ can be found.\n       But today, the Senate has taken a step to prevent some of \n     these needless deaths.\n       In closing, I want to thank the many organizations and \n     supporters who have endorsed this bill and that worked \n     tirelessly for its enactment. I also want to mention my \n     Senate colleagues who have cosponsored the bill, Senators \n     Bradley, Cochran, DeWine, Frist, Helms, Inouye, Bob Kerrey, \n     John Kerry, Leahy, Levin, Moseley-Braun, Murkowski, Robb, and \n     Simpson.\n       Finally, I want to again thank the managers, Senators \n     Kassebaum and Kennedy, for accepting this amendment, and I \n     look forward to working with them to retain it in conference.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Congress has begun the debate on \nlegislation that will affect the way millions of Americans get their \nhealth insurance. Both the House and the Senate bills are intended to \naddress a serious concern among millions of working Americans who \ncurrently have employer provided health insurance: the threat of losing \nprivate health insurance when they lose or change jobs or, try to \nobtain coverage when they have a preexisting medical condition.\n  The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill contains some useful provisions and \naddresses some important problems in the health insurance market. \nHowever, I believe these problems are more effectively addressed in the \nhealth insurance reform plan passed on March 27 in the House of \nRepresentatives--and reportedly contained in the Finance Committee \namendment.\n  I believe the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill could be improved and expanded \nby incorporating important provisions in the House bill--and in the \nproposed Finance Committee amendment. These provisions more \nsuccessfully address the health care problems faced by millions of \nAmericans, such as:\n  The Problem: An ambitious worker who wants to pursue a career \nopportunity, but can't change jobs because his son has cancer, and \nwouldn't be covered by a new employer's insurance.\n  The Solution: The House bill guarantees that anyone with employer \nprovided insurance can move to another job with employer provided \ninsurance without losing coverage for a preexisting condition.\n  The Problem: A worker is laid off, and can't get coverage for a \npreexisting condition in the individual market.\n  The Solution: The House bill includes group-to-individual \nportability, so that when you leave a job that provided coverage for a \nchronic condition, you cannot be denied coverage in the individual \nmarket.\n  The Problem: An uninsured entrepreneur who can't afford insurance as \na self-employed person today.\n  The Solution: The House bill allows the self-employed to deduct 50 \npercent of their premiums from their taxes. Increasing deductibility \nmakes health insurance more affordable for self-employed individuals. \nThe Finance Committee amendment may increase the deduction to 80 \npercent.\n  The Problem: An uninsured person, out of work, who can't afford a \ncostly individual policy because it is loaded down with State mandated \nbenefits.\n  The Solution: The House bill includes medical savings accounts, so \nthat an individual can buy a high-deductible policy, with a much lower, \nmore affordable premium.\n  Mr. President, MSA's offer the ultimate in portability and \naffordability, and I want to further address this critical issue later \nin my remarks.\n  The Problem: A small business employee, whose employer can't afford \nto purchase insurance for his five employees, because one of them has a \nchronic illness.\n  The Solution: The House bill allows small businesses to group \ntogether to purchase health insurance.\n  By grouping together, they can share risk and spread administrative \ncosts over a larger group, lowering premiums for everyone.\n  These ERISA regulated arrangements would be exempted from state \nmandated benefits and pooling prohibitions that can drive up the cost \nof care.\n  The Problem: The federal tax code often discourages citizens from \nproviding for their own health care needs.\n  The Solution: The House bill provides for tax deductibility for long-\nterm care insurance premiums and expenses and, tax free use of \naccelerated life-insurance benefits for health expenses.\n  The Problem: Fear of frivolous lawsuits and outrageous recoveries \nforces many doctors to practice costly ``defensive medicine.''\n  The Solution: The House bill reforms medical malpractice claims. \nPatients who are injured as a result of malpractice deserve to be fully \ncompensated.\n  But in today's system, an enormous amount of money that should be \ndedicated to health care spending goes instead to lawyers--sometimes as \nmuch as 40 percent to 50 percent.\n  The Problem: Fraud, waste, abuse and administrative inefficiency cost \nthe health care system billions per year in wasted resources.\n  The Solution: Tougher penalties for waste, fraud, and abuse along \nwith administrative simplification through electronic billing and \nuniform forms.\n  II. Mr. President, during this debate I plan to support the proposed \nFinance Committee Amendment. The provisions in this amendment will \nincrease portability, tax equity, and affordability.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the following provisions \nwill be included in the Finance Committee Amendment to the Kennedy-\nKassebaum Health Care Reform Act: an increase in the self-employed \nhealth care tax deduction to 50 percent or higher; medical savings \naccounts providing for deposits of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 \nfor families; deductibility for long-term care premiums and expenses; \nand, tax-free treatment of accelerated death benefits for the \nterminally ill.\n  Mr. President, assuming these provisions are included in the \ncommittee's amendment, it would not be my intention to offer any \namendments; further, I would not object to a unanimous consent (UC) \nagreement.\n  However, in the event that any of the above provisions are not \nincluded in the amendment, I will offer and support amendments to \nreplace these provisions.\n  III. The importance of MSAs. MSAs are one feature of the House bill--\nand reportedly the Finance Committee Amendment--that will increase the \nportability, availability, and affordability of health insurance. MSA \nare a simple, low cost alternative to traditional health care insurance \nfor the millions of Americans who cannot afford today's health \ninsurance options or, who are not happy with available insurance \noptions.\n  Here is how an MSA can work: The employer purchases a high-deductible \nhealth insurance policy and places an amount of money equal to the \nemployees' deductible in a special savings account called a medical \nsavings account. The money in the MSA, tax-free, to cover most medical \ncosts. The individual keeps what is not used after one year, collects \ninterest, and the balance rolls over into the next year, when the \nemployer makes additional contributions to the account.\n  In addition to covering basic medical services, these funds can be \nused to cover services not covered by health insurance, such as \nelective surgery and long-term care. Money accumulated in an MSA can \nonly be withdrawn for medical expenses as established by the Internal \nRevenue Code. For MSAs to receive the same tax treatment as employer-\nprovided health benefits plans, a high-deductible plan would have to be \ncombined with the MSA. A high-deductible plan would have a deductible \nof at least $1,500 in the case of an individual, and $3,000 for a \nfamily. Individuals--including the self-employed--could make tax-\ndeductible contributions: up to $2,000 if single, $4,000 if married. \nThe inside build-up would be tax-free. The amounts could be withdrawn \nfrom the MSA tax- and penalty-free if used for medical purposes. \nEmployer contributions to an MSA would\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\nnot be taxable to the employee on whose behalf the contribution is \nbeing made.\n\n  While Congress has been considering MSAs, many companies have gone \nahead on their own and have developed highly successful MSAs or MSA-\ntype programs. A March 1995 study by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation \nanalyzed the experience of 1037 companies nation-wide who had \nimplemented MSAs. For instance, in 1994, the Valley Surgical Group \nHealth Plan of Phoenix implemented an MSA plan for its 14 employees. \nAccording to the Evergreen Report, annual employer costs were reduced \nby $400 per employee in the first year alone. Mr. President, here is \nwhy MSAs will work:\n  1. Parity in tax treatment: MSAs grant high-deductible health plans--\npaired with an MSA--comparable tax treatment to that of other forms of \nemployment-based group health plans, and allow people to claim the \ndeduction even if they do not otherwise itemize taxes.\n  2. Positive incentives: MSAs provide Americans the incentives to \npurchase health care more carefully by letting them keep what they \ndon't spend.\n  The current unlimited exclusion for employer-based health care \nencourages unnecessary spending.\n  3. Major medical protection: MSAs insure that the necessary coverage \nwill be there in the event of an illness or accident.\n  4. The ultimate in portability: MSAs provide for real portability. \nUnlike other forms of employer-based health plans, medical savings in \nthe MSA can be taken from job to job.\n  5. More choices for consumers: The MSAs empower people to make their \nown health care decisions.\n  Funds in the MSA may be spent, on qualified medical expenses that may \nnot be covered under high-deductible plan (e.g., prescription drugs, \ndurable medical equipment, etc * * *).\n  6. MSAs Help meet long term care needs: MSAs will help people who \nwant to protect themselves against future long-term care needs.\n  MSA funds can be used to purchase long-term care insurance or \nservices.\n  7. States are moving toward MSAs: Arizona is one of 15 states that \nhave already passed laws granting favorable tax treatment to MSAs.\n  The failure to establish federal tax rules regarding MSAs will \ninhibit innovations that many states have decided is good health \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the overwhelming evidence that MSAs are a \nviable health insurance alternative with wide appeal, there are still a \nfew who say MSAs favor only the healthy and wealthy. This is \ninaccurate. While MSAs will be attractive for the healthy, they will be \nequally attractive for the sick. The reason: The MSA gives individuals \nthe ultimate freedom to choose their health care providers, thereby \nallowing individuals to seek out the best health care services that \nmeet their budget.\n\n  The accusation that MSAs will work only for the wealthy is also \ninaccurate. According to a 1996 analysis by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, middle-income Americans will choose MSAs. According to the \nJoint Committee, one million Americans are expected to sign up for \nMSAs. An estimated 650,000 people who earn between $40,000 and $75,000 \na year would chose MSAs., 120,000 with incomes between $30,000 and \n$40,000 would choose MSAs.\n  MSAs could lower overall health care costs. Voluntarily uninsured \nworkers might receive an incentive to obtain health insurance as a \nresult of MSAs. Younger, healthier workers who don't purchase health \ninsurance because they believe they will never get sick, would now have \nan incentive to be covered against major illnesses as a result of MSAs. \nThis would increase the number of healthy people in the insurance pool \nand would lower overall health costs.\n  Are supporters of MSAs out of the mainstream? No. As part of the \nKennedy/Kassebaum bill, the Labor Committee passed a ``Sense of the \nCommittee'' resolution that said:\n\n       It is the sense of the Committee that the establishment of \n     medical savings accounts . . . be encouraged as part of any \n     health insurance reform legislation passed by the Senate.\n\n  Also in the Kennedy/Kassebaum bill, there is a provision that allows \nMedicare risk HMOs to offer medical savings accounts.\n  The Democratic support MSAs. In 1994, all the Democrats on Ways and \nMeans voted to include MSAs in the Clinton plan. In 1994, \nRepresentative Gephardt included them in his Democratic Leadership \nbill. In 1992, Senator John Breaux introduced a bipartisan MSA bill. \nSenators Tom Daschle, Sam Nunn, Alan Dickson, Richard Shelby, David \nBoren co-sponsored the legislation. In 1994, Senator Paul Simon was a \ncosponsor of MSA legislation.\n  Mr. President, MSAs are one of the keys to portability, \naffordability, and choice of health insurance for millions of \nAmericans. I believe the Senate must pass MSAs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy was \nassassinated in California by an assailant carrying a junk gun. That \nterrible event convinced Congress that something had to be done about \nthe dramatic increase in gun violence. Specifically, Congress concluded \nthat it had to act to stem the proliferation of these junk guns, or as \nthey are also known, Saturday night specials.\n  Later that year, Congress passed the Gun Control Act of 1968, which \nbarred the importation of junk guns. The guns affected by the import \nban had several things in common: They were cheap. They were poorly \nconstructed, and they lacked important safety devices.\n  Shortly after the passage of the Gun Control Act, unintended \nconsequences began to emerge. Many new companies were formed to \nmanufacture junk guns domestically. Protected from foreign competition \nand given a virtual monopoly over the U.S. market, the domestic \nproduction of junk guns skyrocketed. In fact, all of the companies that \nproduce today's criminals' favorite junk guns were founded after 1968.\n  In 1972, Congress tried to end the double standard that allows the \ndomestic manufacture of junk guns. Sixty eight Senators--including Bob \nDole and Strom Thurmond--voted to close the loophole permanently. \nUnfortunately, despite its more than two to one support in the Senate, \nthat bill was killed in a House committee.\n  Along with my cosponsors, John Chafee and Bill Bradley, I have \nintroduced legislation, S. 1654, that is closely modeled after that \n1972 bill.\n  The principle of that bill that passed the Senate so overwhelmingly \nnearly 25 years ago and the bill I have introduced is simple: if a gun \nis such a great threat to public safety that its importation is banned, \nthen its domestic manufacture should also be prohibited. Its point of \norigin is irrelevant.\n  By every measure, the problem of gun violence has grown worse since \npassage of the Gun Control Act. This indisputable fact was most \nrecently demonstrated in the release last week of a study by the \nChildren's Defense\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nFund. Among CDF's findings was the chilling statistic that a child dies \nfrom gunfire every 92 minutes in the United States. And over the last \n10 years, the rates of child gun deaths have nearly doubled.\n  A Center for Disease Control survey found that on an average day, 1 \nin 20 high school students carries a gun to school. But it is not just \na high school problem. A few years ago in San Francisco, a 7 year old \nsecond grader was suspended for bringing his mother's junk gun to \nschool, where he threatened to shoot a classmate.\n  What can we do to fight this problem? One Step is to end this junk \ngun double standard.\n  In my State of California, a bill to prohibit the manufacture and \nsale of junk guns passed the State senate last year, but was blocked in \nan assembly committee in January.\n  However, this is a problem that the U.S. Congress created, and it is \none that the Congress should fix. Clearly, a nationwide ban would be \nthe most effective way to keep these firearms out of the hands of \ncriminals.\n  My bill applies prospectively only. It does not affect any guns \ncurrently in circulation.\n  I am proud that my legislation has been endorsed by the California \nPolice Chiefs Association and the chiefs of some of California's \nlargest cities including Willie Williams of Los Angeles, Fred Lau of \nSan Francisco, Art Venegas of Sacramento, and Louis Cobarruviaz of San \nJose. In all, 27 California police chiefs and sheriffs have endorsed my \nlegislation. It has also been endorsed by the Coalition to Stop Gun \nViolence, a leading national antiviolence organization.\n  I am introducing this measure at the same time that Congress is \nmoving backward on gun issues by reopening the assault weapons ban. I \nam confident that with the leadership of President Clinton, Senators \nDianne Feinstein, Paul Simon and others, we will defeat efforts to roll \nback our progress on assault weapons, but I believe that just holding \nour ground is not enough. We must continue to move forward.\n  What is a junk gun? There are many differences between models, but \nthey have certain traits in common. They are small and light, which \nmake them highly concealable. They are made of inferior materials like \nzinc, instead of higher quality metal alloys. And they lack important \nsafety features that can help prevent accidental shootings. Junk guns \nare cheap--some can be bought for as little as $69. The most striking \nfeature in common is that junk guns are used disproportionately in \ncrimes.\n  One recent study conducted by the U.C. Davis Violence Prevention \nCenter found that junk guns are 3.4 times as likely to be used in \ncrimes as are other firearms. This view was confirmed by Chief Ronald \nLowenberg, president of the California Police Chiefs' Association who \nwrote to me, ``There is no doubt that `Saturday Night Specials' are \ndisproportionately represented in homicides and other crimes.'' \nAccording to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, of the 10 \nguns most frequently traced at crime scenes, 8 are junk guns.\n  Junk guns' price and concealability--the factors that make them so \nattractive to criminals--are also the factors that make them unsuitable \nfor general use.\n  What about junk guns for hunting and target shooting? According to \nfirearms experts, they are totally unsuitable because of low accuracy \nand high failure rates. And what about home and self protection? Again, \njunk guns are ill suited for the job. These guns are inaccurate, poorly \nconstructed, and lacking important safety features. Keeping a junk gun \nin the house is an invitation to disaster.\n  I know of one case in which a man was killed when his gun fell from \nits holster as he bent over to get a drink of water from a fountain. In \nanother case, a man was critically injured when a junk gun he kept in \nhis car fired when the car hit a bump in the road.

A \ndistinguished public servant, an accomplished legislator, and a man of \ngreat integrity and humanity, Edmund Sixtus Muskie represented the best \nof the Senate and of the Nation.\n  Throughout his career in public service Senator Muskie exhibited a \nrare and remarkable gift; his extraordinary ability to see \nopportunities where others could not and to translate those \nopportunities into positive changes for the people of Maine and the \nNation.\n  Ed Muskie began his career of dedicated public service in the Maine \nLegislature where he initially served as part of a small Democratic \nminority. From this modest beginning, he assumed the reins of the Maine \nDemocratic party and revitalized it by exercising the vision and \nleadership necessary to involve people more fully in the political \nprocess. His efforts led to his own election as Maine's first \nDemocratic governor in 20 years, and in 1958, he became the first \npopularly elected Democratic Senator in Maine's history.\n  But the depth and breadth of Ed Muskie's vision extended far beyond \nMaine politics. Upon his arrival in the U.S. Senate, he continued to \nexhibit the same straightforwardness and independent thinking that won \nhim the trust of the citizens of Maine. These traits enabled him to \nmake the Environment and Public Works Committee the forum which \nproduced this Nation's landmark environmental protection legislation, \nthe Clean Air Act and the Water Quality Act. These critical \nenvironmental statutes changed the way Americans view our precious \nnatural resources and his work provided the foundation upon which all \nsubsequent environmental protection statutes have been built.\n  In addition, his efforts were instrumental to the passage of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, establishing the beginnings of the \nmodern coordinated Congressional budget process. As the first chairman \nof the Senate Budget Committee, Ed Muskie was committed to the \neffective disciplined Federal spending; demonstrating that promoting \nfiscal responsibility and meeting the needs of our people were \ncomplementary objectives.\n  Throughout his lifetime of public service, Ed Muskie was a man his \ncountry could turn to in a time of crises. As a U.S. Senator, a vice-\npresidential and then presidential candidate, and as Secretary of \nState, he demonstrated an unsurpassed commitment to improving the \nwelfare of all Americans. In his candid, forthright and honest way, he \nencouraged the free exchange of ideas within the democratic process, \nworking to transcend partisan boundaries and foster what he called a \n``politics of trust'' in this Nation.\n  One of his many legacies to our country is the large number of former \nMuskie staff members who under his leadership made such extraordinary \ncontributions to our Nation's welfare. Many of these individuals \ncontinue to render dedicated public service and they constitute a \nnational asset which is yet another tribute to Ed Muskie's sterling \nqualities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity not only to \nhonor the life and service of Edmund Muskie, but to extend my deepest \nand heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Jane, and to his children, \nStephen, Ellen, Melinda, Martha, and Ned, and their families. We thank \nthem for sharing their husband and father with the Nation--America is a \nfar better place for Ed Muskie's contributions.\n  On Saturday, March 30, 1996, an exceptionally moving service for Ed \nMuskie was held at the Church of the Little Flower in Bethesda, \nMaryland, followed by burial at Arlington National Cemetery. At that \nservice, eloquent and heartfelt eulogies were delivered which greatly \nmoved all of us who were present. In testimony to Ed Muskie's life of \nquality and honor, I ask unanimous consent that these eulogies be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogies were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Remarks by Steve Muskie\n\n       Rev. Clergy, President and Mrs. Carter, Ed Muskie \n     colleagues, family and friends. From\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\n     my mother and everyone in our family, I want to thank you for \n     coming here today to remember and honor my father. I expect \n     that you will hear others speak about Dad's political life \n     and the work he did over his long career of public service. \n     But I would like to take a few minutes to tell you a little \n     about some of the things that we, his wife, children and \n     grandchildren, remember fondly. Thursday night we had a \n     family dinner to celebrate Dad's 82nd birthday. We drank a \n     toast to him, sang happy birthday and the youngest of Mom and \n     Dad's seven grandchildren blew out the candles on two \n     birthday cakes that we brought to the party. Of course, the \n     celebration was bittersweet because Dad was not physically \n     present. But he was present in spirit, in the thoughts of all \n     of us who learned from him and loved him, you could see and \n     hear the evidence all around the room--in the sixteen people \n     there--some blood relations others bonded by marriage into \n     the Muskie family. I saw it in their mannerisms, vocal \n     inflections, proclivity for puns or quiet contemplation, in a \n     hearty laugh or a mischievous twinkle of an eye. They were \n     the telltale signs of Dad's lasting imprint on our lives. We \n     have all been recalling images of Dad, many of which had been \n     lost for a long time, tucked away in the recesses of our \n     memories.\n       For me, one of the most vivid is an image of cold summer \n     mornings at our Birch Point cottage on Maine's China Lake, \n     forty years ago. The odor of smoke and the crackling sound of \n     a fire just coming to life greeted Ellen and me when we \n     padded down the stairs and climbed on to Dad's lap as he sat \n     next to the fireplace in a big leather chair. While we warmed \n     ourselves by the fire it was Dad's way to repeat the story \n     that we most enjoyed hearing, a tale of young Biddo Bear who \n     woke one cold morning, just as we had, and went with his \n     father on a fishing trip. The story was replete with the kind \n     of sound effects the public never heard from Dad during \n     speeches. For example, Dad talked about Biddo Bear's father's \n     tug on the starter cord of their small boat's outboard \n     motor--Paroom! Putt-putt-putt! ``They drove down the lake \n     to catch some fishes,'' he said. That was a time when Dad \n     was governor and the demands on his time were less than \n     they were by the time the last of his children were almost \n     grown. My brother Ned recalls that even when Dad was \n     secretary of state, he regularly showed up at school, \n     casually dressed and surrounded by security agents to \n     attend a baseball game in which Ned might be pitching or \n     to help Ned haul luggage and boxes into a new dormitory \n     room. Ned of course swears the security agents didn't do \n     any of the work.\n       Another powerful image is of Dad seated at the dining table \n     surrounded by several of the youngest grandchildren. They \n     always wanted to be near him at meal time, because he \n     inevitably played games with them, walking his fingers across \n     the table to tickle them or to catch their tiny hands in his \n     big ones until Mom gently chastised him ``now stop that \n     poppa.'' The kids grinned feeling they had gotten away with \n     something. As much as I would like to stand here displaying \n     my photographs of Dad, these images and others like them are \n     much more powerful than those captured by a camera because \n     they improve and evolve with age and the mix of other \n     memories we recall. They will never leave us. However \n     wonderful and comforting those images are, more important are \n     the lessons we learned and the characters we developed as a \n     result of watching and trying to follow Dad's strong \n     examples. My youngest sister, Martha, told me yesterday that \n     her interest in social work really grew from some of those \n     examples. She said:\n       ``Dad believed that all people really are equal. That the \n     color of your skin, the source of your beliefs, where you \n     live or how much money you have doesn't matter.''\n       When Greg Singleton, from the SW side of Washington, lived \n     with us for several summers, ``It was never any question,'' \n     said Martha, ``that he would be treated exactly like the rest \n     of us.'' Martha's statement made me realize that we have \n     all grown up and lived under the strong influence of both \n     the public and private Ed Muskie. Today we acknowledge our \n     love and gratitude and share with you a celebration of his \n     life.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Remarks by Leon Billings\n\n       People who loved Ed Muskie, welcome. As was so often the \n     case in the thirty years I worked for Ed Muskie, 15 of which \n     I was paid, I have the honor of speaking for the staff. Those \n     who actually worked for the Senator and those he thought \n     worked for him. The nameless, faceless staff. A couple of \n     years ago, I had lunch with the Senator. By then I was in my \n     early 50s, about the same age he was when he hired me. I \n     decided that I could start calling him Ed. So we sat down and \n     I used his first name and he looked at me and said, so its \n     going to be Ed now is it? So Senator * * * Before I tell a \n     couple stories I remember of some of our lighter moments, I \n     want to say something about your role as this nation's most \n     important environmental leader. Many times you would take a \n     globe of the earth in your hand and point out that the \n     earth's atmosphere was no thicker than that thin patina of \n     shellac that covered that globe. And you would say, ``that's \n     all that protects human life. That thin layer, no thicker \n     than that layer of shellac is all that is between humankind \n     and extinction.'' That analogy in simple terms stated your \n     commitment to achievement of a healthy environment. A concept \n     you invented, a concept you institutionalized and a concept \n     that you internationalized. You changed the way the world \n     acts towards the environment. That legacy will endure as long \n     as people breathe on this earth. From the Clean Air Act of \n     1970 to Global 2000 as Senator and Secretary of State, you \n     took a problem too few people cared about and converted it \n     into a movement and then into a reality. I recall after the \n     Senate unanimously passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, Senator \n     Eugene McCarthy said to Senator in the elevator, he said \n     ``Ed,'' (he could call him Ed) he said, ``Ed you found an \n     issue better than motherhood, there are even some people \n     opposed to motherhood.'' So everyone here, please take a \n     deep breath, and while holding that breath think just for \n     a moment that each of us, our children, our grandchildren \n     and the children of centuries yet to come, owe a single \n     debt to you, Senator Muskie.\n       Sometimes working for you wasn't a day at the beach. But we \n     were rewarded by your brilliance, your courageousness and \n     your creative public policy mind. You evinced incredible \n     loyalty. People stayed with you for years, for decades. What \n     a luxury it was to be associated with someone about whom \n     there were no doubt, no doubts about intellect, commitment \n     and integrity. And Senator you gave us a lifetime of stories. \n     Some are even repeatable. Each of us has a favorite and I'm \n     going to tell a couple. Senator Muskie was an avid fisherman \n     and though I was never invited to accompany him, I want to \n     recall two occasions both of which involved President Carter. \n     On the way back from the funeral of Prime Minister Ohira in \n     Japan, the President and Senator Muskie went fishing in \n     Alaska. And when they came back I learned that the President \n     had caught many fish, and the Senator got one. I asked him to \n     explain the difference and he said gruffly, ``its easy to \n     catch them if the secret service ties them down.'' And you \n     know that's all the explanation I got!\n       On the other occasion, and this will be particularly \n     memorable to some of you who are on the Senate staff. I was \n     on the Senate floor during a budget debate and he called me \n     over. I assumed he wanted my advice on the issue at hand. He \n     said, ``I can't find my fishing pole.'' He said, ``President \n     Carter is coming to Maine to fish and I can't find my fishing \n     pole.'' So I called Gayle Cory, the longest and the loyalist \n     of the Muskie staffers. She was out at his house and I asked \n     her to find the pole and I went back and said, Gayle is at \n     the house and she'll find the pole. And he said, ``Gayle \n     wouldn't know what a fishing pole looks like.'' Needless \n     to say, Gayle found the pole, I didn't have to go out to \n     the house to look for it, and I never learned how many \n     fish he caught on the trip.\n       I want to close with one story which will be poignant to \n     those who had the opportunity to travel with the Senator, and \n     particularly to Jane, I think. The Senator always took the \n     window seat on the airplane and the staff, and Jane, sat on \n     the aisle to ward off intruders. It was his want to get on a \n     plane and lose himself in a book or magazine and sometimes \n     not talk to anyone for the entire five hour trip. On the \n     occasion that Eliot Cutler remembers on a trip to Los \n     Angeles, the Senator said not a word and at the end of the \n     trip as they arrived to the gate, Eliot got up to proffer him \n     his coat and he looked at Eliot and he said ``what are you \n     doing here?'' He is smiling now, because I suspect he would \n     say to us today, ``what are we doing here?'' Senator we came \n     here to say good-bye. We came here to say thank you for five \n     decades of public service and personal friendship and most of \n     all, we came here to thank you for being the first steward of \n     the planet earth.\n\n                     Remarks by Madeleine Albright\n\n       Dear friends, my heart is sad for I have lost a friend. I \n     asked myself why I feel such a void. Its not only the \n     personal memories, memories that I share with many of you, \n     although that is surely a part of it. It is also the fear \n     that what Edmund Muskie represented, what he lived for and \n     stood for, might somehow go with him. He has been our \n     connection to each other, he has been our link to a proud \n     democratic heritage. He gave validity to a vision of our \n     country and service to it that has influenced each of our \n     lives. There is an army of us in Washington, Maine and around \n     the country who worked for him as he rose through the ranks \n     of service to America. Whether we were interested in state \n     government or just plain good government, clean air and \n     water, a budget process that worked, a generous foreign \n     policy that reflected our goodness and strength or just \n     because we believed that politics and principles go \n     together. He attracted us. Even today, when members of the \n     Muskie team see each other any where, we exchange the \n     political equivalent of the high-five. The reason that \n     such a diverse group would have so much in common is that \n     Ed Muskie didn't see his public service as \n     compartmentalized. The federal government was not the \n     enemy of state government. Democrats could work with \n     Republicans. A healthy environment was important not only \n     here, but globally. While as budget chairman, he often \n     asked what was so liberal about wasting money, he worried \n     about jobs and he never denied the resources needed to \n     keep America strong. Can you imagine that he actually \n     believed in the United Nations and Foreign Aid, not only \n     when he was Secretary of State, but even when he was in \n     the Senate. Edmund Muskie made history because he \n     understood history. A lot of it he read, a lot of it be \n     experienced personally and what he didn't know, he asked \n     about. All of us who have been on the receiving end know \n     how persistently he could ask questions. The look on his\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n     face or the ``not so gentle'' reproach when we didn't know \n     the answers became an enormous incentive to learn. As a \n     result, we grew with him, In his book we all, but mostly \n     he himself, were accountable. His roots became ours. The \n     great American leaders and their principles became ours. \n     When he arrived at the State Department in May 1980, \n     having been named by President Carter, he brought with him \n     his capacity for endless questions. He brought Leon, \n     Carole, Gayle and Berl. The foreign policy bureaucracy had \n     a bit of trouble with the approach, not to mention with \n     Leon. In the department and over at the national security \n     council, there were rumblings. ``Why all these questions \n     about environmental consequences, fiscal implications, \n     congressional consultations and public opinion.'' As \n     Secretary of State he did not leave his old identities \n     behind. He was still Mr. Clean, the father of the budget \n     process, the chief sponsor of the War Powers Act, an \n     elected official responsive to the people. Still he \n     insisted on looking at all sides, still he wanted to \n     reason everything out. That is why he got along so \n     famously with his deputy, Warren Christopher, another who \n     values principle and reason. Together, they worked \n     patiently to answer the questions and solve the problems \n     our nation faced. Most important they negotiated the safe \n     return of the hostages from Iran. Reuniting families and \n     leaving for the successor administration a clean slate \n     from which to begin. When he left his official foreign \n     policy post, along with the rest of us in January, 1981, \n     he simply began pursuing public policy by private means. \n     Although he was quite in the opposition he did not use his \n     various platforms or chairmanships, of the Center for \n     National Policy and Georgetown's Institute for the Study \n     of Diplomacy to mention two of my favorites, for the \n     politics of protest but characteristically for the \n     politics of healing. For example to consider mending \n     relations with Cambodia and Vietnam, and in this, as in so \n     many other things he was often ahead of his time.\n       Before I end with a personal message from President \n     Clinton, I must say one more thing. I would obviously be here \n     in my capacity as a proud member of the Muskie political \n     family no matter what. But I would definitely not be here or \n     anywhere else representing the President of the United States \n     if it were not for Ed Muskie. It might not be the right \n     answer for feminist groups and I do love Eleanor Roosevelt. \n     But the truth is that this man was my role model. While we \n     all had a good laugh when he sometimes slipped into political \n     incorrect vocabulary or shielded his female staff members \n     from some of his salted language, he was the man who earlier \n     than others enabled women to take their place as public \n     servants. Because he had faith in us, we had faith in \n     ourselves. He was the first to name a woman, Karen Hastie-\n     Williams, Chief Counsel of the Budget Committee, as head of \n     the Congressional Budget Office, Alice Rivlin, he gave me the \n     responsibility as his chief legislative director, for \n     coordinating Leon, Al From, Doug Bennett and John McKvoy. The \n     U.N. Security Council is a piece of cake. No wonder I learned \n     about the politics of foreign policy. Finally I want to \n     read a letter:\n       ``Dear Jane: Hillary and I were so sorry to learn of Ed's \n     death and our hearts go out to you. Our nation was blessed to \n     have Edmund Muskie in public service for so long. As \n     governor, as Senator and Secretary of State. He was a leader \n     of conscience and conviction and I will always be grateful \n     for his wise counsel. His broad knowledge of both \n     international and domestic affairs. His stalwart protection \n     of our precious natural resources and his unshakable \n     integrity as a public figure and private citizen earned him \n     support of millions of Americans and the respect of all of us \n     who were privileged to know him. As a mark of that respect, \n     citizens across our country and around the world are lowering \n     the American flag to half staff today. Hillary and I extend \n     our deepest sympathy to you and your family and we hope you \n     will take comfort in remembering that your husband has left \n     an enduring legacy of public service that continues to \n     inspire us all. We are keeping you in our thoughts and \n     prayers.\n           ``Sincerely\n       ``Bill Clinton, President of the United States.''\n       Dearest Jane, thank you for sharing this great man with us.\n\n                       Remarks by George Mitchell\n\n       Jane, Steve and Lexi, Ellen and Ernie, Melinda and Eddie, \n     Martha, Ned and Julia, and other members of the family, \n     Cardinal Hickey, Bishop Gerry and other members of the \n     clergy, President and Mrs. Carter and other distinguished \n     guests and friends of Ed Muskie. Senator Muskie once said \n     that he didn't like being called ``Lincolnesque'' but it fit. \n     With his lanky frame, his long and craggy face, his powerful \n     voice, he was an imposing figure. He was loved and trusted by \n     the people of Maine because they saw in him the qualities \n     they most admire, independence, fairness, the lack of \n     pretense, the willingness to speak the truth even when it \n     hurt. He was plain spoken even blunt at times and they \n     admired him for it. He had his faults and he made mistakes \n     as do all human beings but he conquered his faults and he \n     learned from his mistakes and as a result, he became the \n     greatest public official in Maine's history and one of the \n     most effective legislators in our nation's history. He \n     accomplished much in a long and distinguished career. In \n     that impressive record, nothing surpasses what he did to \n     protect America's natural environment. Harry Truman once \n     said that men make history, not the other way around. In \n     periods where there is no leadership society stands still. \n     Progress occurs when courageous skillful leaders seize the \n     opportunity to change things for the better. Ed Muskie \n     changed things for the better. When he went to the Senate, \n     there were no national environmental laws, there was no \n     environmental movement, there was hardly an awareness of \n     the problem. Industries and municipalities dumped their \n     wastes into the nearest river and America's waters were, \n     for the most part, stinking open sewers. The air was \n     unhealthy, the water polluted, Ed Muskie changed that. \n     It's one thing to write and pass a law, it's another thing \n     to change the way people live, it's yet another and a far \n     more difficult thing to change the way people think. Ed \n     Muskie did that. With knowledge, skill, determination and \n     patience he won approval of the Clean Air Act and the \n     Clean Water Act and America was changed forever for the \n     better. Any American who wants to know what Ed Muskie's \n     legacy is need only go to the nearest river. Before Ed \n     Muskie it was almost surely not fit to drink or to swim or \n     to fish in, because of Ed Muskie it is now almost surely \n     clean. A source of recreation even revenue. Despite the \n     efforts of some to turn back the clock, these landmark \n     laws will survive because the American people know what a \n     difference he has made in their lives. It has been said \n     that what we do for ourselves, leaves this world with us, \n     what we do for others remains behind. That's our legacy, \n     our link with immortality. Ed Muskie's legacy will stand \n     as a living memorial to his vision. It is his immortality. \n     Each of us could say much more about Ed Muskie's public \n     career but we are here today to pay tribute to Ed Muskie \n     the man, so I would like to say a few words about the man \n     who was my hero, my mentor, my friend. Thirty-four years \n     ago this week, I received a telephone call that changed my \n     life. It was from Don Nicoll, Senator Muskie's \n     Administrative Assistant and close friend who is here \n     today. He invited me to come to Capitol Hill to meet the \n     Senator who was looking for someone from Maine to fill a \n     vacancy on his staff. To help him evaluate me, Don asked \n     that I prepare a memorandum on the legal aspects of an \n     issue that was then being considered by the Senate. I \n     prepared the memo and went up for the interview. I thought \n     the memo was pretty good, but unknowingly I had made a \n     huge mistake. I reached a conclusion that was the opposite \n     of the Senator's. I had never met him but he didn't bother \n     with any small talk. Within minutes of our introduction, \n     he unleashed a ferocious cross-examination. He came out \n     from behind his desk, he towered over me, he shook his \n     finger at me and he took my memo apart, line by line. I \n     was stunned, so intimidated that I couldn't control the \n     shaking of my legs even though I was sitting down. I tried \n     as best as I could to explain my point of view and we had \n     what you might call a lively discussion. As I left he said \n     the next time you come in here, you'll be better prepared. \n     That's how I learned I'd been hired and I sure was better \n     prepared the next time. Ed Muskie was even more imposing \n     intellectually than he was physically. He was the smartest \n     person that I ever met with an incisive analytical mind \n     that enabled him to see every aspect of a problem and \n     instantly to identify possible solutions. He challenged \n     everyone around him to rise to his level of excellence. No \n     one quite reached his level, but those who took up the \n     challenge were improved by the effort. Those who knew him \n     learned from that relationship, those of us who worked for \n     him, most of all. Just about everything I know about \n     politics and government I learned from him. Just about \n     everything I have accomplished in public life, can be \n     traced to his help. No one ever had a better mentor or a \n     better friend. No discussion of Ed Muskie would be \n     complete without mention of his legendary temper. After he \n     became Secretary of State, a news magazine in an article \n     described his temper as entirely tactical, something that \n     he turned on and off at will to help him get his way. I \n     saw him a few days later, he showed me the article, in \n     fact he read it to me, and then he said laughingly, ``all \n     these years you thought my temper was for real.'' Well, I \n     said, you sure fooled me, and a lot of other people. I \n     think the reality is that it was both. When he yelled at \n     you it was terrifyingly real, but you could never be sure \n     that it wasn't also a tactic to move you his way, to get \n     you to do what he wanted done and that's the way he wanted \n     it and liked it. Almost as unnerving as one of his \n     eruptions was the swiftness with which it passed and was \n     forgotten. He was a passionate man and expressed himself \n     with emotion. His point having been made, he moved on, he \n     didn't believe in looking back or nursing grudges and \n     maybe that's how he got past the disappointments he \n     suffered. It surely also helped that he was a secure man, \n     confident in, and comfortable with his values. Those \n     values were simple, yet universal in their reach and \n     enduring in their strength. They were faith, family and \n     country. He was constant in his faith. He was comforted by \n     it and he was motivated by its message. The prayer printed \n     on the back of the program today written by Senator Muskie \n     more than a quarter century ago with its emphasis on \n     compassion and tolerance was the essence of his faith. He \n     was totally devoted to his family, especially to Jane. \n     They would have celebrated their 48th anniversary in May \n     and for all those years, she supported him, she comforted \n     him, she helped him. He was a\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n     passionate believer in democracy and especially in \n     American democracy. I had the privilege of traveling all \n     over Maine and all this country with him. Back when I was \n     on Senator Muskie's staff we didn't have the resources \n     available today so we used to share a motel room in small \n     towns all across Maine as I drove him from one appearance \n     to another. And I can recall the many times he spoke of \n     his Father who he greatly admired and who he was very \n     influenced by. His Father was a Polish immigrant who, like \n     many others who fled from tyranny, flourished in the free \n     air of this blessed land. No person I have ever heard and \n     few in our history could match Ed Muskie's eloquence on \n     the meaning of America. Once in public office, his \n     profound respect for American democracy led him to act \n     always with dignity and restraint, lest he dishonor those \n     he represented. As a result, he was the ideal in public \n     service, a man who accomplished much without ever \n     compromising his principles or his dignity. Character is \n     what you are when you are alone in the dark as well as \n     with others in the daylight. Ed Muskie's character was \n     strong. Strong enough to light up other people's lives. He \n     taught us that integrity is more important than winning. \n     That real knowledge counts more than slogans or sound \n     bites. That we should live our values rather than parading \n     them for public approval. Many years ago, Maine's greatest \n     poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, wrote of another great \n     man these words: ``Were a star quenched on high for ages \n     would its light still traveling downward from the sky \n     shine on our mortal sight. So when a great man dies for \n     years beyond our kin, the light he leaves behind him lies \n     upon the paths of men.'' A great man has died and for \n     years his life will shine upon our paths. Goodbye Ed, may \n     God bless you and welcome you.\n\n                   Remarks by President Jimmy Carter\n\n       Ed Muskie had the appearance, the mannerisms, the actions \n     of a true statesman. I first knew about him was when I became \n     Governor and faced the almost overwhelming lobbying pressure \n     from the power companies with their smokestacks spewing forth \n     back smoke and the thirteen pump mills in our state that were \n     destroying our rivers. I saw the difficulty then of an \n     incredible political battle. But there was a hero in \n     Washington which has been mentioned several times who faced \n     much greater lobbying pressure from nationwide pollutants \n     of our streams and air. Ed Muskie changed all of that. One \n     of my heroes in Georgia was Dr. Benjamin Mays a graduate \n     of Bates College which was very close to Ed Muskie. And in \n     an unpublicized way, Ed Muskie was also a champion of \n     basic civil rights at a time when it wasn't popular to be \n     so. And he and Dr. Benjamin Mays worked hand-in-hand to \n     inspire people like me and other governors and public \n     servants around the country who looked on him with great \n     admiration. I hope everyone here will read the prayer on \n     the back of the program that George just mentioned that \n     was given by Ed Muskie at a Presidential prayer breakfast \n     in 1969, and see how pertinent it is to our nation's \n     capital today, how Ed Muskie is needed. We saw then a \n     budget problem in Washington and he decided to do \n     something about it. He helped orchestrate and get passed a \n     new budget law. He became the first Chairman of the Budget \n     Committee and despite the equally formidable challenges \n     that we now face, that he faced then, he was able to bring \n     order out of chaos and to work harmoniously not only with \n     the Senators, but members of the House of Representatives, \n     jealous of their own prerogatives and with the Presidents \n     who served with him. Democrats and Republicans, President \n     Nixon, President Ford, and President me. I think that Ed \n     was so successful in bringing this coalition together and \n     healing the disparities between Capitol Hill and the White \n     House, because when he spoke you knew at least three \n     things: First, he deeply believed what he said, second, he \n     knew what he was talking about, and third, it was the \n     absolute truth. So I admired him from a distance until the \n     Spring of 1972 when Ed was campaigning for President and \n     he came down to Atlanta for a fund-raiser. I very eagerly \n     invited him to spend the night with me at the Governor's \n     mansion because of my admiration and because I had in the \n     back of my mind, you won't believe this, the thought that \n     he was going to get the nomination and he might be looking \n     for a southern governor to be his running mate. So I \n     wanted to make a good impression on him and I wanted him \n     to think that I was a little more sophisticated than I \n     was. So that night in the so-called Presidential suite in \n     the front of the Governor's mansion, late at night he was \n     very tired, he had been campaigning all day, and I said \n     ``Senator would you like to have a drink?'' He said ``yes \n     Governor I believe I would.'' I said ``well what would you \n     like,'' he said ``I'd like Scotch and milk.'' I was taken \n     aback. I knew about Bourbon and Branch Water and a few \n     other drinks of that kind but I tried to put on the \n     appearance of being knowledgeable and I left him in the \n     room and went down to the kitchen to prepare a drink. I \n     got about halfway down the hall and a terrible question \n     came to me and I went back into the room and I think \n     ruined all my chances of being on the ticket. I said ``is \n     that sweet milk or buttermilk?'' He very gently said \n     ``sweet milk.'' Later when I was elected President, I \n     turned to Ed Muskie as one of my closest and most valued \n     advisers. He was still a hero to me and I turned to him \n     often. In 1980, as some of you would remember, my \n     administration was in trouble. Fifty-three hostages were \n     still being held by militants in Iran. In April we tried \n     to rescue them and my Secretary of State in protest \n     resigned with a great deal of public fanfare. I was facing \n     a revolution in my own party from Senator Kennedy and \n     others who were more liberal than I and it seemed very \n     doubtful that I would even be renominated as an incumbent \n     President. I turned to Ed Muskie who had a secure seat in \n     the U.S. Senate and I ask him if he would serve as \n     Secretary of State, and after checking with George and \n     others, he said ``yes.'' In a way I thought that I was \n     doing him a big favor but when we had the little ceremony \n     in the White House, I introduced him as the new Secretary \n     of State being willing to serve and his comment was, ``Mr. \n     President, I'm not going to say thanks, I'm going to wait \n     a few months and then make a judgment about whether I \n     thank you or not.'' But he brought to the State \n     Department, as Madeleine just pointed out, his formidable \n     knowledge as a long-time Chairman of the Budget Committee, \n     of every domestic and foreign policy program that our \n     nation had and that statesmanship from Maine that let the \n     members of our Congress, the people of our nation and \n     leaders throughout the world know, that here was a man who \n     spoke with absolute integrity. When the Prime Minister of \n     Japan passed away, Ohira, who was one of my closest \n     friends as Leon has pointed out, I wasn't going to mention \n     this, we went to the funeral with a very devout expression \n     on our face but arranged to stop in Alaska for a day of \n     fishing which Ed suggested as a way for me to forget my \n     troubles. I don't guess he was worried about his own \n     troubles. We went to a little lake about an hour and one-\n     half helicopter flight from Anchorage and were fishing for \n     Grayling and I have to confirm part of Leon's story, I did \n     catch 15 or 20 Grayling, the Secret Service were quite a \n     distance from me I might add, and Ed only caught one fish. \n     So after we got through fishing, Ed came up to me and said \n     ``Mr. President, I'd like to make a comment about the \n     trip'' and I waited for his approval and he said ``you \n     really need to practice your cast'' and I said ``thank you \n     very much, Mr. Secretary.'' Later he sent me a wonderful \n     fishing rod that I still have Leon. In the last few days \n     of our administration it was Ed Muskie's integrity, his \n     sound judgment, his wisdom and his determination and his \n     patience that had made it possible for us to bring every \n     hostage home, safe into freedom. Typically, Ed Muskie did \n     not seek any credit for that achievement, he let others \n     take the credit. I looked up last night the citation I \n     read when I gave Ed Muskie the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom. ``As Senator and Secretary of State, candidate \n     and citizen, Edmund Muskie has captured for himself a \n     place in the public eye and in the public's heart. Devoted \n     to his nation and our ideals, he has performed heroically \n     and with great fortitude in a time of great challenge.'' \n     His response was you forgot that I was also Governor. This \n     week I made a statement about my friend Ed Muskie and I \n     closed the statement by saying of all the people I've ever \n     known, no one was better qualified to be President of the \n     United States but Jane, I'd like to say now that I don't \n     believe many Presidents in history have ever contributed \n     as much to the quality of life of people in our nation and \n     around the world as your husband, Edmund Muskie. I am \n     grateful to him. Thank you very much.\n\n                    Remarks by Edmund S. Muskie, Jr.\n\n       I could not be more proud than to be here to read to you a \n     prayer that my father wrote. He delivered this prayer at the \n     Presidential Prayer Breakfast here in Washington, DC in \n     January of 1969.\n       ``Our father, we are gathered here this morning, perplexed \n     and deeply troubled. We are grateful for the many blessings \n     You have bestowed upon us.--the great resources of land and \n     people--the freedom to apply them to uses of our own \n     choosing--the successes which have marked our efforts. We are \n     perplexed that, notwithstanding these blessings, we have not \n     succeeded in making possible a life of promise for all our \n     people. In that growing dissatisfaction threatens our unity \n     and our progress towards peace and justice. We are deeply \n     troubled that we may not be able to agree upon the common \n     purposes and the basis for mutual trust which are essential \n     if we are to overcome these difficulties. And so, our Father, \n     we turn to you for help. Teach us to listen to one another, \n     with the kind of attention which is receptive to points of \n     view, however different, with a healthy skepticism as to our \n     own infallibility. Teach us to understand one another with \n     the kind of sensitivity which springs from deeply-seated \n     sympathy and compassion. Teach us to trust one another, \n     beyond mere tolerance, with a willingness to take the chance \n     on the perfectibility of our fellow men. Teach us to help one \n     another, beyond charity, in the kind of mutual involvement \n     which is essential if a free society is to work. We ask it in \n     Jesus' name, Amen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3614-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3617-S3620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CRISIS IN LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the resumption of violence in Liberia is of \ngreat concern to me. A factional standoff over an ousted government \nminister has led to widespread looting, arson, and murder, plunging the \ncountry into a state of chaos. This spasm of violence is the first \nmajor interruption of the Abuja Accords, which have held peace together \nin Liberia since last August.\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\n  The deterioration of Liberia is disheartening. Since 1989, the civil \nwar has caused the deaths of more than 150,000 people and has displaced \nmore than 800,000. Thousands of children have been conscripted to the \narmed forces. The resumption of violence threatens the lives of even \nmore Liberians. The potential of a massive humanitarian disaster is \nhigh, as supplies of food and water dwindle, sanitary conditions \ndeteriorate, and outbreaks of cholera erupt.\n  Mr. President, The United States has a special responsibility toward \nLiberia. Founded in the early 19th century by freed slaves, the United \nStates and Liberia have had almost 150 years of uninterrupted \nfriendship. In World War II, the airfields and ports of Liberia were a \nkey part of the link to supply the battlefields in North Africa and \nEurope. During the cold war, the people of Liberia were at many times \nthe only reliable ally of the United States in Africa. Liberia served \nas a ``listening post'' and headquarters to the United States \nintelligence services. At the United Nations, Liberia consistently \nvoted for the United States position even when this position was \nunpopular with other developing nations.\n  In addition, I would like to add that I have a special interest in \nthis war-devastated country as so many emigrants from Liberia have \nsettled in Rhode Island. Just this morning, a delegation of \napproximately 400 Liberian-Americans who live in my State participated \nin an impressive demonstration of their eagerness for peace to be \nrestored to this tragically war-torn country.\n  These Rhode Islanders, led by longtime community leader Lady Bush, \nmarched several miles into downtown Providence where they demonstrated \nin front of the Federal Courthouse Building and met with members of my \nstaff and the staff of my colleague, Senator Chafee.\n  The demonstrators presented a petition, entitled ``Plea for an \nImmediate End To the Human Carnage in Liberia.'' It urges active U.S. \nGovernment efforts to end the fighting and places the blame for the \nlatest outbreak of terror and fighting squarely on the assorted \nwarlords whose forces control various portions of the capital and the \ncountry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that petition be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, it is understandable that the international \ncommunity is hesitant about investing anything more in Liberia. It is \nup to the faction leaders who constituted the last Council of State and \nwho control the rival forces to stop the looting and killing and to \nrebuild a sense of national unity. The rival warlords must demonstrate \nthat they are ready for peace. The people of Liberia should not have to \nendure any more violence. If the United States pulls out of Liberia, it \nwill certainly put the last nail in the coffin for this poor, African \nnation. Moreover, if the situation in Liberia continues to unravel, the \nregional implications will be of monumental proportions.\n  I believe the United States must have an immediate response to this \ncrisis. As a result, I am cosponsor of the resolution introduced this \nafternoon by my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold. Among others, this resolution urges the administration to \nsupport West African peacekeepers, to influence other nations to \nsupport the peacekeeping force, and to lead efforts in the United \nNations to sanction those parties which violate the U.N. arms embargo \non Liberia.\n  I would like to add that it is imperative that the international \ncommunity, at its highest levels, make public their views on the \natrocities in Liberia. The international community, moreover, must \nactively engage with ECOMOG and ECOWAS, to find a lasting solution. And \nmost importantly, I call upon the competing warlords to stop the \npillaging of Liberia. There has already been too much bloodshed, too \nmuch hope lost.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Liberian Community Association\n\n\n                                        of Rhode Island, Inc.,\n\n                                   Providence, RI, April 18, 1996.\n\n Petition of the Liberian Community Association of Rhode Island to the \n                    Government of the United States\n\n     Subject: Plea for an Immediate End To the Human Carnage in \n         Liberia\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Liberia was founded and funded by \n     humanitarian societies in the United States, with the \n     appropriation and assistance of the American Government as a \n     safe haven for emancipated people of color;\n       And whereas throughout its one hundred forty nine years of \n     independence, the people and Government of these United \n     States of America have manifested friendly and benign \n     interest in Liberia's right to exist as a sovereign state, \n     lending aid in times of national exigencies and emergencies;\n       And whereas Liberia has always shown its gratitude and \n     appreciation to the Government and people of the United \n     States by being staunch ally and trusted African friend \n     during times and circumstances critical to the national \n     interest of the United States;\n       And whereas the on-going genocidal civil conflict in \n     Liberia resulted from the rash, diabolical, dictatorial, and \n     military rules which set the stage for subsequent atrocities \n     and infrastructure destruction, causing the displacement at \n     home and abroad of over one half the population, many of whom \n     are stranded in the United States;\n       And whereas the civil war since 1989 has resulted into the \n     slaughter of a quarter million people, most of whom are \n     civilians; women, children and the elderly;\n       And whereas the war-lords do not have the fortitude to \n     honor the many peace accords that they themselves signed, \n     resulting into the carnage that began on April 5, 1996 and \n     continues to date, described by the international press and \n     the United States Government as the worst in three years;\n       And whereas the EMOMOG has proven that it cannot enforce \n     the cease-fire, monitor the disarmament process and protect \n     innocent civilians;\n       And whereas the rebels and government troops, some as young \n     as six are still heavily armed;\n       And whereas the recent carnage that began April 5, 1996 is \n     so war torn that the United States is evacuating its citizens \n     from Liberia;\n       And whereas the recent massacre of women and children is so \n     contiguous that Americans, Americans of Liberian descent, and \n     Liberians residing in Rhode Island convened on April 14, 1996 \n     and after deliberation resolved that the organization \n     petitions the United States Government to intervene to help \n     bring the carnage to an immediate end.\n       We therefore, appeal to the United States to:\n       1. intervene directly to bring the carnage to an end;\n       2. use it economic, diplomatic and military leverages to \n     encourage the warring factions to call for, and honor a true \n     cease-fire and disarmament;\n       3. convene a meeting of the war-lords in the United States \n     to work out modalities for the enforcement of the cease-fire \n     as in the case of Bosnia;\n       4. to help plan, monitor, and enforce the disarmament \n     process;\n       5. impose an embargo on the shipment of arms to any of the \n     warring factions;\n       6. freeze all assets of the war-lords, their family \n     members, and representatives; and\n       7. deny all war-lords, their family members and \n     representatives visas to travel to the United States except \n     for a conference to resolve the conflict.\n       We call on all peace loving countries of the world, the \n     United Nations and other international organizations to join \n     the United States, a country of goodwill that has practically \n     resolved all conflicts in modern times, to do the same for \n     Liberia. We are pleading. Please help us.\n\n\n                            NUCLEAR SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nsingle greatest security threat to Americans in the post-cold war ERA--\nthe possibility that weapons of mass destruction could be acquired by \nrogue states, criminal organizations, or terrorists, and used against \nAmerican targets.\n  In the coming weeks, I hope that this body will have the opportunity \nto act on the Chemical Weapons Convention and reduce one portion of \nthis threat.\n  Today, however, as President Clinton prepares to join President \nYeltsin and the G-7 leaders in Moscow for a nuclear safety and security \nsummit over the next 2 days, I would like to focus my remarks on the \nnuclear threat.\n  President Clinton has placed nuclear nonproliferation at the top of \nthe U.S. national security agenda--he is clearly committed and willing \nto lead on this issue. Vice President Gore's regular meetings with \nRussian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also have advanced nuclear \nsecurity. Indeed, in the last 3 years we have seen important agreements \nand cooperative projects between U.S. officials and their counterparts \nin Russia and other Republics of the former Soviet Union.\n  Despite these positive steps, however, the threat before us remains \nimmense, and the path to nuclear security remains long and difficult. \nWe need to understand the potential magnitude of\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nthe threat, and muster the resolve and resources to address it \neffectively.\n\n\n                        the nature of the threat\n\n  Mr. President, Soviet nuclear missiles no longer point at American \ncities. With the START process, we have also seen and hopefully will \ncontinue to see significant reductions in strategic nuclear weapons in \nthe former Soviet Union. But these arms control successes should not \ngive us a false sense of security.\n  Over 100,000 weapons or weapons equivalent material remain strewn--\nliterally strewn--about Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. The \ncentralized system that prevented the possible theft or diversion of \nthis immense quantity of fissile material during the cold war no longer \nexists.\n  I should also note that each year as more nuclear warheads are \ndismantled, additional tons of weapons-grade material move from \nrelatively more secure military facilities to less secure nuclear \nstorage facilities. The 3,000 warheads that are dismantled each year \nyield 15 tons of plutonium and 45 tons of highly-enriched uranium.\n  Of this veritable cornucopia of dangerous fissile material spread \nacross the territory of the former Soviet Union, only a small fraction \nwould be required to wreak unspeakable damage.\n  It takes only 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium or 8 kilograms \nof plutonium to create a weapon capable of massive destruction. We are \ntalking about an amount of uranium the size of a softball--or a \nbaseball in the case of plutonium. That small amount of material could \nbe easily concealed and transported in a sturdy briefcase or a \nbackpack.\n  As my colleagues know, the greatest barrier to overcome in \nmanufacturing a nuclear weapon is acquiring the appropriate grade and \nquantity of fissile material. After that, it just takes a little time, \nmoney, and technical know-how.\n  A determined terrorist or rogue state does not even need to build a \nperfectly designed atomic bomb with the highest grade fissile material \nto create unimaginable terror. A weapon built of crude, low-grade \nnuclear material such as a nuclear radiological device would be \nsufficient to generate widespread panic.\n  This is not just doomsday rhetoric. Does anyone actually deny that \nthere exists a great demand today for nuclear material? Those who are \nnot yet convinced need only consider the chilling incidents that have \noccurred over the last few years. As my colleagues are well aware, gram \nand kilogram quantities of weapons-grade uranium--almost surely leaked \nfrom the former Soviet Union--have been seized in Moscow, Munich, and \nPrague. In addition, dismantled parts of Soviet nuclear missiles have \nmade their way to Iraq.\n  We know that the demand exists. We also know that the supply exists. \nElementary economics tells us that without intervention, a supply curve \nand a demand curve will intersect--and you will have a transaction. It \nis incumbent upon us to intervene and prevent even one of these \npotentially deadly transactions from occurring.\n  These are the key challenges we face in doing so:\n  How do we develop a comprehensive accounting system for all nuclear \nmaterial in the former Soviet Union?\n  How do we gather and physically protect nuclear material in a limited \nnumber of secure sites?\n  How do we safely dispose of excess nuclear material?\n  How do we prevent the theft and smuggling of nuclear material?\n  And, how do we prevent former Soviet nuclear experts from selling \ntheir knowhow to rogue states or terrorists?\n  The answers to these questions are not exclusively of concern to the \nUnited States. They are vitally important to Western Europe, Japan, and \neven to Russia.\n\n\n                the situation in the former soviet union\n\n  Perhaps it would be useful if I briefly walked through what we know \nabout the situation in Russia today to demonstrate the difficulties we \nface in meeting these challenges.\n  First, the collapse of the Soviet command and control security system \nhas been replaced by chaos and the absence of many controls at sites \nwhere nuclear materials are stored. In the context of Russia's current \ntumultuous social and economic conditions, we are talking about an \nenvironment conducive to theft and extortion.\n  Second, the Soviet Union had no comprehensive accounting system for \nnuclear weapons and fissile material--certainly no computerized \ninventory. In other words, we--including the Russians--do not even know \nexactly where all of the Soviet Nuclear material is stored or how much \nof it exists. We think most nuclear material is located in 80 to 100 \nsites. But there may be another 40 sites. We think the Soviet Union \nproduced some 1,200 metric tons of highly enriched uranium and some 200 \nmetric tons of plutonium. Needless to say, it would be difficult to \ndetermine if a few kilograms of this material were misplaced here and \nthere.\n  Third, the lack of physical protection of nuclear material in the \nformer Soviet Union is shocking. Nuclear material is stored in \ncontainers without seals to prevent tampering. Many of the labs, \nresearch centers, and power plants with nuclear material do not have \nperimeter fences, electronic sensors, or monitoring cameras to deter \nand detect intruders. Instead, U.S. officials have seen nuclear rods \nstored in metal lockers secured with padlocks. According to the Russian \nGovernment, 80 percent of its nuclear facilities--80 percent--do not \nhave radiation detectors to prevent those on the inside from walking \nout the door with nuclear material.\n  Fourth, there are nuclear technicians and guards at these facilities \nwho have not been paid in months. I have heard that the senior staff of \none nuclear facility abandon their posts a few hours a day to tend to \ntheir potato gardens, so that they will have food to eat. It seems to \nme that these conditions are so ripe for corruption that the threat of \nan inside job is much greater than the threat of an outside thief \nentering a nuclear facility--as easy as that may be.\n  Fifth, current border controls throughout the former Soviet Union are \nnotoriously weak. If smuggled nuclear material passes through Europe, \nwe have some chance that intelligence officials and law enforcement can \ninterdict it. However, trafficking routes through the Caucasus or \nCentral Asia are another story--the chances of successful interdiction \nare slim to none.\n  Finally, we have the problem of the thousands of nuclear scientists \nand technicians in the former Soviet Union with knowledge about nuclear \nweapons who are looking for ways to make a living in the new world \norder. Their expertise would certainly be welcome in some aspiring \nnuclear states that immediately come to mind.\n\n\n                            the u.s response\n\n  After a slow start 4 years ago, many of these problems are now being \naddressed by our Departments of Defense and Energy. The Energy \nDepartment, for example, has equipped a number of nuclear facilities in \nthe former Soviet Union with fences, monitors, and sensors. The United \nStates Enrichment Corporation has arranged for the purchase of 500 \nmetric tons of highly enriched uranium to be converted into commercial \nreactor fuel. Newly created international research institutes have \nemployed hundreds of Russian nuclear scientists. Such cooperative \nefforts need to be evaluated and duplicated on a much larger scale.\n  I commend my distinguished colleagues Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar \nfor bringing attention to global proliferation threats through Senator \nNunn's recent hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nand Senator Lugar's hearings last august on the issue of Loose Nukes. I \nmight add that Senator Lugar's hearings are the only hearings that have \nbeen held on this critical issue in the Foreign Relations Committee in \nthe 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is worth asking: are we directing \nAmerica's limited resources proportionately to meet a clear and present \nthreat which I and many of my colleagues regard as our greatest \nnational security challenge?\n  In 1991, my colleagues Senators Nunn and Lugar had the foresight to \ndevise the cooperative threat reduction program to assist the states of \nthe former Soviet Union in dismantling nuclear warheads and protecting \nnuclear materials. Over the last 5 years funding for the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram has totaled $1.5 billion--an average of $300 million\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\nper year, or about one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual defense budget. \nIn addition, this year's funding level was cut 25 percent from last \nyear's level.\n  In contrast, consider how much time, money, and energy we have spent \non the proposed missile defense system to meet the improbable long-\nrange ballistic missile threat, which we are told is at least 15 years \naway. We have spent some $35 billion over the years on missile \ndefenses. I find it hard to believe that this disparity in spending \ncorresponds to the threats we face.\n  As I have repeatedly stated on this floor, a long-range ballistic \nmissile will not be the most likely means of delivery of a weapon of \nmass destruction to the United States. No. A much more likely scenario \nis that a terrorist group will smuggle material and parts for a \nnuclear, chemical, or biological device onto our shores--perhaps by any \nof the many routes used by narcotics traffickers--and then reconstruct \na weapon of mass destruction, put it in a van, and detonate it in near \nan important American landmark.\n  That is the more likely threat, and that is where we should be \nfocusing the bulk of our energies, not on reviving star wars.\n\n\n                           the nuclear summit\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues recognize that we are \nengaged in a race against time. Either we will help secure this \nmaterial and provide our citizens with the safety to which they are \nentitled, or rogue elements will procure this material and use it to \nblackmail civilization.\n  The danger of uncontrolled nuclear material is a first level national \nsecurity threat to the United States of America and a first level \nnational security threat to our friends and allies. We cannot simply \nignore the problem and leave if for Russia to solve on her own. \nLikewise, Russia cannot simply downplay the potential threat and delay \nimplementing concrete measures. Indeed, Russia itself is a target--just \nlast November Chechen separatists placed radioactive material in a \nMoscow park.\n  To be successful, the nuclear safety and security summit must build a \nglobal consensus on the nature of the threat before us and generate \nwider cooperation for swift action.\n  The critical first step must be to improve the physical protection of \nnuclear material at the source--secure the material at a limited number \nof sites and institute a comprehensive accounting system. That, in my \nopinion, is the most important agenda item for the leaders of the G-7 \nand Russia at the nuclear summit.\n  World leaders at the summit will also discuss ways to improve \ncooperation in countering nuclear material smuggling. Given the limited \nsuccess we have had in interdicting narcotics traffickers, I am not \noptimistic about the prospects of interdiction alone to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear material. Nonetheless, much more can and \nshould be done to improve border controls and intelligence cooperation.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the nuclear safety and security \nsummit in Moscow this week will help propel the world's leaders to take \nimmediate preventative and rational steps toward nuclear security. The \nalternative is to delay action until after our first nuclear terrorist \nincident--whether in a Moscow park, a Tokyo subway, or a New York \noffice building.\n  Mr. President, no other nation can match the expertise and resources \nof the United States. We must be the leader in promoting cooperative \nefforts to reduce the nuclear threat. Investments we make in this area \ntoday will reap a future return in the form of enhanced security for \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3617-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO FORMER ALABAMA AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER A.W. TODD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, my long-time friend A.W. Todd, who served \n3 terms as Alabama's commissioner of agriculture, passed away at his \nhome on March 29, 1996. He was regarded as one of our State's most \npopular government leaders and one of the most colorful and effective \npoliticians to ever hold office in Alabama.\n  A long-time Democrat, A.W. Todd represented Franklin, Colbert, and \nMarion Counties in the State Senate from 1950-1954. Colbert is my home \ncounty. His terms as commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and \nIndustries ran from 1955-1959, 1963-1967, and 1991-1995. He was also a \ngubernatorial candidate in 1958 and 1966. He had boundless energy and \nwas a tireless campaigner. In fact, the last time I saw him, A.W. told \nme that he was planning to run again for agriculture commissioner in \n1998.\n  He is regarded by many as the best agriculture commissioner Alabama \never had. The small, family farmer was always foremost in his mind, and \nthe agriculture community in the state benefitted directly from his \ndevotion and hard work. Among his many accomplishments as commissioner \nwas the coliseum program, which resulted in 6 coliseums being built \nstatewide. He also oversaw the expansion of the farmers' market program \nto Birmingham, Montgomery, Slocomb, and Mobile. The quality of eggs \nsold in the State was dramatically improved through the Todd Egg Law, \nwhich placed new inspection requirements on eggs and established a \ngrading system.\n  While serving in his last term, A.W. Todd had the distinction of \nbeing the oldest elected State official in Alabama and was among the \noldest in the entire country. He took pride in introducing himself as \nthe country's oldest ``Young Democrat.'' He was an old-school Democrat \nwho grew up in Belgreen, Alabama. When he was only 13, he was \npermanently injured in a hunting accident that resulted in his left arm \nbeing severed.\n  This did not slow him down at all. He used a job on Auburn \nUniversity's experiment farm to work his way through college. After \ngraduating, he returned to Franklin County, where he operated a feed \nmill and poultry company and served in State government. One of his \nchildren, Elizabeth Campbell, followed him into public service, \nbecoming a Federal magistrate in Birmingham.\n  A.W. Todd was an outstanding public servant who will be greatly \nmissed. I was proud to have known and worked with him over the years. I \nextend my sincerest condolences to his wife, Robbie, and their entire \nfamily in the wake of this tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3620-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3620-S3621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHARLES E. GRAINGER\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, one of the major reasons that Huntsville, \nAL, has been nationally recognized as one of the country's top high-\ntechnology growth areas is the strength and vitality of its community \nleadership. One of these visionary leaders is Charles E. Grainger, vice \npresident of administration at Teledyne Brown Engineering and 1992 \nchairman of the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce. \nRecently, he received the chamber's Distinguished Service Award.\n  As chairman of the chamber 4 years ago, Charlie Grainger expanded its \neconomic development emphasis to create a coordinated Partnership for \nEconomic Development. Madison County led all Alabama's counties in new \nplant and equipment investments that year.\n  As vice president of administration at Teledyne Brown, a major \ndefense contractor, Charlie is responsible for coordinating \ngovernmental relations activities with agencies and Congress. He has \noverall management responsibility for the departments of human \nresources, facilities, public relations, administrative services, \nsecurity, technical communications, and computing resources and \ntechnology. He has held his current position since 1978, having served \nas director of administration from 1967 to 1978. He joined Brown \nEngineering as assistant to the director of administration in 1963.\n  Charlie was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1968 \nand 1970, and was an award-winning legislator. He sponsored a water \npollution control act and a school bus safety act, both of which became \nnational models. Both pieces of legislation were named after their \nsponsor by joint resolution, which is somewhat rare. As a member of the \nWays and Means Committee, he secured funding to begin the University of \nAlabama in Huntsville nursing education program, to establish physical \nhealth facilities at Alabama A University, and to complete the \nHuntsville-Madison County Mental Health Center. He served as an elected \nmember of the Alabama Democratic Executive Committee from 1966 through \n1990, serving as a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention. \nHe was a presidential campaign coordinator for\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nSenator John Glenn in 1984 and Vice President Al Gore in 1988.\n  A native of Lawrence County, Alabama, Charlie grew up in Sheffield, \nattended Florence State College, and earned a master of science degree \nin management from Southeastern Institute of Technology. His work as a \nmember of the Base Realignment and Closing Commission Community Task \nForce was invaluable during the base closure rounds of 1991, 1993, and \n1995. He has received the Governor's Air Pollution Control Award; \nMadison County Good Government Award; Alabama Water Conservationist of \nthe Year Award; and Huntsville-Madison County Mental Health \nDistinguished Service Award.\n  He was originally a journalist. He spent several years as a reporter \nfor the Birmingham News. He served as editor and publisher of the \nValley Voice, a weekly newspaper published in Tuscumbia.\n  One of the secrets to Charlie Grainger's phenomenal success is that \nhe truly understands that in order to thrive and grow, the various \ngroups and resources within a community must be united in supporting \nthe bottom-line economic imperatives. In Huntsville's case these are \nthe defense and space industries. He is an instrumental unifying force \nwho sees the big picture and Huntsville's role in that picture. He is a \nleader who brings people from divergent points of view to common \nunderstandings so they can work together for the common good.\n  I congratulate and commend Charlie for all his accomplishments and \nfor his superb leadership role in the development, growth, and vitality \nof the Hunstville area. He is a unique role model and a living \ntestament to the tremendous results which can be realized through \nstrong partnerships between government and industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3620-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES STILLMAN FREE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, on April 3, James Stillman Free, a native \nof Gordo, Alabama and for 33 years the Washington correspondent for The \nBirmingham News, passed away at the age of 87. Jim enjoyed a rich and \ncolorful career as a journalist and historian. Back in November 1993, I \nhad the opportunity to attend his 85th birthday celebration and it was \na wonderful experience for his many friends and associates as we \ngathered with him to celebrate and reflect.\n  Jim Free attended the public schools of Tuscaloosa, AL; earned his \nbachelor's degree at the University of Alabama; and obtained his \nmaster's degree from Columbia University. He was part owner and editor \nof a weekly Tuscaloosa newspaper shortly before joining the News in \n1935.\n  Jim's 33 years as The Birmingham News' Washington correspondent was \nthe longest tenure for any Washington correspondent for Alabama \nnewspapers. He spent a total of 35 years with that paper, his name and \nwritings becoming synonymous with Alabama political coverage and \nanalysis in the nation's capital. He also served as the Washington \ncorrespondent for the Chicago Sun, Raleigh News and Observer, and \nWinston-Salem Journal during the 1940's and '50's.\n  His coverage extended from the Great Depression and New Deal through \nWorld War II preparations and his own combat duty as a Navy Captain in \nthe Pacific; the McCarthy ``Red Scare'' era; the Civil Rights movement; \nthe assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King; \nand all national defense, medical, educational, and environmental \nissues that affected Alabama. He was an on-the-scenes, eye witness to \nmuch of the social change and history of this century.\n  His many ``scoops'' included President Truman's 1946 order for the \nArmy to take over strike-threatened railroads, and he led the national \npress with his stories on the Justice Department's civil rights \ndecisions. Jim filed overseas reports on the 1957 Berlin crisis and \nNATO operations in the North Sea, Western Europe, and the United \nKingdom in 1966. He served as the historian for the Gridiron Club and \nwas the author of ``The First One Hundred Years: a casual chronicle of \nthe Gridiron Club.''\n  His World War II service allowed him to bring special insight into \nhis coverage of national defense issues. In an October 1961 article on \nhis time in Berlin, he said, ``* * * our test of strength with Russia \nin the months and years ahead * * * will be 90 percent non-military. It \nwill be political, economic, scientific, and educational. It will be a \nshowdown of our way of life against theirs.'' Indeed, history proved \nhim right.\n  While covering the Justice Department, Jim relayed messages from \nAlabama moderates to then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy during the \nFreedom Rider bus burning crisis. He was also one of the first \nreporters to question in print the validity of charges brought against \npublic officials and private citizens by Senator Joseph McCarthy.\n  Jim held a number of leadership positions in his field and received a \nnumber of honors. In 1967, he was elected president of the Washington \nchapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. In 1989, he was \ninducted into the society's hall of fame. The Raymond Clapper Award \ncommittee gave him a special citation for exceptional reporting on \nnational affairs and he received the Outstanding Alumnus Award from the \nUniversity of Alabama alumni association.\n  It is a grand understatement to say that Jim Free was a highly \nregarded and respected figure. He was a well-rounded professional and a \ngenuine person of integrity. Jim never tried to purposely harm anyone's \nreputation through his reporting. His professional ethics dictated that \nhe would let the facts speak for themselves. He never tried to make a \ncareer of finding dirt on government officials. He was not a \npractitioner of yellow journalism and was not a purveyor of scandal.\n  Jim was a gentleman who possessed all the traits that one would \nexpect to find in a gentleman--civility, an educated mind, sensitivity, \ncourteousness, and a healthy respect for the views of others.\n  I was proud to have known Jim Free, who will long be remembered in \nthe dual worlds of journalism and politics for his lifetime of service \nto the cause of informing citizens about the world around them. I \nextend my condolences to his family in the wake of their tremendous \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3621-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3621-S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BUSINESSWOMAN EULA SIMS DURBIN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Eula Sims Durbin, who was a pioneer of the \nmodern poultry industry in Alabama and throughout the southeast, passed \naway late last month at the age of 98. She earned a place in the annals \nof Alabama business history during the dark years of the Great \nDepression when she and her husband Marshall used her $500 in savings \nto finance a new business venture, a fish concession. Eventually, the \nDurbins switched to dressed chickens because of the great difficulty in \nkeeping fresh fish, and opened their own processing plant in \nBirmingham. Today, the Birmingham-based Marshall Durbin Companies is \nthe nation's 10th largest poultry producer.\n  On April 2, the Birmingham Post-Herald carried an excellent story \ndetailing the history and growth of Marshall Durbin Companies and of \nthe crucial role Mrs. Durbin played in its enormous success. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the article be printed in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Mrs. Eula S. Durbin will long be \nremembered for her astute business instincts, for her willingness to \ntake risks, and for her perseverance in the face of great uncertainty \nand adversity. I extend my condolences to her family in the wake of \ntheir loss.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n            [From the Birmingham Post-Herald, April 2, 1996]\n\n                   Mrs. Durbin's Risks are Remembered\n\n                         (By Patrick Rupinski)\n\n       When they write about the seeds of Alabama's successful \n     businesses, the gamble of Eula Sims Durbin will be recorded.\n       Mrs. Durbin risked all of her personal savings in a move \n     that helped build the poultry industry in both Alabama and \n     the Southeast.\n       Mrs. Durbin, who co-founded Marshall Durbin Cos. with her \n     husband--the late Marshall Durbin Sr., died Thursday. She was \n     98.\n       ``She worked to build this company and kept an active \n     interest in it even in her 90s,''\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n     said Pat Shea, a spokeswoman for Birmingham-based Marshall \n     Durbin Companies, the nation's 10th largest poultry producer.\n       Mrs. Durbin's place in Alabama's business history occurred \n     as the Great Depression gripped Birmingham in the 1930s.\n       Her husband wanted to start a business even though \n     businesses were failing in record numbers.\n       Money was tight, but Mrs. Durbin believed in her husband \n     enough to give him her $500 in savings to finance the \n     venture, a fish concession at a Birmingham market.\n       The business struggled, particularly in the hot Alabama \n     summers when a lack of refrigeration made keeping fish fresh \n     difficult. But Mrs. Durbin never shied from taking a risk and \n     supported her husband's decision to begin selling dressed \n     chickens.\n       The move proved popular and soon chicken sales replaced \n     fish. In time, the Durbins opened their own chicken \n     processing plant in downtown Birmingham.\n       It started small with Mrs. Durbin doing the bookkeeping and \n     other chores, said Ms. Shea, who had interviewed Mrs. Durbin \n     for a history of the company.\n       By the 1950s, the poultry industry was changing. No longer \n     did farmers with a few hens sell directly to poultry \n     processors. The industry was becoming highly integrated.\n       By the 1960s, Marshall Durbin Companies had become part of \n     the changes. It added more processing plants plus feed mills, \n     hatcheries, growing facilities and distribution centers.\n       Today, the family-owned company has annual sales of about \n     $200 million with facilities in three states--Alabama, \n     Mississippi and Tennessee.\n       The chickens--processed at a rate of more than 2 million a \n     week--end up as everything from frozen breaded nuggets at \n     local supermarkets to cut pieces at KFC restaurants in \n     California and frozen leg quarters shipped to Russia.\n       Ms. Shea said Mrs. Durbin however, always seemed to take \n     the most pride in how her husband taught their son the \n     business.\n       Durbin died in 1971. The couple's son, Marshall Durbin Jr., \n     runs the company today.\n       Mrs. Durbin's interest in the company never waned. Even in \n     her 90s when she was legally blind, she would have someone \n     read her the monthly employee newsletter, Ms. Shea said.\n       Mrs. Durbin was born in Brookhaven, Miss., and moved to \n     Sulligent after finishing her education, becoming a secretary \n     to the president of a lumber company. She met her future \n     husband while in Sulligent.\n       Their courtship blossomed after Mrs. Durbin moved to \n     Birmingham to take another secretarial job.\n       Mrs. Durbin's funeral will be at 2 p.m. today at Ridout's \n     Valley Chapel, followed by a private family burial. Survivors \n     besides her son include two granddaughters, two great-\n     grandsons and six sisters.\n       In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorials to the \n     Eula Sims Durbin Scholarship Fund at Birmingham-Southern \n     College, Box 549003, Birmingham, Ala. 35254.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3621-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BUCKY MILLER\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, one of the most interesting people and \ncharming characters I have met in my lifetime is Aura J. ``Bucky'' \nMiller, who celebrates the 55th anniversary of first coming to work at \nthe Marriott Grand Hotel Resort and Golf Club in Point Clear, AL, on \nApril 18, 1996. He just celebrated his 79th birthday on April 12 and, \nthankfully, has no plans to retire.\n  As an associate at the Grand Hotel over the course of these many \nyears, Bucky Miller has become the very embodiment of hospitality. For \nmany years, he has served as the hotel's resident expert on mint \njuleps, all-around hospitality ambassador, and official historian. He \nis well-known throughout Alabama and the South. Once he meets a guest, \nhe never forgets the name or face. He has taken care of a seemingly \nendless number of politicians, sports figures, actors, and business \npeople who have been guests at the hotel over the decades.\n  As an extraordinary hospitality ambassador, he has received a great \ndeal of recognition and attention for his natural skills in making \npeople feel welcome and comfortable. In 1989, the town of Fairhope, \nwhich is near Point Clear, declared the first week of June ``Bucky \nMiller Week.'' That same year, he was chosen along with 17 other \nMarriott associates nationwide to receive the J.W. Marriott Award of \nExcellence in recognition of exceptional hospitality skills.\n  As a people-person, Bucky has a caring attitude that really endears \nhim to his guests. He has a talent for making people feel like they are \nspecial.\n  Over the years, Bucky has worked as a housekeeping aide, wine \nsteward, bartender, and kitchen steward. He left the hotel for a time \nto serve in World War II and to teach mathematics, but soon returned \nfor good saying, ``This hotel is in my blood.'' His outgoing \npersonality soon earned him the title ``Mr. Hospitality,'' and resulted \nin a continuous flow of favorable guest comments and feature articles \nin newspapers and magazines.\n  His legendary mint juleps, which he makes from his own recipe with \nfresh mint he grows in a garden outside the lounge, are internationally \nknown. Seagram's published his recipe in its recipe book and named \nBucky one of the country's 100 best bartenders.

I commend and congratulate Dave Harris for all his \naccomplishments and hard work on behalf of the Army over the years, and \nhope he is enjoying his well-earned retirement.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [The Huntsville Times, Friday, Dec. 8, 1995]\n\n                       One Who Made a Difference\n\n       There are a handful of people who make a difference in any \n     community. They're usually visible personalities like \n     government or community leaders, businessmen or clergy. Dave \n     Harris has made an impact behind the scenes for 33 years.\n       Harris, 65, will retire Jan. 3 as the head of the public-\n     affairs office for Redstone Arsenal and the Army Missile \n     Command. During that time, he's been a trusted source of \n     information for the media on subjects ranging from high-tech \n     missiles to traffic accidents. He's also been a trusted \n     source for Army employees, squelching unfounded rumors that \n     could affect morale or raising legitimate concerns to \n     management's attention.\n       Less well known has been his role as adviser to Redstone \n     commanders, project managers and community leaders on matters \n     of importance to each.\n       Harris is uncommon partly because he has been at the same \n     job for so long. He knows who to call for answers. He has a \n     historical perspective on weapons development and the \n     community and knows how to put both in the proper context for \n     generals, soldiers, civil servants and citizens.\n       Very few media spokespersons today have any actual media \n     experience. Harris worked for a newspaper. He is a skilled \n     writer and knows how a story will play. He not only \n     understands reporters and tolerates their eccentricities, he \n     likes working with them. Those qualities make news stories \n     more accurate and cast the Army in a more positive light.\n       He has believed in what his Army was doing at Redstone \n     Arsenal. Generals to whom Harris reported describe him as \n     ``the heart and soul'' and ``conscience and ombudsman'' of \n     the command.\n       Dave Harris possesses intelligence, honesty, integrity, \n     common sense, a sense of duty and responsibility, and a long-\n     standing reputation for all the above. He will be difficult \n     to replace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3622-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3622-S3623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION? HERE'S TODAY'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat, for the week ending April 12, the U.S. imported 7,635,000 barrels \nof oil each day--1,155,000 barrels more than the 6,480,000 barrels \nimported during the same period a year ago.\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\n  Americans now rely on foreign oil for more than 50 percent of their \nneeds, and there are no signs that this upward trend will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in \nthe 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians better ponder the \neconomic calamity that will occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply, or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the U.S.--now 7,635,000 barrels a day.\n   Mr. President, Joseph J. Romm and Charles B. Curtis wrote in the \nApril 1996 Atlantic Monthly an extensive analysis of the impending \ncrisis due to U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The article, ``Mideast \nOil Forever?'' is very thorough and detailed--and I commend it to \nSenators and staff. At the very least, I hope Senators will read \nseveral paragraphs from this article under the subheading ``The Coming \nOil Crisis.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Atlantic Monthly, Apr. 1996]\n\n                          Mideast Oil Forever?\n\n\n                         the coming oil crisis\n\n       Given that the most recent war America fought was in the \n     Persian Gulf, let's start by examining the likelihood that an \n     oil crisis will occur in the coming decade. Forecasting is \n     always risky, especially where oil is concerned, but consider \n     what a variety of experienced energy hands from every point \n     on the political spectrum have said in the past year alone. \n     Donald Hodel, who was a Secretary of Energy under Ronald \n     Reagan, has said that we are ``sleepwalking into a \n     disaster,'' and predicts a major oil crisis within a few \n     years. Irwin Stelzer, of the American Enterprise Institute, \n     says that the next oil shock ``will make those of the 1970s \n     seem trivial by comparison.'' Daniel Yergin says, ``People \n     seem to have forgotten that oil prices, like those of all \n     commodities, are cyclical and will go up again.'' James \n     Schlesinger, who was the Secretary of Energy under Jimmy \n     Carter, has said, ``By the end of this decade we are likely \n     to see substantial price increases.'' In March of last year \n     Robert Dole, the Senate majority leader, said in a speech at \n     the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, ``The second \n     inescapable reality of the post-twentieth-century world is \n     that the security of the world's oil and gas supplies will \n     remain a vital national interest of the United States and of \n     the other industrial powers. The Persian Gulf . . . is still \n     a region of many uncertainties. . . . In this `new energy \n     order' many of the most important geopolitical decisions--\n     ones on which a nation's sovereignty an depend--will deal \n     with the location and routes for oil and gas pipelines. In \n     response, our strategy, our diplomacy, and our forward \n     military presence need readjusting.'' The chairman of the \n     Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, not known for being an \n     alarmist, in testimony before Congress last July raised \n     concerns that a rising trade deficit in oil ``tends to create \n     questions about the security of our oil resources.''\n       Concerns about a coming oil crisis have surfaced in the \n     financial markets as well. Last October, in an article titled \n     ``Your Last Big Play in Oil,'' Fortune magazine listed \n     several billionaires and ``big mutual fund managers'' who \n     were betting heavily that oil prices would rise \n     significantly. The magazine went on to suggest an investment \n     portfolio of ``companies that are best positioned to profit \n     from the coming boom.''\n       Fundamental trends in oil demand and supply underlie this \n     emerging consensus. First, the world will probably need \n     another 20 million barrels of oil a day by the year 2010, \n     according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The \n     International Energy Agency projects an even greater growth \n     in demand, following the inexorable tide of population \n     growth, urbanization, and industrialization.\n       Second, the world's population is expected to increase by \n     50 percent by 2020, with more than half those additional \n     people born in Asia and Latin America. And as farm workers \n     move to the city, much more energy and oil will be needed. \n     The fundamentals of urbanization--commuting, transporting raw \n     materials, constructing infrastructure, powering commercial \n     buildings--all consume large amounts of oil and electricity. \n     At the same time, fewer farms will have to feed more people, \n     and so the use of mechanization, transportation, and \n     fertilizer will increase, entailing the consumption of still \n     more energy and oil. An analysis by one of the Department of \n     Energy's national laboratories found that a doubling of the \n     proportion of China's and India's populations that lives in \n     cities could increase per capita energy consumption by 45 \n     percent--even if industrialization and income per capita \n     remained unchanged.\n       Finally, industrialization has an even greater impact on \n     energy use. As countries develop industries, they use more \n     energy per unit of gross national product and per worker. \n     Crucial industries for development are also the most energy-\n     intensive: primary metals; stone, clay, and glass; pulp and \n     paper; petroleum refining; and chemicals. In the United \n     States these industries account for more than 80 percent of \n     manufacturing energy consumption (and more than 80 percent of \n     industrial waste).\n       As Fortune has noted, if the per capital energy consumption \n     of China and India rises to that of South Korea, and the \n     Chinese and Indian populations increase at currently \n     projected rates, ``these two countries alone will need a \n     total of 119 million barrels of oil a day. That's almost \n     double the world's entire demand today.''\n       Barring a major and long-lasting worldwide economic \n     depression, global energy demand will be rising inexorably \n     for the foreseeable future. The Persian Gulf, with two-thirds \n     of the world's oil reserves, is expected to supply the vast \n     majority of that increased demand--as much as 80 percent, \n     according to the EIA. Within ten to fifteen years the Persian \n     Gulf's share of the world export market may surpass its \n     highest level to date, 67 percent, which was attained in \n     1974. The EIA predicts that in the face of increased demand, \n     oil prices will rise slowly to $24 a barrel (1994 dollars) in \n     2010. If, instead, they remain low, the Gulf's share of the \n     world export market may rise as high as 75 percent in 2010.\n       Although non-OPEC nations did increase production by almost \n     15 percent from 1980 to 1990, they increased proven reserves \n     of oil by only 10 percent. The net result is that the \n     remaining years of production for non-OPEC reserves has \n     actually fallen from eighteen years to seventeen years. On \n     the other hand, while OPEC increased production by 20 percent \n     in the 1980s, it increased its proven reserves by 75 percent. \n     As a result, OPEC's reserves-to-production ratio doubled to \n     ninety years.\n       The growing dependence on imported oil in general and \n     Persian Gulf oil in particular has several potentially \n     serious implications for the nation's economic and national \n     security. First, the United States is expected to be \n     importing nearly 60 percent of its oil by ten years from now, \n     with roughly a third of that oil coming from the Persian \n     Gulf. Our trade deficit in oil is expected to double, to $100 \n     billion a year, by that time--a large and continual drag on \n     our economic health. To the extent that the Gulf's recapture \n     of the dominant share of the global oil market will make \n     price increases more likely, the U.S. economy is at risk. \n     Although oil imports as a percent of gross domestic product \n     have decreased significantly in the past decade, our economic \n     vulnerability to rapid increases in the price of oil \n     persists. Since 1970 sharp increases in the price of oil have \n     always been followed by economic recessions in the United \n     States.\n       Second, the Persian Gulf nations' oil revenues are likely \n     to almost triple, from $90 billion a year today to $250 \n     billion a year in 2010--a huge geopolitical power shift of \n     great concern, especially since some analysts predict \n     increasing internal and regional pressure on Saudi Arabia to \n     alter its pro-Western stance. This represents a $1.5 trillion \n     increase in wealth for Persian Gulf producers over the next \n     decade and a half. That money could buy a tremendous amount \n     of weaponry, influence, and mischief in a chronically \n     unstable region. And the breakup of the Soviet Union, coupled \n     with Russia's difficulty in earning hard currency, means that \n     for the next decade and beyond, pressure will build to make \n     Russia's most advanced military hardware and technical \n     expertise available to well-heeled buyers.\n       The final piece in the geopolitical puzzle is that during \n     the oil crisis of the 1970s the countries competing with us \n     for oil were our NATO allies, but during the next oil crisis \n     a new, important complication will arise; the competition for \n     oil will increasingly come from the rapidly growing countries \n     of Asia. Indeed, in the early 1970s East Asia consumed well \n     under half as much oil as the United States, but by the time \n     of the next crisis East Asian nations will probably be \n     consuming more oil than we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3622-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3623-S3624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on Friday February 23, 1996, the Federal \ndebt broke the 5 trillion dollar sound barrier for the first time in \nhistory. The records show that on that day, at the close of business, \nthe debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53.\n  Twenty years earlier, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 \nbillion, after the first 200 years of America's history, including two \nworld wars. The total Federal debt in 1976, I repeat, stood at $629 \nbillion.\n  Then the big spenders went to work and the interest on the Federal \ndebt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past 2 decades \nthe Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing by more \nthan $4 trillion in 2 decades--from 1976 to 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, as of the close of business yesterday, Wednesday, \nApril 17, 1996, the Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at \n$5,146,356,518,536.99. On a per capita basis, every man, woman\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nand child in America owes $19,445.43 as his or her share of that debt.\n  This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens \nand especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and \ngrandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, ``to preserve [our] \nindependence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. \nWe must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.''

Mr. President, I recently became a co-sponsor of S. 295, \nthe Teamwork for Employers and Management Act, a bill that is scheduled \nfor markup today in the Labor Committee and which the Small Business \nCommittee, on which I sit, will consider tomorrow. This bill is very \nimportant to small businesses. It is important to all business but, \nwith 98 percent of Montana's businesses considered small, those are the \nfolks I'm hearing from.\n  Many of the businesses that have contacted me were in shock. They had \nno idea that the committees they had formed with their employees were \nin violation of the law. As far as they were concerned, they were just \ngood business practice. The committees kept the employees involved in \noperations and improved customer satisfaction.\n  But according to the National Labor Relations Act, employee \ninvolvement is illegal. The intent of the law, established in the \n1930's, was to prevent employers from dominating a labor organization. \nAnd labor organization is defined as a group of employees that \ndiscusses terms or conditions of employment with the employer. That may \nbe well and good as far as collective bargaining is concerned--at the \ntime, the NLRA wanted to stop employers from establishing these company \nunions to keep independent unions out--but the law is being interpreted \nto mean that discussions of safety, productivity, and quality are \nconsidered conditions of employment. That's causing more than a little \nheart burn.\n  Let me give you an example. There is a Montana company I have heard \nfrom, and I will not name them since, understandably, many small \nbusinesses are afraid of having their practices brought to the \nattention of the NLRB. But this company, with diversified interests, \nhas formed a committee on safety--safety not only of employees who work \nwith a variety of equipment but of the thousands of visitors who use \ntheir facilities every day. This committee gives the employees \nownership of their surroundings and results in a safer workplace for \neveryone.\n\n  This same company also has a committee on customer satisfaction. The \nemployees survey the facilities periodically and decide on changes in \ndecorations, improvements in the surroundings, how to make the area \nmore customer friendly--basically how to draw business in and keep it. \nOnce again, this is not only a good business practice, it is a way to \nkeep the employees energized about their work conditions. How can this \npossibly be against the law? That is not only the question they are \nasking, it is one we should all ask.\n  Yet, if the National Labor Relations Board learned about these \nemployee involvement teams, according to the law, they could penalize \nthe employer. And in a number of cases, they already have. That does \nnot even make sense.\n  Now, I know that the Government is famous for not making sense--and \nthat is what our regulatory reform efforts are about--but here is one \nspecific place we can make a difference. By passing this bill, the \nTeamwork for Employees and Management Act, without any taxpayers \ndollars, without any new volumes of paperwork, we can let business get \nback to business without fear of the heavy hand of Government coming \ndown on them.\n  By simply amending the National Labor Relations Act, we can allow \nteamwork to continue, and allow businesses to form teams to safeguard \nworking conditions, improvement productivity and efficiency, and boost \nthe quality of their products. This does not just benefit the employer \nand the employee, it helps our economy.\n  Mr. President, this provision of the law may have served its purposes \n60 years ago, but it is not necessary today. Small businesses need all \nthe help they can get to survive in today's competitive market and \nbeing flexible is vital to that success. Small business owners need the \ninput, the advice, the cooperation, and the labor of their employees. \nTo prohibit that involvement is to squash innovation and prosperity, \nthe very ideals that make up the American Dream.\n  I strongly support this legislation, Mr. President. I hope we can \nbring this to the floor quickly and relieve the stress on our small \nbusinesses around the Nation who have learned of their allegedly \n``illegal'' business practices. Let us get the government off their \nbacks once again, and let business do what they do best--create jobs \nand produce high quality goods and services for the world to enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3624-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3624-S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, an important bill was recently reported out \nof the Senate Labor Committee and I hope it will make its way to the \nSenate floor quickly. This is a bill that was designed with not only \nchildren in mind--and that is foremost--but with the needs of teachers, \nadministrators, and parents of children with disabilities. That can be \na delicate balance, but I think it was achieved.\n  S. 1578, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \nreauthorization, ensures that children with disabilities have access to \na free appropriate public education. At first, that may sound like \nsomething we would assume is a guaranteed right of any American \ncitizen. And it is. But many children with disabilities have special \nneeds--needs that neither the parents nor the schools can meet without \nsacrifice. And it seems that when this bill was first enacted in 1975, \nthe burdens on some were increased. And 21 years later, we have the \nopportunity to make some positive changes.\n  Let me just highlight a few of the changes that are proposed that \nprompted me to sign my name on this bill. To begin with, S. 1578 \nreduces the bureaucratic maze that schools have been required to fight \ntheir way through. Right now, State and local education agencies must \nsubmit a plan or application every 3 years. Now, they will only have to \nprepare that plan once, unless they institute substantial changes. And \nthe data they are required to collect is cut in half.\n  Some may say, ``But how will that affect my child's education?'' As \nI've visited with school administrators and teachers around Montana, it \nhas\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\namazed me to hear how many resources are tied up with paperwork \ngenerating, reporting requirements, and tracking. If it wasn't required \nby law, I wouldn't be surprised if schools refused to enroll children \nwith disabilities. The amount of time it takes a school employee to \nkeep up with the regulations, the amount of financial resources that \nare used to document school activities and student performance--it's \nalmost a miracle that the school has the time to educate the children.\n  When we reduce the paperwork, the reporting requirements, the \ndocumentation, we free up time and money to devote to the education of \nour children and we allow those children with disabilities to achieve \nas much as they can possibly achieve. It allows the teacher to get back \nto the classroom, the administrator to get back to making sure the \nschool is safe and the curriculum is top-notch, and the parents to rest \neasy knowing that their child is receiving the same educational \nopportunities every other child is receiving.\n  But one of the most common remarks I've heard from Montana schools is \nthat they need more flexibility. And this bill gives them that. In \nparticular, the question of discipline is often raised. Current law \nprohibits schools from suspending a disabled child for more than 30 \ndays even if the child brought in a dangerous weapon or threatened a \nteacher or student. S. 1578 gives the school some flexibility in \ndeciding how to handle that violation. If a child with a disability \nviolates such a policy, that child may be suspended for up to 10 school \ndays. In that time, the IEP team may designate an alternative placement \nfor up to 35 days. And, if the behavior was not related to the \ndisability, the child can be disciplined as any other nondisabled child \nwould be.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure that all children have access to a \nfree, appropriate public education. Whether a child has a disability, \nmental or physical, whether a child is poor or disadvantaged, whether \nthe parents of schoolaged children have the resources to afford special \ncare or not--we need to take the responsibility of educating our future \ngenerations very seriously.\n  And there is a balance we need to maintain. Order and discipline in \nour schools is essential to creating an environment conducive to \nlearning, for disabled and nondisabled children alike. There should be \na balance between the parents involvement and the schools efforts in \neducating a child with disabilities. And there is a balance to be kept \nbetween making sure schools are accountable for the Federal dollars \nthey receive and overburdening them with red tape. This bill, S. 1578, \nstrikes that balance.\n  I join my colleagues in supporting this important legislation and I \ncommend Senator Frist for his hard work in making sure that both \nparents and schools were consulted in proposing these changes. With the \nbipartisan support it enjoyed in the Labor Committee, I look forward to \nseeing this bill brought to the Senate floor soon. Our Nation's \nfuture--our children--depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3624-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECRETARY RON BROWN AND BARRY CONRAD\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I offer my heartfelt condolences and \nprayers to the family of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and to all of the \nother families who have lost a loved one in this terrible tragedy.\n  It is never easy to lose someone close to you. Yet I believe those \nthat Commerce Secretary Brown left behind--his wife Alma, his daughter \nTracey, and his son Michael--can be comforted and given strength by the \nknowledge that Ron Brown died doing what he loved: Representing the \nPresident as Commerce Secretary and serving America by promoting \nAmerican economic interests abroad.\n  Secretary Brown will be remembered for his commitment to our \ndemocracy, his charisma, and the enthusiasm with which he embraced new \nideas and challenges. I will keep Alma, Tracey, Michael, and all others \nwho are mourning this great loss, in my thoughts and prayers during \ntheir time of grief.\n  I would also like to offer my condolences at this time to the family \nof Barry L. Conrad who was accompanying Secretary Brown on his trip to \nthe Balkans. Mr. Conrad was the founder of the Barrington Group, a \ndynamic hotel company in Miami, and had previously headed Burger King's \nU.S. franchise operation.\n  In addition to being a successful businessman, Mr. Conrad was a very \nprominent and well-respected member of the south Florida community. \nThis is a great loss not only for the family and friends of Mr. Conrad \nbut for the entire State of Florida.\n  I am praying for the Conrad family, and all others who are mourning \nas a result of this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3625-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3625-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 842.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to require States to regard adult relatives who meet State child \nprotection standards as the preferred placement option for children, \nand to provide for demonstration projects to test the feasibility of \nestablishing kinship care as an alternative to foster care for a child \nwho has adult relatives willing to provide safe and appropriate care \nfor the child; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      the kinship care act of 1996\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I introduce the Kinship Care Act of \n1996. Today Representative Connie Morella is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  Grandparents caring for grandchildren represent one of the most \nunderappreciated natural resources in our Nation. They hold tremendous \npotential for curing one of our society's most pressing maladies: The \ncare of children who have no parents, or whose parents simply aren't up \nto the task of providing children a stable, secure and nurturing living \nenvironment.\n  There is such a great reservoir of love and experience available to \nus, and more especially to the tens of thousands of American children \nwho desperately need basic care giving. We provide public assistance to \nstrangers for this kind of care, but the folks available to provide \nfoster care homes are in short supply.\n  At the same time, inflexibility in current regulations often force us \nto\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nignore a precious alternative that is right at our doorstep. Our public \npolicy planners have missed the forest for the trees. Grandparents can \nfill the gap. They are ready, willing and able to provide the kind of \ncare these youngsters so desperately need.\n  The legislation I plan to introduce in the Senate today will give \nStates the flexibility to provide the support these grandparents need, \nso that our seniors can help fill the care gap.\n  The House included my legislation, similar to today's bill, as part \nof the welfare reform measure last year. My new legislation will \ncontinue the process of shifting the focus of our child welfare system \nfrom turning children over to strangers, to granting them the loving \narms of grandparents and other relatives.\n  States have been moving in this direction for over a decade. Over the \npast 10 years the number of children involved in extended family \narrangements has increased by 40 percent. Currently, more than 3 \nmillion children are being raised by their grandparents. In other \nwords, 5 percent of all families in this country are headed by \ngrandparents.\n  It's time that the Federal Government get with the program and start \ndeveloping policies that make it easier, instead of more difficult, for \nfamilies to come together to raise their children.\n  My bill has several parts. The first would require States to give \npreference to relative providers when a child is removed from their \nparents' home. Too often I have heard stories of grandparents or other \nrelatives, not finding out that their grandchildren have been removed \nfrom their children's home. By the time they know what is happening, \nthe grandchildren are locked into the foster care system.\n  Often I have heard stories where brothers and sisters are split up \nand grandparents spend years in court trying to reunite their own \nfamilies. As we rethink our child protection system, we need to \nrededicate ourselves to looking to families, including extended \nfamilies, for solutions. When a child is separated from their parents, \nit is usually a painful and traumatic experience. Living with people \nthat a child knows and trusts gives children a better chance in the \nworld and gives families a better chance to rebuild themselves.\n  The second part of my bill allows States to obtain waivers to set up \nkinship care guardianship systems where grandparents and other relative \nproviders can receive some financial assistance without having to turn \nover custody of the child to the State, and without having to go \nthrough the paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles of the foster care \nsystem.\n  Our child protection system is where our welfare system was about 10 \nyears ago. We know it isn't working well, but States and the Federal \nGovernment are still fumbling for solutions. What we need to do now, as \nwe did for our welfare system, is start opening the door for States to \ntry new ideas to both protect children and keep families together.\n  As we reevaluate the effectiveness of our country's child protection \nsystems, it's time that we identify new ideas and new ways to find \nloving environments for our Nation's most vulnerable children. \nGrandparents can provide the lynchpin for such a new system.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1684. A bill to require that applications for passports for minors \nhave parental signatures; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n            the mikey kale passport notification act of 1996\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation I intended \nto offer as an amendment to the immigration bill. Unfortunately, it \ndoes not appear I will have the opportunity to offer this as an \namendment to that bill. I therefore decided to offer this as a \nfreestanding bill as I believe it is an issue that needs to be \naddressed whether or not we decide to go back to this bill.\n\n  Much of the debate on the immigration legislation involves complex \nissues and arcane areas of the law. My legislation is pretty easy to \nunderstand. It is a common sense legislative solution to a simple, but \ntroubling, issue. The issue my bill attempts to resolve is that of \ninternational parental abductions. Significantly, my bill does not \nattempt to right a wrong. Rather, it attempts to prevent future wrongs \nfrom occurring. And there is little dispute that absent legislation, \nfuture wrongs will occur.\n  The wrong that occurs is best illustrated by a living nightmare \nforced upon an American family from Henderson, NV. No parent should \never have to go through what Fred and Barbara Spierer went through in \n1993. That year, on Valentine's Day, Barbara Spierer's ex-husband took \nher son to his native country, war-torn Croatia. She would soon learn \nthat upon their arrival, her ex-husband initiated official custody \nproceedings in a Croatian court.\n  Through tremendous emotional and financial costs, Fred and Barbara \nSpierer were able to secure the return of young Mikey. Incredibly, this \ncould all have been prevented if our laws didn't permit such easy \nprocurement of passports for minors. Few would disagree that parental \nconsent should be given before a passport is issued to a minor child. \nBoth parents ought to be notified before the State Department issues a \ndocument permitting their child to be taken out of this country.\n  Presently, such joint notification is not required. Under current \nlaw, one parent can apply for a U.S. passport for his or her child, \nreceive it, and then depart from the country with that child. Again, \nthis can all be accomplished without the notification of the other \nparent. Current law is an invitation to engage in the grossest of \nmisbehavior by a scurrilous parent. And engage in it they do. Sadly, \nthe case of Fred and Barbara Spierer is not an isolated incident.\n  International parental abductions are a growing problem. In 1994, \nthere were over 600 cases of children being abducted from the U.S.A. \nThousands of parents are attempting to bring home their children who \nwere taken from this country by a mother or father. While these cases \nare tracked by the State Department, children's advocates believe many \nmore go unreported. Often, the children are snatched during a divorce. \nThe abducting parents usually have strong ties to a foreign country. \nBut sometimes an American-born mother or father will take off for an \nunfamiliar nation to flee U.S. law. Regrettably, such surreptitious \ntravel is made quite easy because of current law. Why? Because one \nparent can procure the child's passport without the other one knowing.\n  Left-behind parents are faced with wading through a maze of foreign \nlaws and customs in their efforts to secure their child's return. \nImagine how difficult it is to find a missing child in the United \nStates and then multiply it by 1,000. That's about how difficult it is \nto locate and return a child abducted overseas. And finding a missing \nchild is only the start.\n  A parent must then take their case to the foreign country's legal \nsystem. Most nations do not recognize custody orders from U.S. courts. \nEven when criminal charges have been filed against the abducting parent \nin the United States, many nations will not honor a U.S. request for \nextradition. Some countries simply discriminate against women. The \ndecision to fight for a child's return consumes enormous amounts of \ntime and money. Many parents are simply without the financial \nwherewithal to engage in a protracted international legal battle.\n  For a variety of reasons, the Government is able to do very little to \nassist these parents. The current budgetary constraints realistically \npreclude doing more to secure the return of abducted children. But they \ndo not preclude efforts to implement additional barriers to prevent \nthese tragic abductions from occurring.\n  My bill takes cost effective steps toward preventing future \nabductions. It implements a system of checks prior to the issuance of a \nminor child's passport. Both parents would be required to sign the \npassport application of a child under the age of 16. Or, if the parents \nwere already divorced, the application would have to be signed by the \nparent of the child having primary custody. If such a law had been in \nplace by 1993, Barbara Spierer's ex-husband would not have been able to \nabduct their child to Croatia. The passport would not have been issued \nbecause her written permission had not been given. I believe it is \ndrafted in such a manner so as to give the State Department the\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\ndiscretion to implement a reasonable and flexible rule.\n  This bill is not just about parental rights and preventing these \ntragic international abductions. It is also about protecting the rights \nof our children. No one disagrees that the rights, liberties and \nfreedoms provided in our Nation make it the best country in the world. \nNo child should be forced to lose these rights. No child should be \nforced to undergo what Mikey Kale lived through. No American child, \nregardless of his age, should be abducted to the middle of a war torn \npart of the world. American parents should not be forced to endure the \nliving nightmare that the Spierers' were forced to go through. If my \nbill prevents only one family from having to endure this nightmare it \nwill be judged a success. I believe that more can be done but this is \nthe most cost effective step we can take today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support \nit should we return to consideration of the immigration bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide income and economic security to the \nAmerican family, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          The American Family Income and Economic Security Act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the American Family \nIncome and Economic Security Act.\n  Not long ago the Treasury announced that the leading economic \nindicators were up 1.3 percent for February, the gross domestic product \nrose half a percent, the stock market is at record levels, inflation is \nsubdued, interest rates are stable, unemployment is the lowest in the \nindustrial world, job growth is the highest with over 8 million jobs \nsince 1993; and--to topoff all of these positive indicators--the \nDemocratic economic plan--that passed without one Republican vote--has \ncut the deficit by more than half--down from $290 billion to $140 \nbillion.\n  We worked hard with the President against Republican stonewalling, \ngridlock, and continued opposition to make this happen so that even the \nRepublican Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, told me 2 \nweeks ago, at a Banking Committee hearing, that this is the longest \nperiod of the most robust and sustained economic growth since the end \nof the Second World War, and he expects the economy to continue to grow \n``at a steady clip.''\n  But this economic growth is best reflected in corporate boardrooms--\nbusinesses are finding it easier to borrow money, interest rates are \nlow, executive salaries are up and continue to mushroom, regulations \nare being eased in every sector from financial services to basic \nmanufacturing. But, in living rooms across Massachusetts there is \nextraordinary anxiety about jobs, health care, education, wages, and \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I have talked to family after family in Massachusetts \nwho told me that people at the top are doing great, but their friends \non the shop floor are not. Statistics show that corporate executives \nare earning 170 times that of their lowest paid worker. Just last year \nCEO's had an average salary increase of 15 percent while their workers \nare downsized into the street. These workers--whose real wages have \nfallen half-a-percent every year since 1973--worry about the future, \nabout elderly parents getting sick, about their kids' education, about \ntheir own health care if they lose their job, about the debt they are \ncarrying, and about their retirement.\n  I understand how difficult it is when productivity rose 7 percent but \nreal wages fell 3 percent in the first 6 years of the 1990's. A family \nthat used to take out a loan for a major expense like a car, now put \ngas on their credit cards. They took out loans to send kids to college, \nnow they take out loans to send kids to the pediatrician. The American \nfamily is sinking further and further into debt and this Republican \nCongress is making it worse.\n  In 1995 commercial banks earned an all-time record high profit of \n$48.8 billion while consumer debt has soared 39 percent in the last 5 \nyears and now exceeds $1 trillion. Personal bankruptcies rose by 6 \npercent in 1 year, and consumers owe $360 billion on their credit \ncards. And families in Massachusetts, fourth in the Nation in loan \ndelinquencies, have defaulted on $80 million in consumer loans.\n  Mr. President, in these economic times, the average American family \nhas four credit cards--each with balances of $4,800. It's no wonder we \nare anxious. Thousands and thousands of families are one paycheck away \nfrom economic disaster. But, it took Pat Buchanan to wake up the \nRepublican Party to do something the Democrats have been doing since \nthe Roosevelt administration--fighting for working families and people \nstruggling to make ends meet. Yet the Republicans have done nothing to \nalleviate this anxiety. They will not even raise the minimum wage--in \nfact they have downsized the American dream for millions of hard \nworking families, but voted time and again to increase corporate \nwelfare, and give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.\n\n  Therefore, today, to fight back, I am announcing that I will \nintroduce the American Family Income and Economic Security Act.\n  It helps families by increasing the minimum wage, helps them educate \ntheir kids and re-educate themselves, helps secure portable, \naffordable, health care with no preexisting conditions clause, and \nmakes investments for retirement easier. I believe that this \nlegislation can go a long way to restoring faith in the American dream.\n  The American Family Income and Economic Security Act gives incentives \nto businesses that become better corporate citizens and that foster a \nfamily-friendly environment that provides high-wage jobs for the 21st \ncentury.\n  It includes 10 new approaches to family economic problems, and 10 \ninitiatives that I have sponsored before. But, what makes this proposal \nunique is that it takes simple, necessary, common sense steps in the \nright direction. Each element of this plan can stand alone. It uses the \nTax Code to help workers keep up, and rewards businesses that reward \nworkers.\n  I believe that these proposals are what real families need to make \nends meet and to feel that they have a chance in the new economy.\n  Let us start with wages. Under this proposal we reward work--those \nwho are on the job and off the dole--by increasing the minimum wage \nfrom $4.25 and hour to $5.15 an hour. Maybe my Republican opponents \ndon't know what an increase means in real terms: It means an additional \n$1,800--the equivalent of 7 months of groceries.\n  Second, when it comes to educating kids--while the Republicans are \ncutting Pell grants and student loans for average working families--I \nwant to use the Tax Code creatively. This proposal gives every family a \n$10,000 maximum deduction for tuition costs; and it allows their sons \nor daughters, who take out a student loan, to deduct the interest on \nthat loan so they are not saddled with debt as soon as they graduate.\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\n  But more than helping families pay for tuition costs, I want to help \nparents get the lifetime education and training they will need to \ncompete. That is why my proposal encourages companies to provide \neducation and training with a $5,200 per employee tax deduction for \ntraining.\n  These proposals are real-life solutions to real-life family problems. \nHow can we say that everyone should go to college--everyone should be \ntrained and retrained--and then make it as difficult as we can to do \nit. How can we not provide incentives to help educate our workforce \nwhen we know that in 1972 people with advanced degrees earned 72 \npercent more than high school graduates--when we know that by 1992 \nthose with graduate degrees made 2.5 times more than high school \ngraduates--and when we know that today high school dropouts earn \nscarcely half as much as high school graduates and the education gap is \nwidening?\n  But education costs and retraining are not the only hurdles families \nare facing. Health care costs and the fear of catastrophic illness of a \nloved one add to America's insecurities. Every American has the right \nto feel secure that if they get sick, or their child or parents get \nsick, they will not face financial ruin. So, my plan endorses the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill that makes health insurance portable and limits \npreexisting condition clauses. But it goes one step further.\n\n  We know too well the horrors of a family who has tragically lost a \nloved one at a young age. The entire family, in a time of grief, can be \nfaced with mounting medical bills. This proposal provides some security \nfor younger families who are forced to sell family property because of \na terminal illness. It zeroes-out capital gains taxes for them to give \nthem a chance to recover.\n  I am tired of going around Massachusetts and hearing stories of a \nfamily that took 10 years to crawl out from under the burden of debt \ncaused by the loss of a loved one to breast cancer--which strikes 1 in \nevery 9 Massachusetts women--or AIDS--which is the leading killer of \nMassachusetts residents aged 25 to 44. I am tired of going back to \nWashington to see Republicans continue their attempts to cut Medicare \nand Medicaid and cruelly leave so many of these young families in their \npolitical wake.\n  Young families are the strength of this Nation. If they work hard \nthey have every right to expect success, security, and a piece of the \ndream--and it is up to us to help them achieve it. I came to the Senate \nwhen my daughters were young and I know how hard it is to have a career \nand be a good parent. Many families cannot afford the cost of daycare, \nand do not want to be separated from their children. That is why I am \nproposing that businesses get a tax credit of up to 50 percent of their \ninvestment up to $150,000 for establishing on-site daycare centers for \nemployees. Since the average American family spends $9,000 a year on \ndaycare, it makes sense to help businesses keep families together--kids \ncan be a few floors away rather than a few miles away, and we can take \naway parental anxiety while we raise their productivity. The Glass \nCeiling Commission and others said that on-site daycare raises the \nproductivity of American workers by 10 percent. So what are we waiting \nfor?\n  These are proposals to put more money in people's pockets, and there \nis one more proposal that is especially important to Massachusetts and \nworking families everywhere: I am proposing to create a Federal tax \ndeduction for local sewer and water fees to help those hardest hit by \nsoaring water rates that are above 1 percent of a taxpayers adjusted \ngross income.\n  In and around Boston, water rates continue to escalate--from $185 per \nyear in 1985 to $525 per year in 1992 and $618 for 1996. By the year \n2000, the rate is projected to rise to $800. The Tax Code allows \ndeductions for State and local taxes, and this will similarly avoid the \ndouble tax on water and sewer rates for homeowners.\n  And most importantly I reiterate my strong desire to double the \nincome levels for those who participate in IRA's. I want individuals \nwith incomes of $50,000 and couples who make $80,000 to be allowed to \ndeduct IRA contributions. And I want them to be allowed early \ndistribution to finance education, first time home buying, medical \nbills associated with catastrophic illness and long-term unemployment. \nThis is a common sense approach to increasing the national savings rate \nwithout breaking the Treasury. This is an innovative approach that \ngives families the flexibility to grow and build and cope with economic \nreality.\n  These are the creative programs we should incorporate into the Tax \nCode instead of giving tax breaks to MacDonalds to finance their \nforeign advertising budget. That is why I sponsored a bipartisan bill \nto cut $60 billion in corporate welfare and that is why I am proposing \nto stop companies from deducting the salaries of employees who earn \nover $1 million a year.\n  No wonder the average American does not trust Government to help \nthem.\n  To begin helping business move us in the right direction I am \nproposing today a seven part business-to-family plan that provides \ndirect assistance to high-growth, high-wage, job-producing businesses; \nand punishes businesses that put the bottom-line first and families \nlast.\n  On the positive side, I am proposing to completely eliminate capital \ngains taxes for investors who hold stock for more than 10 years in \nqualified small, high-growth, job-creating, critical-technology \ncompanies that do at least 75 percent of their business in the United \nStates; and I am proposing to reduce the tax burden by 50 percent for \ninvestors who hold stock for at least 5 years.\n  Massachusetts leads the Nation in these cutting-edge technology-\ndriven businesses, and is a model for the Nation on making investments \ncount for American working families. Let us make the Massachusetts \nhigh-tech experience, America's experience.\n  These businesses are doing it right and expanding into the global \nmarket, and we should be encouraging that expansion. That is why this \nplan encourages small businesses to export and that is why it levels \nthe playing field in Federal export financing between the Export-Import \nBank's 90-percent guaranteed coverage and the Small Business \nAdministration's 75 to 80 percent coverage. The Coalition of New \nEngland Companies for Trade strongly supports this export enhancement \nidea because they know it will work. But, most importantly, it \nencourages companies to keep jobs in this country and--like Aaron \nFeuerstein--it encourages them to recognize that their employees are an \nasset not a liability.\n  My friends, as I meet people across this State, I find that many are \nconcerned about their retirement. Employee pension plans should be \nsacred. That is why this proposal makes sure that private pension plans \nare not the toybox of corporate America. I am proposing that we \nprohibit companies from using pension plans when considering financing \nmergers and acquisitions; and we prohibit companies from deducting \nmerger and acquisition expenses if the merger results in a 15 percent \nreduction in the work force.\n  And we should not be rewarding corporate behavior with misguided tax \nloopholes that gives favorable tax treatment to companies that move \noffshore. If nothing else, a good corporate citizen keeps jobs in \nAmerica, stays in America, and builds the American economy. I am \nproposing that we close those loopholes immediately.\n  To take corporate citizenship one step further, I think we should \npunish Federal contractors that hire illegal immigrants. The Federal \nGovernment should lead by example and not allow its contractors to hire \nundocumented foreign workers at the expense of an American job. That is \ncommon sense and its the kind of corporate citizenship that we have \nevery right to demand.\n  I am also proposing that Congress give its unequivocal support to the \nidea of companies granting stock options to people they layoff and \ndownsize out of a job. Why should not CEO's with guaranteed golden \nparachutes give loyal workers at least a tin parachute to make \ndownsizing easier?\n  I am also proposing that we retroactively and permanently extend the \nResearch and Development tax credit that is so critical to a pro-\ngrowth, future oriented economy that understands that responsible, \nthoughtful investment in research and development can and will create \nthe kind of high-\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nwage jobs we need. This provision is, perhaps, the most critical of \nall. It establishes our commitment to investing in the future. It is \nnot a gamble or a waste of taxpayers' dollars. It is a sure bet; and we \nshould be willing to make it.\n  We should be willing to accept the costs of any and all of these \nproposals--first because they can be offset by the $60 billion in \nsavings we get from stopping corporate welfare under the bi-partisan \nbill that Senator McCain and I sponsored; and second, because we have \nto step up to the plate for what's right for working families and \nwhat's right for America.\n  So, what does my American Family Income and Economic Security Act do? \nIt helps workers, it supports businesses, and it rewards corporate \ncitizenship. It addresses the anxieties of American working families, \nand it begins to move us in the right direction. It fights against the \nwrong-headedness of Republican policies that have downsized the \nAmerican dream and shifted wealth to the top 10 percent of Americans.\n  It is time to begin the shift back at least enough to protect hard \nworking families from the extreme political agenda of the Republicans \nin Congress. So, this proposal is a hedge against the incredible odds \nthat working families face every day in meeting the bills for health \ncare, education, and a decent retirement. It is a hedge against \nstagnant wages, and it is a challenge to businesses to be good \ncorporate citizens, and to build a family friendly workplace so that, \ntogether, we can build a better stronger American economy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FORD (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1686. A bill to provide for early deferred annuities under chapter \n83 of Title 5, United States Code, for certain former Department of \nDefense employees who are separated from service by reason of certain \ndefense base closures, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n        defense privatization and worker protection legislation\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this country has undergone tremendous \nchanges over the last few years as a result of military downsizing and \nbase closures. Making the transition has proved very difficult to \ncommunities all across the country and today, in an effort to ease that \ntransition, I am introducing legislation with original cosponsors \nSenators Coats, Lugar, Hutchinson, and McConnell directed at specific \nproblems we've seen with privatization of these bases.\n  I know many of my colleagues are aware of the job loss that results \nfrom downsizing. That is because many jobs have become obsolete or \nredundant. But, there's also a whole other category of affected \nemployees, whose skills and expertise are still needed by the military \nin the same roles, but in new privatized facilities. Under the 1995 \nBase Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), these employees are \nstill eligible to work for the Federal Government and receive a Federal \npension.\n  However, this would defeat one of our major goals in privatization--\nto save the taxpayer money. The idea under privatization is to continue \nutilizing these workers' much-needed skills, but in the private sector, \nat a reduced cost to the taxpayer. Yet, by sending these workers out \ninto the private sector, we are asking a huge portion of them to give \nup their retirement benefits.\n  These workers are in a catch-22. If they move into the privatized \nfacilities, where they would be performing the same mission and jobs as \nthey had as Federal employees, they lose hard-earned pensions. If they \nremain in the Federal Government, they could face lower paying \npositions, while the community loses those workers altogether.\n  With little incentive to move into the private sector, these \nemployees could create a vacuum that private contractors are unable to \nfill. Under that scenario everyone loses: Highly skilled workers will \nbe underemployed and underpaid. Private contractors won't be able to \nmeet the challenge of taking over government facilities. And the \ntaxpayer will foot the $390 million cost-avoidance bill the Navy \nestimates the government faces if they have to keep these workers on \nthe payroll and deal with the failure of privatization.\n  This problem was brought to my attention when the Louisville Naval \nOrdnance Station began the process of privatization, where unlike other \nbase closings, moving the work would be a far greater cost than \nprivatizing. But, it is a problem faced by workers in the same \nsituation all across the country.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to provide a deferred \nannuity for those Department of Defense employees who are targeted for \nprivatization, but stand to lose their benefits under the Civil Service \nRetirement System (CSRS). With this legislation, we can make good on \nthe promise our Government made with these employees when they entered \nGovernment Service, and assure private contractors that a skilled work \nforce will be available to them when they assume control of former \nDefense Department facilities.\n\n  Most Federal employees hired before 1984 participate in the CSRS, \nwhile workers hired after 1984 belong to the Federal Employees \nRetirement System (FERS). Unlike CSRS, FERS is a portable plan, \nallowing a Federal employee to move between Federal and non-federal \nemployment, without significantly penalizing the accrual of Federal \nbenefits. Unfortunately, CSRS participants do not enjoy this same \nflexibility, because CSRS is a single component defined benefit plan.\n  Because CSRS-covered employees are forced to separate from Federal \nemployment before they're eligible for an immediate annuity, they see \ntheir federal retirement benefits lose considerable value. And, \nemployees who withdraw their retirement contribution not only forfeit \nall benefits, but also cost the government money up front.\n  I think we can all agree that privatization is a key component of \nreorganizing our defense priorities in this post-cold-war era of \nmilitary downsizing. But, I believe my legislation is critical to \nensuring that privatization works.\n  It can accomplish these goals by providing a deferred annuity with \nindexing pension benefits for CSRS Department of Defense employees. \nTheir positions will be immediately transferred to contractors assuming \nthe workload designated for privatization. In this way we can provide a \nvery restricted, but common sense way of keeping our military \ninfrastructure running smoothly as we embark on military \nprivatization's maiden voyage.\n  And perhaps equally important, my legislation sends a clear message \nto this work force that their loyalty and dedication did not go \nunnoticed. These workers provided our men and women in uniform with the \nfinest maintenance, supply and logistics system in the world. The best \nway we can repay this commitment to excellence is to uphold the Federal \nGovernment's end of the contract made when these workers first entered \nGovernment Service. That's in the workers' best interest and in the \nbest interest of the Nation.\n  I would also like at this time to thank Mrs. Carolyn Merk of the \nCongressional Research Service for her outstanding professional work in \nhelping craft this legislation that we're introducing today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(2)(A) This paragraph applies to the compensation of an \n     annuity of a transferred employee who retires in accordance \n     with this section who immediately before separation from \n     Federal service as described under subsection (a)(6)(A) was a \n     prevailing rate employee as defined under section 5342(2) of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (B) In the computation of an annuity referred to under \n     subparagraph (A) for a transferred employee, average pay \n     under section 8331(4) of title 5, United States Code, shall \n     be adjusted at the same time and by the same percentage that \n     pay rates for positions that are in the same area as, and are \n     comparable to, the last position the transferred employee \n     held as a prevailing rate employee, are increased under \n     section 5343(a) of such title during the period beginning on \n     the date on which the transferred employee separates from \n     Federal service as described

(f) Lump-Sum Credit Payment.--If a transferred employee \n     dies before attaining early deferred retirement age, such \n     employee shall be treated as a former employee who dies not \n     retired for purposes of payment of the lump-sum credit under \n     section 8342(d) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (g) Implementing Regulations.--The Office of Personnel \n     Management

Issue\n\n\n                                 issue\n\n       The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission \n     recommended the privatization of certain military facilities. \n     The President has directed the Air Force to privatize two Air \n     Force logistic centers. For privatization to succeed, the \n     maintenance of an experienced workforce is critical. \n     Retirement benefits have become recognized as a major \n     impediment to the privatization of the Louisville and \n     Indianapolis Navy facilities and other Department of Defense \n     (DOD) facilities.\n       Without legislation to protect their retirement benefits \n     many employees will--and are--transferring to other Federal \n     positions to maintain and protect their retirement benefits \n     under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).\n       If many key employees transfer within the Government rather \n     than work for a private sector contractor, privatization \n     savings to the Government may not be fully realized. The \n     Department of the Navy estimates that privatization of \n     Louisville and Indianapolis would provide up to $390 million \n     in ``cost avoidance'' to the Government. Unlike other Base \n     closings, the cost to the Federal government to close and \n     move the work at Louisville and Indianapolis is far greater \n     than the cost of privatization. The retention of the Federal \n     employees at these facilities is essential to the private \n     contractor.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The 1995 BRAC Commission directed privatization of two Navy \n     facilities with a large federal workforce, the Naval Surface \n     Warfare Center, Louisville, Kentucky and the Naval Surface \n     Warfare Center, Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, President \n     Clinton directed the Air Force to try and privatize two Air \n     Force logistic centers, one in Texas and one in California \n     which were ordered to be closed by the 1995 BRAC.\n       These Federal employees are different from other employees \n     adversely affected by downsizing. The key difference is that \n     these employees are not being separated because their \n     services are no longer needed or because the work they \n     accomplished is redundant or unnecessary. Under the BRAC \n     ``Close and Move'' scenario, these employees would have been \n     eligible to continue their Federal employment (and qualify \n     for an annuity) at another federal installation. These \n     employees are expected to continue accomplishing the same \n     mission as before, but they will be working as private sector \n     employees.\n       Most Federal employees hired before 1984 currently \n     participate in the CSRS. Those workers hired after 1984 \n     participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System \n     (FERS). FERS is different than CSRS because it is a portable \n     plan that allows a Federal employee to move between Federal \n     and non-federal employment. In doing so, the accrual of \n     Federal benefits is not significantly penalized.\n       However, employees under CSRS have no portability because \n     it is a single component defined benefit plan. Therefore, \n     when CSRS-COVERED workers are forced to separate from Federal \n     employment before they are eligible for an immediate annuity, \n     their retirement benefits lose considerable value. Employees \n     who lose their Federal position and withdraw their retirement \n     contribution early will forfeit all benefits from the Federal \n     government and thereby are not eligible for a pension.\n       Employees with the most experience tend to be covered under \n     CSRS. These are the employees the contractor taking over the \n     work at a government facility considers to be very valuable. \n     For example, 46% of the employees at the Louisville Naval \n     Surface Warfare Center are covered by CSRS and are not \n     eligible for retirement. Many of these employees, and those \n     in Indiana, Texas and California who are highly skilled, are \n     seeking to transfer to other Federal positions. Some are even \n     accepting lower paid positions within DOD so they may \n     maintain their CSRS retirement benefits. As a result, there \n     is little incentive for CSRS employees to accept positions \n     with the private contractor. Therefore, the privatization of \n     Federal facilities could fail at a significant cost to the \n     Government and the U.S. taxpayers.\n\n\n                          Legislative remedy:\n\n       To rectify the CSRS issue, the attached draft legislation \n     proposes to index a deferred\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\n     annuity for certain DOD CSRS Employees. The legislation would \n     address the issue of CSRS employees receiving a retirement \n     benefit by:\n       Indexing the average pay on which the annuity is computed, \n     and\n       Allowing a Federal deferred annuity to be paid to specific \n     CSRS employees at the individuals optional retirement age.\n       The legislation will apply only to Transferred Employees of \n     the Department of Defense. A Transferred Employee is one \n     whose job is privatized pursuant to a 1995 decision of the \n     BRAC Commission and pursuant to a President directive \n     privatizing a base to be closed by the 1995 BRAC. This \n     indexedial deferred annuity will be available only to \n     individuals participating in CSRS, and not to those \n     participating in FERS. The proposed legislation will apply to \n     only those CSRS employees who are ineligible to retire and \n     who accept work with the private contractor. They will be \n     ineligible for severance pay.\n       Reasons for legislation:\n       At this time there are no administrative remedies.\n       Treats employees equitably and thus stabilizes the work \n     force for privatization.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1687. A bill to provide for annual payments from the surplus funds \nof the Federal Reserve System to cover the interest on obligations \nissued by the Financing Corporation; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                The Federal Reserve Surplus Act of 1996\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing the Federal Reserve \nSurplus Act of 1996 to provide a solution to an impending crisis in our \nfinancial services industry, and to avoid once again having to use \ntaxpayers' money to bail out another round of S failures. I am happy \nto join my colleague in the House, Congressman Barney Frank as well as \nother members of the Massachusetts delegation, Congressmen Joe Kennedy, \nMarty Meehan, and Richard Neal, who introduced the companion bill in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  This bill will ease the obligation remaining from the savings and \nloan crisis of the 1980's with a creative approach that does not burden \nthe banking institutions or taxpayers, but uses an existing $3.7 \nbillion fund at the Federal Reserve. The GAO tells us that because the \nFederal Reserve's interest income so far exceeds its expenses, we \nbelieve it is highly unlikely the System will ever incur sufficient \nannual losses such that it would be required to use any funds in the \nsurplus account.\n  Savings and loans are required to pay almost $800 million per year in \ninterest on financing corporation bonds which were sold to cover \ndepositor claims on S's that failed in the 1980's. This legislation \nwould use $3 billion from the Federal Reserve's surplus fund as a \ncontribution toward the payment of the FICO interest obligation. This \nwould leave about $1 billion in the fund.\n  It is generally believed, within the financial community, as \nCongressman Frank has said, that ``continuing to require the savings \nand loans to pay the entire FICO interest obligation would worsen the \ndisparity between what banks must pay to such a degree as to risk \ndefault by the SAIF, which would ultimately result in a further drain \non the Treasury.''\n  Mr. President, this just makes sense. The Federal Reserve is \ncontrolling a fund with no specific purpose--paid in by banks--and the \nCongress should turn to this fund first before asking bankers in this \ncountry to bear the burden of recapitalizing the savings association \ninsurance fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRANSFER OF FEDERAL RESERVE SURPLUS FUNDS TO MEET \n                   FICO CARRYING COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7(a) of the Federal Reserve Act \n     (12 U.S.C. 289) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) FICO payments.--\n       ``(A) In general.--During the period beginning on the date \n     of enactment of the Federal Reserve Surplus Act of 1996 and \n     ending on the date on which the Financing Corporation ceases \n     to have any obligations outstanding under section 21(e) of \n     the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, the Board shall annually \n     transfer (in addition to the transfers of funds required \n     under paragraph (3)) to the Financing Corporation, from \n     amounts in the surplus funds of the Federal reserve banks, an \n     amount equal to $3,000,000,000 divided by the number of \n     calendar years any portion of which falls within such period \n     for use in accordance with section 21(f)(1) of the Federal \n     Home Loan Bank Act.\n       ``(B) Allocation.--The Board shall annually determine, on \n     the basis of such factors as the Board considers appropriate, \n     the manner in which the amount of the obligation of the Board \n     under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among the surplus \n     funds of the Federal reserve banks.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 21(f) \n     of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441(f)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Federal reserve surplus.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Amounts transferred to the Financing \n     Corporation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System from the surplus funds of the Federal reserve banks in \n     accordance with section 7(a)(4) of the Federal Reserve Act.\n       ``(B) Treatment in case of bank insurance fund member \n     assessments.--To the extent Bank Insurance Fund members (as \n     defined in section 7(l)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act) are subject to any assessments under this subsection, \n     the total amount of such assessments which, but for this \n     subparagraph, would be imposed on all such members for any \n     year shall be reduced by the transferred amount referred to \n     in subparagraph (A) with respect to such year.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Abraham, Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun, Mr. Murkowski, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Helms, Mr. Roth, Mr. \n        Santorum, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S.J. Res. 51. A joint resolution saluting and congratulating Polish \npeople around the world as, on May 3, 1996, they commemorate the 205th \nanniversary of the adoption of Poland's first constitution; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  poland constitution 205th anniversary commemoration joint resolution\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a joint resolution \nwhich salutes and congratulates Polish people around the world on the \noccasion of the 205th anniversary of the Polish Constitution. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Simon, Abraham, Moseley-Braun, \nMurkowski, Mikulski, Helms, Roth, Santorum, and Lugar. This resolution \nis being introduced today in the House by Congressman Jack Quinn of New \nYork and a number of bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Poland is one of America's oldest and closest friends. Many of its \nsons and daughters have crossed the ocean to our shores over the past \n200 years. Indeed, from the very birth of our great nation we have \nbenefited from the talent and dedication of the Polish people. When we \nfought for our independence, Thaddeus Kosciuszko--a native son of \nPoland--fought alongside General Washington. Today, memorials to \nKosciuszko's courage, military skill, and genuine friendship, can be \nfound in our Capital and in many cities across the United States.\n  Following the War of Independence, Kosciuszko carried back to Poland \nthe American concept of constitutional democracy. Poland's 1791 \nConstitution was the first constitution in Central and Eastern Europe \nto secure individual and religious freedom for all persons. It also \nformed a government much like ours, composed of distinct legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial powers. I would like to quote from the Polish \nConstitution which declares, ``All power in civil society should be \nderived from the will of the people.''\n\n  Tragically, this Constitution was only in effect for less than 2 \nyears. However, its principles endured for 2 centuries. And over the \nlast 5 years--since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact--Poland has \nfinally realized the promise of freedom and democracy held in the 1791 \nConstitution.\n  So, on May 3, 1996, when the citizens of Poland celebrate the 205th \nanniversary of the adoption of Poland's first Constitution, we want \nthem to know that the United States Congress shares in their \ncelebration. No doubt, all across our 50 States, Polish-Americans will \nbe celebrating and taking pride in their rich heritage. This joint \nresolution salutes and congratulates all Polish people, wherever they \nmay now reside, on this great and historic occasion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 51\n\n       Whereas, on May 3, 1996, Polish people around the world, \n     including Americans of Polish decent, will celebrate the \n     205th anniversary of the adoption of the first Polish \n     constitution;\n       Whereas American Revolutionary War hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko \n     introduced the concept of constitutional democracy to his \n     native country of Poland;\n       Whereas the Polish constitution of 1791 was the first \n     liberal constitution in Europe and represented Central-\n     Eastern Europe's first attempt to end the feudal system of \n     government;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution was designed to protect \n     Poland's sovereignty and national unity and to create a \n     progressive constitutional monarchy;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution was the first constitution \n     in Central-Eastern Europe to secure individual and religious \n     freedom for all persons in Poland;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution formed a government \n     composed of distinct legislative, executive, and judicial \n     powers;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution declared that ``all power \n     in civil society should be derived from the will of the \n     people'';\n       Whereas this Polish constitution revitalized the \n     parliamentary system by placing preeminent lawmaking power in \n     the House of Deputies, by subjecting the Sejm to majority \n     rule, and by granting the Sejm the power to remove ministers, \n     appoint commissars, and choose magistrates;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution provided for significant \n     economic, social, and political reforms by removing \n     inequalities between the nobility and the bourgeoisie, by \n     recognizing town residents as ``freemen'' who had judicial \n     autonomy and expanded rights, and by extending the protection \n     of the law to the peasantry who previously had no recourse \n     against the arbitrary actions of feudal lords;\n       Whereas, although this Polish constitution was in effect \n     for less than 2 years, its principles endured and it became \n     the symbol around which a powerful new national consciousness \n     was born, helping Poland to survive long periods of \n     misfortune over the following 2 centuries; and\n       Whereas, in only the last 5 years, Poland has realized the \n     promise held in the Polish constitution of 1791, has emerged \n     as an independent nation after its people led the movement \n     that resulted in historic changes in Central-Eastern \n     Europe, and is moving toward full integration with the \n     Euro-Atlantic community of nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That--\n       (1) the people of the United States salute and congratulate \n     Polish people around the world, including Americans of Polish \n     descent, as on May 3, 1996, they commemorate the 205th \n     anniversary of the adoption of the first Polish constitution;\n       (2) the people of the United States recognize Poland's \n     rebirth as a free and independent nation in the spirit of the \n     legacy of the Polish constitution of 1791; and\n       (3) the Congress authorizes and urges the President of the \n     United States to call upon the Governors of the States, the \n     leaders of local governments, and the people of the United \n     States to observe this anniversary with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. Simon, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nJeffords, and Mr. Pell) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 248\n\n       Whereas, the war in Liberia begun in 1989 has devastated \n     that country, with more than 150,000 people killed, up to 1 \n     million forced to flee as refugees to neighboring countries, \n     and thousands of children conscripted into the rebel armies;\n       Whereas, the Abuja Accords signed in August 1995 \n     represented the most realistic path for lasting peace;\n       Whereas, the Senate passed a resolution on September 20, \n     1995, expressing the sense of the Congress that the United \n     States should strongly support the peace process in Liberia, \n     including support for the west African peacekeeping force;\n       Whereas the U.S. committed $10 million in support for the \n     west African peacekeeping force, but has delivered only $5.5 \n     million, most of which arrived only in February 1996;\n       Whereas, the peacekeeping force has fewer than 6,000 \n     soldiers, but needs over 15,000 to carry out its mission;\n       Whereas, violence characterized by massive looting, \n     shelling, and ethnic hostilities broke out in Monrovia on \n     April 6, 1996, forcing tens of thousands of people into \n     hiding, without food and water, halting most humanitarian \n     assistance programs in Liberia, and signifying a failure of \n     the west African peacekeeping force to maintain order and \n     stability in Monrovia;\n       Whereas, 214 U.S. armed forces and 1400 support personnel \n     have been deployed to Liberia to facilitate the successful \n     evacuation of approximately 1800 people, including over 300 \n     Americans, from Liberia;\n       Whereas, while the U.S. is the only functioning diplomatic \n     mission in Monrovia, some nations, such as Japan, have \n     continuing economic concerns in Liberia and other nations, \n     such as France, have national interests in western Africa; \n     and\n       Whereas, negotiations for a ceasefire and the peaceful \n     release of hostages are being led by Ghanian Kojo Tsikata, \n     and Cote D'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and others are trying to use \n     their influence to moderate combatants.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, that the Senate\n       (1) commends the U.S. Armed Forces and the U.S. Embassy \n     personnel for the successful evacuation of over 1795 people \n     from Liberia;\n       (2) declares that a breakdown of the Abuja process would \n     have disastrous humanitarian ramifications and seriously \n     threaten other U.S. interests in west Africa;\n       (3) calls upon all factions to reach a ceasefire and re-\n     commit themselves to the Abuja process; and\n       (4) urges the Administration to:\n       a. scrutinize the Federal budget to identify funds that \n     could be either re-programmed or transferred and used to \n     support additional non-Nigerian West African peacekeepers;\n       b. consider the provision of excess defense articles for \n     communications and logistical support and training for crowd-\n     control techniques for non-Nigerian troops to participate \n     effectively in a west African peacekeeping force;\n       c. use its influence with other nations with interests in \n     Liberia to solicit further support for west African \n     peacekeeping forces, including their participation at the \n     April 26 meeting of a newly-formed Contact Group in Liberia; \n     and\n       d. lead efforts in the United Nations to activate a \n     Commission in the United Nations to develop an implementation \n     plan and sanctions against those parties violating the U.N. \n     arms embargo on Liberia.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today on \nbehalf of myself, and Senators Kassebaum, Simon, Leahy, Jeffords, and \nPell, which includes proposals for United States action in support of \nthe Liberian peace process.

SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE CONCERNING MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Committee on Labor and Human Resources \n     of the Senate finds that the Public Trustees of Medicare \n     concluded in their 1995 Annual Report that--\n       (1) the Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form;\n       (2) ``the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays \n     inpatient hospital expenses, will be able to pay benefits for \n     only about 7 years and is severely out of financial balance \n     in the long range''; and\n       (3) the Public Trustees ``strongly recommend that the \n     crisis presented by the financial condition of the Medicare \n     trust fund be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis, \n     including a review of the programs's financing methods, \n     benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms''.\n       (b) Sense of the Committee.--It is the Sense of the \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate that the \n     Senate should take measures necessary to reform the Medicare \n     program, to provide increased choice for seniors, and to \n     respond to the findings of the Public Trustees by protecting \n     the short-term solvency and long-term sustainability of the \n     Medicare program.\n\n     SEC. 304.

SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act or the application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance is held to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the \n     application of the provisions of such to any person\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\n     or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  DOLE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3676\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Roth, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Lott, \nMr. Craig, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \nGregg, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Grams, and Mr. \nWarner) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 3675 proposed by Mrs. \nKassebaum to the bill S. 1028, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new titles:\n                TITLE IV--TAX-RELATED HEALTH PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 400.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE \n                   COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health care coverage of mothers and children in the \n     United States is unacceptable, with more than 9,300,000 \n     children and 500,000 expectant mothers having no health \n     insurance.\n       (2) Among industrial nations, the United States ranks 1st \n     in wealth but 18th in infant mortality, and 14th among such \n     nations in maternal mortality.\n       (3) 22 percent of pregnant women do not have prenatal care \n     in the first trimester, and 22 percent of all poor children \n     are uninsured, despite the medicaid program under title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act.\n       (4) Of the 1,100,000 net increase in uninsured persons from \n     1992 to 1993, 84 percent or 922,500 were children.\n       (5) Since 1987, the number of children covered by \n     employment based health insurance has decreased, and many \n     children lack health insurance despite the relative \n     affordability of providing insurance for children.\n       (6) Health care coverage for children is relatively \n     inexpensive and in 1993 the medicaid program spent an average \n     of $1,012 per child compared to $8,220 per elderly adult.\n       (7) Uninsured children are generally children of lower \n     income workers, who are less likely than higher income \n     workers to have\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\n     health insurance for their families because they are less \n     likely to work for a firm that offers insurance, and if \n     such insurance is offered, it is often too costly for \n     lower income workers to purchase.\n       (8) In 1993, 61 percent of uninsured children were in \n     families with at least one parent working full time for the \n     entire year the child was uninsured, and about 57 percent of \n     uninsured children had a family income at or below 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level.\n       (9) If Congress eliminates the Federal guarantee of \n     Medicaid, an estimated 4,900,000 children may lose their \n     guarantee of health care coverage, and those same children \n     may be added to the currently projected 12,600,000 children \n     who will be uninsured by the year 2002.\n       (10) Studies have shown that uninsured children are less \n     likely than insured children to receive needed health and \n     preventive care, which can affect their health status \n     adversely throughout their lives, with such children less \n     likely to have routine doctor visits, receive care for \n     injuries, and have a regular source of medical care.\n       (11) The families of uninsured children are more likely to \n     take the children to an emergency room than to a private \n     physician or health maintenance organization.\n       (12) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n     be appropriately immunized or receive other preventive care \n     for childhood illnesses.\n       (13) Ensuring the health of children clearly increases \n     their chances to become productive members of society and \n     averts more serious or more expensive health conditions later \n     in life, and ensuring that all pregnant women receive \n     competent prenatal care also saves social costs.\n       (14) Although the United States has made great improvements \n     in health care coverage through the Medicaid program, it is \n     still the only developed nation that does not ensure that all \n     of its children and pregnant women have health care coverage.\n       (15) The United States should not accept a status quo in \n     which children in many neighborhoods are more likely to have \n     access to drugs and guns than to doctors, or accept a status \n     quo in which health care is ensured for all prisoners but not \n     for all children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the issue of adequate health care for our mothers and \n     children is important to the future of the United States, and \n     in consideration of the importance of such issue, the \n     Senate should pass health care legislation in the 105th \n     Congress that will ensure health care coverage for all of \n     the United States's pregnant women and children.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 DORGAN (AND FRIST) AMENDMENT NO. 3688\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for Mr. Dorgan, for himself and Mr. Frist) proposed an \namendment to the bill S. 1028, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3.

The management and \ncontrol of information are increasingly critical to every industry, \nbusiness and government agency, and the systematic creation, \ndistribution, storage and retrieval of records are of critical \nimportance to the continued and efficient operation of any good \norganization.\n  The organizations that excel today and tomorrow will be those \nrecognizing information as a major resource and structuring it as \nefficiently as they do their assets. An effective records management \nprogram assures the availability of information as a basis for sound \ndecisionmaking by providing security and control against loss by \nmismanagement, natural disaster, theft or inadvertent destruction. All \nAmericans should recognize the significant and important role that \nrecords management professionals render in maintaining appropriate \nbusiness, civic, and government records. I commend businesses such as \nARMA International who have brought National Records and Information \nManagement Day to my attention and wish them every success as they \neducate the business community regarding the importance of records \nmanagement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3680-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EARTH DAY/ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF DETROIT\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

The city of Detroit on Earth Day/Arbor \nDay, Monday, April 22, 1996, is holding a ceremony kicking off a week \nlong program to plant trees in parks around the city.\n  For its tree planting efforts, Detroit, for the ninth time, has been \nnamed a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation. Detroit \nrecognizes the importance that trees play in not only making our \ncommunities more attractive, but by providing tremendous environmental \nbenefits as well. Trees produce oxygen, help clean the air, provide a \nhabitat for wildlife and provide humankind with great visual beauty.\n  The city of Detroit recognizes the importance of tree planting and is \ncommitted to the continuation of its exemplary reforestation programs. \nI am proud of the efforts of my home city and I ask that my colleagues \njoin me in congratulating the city of Detroit. \n\n\n                         the antiterrorism bill\n\n Mr. MACK.

Kennedy Journalism \nAward for outstanding coverage of the problems of the disadvantaged. \nMr. Jessmore won the award in the photojournalism category for his \nphoto essay, ``Blind Faith.''\n  ``Blind Faith'' follows the life of Carl, a yellow labrador retriever \npuppy raised by a Carrolton Township elementary school class. Carl was \ntrained as a leader dog for the blind and eventually placed with a \nvisually impaired man in Kansas City, MO.\n  Judges for the Kennedy award included journalists from the Washington \nPost, Knight Ridder, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and NBC. ``Blind \nFaith'' has also won the national Lincoln University of Missouri 43d \nAnnual Unity Awards in Media, as well as several other awards in State, \nregional, and national contests.\n  ``Blind Faith'' marks the first time that someone has followed the \nstory of a leader dog since 1939, when the Rochester-based nonprofit \norganization that trained Carl was founded. The photos from ``Blind \nFaith'' will now be permanently on display in the Robert F. Kennedy \ncollection of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.\n  On hearing that he had won the award, Jessmore said, ``I'm real happy \nthat so many other people get to see it now, because it's such a \ntremendous, positive story--kids learning early how to help other \npeople.''\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Steve Jessmore for \nhis outstanding work in the field of photojournalism. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3680-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3680-S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION\n\n Mr. GLENN.

Because I thought it \nwas a poor use of the taxpayer's money, I voted against the original \nresolution and had the current resolution been brought to a rollcall \nvote, I would have voted to discontinue proceedings dealing with \nWhitewater.\n  The Whitewater investigation duplicates the ongoing independent \ncounsel's investigation and wastes the limited time we have left in \nthis session to pass important legislation. The independent counsel has \nfull authority and budget to continue the investigation as long as he \nthinks is practicable. Calling an end to the Senate Whitewater\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\ninvestigation only stops the duplication of investigations, neither of \nwhich have so far resulted in anything of substance.\n  The current resolution extends the committee's deadline until June 14 \nand will cost the taxpayer's an additional $480,000. I believe this \ninvestigation could have been completed by the original promised \ndeadline of February 29.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3680-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SAGINAW HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, much has happened in the year \nsince this bill left the Senate. Oklahoma City has begun the healing \nprocess from the senseless violence it suffered at the hands of a \nterrorist bomber. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed by a \nterrorist. Terrorism in the Middle East, against subway riders in Tokyo \nand elsewhere have reminded us of the vulnerability of free societies \nto this kind of senseless violence. The unabomber's reign of terror has \napparently been brought to an end by the FBI. And the antiterrorism \nbill that left this Senate has come back, in some ways, a better bill: \nIt is less invasive of civil liberties when it comes to eavesdropping \nby Federal agents, and it prevents defendants from being deported based \nonly on evidence they are not allowed to understand.\n  What happened to Rabin shows us all that terrorism is not going away. \nWhat may have been a success in stopping the unabomber shows that the \nFederal Government can fight back. I support this bill because I \nrecognize that terrorism is a threat that puts all our lives at risk, \nand that we must bolster national antiterrorism efforts, including by \nproviding to law enforcement and the courts new tools to combat cutting \nedge technologies of violence and increasingly bold villains, in order \nto stem the tide of destruction.\n  I have made it clear that I do not support everything in this bill. I \nvoted against the Senate bill last year largely because of its broad \nhabeas corpus provisions, which will limit Federal court review in \ndeath penalty cases. I am also opposed to this bill's provisions to \nweaken protections for refugees and asylees fleeing persecution in \nother countries which has nothing to do with antiterrorism efforts. \nWhile I am still profoundly opposed to these provisions, I have \nconcluded that on balance this bill should pass.\n  There is much in this bill that is good, that will address concerns \nMinnesotans have expressed to me. This bill will make a real difference \nin the fight against terrorism. It includes many necessary changes to \nour Federal criminal laws. It will make it a Federal crime to plan or \nto carry out terrorist attacks in the United States. It will make it a \nFederal crime to plan terrorist attacks in the United States, even if \nthe attacks are carried out overseas. It includes increased penalties \nfor conspiracies involving explosives. It will make it easier to detect \nplastic explosives, and to track chemicals of which most bombs are \ncomposed. It will make it harder for terrorist groups to raise funds in \nthe United States. It provides mandatory restitution for victims of \nterrorist acts. It will help prevent the sale of arms to terrorist \nstates by third parties. And it expands the authority of government \nofficials to deal with threats posed by chemical, biological, and \nnuclear technologies, involving deadly nuclear materials.\n  While I did not agree with every aspect of the 1994 crime bill I \nsupported it because I concluded that, on balance, it contained many \neffective provisions to fight crime and violence. By the same token \nthis is a bill that on balance can make an impact against terrorism.\n  I voted against provisions in this bill that I fiercely opposed, and \nsupported many changes that were not agreed to. The President and \nMembers of both parties on both sides of Capitol Hill have nearly \nunanimously come together in this statement against destruction and \nviolence. Because this bill successfully addresses a threat that \nendangers all of us and because a unified effort makes a strong \nstatement and therefore my voice can help make it stronger, I join my \ncolleagues in its support. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3681-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COL.

Mr. President, as the Senate continues to debate \nour proper budget priorities, I have noted the presence of a number of \ninaccurate arguments. These arguments, in my opinion, are distracting \nus from the central question of how our taxing and spending policies \naffect middle-class Americans. Particularly worrisome to me are \ninaccurate views concerning the historical performance of tax cuts, and \ntheir impact on middle-class income in particular. Specifically, some \nare arguing that tax cuts in the 1980's produced lower incomes for our \nmiddle class, and saddled them with a larger percentage of total tax \nreceipts.\n  In an attempt to focus debate more effectively on questions of what \nwill and will not work for the American people, I would like to have \ninserted into the Record an article of mine, published recently in The \nWorld & I. In this article I set forth my view of the real effect of \ntax cuts in the 1980's. As published, the article is accompanied by \nspirited responses and defenses from several distinguished observers, \nincluding Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, Michael Meeropol \nof the Center for Popular Economics, Bruce Bartlett of the National \nCenter for Policy Analysis, Norman B. Ture of the Institute for \nResearch on the Economics of Taxation, and Paul M. Weyrich of the Free \nCongress Foundation.\n  I argue that the pro-growth and pro-family tax policies of the 1980's \ncontributed significantly to the prosperity of America's middle-class \nfamilies. In\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\naddition, I point out that tax cuts produce lower, not higher, deficits \nand that tax cuts help the middle class and poor more than the rich. \nNot all the respondents agreed completely with my argument. But I \nbelieve the article can help all of us form more useful, coherent \narguments as we face the budget challenges ahead.\n  The article follows:\n\n                            The Real 1980's\n\n                          (By Spencer Abraham)\n\n       The debate over the budget is becoming a debate over the \n     1980s. Opponents of tax cuts and spending restraints are \n     claiming that these policies wreaked havoc when tried before \n     under Ronald Reagan. The policies of the 1980s, in this view, \n     hurt American families and the American economy, and so \n     should not be repeated.\n       To answer this criticism, one must explode three \n     interrelated myths that are exercising undue influence over \n     the budget debate today:\n       The progrowth and profamily tax policies of the 1980s \n     actually hurt America's middleclass families.\n       Tax cuts necessarily increase the budget deficit.\n       Tax cuts disproportionately benefit the rich at the expense \n     of the middle class and poor.\n       Using these myths, defenders of the status quo paint \n     reformers as heartless friends of rich people and enemies of \n     the poor and middle class. By exploding them, we can return \n     the focus of our budget debate to the question of how best to \n     reform tax and spending policies for the benefit of all \n     Americans. But to do this, we must reestablish the truth \n     about how our nation's middle class really fared under the \n     low-tax, limited-government policies of the 1980s.\n\n\n                               myth no. 1\n\n       The claim that middle-class families suffered under \n     conservative reforms is based on an inaccurate representation \n     of the income data. For example, opponents of reform have \n     said over and over that household income fell over a 15-year \n     period, from $38,248 in 1979 to $36,959 in 1993, and that \n     this decline was the direct result of the policies of Ronald \n     Reagan and the Republicans. They wield a frightening graph, \n     much like figure 1.\n       But the graph does not reflect reality. These 15 years did \n     not constitute one monolithic era of Republican policy \n     dominance. Rather, they included two periods characterized by \n     overtaxation and overregulation (1979-81 and 1990-93) and one \n     period (1982-89) during which Republican policies of lower \n     taxes and less regulation were in place. An accurate \n     portrayal of this overall period would look like figure 2.\n       In truth, this 15-year period consists of one era of \n     middle-class prosperity under low-tax, limited-government \n     policies and two eras of middle-class pain under policies of \n     high taxes and increased regulation. Americans had 8 years of \n     improvement in middle-class incomes from 1982 to 1989. \n     Unfortunately for the middle class, the periods from 1979 to \n     1981 and 1990 to 1993 were dominated by overtaxation and \n     overregulation, policies that resulted in declines in middle-\n     class incomes.\n       Opponents of reform attempt to paint Ronald Reagan's low-\n     tax, limited-government policies as harmful by treating the \n     1979-93 period as if all of it were in the Reagan era. They \n     wrongly imply that Reagan was president and Republicans were \n     in control throughout this period.\n       On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the first 3 of \n     the 15 years were under high-tax and heavy regulatory \n     policies. It is also clear that, during this first period, \n     real median family income fell precipitously from over \n     $38,000 to under $36,000, for a total loss of over $2,500, \n     according to Census Bureau data. In fact, one of the \n     sharpest declines in median family income on record \n     occurred in the year 1980.\n       As anyone with a working knowledge of the calendar and even \n     a passing interest in American politics Knows, Ronald Reagan \n     was not president in 1979 or 1980. Jimmy Carter was. Further, \n     Republicans controlled the Senate for only the first 6 years \n     of Reagan's tenure.\n       What is more, Republicans did not control the House of \n     Representatives at any time during this 15-year period. \n     Democrats were in charge the entire time. And, in 1979 and \n     1980, they controlled both the legislature and the \n     presidency.\n       Yet opponents of lower taxes and slower spending growth \n     almost always include 1979 and 1980, the last years of the \n     Carter era, in describing the impact of the Reagan \n     administration's conservative tax and regulatory reforms. But \n     no matter how much one opposes tax cutting and deregulation, \n     it is difficult to argue that these policies, pursued under \n     Ronald Reagan and the GOP in 1981 and beyond, were bad enough \n     to cause income declines in the years before they were \n     implemented.\n       Unlike the 1993 Clinton income tax increases, many of which \n     were implemented retroactively, the 1981 Reagan economic \n     policies did not take effect until the middle of 1982. And \n     what happened after these policies went into effect in 1982? \n     As anyone can see from figure 2, real, postinflation median \n     family income in the United States rose between 1982 and \n     1990, from $35,419 to $39,086, for an increase of 10.4 \n     percent.\n\n\n                       cold water on the economy\n\n       But in 1990, the Democratic majority in Congress began \n     insisting that tax-revenue increases had to be part of any \n     effort to reduce the budget deficit. The result was the \n     budget summit deal of 1990.\n       After that, again shown in figure 2, we saw a different \n     pattern. Between 1990 and 1993, median family income \n     plummeted 5.4 percent, from $39,086 to $36,959. The most \n     severe drop in middle-class income began in 1993, the year \n     the Clinton retroactive tax increases took effect. In that \n     year, there was a remarkable $709 (1.9 percent) plunge in \n     real median family income.\n       So what conclusion should we reach? The answer seems clear: \n     Republican economic and tax policies helped the middle class. \n     Thus, to get middle-class incomes moving upward again, we \n     should return to the low-tax, deregulatory policies of the \n     1980s. These policies produced one of the most dramatic \n     increases in middle-class incomes in the last 30 years.\n       Nineteen million new jobs were created between 1982 and \n     1989--2.4 million in 1989 alone. And 82 percent of these jobs \n     were in higher-paying occupations: technical, precision \n     production, and managerial and professional. Clearly then, \n     tax cuts helped the middle class in the best way possible, by \n     producing economic opportunity and good jobs.\n       This brings us to a subset of the first myth: that the rich \n     got richer and the poor got poorer during the 1980s. Once \n     again, this claim is unsubstantiated by the facts. First, let \n     us look at a graph (fig. 3) that surfaced during the economic \n     policy debate.\n       According to this figure, the 15 years between 1979 and \n     1993 produced:\n       A 15 percent decline in real family income for the bottom \n     20 percent of America taxpayers.\n       A 7 percent drop in income for the second-lowest 20 percent \n     of taxpayers.\n       A 3 percent drop in income for the middle 20 percent.\n       Meanwhile, this 15-year period saw:\n       A 5 percent increase in income for the fourth 20 percent.\n       An 18 percent increase in income for the richest 20 percent \n     of taxpayers, which was most problematic of all for critics \n     of taxcut policy.\n       Once again, however, the use of this 15-year conglomeration \n     produces misleading figures. The data look bad for the poor \n     and middle class on this graph because, once again, the \n     figure lumps in the effects of Jimmy Carter's high-tax, high-\n     regulation policies with those of low taxes and low \n     regulation.\n       When we separate out the 1979-81 period (fig. 4) from the \n     1982-90 recovery years (fig. 5), we find that everyone got \n     poorer under the high-tax, high-regulation policies of \n     1979-81--the poor much more so and much more devastatingly \n     than the rich. From 1979 to 1981, the poorest fifth \n     experienced a drop in income of 9 percent, the next fifth \n     a drop of 6.8 percent, the middle fifth a drop of 5.4 \n     percent, the following fifth a drop of 3.5 percent, and \n     the top fifth a drop of 4.5 percent.\n       Meanwhile, when the government lowered taxes and \n     regulations during the 1982-90 period, everyone got richer.\n       During the 1982-90 Reagan-Bush era, everyone was better \n     off. The bottom fifth experienced an 11 percent increase in \n     income, the next fifth experienced a 9.7 percent gain, the \n     middle fifth a 10.3 percent increase, the next fifth an 11.8 \n     percent rise, and the highest fifth a 17.9 percent increase.\n       After the 1990 budget deal, everyone again became worse \n     off. And after President Clinton's retroactive tax hike took \n     effect in 1993, average Americans were hit hard.\n       Perhaps some would complain that people with high incomes \n     did even better than other Americans during the prosperous \n     1980s. But government's goal should not be to make all people \n     the same. It should be to allow everyone to become better \n     off. And policies of low taxes and fewer regulations did \n     precisely this.\n       It really is very simple: Lower taxes and less regulation \n     help the poor, along with everyone else, while higher taxes \n     and more regulation hurt the poor, along with everyone else.\n\n\n                               myth no. 2\n\n       What about the notion that we cannot afford tax cuts and \n     that the tax cuts of the 1980s produced the burdensome \n     deficits our economy is staggering under today?\n       This myth, unfortunately, has led some in Congress to \n     abandon their commitment to tax cuts in the name of common \n     sense. They now argue that common sense demands that we \n     delay, cut back, or abandon entirely any tax cuts, at least \n     until we achieve a balanced budget.\n       In fact, tax cuts can help America achieve the goal of \n     balancing the budget. Tax reductions--particularly those that \n     strengthen incentives to work, save, and invest--increase the \n     rate of economic growth and thereby produce higher tax \n     revenues for the Treasury than would be the case under a \n     high-tax regime.\n       It is a paradoxical truth--to paraphrase what President \n     John F. Kennedy said in 1962--that tax rates are too high \n     today and tax revenues are too low. And the soundest way to \n     raise revenue in the long run is to cut the rates now.\n       Kennedy was right and for a simple if somewhat unexpected \n     reason: Irrespective of the top marginal tax rate, the \n     government will take in about the same amount as a percentage \n     of gross domestic product (GDP).\n       Research by economist W. Kurt Hauser shows that government \n     receipts as a proportion of GDP have continued to hover at \n     19.5\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\n     percent since 1960. In 1982, the tax share stood at 19.8 \n     percent of GDP. By 1989, the tax share had declined slightly \n     to 19.2 percent of GDP--much the same as it had been back in \n     1960.\n       In short, whether we have raised or lowered tax rates, the \n     percentage of GDP in taxes has hovered at 19 percent. The \n     issue, of course, is 19 percent of what? Is it 19 percent of \n     a large and growing GDP, or of an anemic, stagnant one?\n       Here again, the real numbers destroy the myths and tell the \n     true story. According to the federal Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB), in 1982, the year the tax cuts were \n     implemented, tax receipts stood at $617.8 billion. By 1989, \n     tax receipts had increased to $990.7 billion.\n       How did this come about? By lowering taxes, the government \n     freed up capital and entrepreneurial spirit, creating jobs \n     and wealth and expanding the size of the economic pie. From \n     1982 to 1989, GDP increased from $3.1 to $5.4 trillion. \n     Therefore, while tax revenues as a share of GDP remained \n     relatively constant at just over 19 percent, the dollar \n     amount of tax revenues collected by the federal government \n     rose dramatically, because the economy grew dramatically.\n       Tax cuts will increase economic growth and thereby reduce \n     the deficit. The question is, by how much? Economist Bruce \n     Bartlett, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury, notes \n     that the OMB figures show that increases in real GDP \n     significantly reduce the deficit. By the year 2000, the \n     deficit would be diminished by more than $150 billion if the \n     economy grew just 1 percent faster than currently projected \n     over the next five years.\n       Of course, Bartlett says, there is no guarantee that the \n     Republican tax cuts will achieve a 1 percent faster growth \n     rate. But there is no doubt they will increase growth above \n     what would otherwise have occurred. If growth is just 0.4 \n     percent faster per year it would be enough to make the tax \n     cut deficit-neutral, based on the OMB data.\n       Thus, a dispassionate review of the figures shatters the \n     myth that the Reagan tax cuts increased the deficit. The \n     problem was not our revenue stream, either in terms of the \n     percentage of GDP paid in taxes, or in real tax dollars \n     received. The problem was too much spending. From 1982 to \n     1989, government spending rose from $745 billion to $1.14 \n     trillion, a 53 percent jump.\n       Tax cuts in the 1990s can help produce the same type of \n     economic growth they generated in the 1980s. This growth in \n     turn will help us reduce the deficit. All we must do is \n     reduce the rate at which government spending grows. CBO \n     figures show that, if we simply hold the rate at which \n     federal spending grows to a little over 2 percent per year, \n     we can cut taxes by $189 billion and balance the budget by \n     the year 2002.\n\n\n                               myth no. 3\n\n       But this reference to tax cuts brings us face to face with \n     another myth, namely, that tax cuts disproportionately \n     benefit the rich at the expense of the poor.\n       The myth explodes, however, on contact with IRS data \n     conclusively show that lower income-tax rates actually \n     increase the percentage of the total tax bill paid by the \n     rich while decreasing the tax burden on the poor.\n       There is an amazing historical correlation between \n     decreases in the marginal tax rate and increases in the share \n     of revenue paid by the top 1 percent of income earners. And, \n     of course, along with this increase in taxes paid by the most \n     wealthy went a decrease in the taxes paid by the lower 50 \n     percent of income earners.\n       For example, by 1988, the share of income taxes paid by the \n     bottom 50 percent of taxpayers assumed just 5.7 percent of \n     the income tax burden. Also in 1988, the average tax payment \n     of the top 1 percent of taxpayers amounted to 27.5 percent of \n     the total.\n       On the other hand, after the budget summit deal of 1990, \n     the top marginal tax rate was increased from 28 to 31 \n     percent. This produced a 3.5 percent decrease in the revenue \n     share paid by the top 1 percent--down to 24.6 percent of the \n     total. That is, as marginal rates decreased, the rich paid \n     more, and as marginal rates increased the rich paid less, \n     leaving more for the middle class and poor to pay.\n       Clearly, then, if we want to help the middle class, the \n     last thing we should do is increase marginal tax rates. Such \n     an increase will lead to lower productivity, lower tax \n     revenues from the rich, and an increased tax burden for those \n     who are not rich.\n       The answer to our dilemma, then, is not to keep our current \n     high taxes but to cut taxes while bringing spending under \n     control.\n       By bringing together disparate kinds of tax cuts, from a \n     $500-per-child tax credit to a reduction in the capital-gains \n     tax rate that will strengthen small businesses and \n     entrepreneurs, we can increase the well-being and \n     productivity of America's middle-class families. These tax \n     cuts would allow middle-class families to build a better \n     future for their children.\n       The proposed $500-per-child tax credit directly benefits \n     the middle class. The Joint Committee on Taxation has \n     reported that three-quarters of the benefits from this tax \n     cut will go to people with incomes less than $75,000.\n       A capital-gains tax cut will accrue to the middle class as \n     well. IRS data show that 55 percent of taxpayers who report \n     long-term capital gains earn $50,000 or less. And 75 percent \n     of them earn $75,000 or less.\n       These tax cuts will bring real relief to America's middle \n     class. They will help the economy and thereby help lower the \n     deficit.\n       The 1980s teach us--if only we will examine their lessons \n     properly--that a vibrant economy, spurred by low taxes and \n     fewer regulations, will produce balanced budgets and economic \n     well-being for the middle class. We need only trust Americans \n     to spend and invest their own money as they see fit. We need \n     only trust the people, rather than government, to make their \n     own decisions about how to take care of their families and \n     improve their lot in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3681-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3683-S3687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW TITLE OF H.R. 3136\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will submit for the Record a \nstatement which serves to provide a detailed explanation and a \nlegislative history for the congressional review title of H.R. 3136, \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. H.R. \n3136 was passed by the Senate on March 28, 1996, and was signed by the \nPresident the next day. Ironically, the President signed the \nlegislation on the first anniversary of the passage of S. 219, the \nforerunner to the congressional review title. Last year, S. 219, passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 100 to 0 on March 29, 1995. Because title III \nof H.R. 3136 was the product of negotiation with the Senate and did not \ngo through the committee process, no other expression of its \nlegislative history exists other than the joint statement made by \nSenator Reid and myself immediately before passage of H.R. 3136 on \nMarch 28. I am submitting a joint statement to be printed in the Record \non behalf of myself, as the sponsor of the S. 219, Senator Reid, the \nprime cosponsor of S. 219, and Senator Stevens, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. This joint statement is intended to \nprovide guidance to the agencies, the courts, and other interested \nparties when interpreting the act's terms. The same statement has been \nsubmitted today in the House by the chairmen of the committees of \njurisdiction over the congressional review legislation.\n  The joint statement follows:\n\n    Statement for the Record by Senators Nickles, Reid, and Stevens\n\n\n               SUBTITLE E--Congressional Review Subtitle\n\n       Subtitle E adds a new chapter to the Administrative \n     Procedure Act (APA), ``Congressional Review of Agency \n     Rulemaking,'' which is codified in the United States Code as \n     chapter 8 of title 5. The congressional review chapter \n     creates a special mechanism for Congress to review new rules \n     issued by federal agencies (including modification, repeal, \n     or reissuance of existing rules). During the review period, \n     Congress may use expedited procedures to enact joint \n     resolutions of disapproval to overrule the federal rulemaking \n     actions. In the 104th Congress, four slightly different \n     versions of this legislation passed the Senate and two \n     different versions passed the House. Yet, no formal \n     legislative history document was prepared to explain the \n     legislation or the reasons for changes in the final language \n     negotiated between the House and Senate. This joint statement \n     of the authors on the congressional review subtitle is \n     intended to cure this deficiency.\n\n                               Background\n\n       As the number and complexity of federal statutory programs \n     has increased over the last fifty years, Congress has come to \n     depend more and more upon Executive Branch agencies to fill \n     out the details of the programs it enacts. As complex as some \n     statutory schemes passed by Congress are, the implementing \n     regulations are often more complex by several orders of \n     magnitude. As more and more of Congress' legislative \n     functions have been delegated to federal regulatory agencies, \n     many have complained that Congress has effectively abdicated \n     its constitutional role as the national legislature in \n     allowing federal agencies so much latitude in implementing \n     and interpreting congressional enactments.\n       In many cases, this criticism is well founded. Our \n     constitutional scheme creates a delicate balance between the \n     appropriate roles of the Congress in enacting laws, and the \n     Executive Branch in implementing those laws. This legislation \n     will help to redress the balance, reclaiming for Congress \n     some of its policymaking authority, without at the same time \n     requiring Congress to become a super regulatory agency.\n       This legislation establishes a government-wide \n     congressional review mechanism for most new rules. This \n     allows Congress the opportunity to review a rule before it \n     takes effect and to disapprove any rule to which Congress \n     objects. Congress may find a rule to be too burdensome, \n     excessive, inappropriate or duplicative. Subtitle E uses the \n     mechanism of a joint resolution of disapproval which requires \n     passage by both houses of Congress and the President (or veto \n     by the President and a two-thirds' override by Congress) to \n     be effective. In other words, enactment of a joint resolution \n     of disapproval is the same as enactment of a law.\n       Congress has considered various proposals for reviewing \n     rules before they take effect\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\n     for almost twenty years. Use of a simple (one-house), \n     concurrent (two-house), or joint (two houses plus the \n     President) resolution are among the options that have been \n     debated and in some cases previously implemented on a limited \n     basis. In INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), the Supreme \n     Court struck down as unconstitutional any procedure where \n     executive action could be overturned by less than the full \n     process required under the Constitution to make laws--that \n     is, approval by both houses of Congress and presentment to \n     the President. That narrowed Congress' options to use a \n     joint resolution of disapproval. The one-house or two-\n     house legislative veto (as procedures involving simple and \n     concurrent resolutions were previously called), was thus \n     voided.\n       Because Congress often is unable to anticipate the numerous \n     situations to which the laws it passes must apply, Executive \n     Branch agencies sometimes develop regulatory schemes at odds \n     with congressional expectations. Moreover, during the time \n     lapse between passage of legislation and its implementation, \n     the nature of the problem addressed, and its proper solution, \n     can change. Rules can be surprisingly different from the \n     expectations of Congress or the public. Congressional review \n     gives the public the opportunity to call the attention of \n     politically accountable, elected officials to concerns about \n     new agency rules. If these concerns are sufficiently serious, \n     Congress can stop the rule.\n\n        Brief procedural history of congressional review chapter\n\n       In the 104th Congress, the congressional review legislation \n     originated as S. 348, the ``Regulatory Oversight Act,'' which \n     was introduced on February 2, 1995. The text of S. 348 was \n     offered by its sponsors, Senators Don Nickles and Harry Reid, \n     as a substitute amendment to S. 219, the ``Regulatory \n     Transition Act of 1995.'' As amended, S. 219 provided for a \n     45-day delay on the effectiveness of a major rule, and \n     provided expedited procedures that Congress could use to pass \n     resolutions disapproving of the rule. On March 29, 1995, the \n     Senate passed the amended version of S. 219 by a vote of 100-\n     0. The Senate later substituted the text of S. 219 for the \n     text of H.R. 450, the House passed ``Regulatory Transition \n     Act of 1995.'' Although the House did not agree to a \n     conference on H.R. 450 and S. 219, both Houses continued to \n     incorporate the congressional review provisions in other \n     legislative packages. On May 25, the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee reported out S. 343, the ``Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995,'' and S. 291, the ``Regulatory \n     Reform Act of 1995,'' both with congressional review \n     provisions. On May 26, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     reported out a different version of S. 343, the \n     ``Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995,'' which also \n     included a congressional review provision. The congressional \n     review provision in S. 343 that was debated by the Senate was \n     quite similar to S. 219, except that the delay period in the \n     effectiveness of a major rule was extended to 60 days and the \n     legislation did not apply to rules issued prior to enactment. \n     A filibuster of S. 343, unrelated to the congressional review \n     provisions, led to the withdrawal of that bill.\n       The House next took up the congressional review legislation \n     by attaching a version of it (as section 3006) to H.R. 2586, \n     the first debt limit extension bill. The House made several \n     changes in the legislation that was attached to H.R. 2586, \n     including a provision that would allow the expedited \n     procedures also to apply to resolutions disapproving of \n     proposed rules, and provisions that would have extended the \n     60-day delay on the effectiveness of a major rule for any \n     period when the House or Senate was in recess for more \n     than three days. On November 9, 1995 both the House and \n     Senate passed this version of the congressional review \n     legislation as part of the first debt limit extension \n     bill. President Clinton vetoed the bill a few days later, \n     for reasons unrelated to the congressional review \n     provision.\n       On February 29, 1996, a House version of the congressional \n     review legislation was published in the Congressional Record \n     as title III of H.R. 994, which was scheduled to be brought \n     to the House floor in the coming weeks. The congressional \n     review title was almost identical to the legislation approved \n     by both Houses in H.R. 2586. On March 19, 1996, the Senate \n     adopted a congressional review amendment by voice vote to S. \n     942, which bill passed the Senate 100-0. The congressional \n     review legislation in S. 942 was similar to the original \n     version of S. 219 that passed the Senate on March 29, 1995.\n       Soon after passage of S. 942, representatives of the \n     relevant House and Senate committees and principal sponsors \n     of the congressional review legislation met to craft a \n     congressional review subtitle that was acceptable to both \n     Houses and would be added to the debt limit bill that was \n     scheduled to be taken up in Congress the week of March 24. \n     The final compromise language was the result of these joint \n     discussions and negotiations.\n       On March 28, 1996, the House and Senate passed title III, \n     the ``Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996,'' as part of the second debt limit bill, H.R. 3136. \n     There was no separate vote in either body on the \n     congressional review subtitle or on title III of H.R. 3136. \n     However, title III received broad support in the House and \n     the entire bill passed in the Senate by unanimous consent. \n     The President signed H.R. 3136 into law on March 29, 1996, \n     exactly one year after the first congressional review bill \n     passed the Senate.\n\n               Submission of rules to Congress and to GAO\n\n       Pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(A), a federal agency \n     promulgating a rule must submit a copy of the rule and a \n     brief report about it to each House of Congress and to the \n     Comptroller General before the rule can take effect. In \n     addition to a copy of the rule, the report shall contain a \n     concise general statement relating to the rule, including \n     whether it is a major rule under the chapter, and the \n     proposed effective date of the rule. Because most rules \n     covered by the chapter must be published in the Federal \n     Register before they can take effect, it is not expected that \n     the submission of the rule and the report to Congress and the \n     Comptroller General will lead to any additional delay.\n       Section 808 provides the only exception to the requirement \n     that rules must be submitted to each House of Congress and \n     the Comptroller General before they can take effect. \n     Subsection 808(1) excepts specified rules relating to \n     commercial, recreational, or subsistence hunting, fishing, \n     and camping. Subsection 808(2) excepts certain rules that are \n     not subject to notice-and-comment procedures. It provides \n     that if the relevant agency finds ``for good cause . . . that \n     notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, \n     unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, [such rules] \n     shall take effect at such time as the Federal agency \n     promulgating the rule determines.'' Although rules described \n     in section 808 shall take effect when the relevant Federal \n     agency determines pursuant to other provisions of law, the \n     federal agency still must submit such rules and the \n     accompanying report to each House of Congress and to the \n     Comptroller General as soon as practicable after \n     promulgation. Thus, rules described in section 808 are \n     subject to congressional review and the expedited \n     procedures governing joint resolutions of disapproval. \n     Moreover, the congressional review period will not begin \n     to run until such rules and the accompanying reports are \n     submitted to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General.\n       In accordance with current House and Senate rules, covered \n     agency rules and the accompanying report must be separately \n     addressed and transmitted to the Speaker of the House (the \n     Capitol, Room H-209), the President of the Senate (the \n     Capitol, Room S-212), and the Comptroller General (GAO \n     Building, 441 G Street, N.W., Room 1139). Except for rules \n     described in section 808, any covered rule not submitted to \n     Congress and the Comptroller General will remain ineffective \n     until it is submitted pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(A). In \n     almost all cases, there will be sufficient time for an agency \n     to submit notice-and-comment rules or other rules, that must \n     be published to these legislative officers during normal \n     office hours. There may be rare instance, however, when a \n     federal agency must issue an emergency rule that is effective \n     upon actual notice and does not meet one of the section 808 \n     exceptions. In such a rare case, the federal agency may \n     provide contemporaneous notice to the Speaker of the House, \n     the President of the Senate, and the Comptroller General. \n     These legislative officers have accommodated the receipt of \n     similar, emergency communications in the past and will \n     utilize the same means to receive emergency rules and reports \n     during nonbusiness hours. If no other means of delivery is \n     possible, delivery of the rule and related report by telefax \n     to the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and \n     the Comptroller General shall satisfy the requirements of \n     subsection 801(a)(1)(A).\n\n          Additional delay in the effectiveness of major rules\n\n       Subsection 553(d) of the APA requires publication or \n     service of most substantive rules at least 30 days prior to \n     their effective date. Pursuant to subsection 801(a)(3)(A), a \n     major rule (as defined in subsection 804(2)) shall not take \n     effect until at least 60 calendar days after the later of the \n     date on which the rule and accompanying information is \n     submitted to Congress or the date on which the rule is \n     published in the Federal Register, if it is so published. If \n     the Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval and the \n     President vetoes such resolution, the delay in the \n     effectiveness of a major rule is extended by subsection \n     801(a)(3)(B) until the earlier date on which either House of \n     Congress votes and fails to override the veto or 30 session \n     days \\1\\ after the date on which the Congress receives the \n     veto and objections from the President. By necessary \n     implication, if the Congress passes a joint resolution of \n     disapproval within the 60 calendar days provided in \n     subsection 801(a)(3)(A), the delay period in the \n     effectiveness of a major rule must be extended at least until \n     the President acts on the joint resolution or until the time \n     expires for the President to act. Any other result would be \n     inconsistent with subsection 801(a)(3)(B), which extends the \n     delay in the effectiveness of a major rule for a period of \n     time after the President vetoes a resolution.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ In the Senate, a ``session day'' is a calendar day in \n     which the Senate is in session. In the House of \n     Representatives, the same term is normally expressed as a \n     ``legislative day.'' In the congressional review chapter, \n     however, the term ``session day'' means both a ``session \n     day'' of the Senate and a ``legislative day'' of the House of \n     Representatives unless the context of the sentence or \n     paragraph indicates otherwise.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Of course, if Congress fails to pass a joint resolution of \n     disapproval within the 60-day period provided by subsection \n     801(a)(3)(A), subsection 801(a)(3)(B) would not apply and\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\n     would not further delay the effective date of the rule. \n     Moreover, pursuant to subsection 801(a)(5), the effective \n     date of a rule shall not be delayed by this chapter beyond \n     the date on which either house of Congress votes to reject a \n     joint resolution of disapproval.\n       Although it is not expressly provided in the congressional \n     review chapter, it is the authors' intent that a rule may \n     take effect if an adjournment of Congress prevents the \n     President from returning his veto and objections within the \n     meaning of the Constitution. Such will be the case if the \n     President does not act on a joint resolution within 10 days \n     (Sundays excepted) after it is presented to him, and ``the \n     Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return'' within the \n     meaning of Article I, Sec. 7, cl. 2, or when the President \n     affirmatively vetoes a resolution during such an adjournment. \n     This is the logical result because Congress cannot act to \n     override these vetoes. Congress would have to begin anew, \n     pass a second resolution, and present it to the President in \n     order for it to become law. It is also the authors' intent \n     that a rule may take effect immediately if the President \n     returns a veto and his objections to Congress but Congress \n     adjourns its last session sine die before the expiration of \n     time provided in subsection 801(a)(3)(B). Like the situations \n     described immediately above, no subsequent Congress can act \n     further on the veto, and the next Congress would have to \n     begin anew, pass a second resolution of disapproval, and \n     present it to the President in order for it to become law.\n\n         Purpose of and exceptions to the delay of major rules\n\n       The reason for the delay in the effectiveness of a major \n     rule beyond that provided in APA subsection 553(d) is to try \n     to provide Congress with an opportunity to act on resolutions \n     of disapproval before regulated parties must invest the \n     significant resources necessary to comply with a major rule. \n     Congress may continue to use the expedited procedures to pass \n     resolutions of disapproval for a period of time after a major \n     rule takes effect, but it would be preferable for Congress to \n     act during the delay period so that fewer resources would be \n     wasted. To increase the likelihood that Congress would act \n     before a major rule took effect, the authors agreed on an \n     approximately 60-day delay period in the effective date of a \n     major rule, rather than an approximately 45-day delay period \n     in some earlier versions of the legislation.\n       There are four exceptions to the required delay in the \n     effectiveness of a major rule in the congressional review \n     chapter. The first is in subsection 801(c), which provides \n     that a major rule is not subject to the delay period of \n     subsection 801(a)(3) if the President determines in an \n     executive order that one of four specified situations exist \n     and notifies Congress of his determination. The second is in \n     subsection 808(1), which excepts specified rules relating to \n     commercial, recreational, or subsistence hunting, fishing, \n     and camping from the initial delay specified in subsection \n     801(a)(1)(A) and from the delay in the effective date of a \n     major rule provided in subsection 801(a)(3). The third is in \n     subsection 808(2), which excepts certain rules from the \n     initial delay specified in subsection 801(a)(1)(A) and from \n     the delay in the effective date of a major rule provided in \n     subsection 801(a)(3) if the relevant agency finds ``for good \n     cause . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are \n     impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \n     interest.'' This ``good cause'' exception in subsection \n     808(2) is taken from the APA and applies only to rules which \n     are exempt from notice and comment under subsection 553(b)(B) \n     or an analogous statute. The fourth exception is in \n     subsection 804(2). Any rule promulgated under the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 or any amendments made by that \n     Act that otherwise could be classified as a ``major rule'' is \n     exempt from that definition and from the 60-day delay in \n     section 801(a)(3). However, such an issuance still would fall \n     within the definition of ``rule'' and would be subject to the \n     requirements of the legislation for non-major rules. A \n     determination under subsection 801(c), subsection 804(2), or \n     section 808 shall have no effect on the procedures to enact \n     joint resolutions of disapproval.\n\nA court may not stay or suspend the effectiveness of a rule beyond the \n    period specified in section 801 simply because a resolution of \n                   disapproval is pending in Congress\n\n       The authors discussed the relationship between the period \n     of time that a major rule is delayed and the period of time \n     during which Congress could use the expedited procedures in \n     section 802 to pass a resolution of disapproval. Although it \n     would be best for Congress to act pursuant to this chapter \n     before a major rule goes into effect, it was recognized that \n     Congress could not often act immediately after a rule was \n     issued because it may be issued during a recesses of \n     Congress, shortly before such recesses, or during other \n     periods when Congress cannot devote the time to complete \n     prompt legislative action. Accordingly, the authors \n     determined that the proper public policy was to give Congress \n     an adequate opportunity to deliberate and act on joint \n     resolutions of disapproval, while ensuring that major rules \n     could go into effect without unreasonable delay. In short, \n     the authors decided that major rules could take effect after \n     an approximate 60-day delay, but the period governing the \n     expedited procedures in section 802 for review of joint \n     resolution of disapproval would extend for a period of time \n     beyond that.\n       Accordingly, courts may not stay or suspend the \n     effectiveness of any rule beyond the periods specified in \n     section 801 simply because a joint resolution is pending \n     before Congress. Such action would be contrary to the many \n     express provisions governing when different types of rules \n     may take effect. Such court action also would be contrary to \n     the authors' intent because it would upset an important \n     compromise on how long a delay there should be on the \n     effectiveness of a major rule. The final delay period was \n     selected as a compromise between the period specified in the \n     version that passed the Senate on March 19, 1995, and the \n     version that passed both Houses on November 9, 1995. It is \n     also the authors' belief that such court action would be \n     inconsistent with the principles of (and potentially \n     violate) the Constitution, art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2, in that \n     courts may not give legal effect to legislative action \n     unless it results in the enactment of law pursuant that \n     Clause. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). Finally, \n     the authors intend that a court may not predicate a stay \n     on the basis of possible future congressional action \n     because it would be improper for a court to rule that the \n     movant had demonstrated a ``likelihood of success on the \n     merits,'' unless and until a joint resolution is enacted \n     into law. A judicial stay prior to that time would raise \n     serious separation of powers concerns because it would be \n     tantamount to the court making a prediction of what \n     Congress is likely to do and then exercising its own power \n     in furtherance of that prediction. Indeed, the authors \n     intend that Congress may have been reluctant to pass \n     congressional review legislation at all if its action or \n     inaction pursuant to this chapter would be treated \n     differently than its action or inaction regarding any \n     other bill or resolution.\n\n   Time periods governing passage of joint resolutions of disapproval\n\n       Subsection 802(a) provides that a joint resolution \n     disapproving of a particular rule may be introduced in either \n     House beginning on the date of the rule and accompanying \n     report are received by Congress until 60 calendar days \n     thereafter (excluding days either House of Congress is \n     adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of Congress). \n     But if Congress did not have sufficient time in a previous \n     session to introduce or consider a resolution of disapproval, \n     as set forth in subsection 801(d), the rule and accompanying \n     report will be treated as if it were first received by \n     Congress on the 15th session day in the Senate, or 15th \n     legislative day in the House, after the start of its next \n     session. When a rule was submitted near the end of a Congress \n     or prior to the start of the next Congress, a joint \n     resolution of disapproval regarding that rule may be \n     introduced in the next Congress beginning on the 15th session \n     day in the Senate or the 15th legislative day in the House \n     until 60 calendar days thereafter (excluding days either \n     House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days during \n     the session) regardless of whether such a resolution was \n     introduced in the prior Congress. Of course, any joint \n     resolution pending from the first session of a Congress, may \n     be considered further in the nest session of the same \n     Congress.\n       Subsections 802(c)-(d) specify special procedures that \n     apply to the consideration of a joint resolution of \n     disapproval in the Senate. Subsection 803(c) allows 30 \n     Senators to petition for the discharge of resolution from a \n     Senate committee after a specified period of time (the later \n     of 20 calendar days after the rule is submitted to Congress \n     or published in the Federal Register, if it is so published). \n     Subsection 802(d) specifies procedures for the consideration \n     of a resolution on the Senate floor. Such a resolution is \n     highly privileged, points or order are waived, a motion to \n     postpone consideration is not in order, the resolution is \n     unamendable, and debate on the joint resolution and ``on all \n     debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith'' \n     (including a motion to proceed) is limited to no more than 10 \n     hours.\n       Subsection 802(e) provides that the special Senate \n     procedures specified in subsections 802(c)-(d) shall not \n     apply to the consideration of any joint resolution of \n     disapproval of a rule after 60 session days of the Senate \n     beginning with the later date that rule is submitted to \n     Congress or published, if it is so published. However, if a \n     rule and accompanying report are submitted to Congress \n     shortly before the end of a session or during an intersession \n     recess as described in subsection 801(d)(1), the special \n     Senate procedures specified in subsections 802(c)-(d) shall \n     expire 60 session days after the 15th session day of the \n     succeeding session of Congress--or on the 75th session day \n     after the succeeding session of Congress first convenes. For \n     purposes of subsection 802(e), the term ``session day'' \n     refers only to a day the Senate is in session, rather than a \n     day both Houses are in session. However, in computing the \n     time specified in subsection 801(d)(1), that subsection \n     specifies that there shall be an additional period of review \n     in the next session if either House did not have an adequate \n     opportunity to complete action on a joint resolution. Thus, \n     if either House of Congress did not have adequate time to \n     consider a joint resolution in a given session (60 session \n     days in the Senate and 60 legislative days in the House), \n     resolutions of disapproval may be introduced or reintroduced \n     in both Houses in the next session, and the special Senate \n     procedures specified in subsection 802(c)-(d) shall apply in \n     the next session of the Senate.\n       If a joint resolution of disapproval is pending when the \n     expedited Senate procedures specified in subsections 802(c)-\n     (d) expire, the resolution shall not die in either House but \n     shall simply be considered pursuant to the\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\n     normal rules of either House--with one exception. Subsection \n     802(f) sets forth one unique provision that does not expire \n     in either House. Subsection 802(f) provides procedures for \n     passage of a joint resolution of disapproval when one House \n     passes a joint resolution and transmits it to the other House \n     that has not yet completed action. In both Houses, the joint \n     resolution of the first House to act shall not be referred to \n     a committee but shall be held at the desk. In the Senate, a \n     House-passed resolution may be considered directly only under \n     normal Senate procedures, regardless of when it is received \n     by the Senate. A resolution of disapproval that originated in \n     the Senate may be considered under the expedited procedures \n     only during the period specified in subsection 802(e). \n     Regardless of the procedures used to consider a joint \n     resolution in either House, the final vote of the second \n     House shall be on the joint resolution of the first House (no \n     matter when that vote takes place). If the second House \n     passes the resolution, no conference is necessary and the \n     joint resolution will be presented to the President for his \n     signature. Subsection 802(f) is justified because subsection \n     802(a) sets forth the required language of a joint resolution \n     in each House, and thus, permits little variance in the joint \n     resolutions that could be introduced in each House.\n\n        Effect of enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval\n\n       Subsection 801(b)(1) provides that: ``A rule shall not take \n     effect (or continue), if the Congress enacts a joint \n     resolution of disapproval, described under section 802, of \n     the rule.'' Subsection 801(b)(2) provides that such a \n     disapproved rule ``may not be reissued in substantially the \n     same form, and a new rule that is substantially the same as \n     such a rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new \n     rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the \n     date of the joint resolution disapproving the original \n     rule.'' Subsection 801(b)(2) is necessary to prevent \n     circumvention of a resolution disapproval. Nevertheless, \n     it may have a different impact on the issuing agencies \n     depending on the nature of the underlying law that \n     authorized the rule.\n       If the law that authorized the disapproved rule provides \n     broad discretion to the issuing agency regarding the \n     substance of such rule, the agency may exercise its broad \n     discretion to issue a substantially different rule. If the \n     law that authorized the disapproved rule did not mandate the \n     promulgation of any rule, the issuing agency may exercise its \n     discretion not to issue any new rule. Depending on the law \n     that authorized the rule, an issuing agency may have both \n     options. But if an agency is mandated to promulgate a \n     particular rule and its discretion in issuing the rule is \n     narrowly circumscribed, the enactment of a resolution of \n     disapproval for that rule may work to prohibit the reissuance \n     of any rule. The authors intend the debate on any resolution \n     of disapproval to focus on the law that authorized the rule \n     and make the congressional intent clear regarding the \n     agency's options or lack thereof after enactment of a joint \n     resolution of disapproval. It will be the agency's \n     responsibility in the first instance when promulgating the \n     rule to determine the range of discretion afforded under the \n     original law and whether the law authorizes the agency to \n     issue a substantially different rule. Then, the agency must \n     give effect to the resolution of disapproval.\n\n   Limitation on judicial review of congressional or administrative \n                                actions\n\n       Section 805 provides that a court may not review any \n     congressional or administrative ``determination, finding, \n     action, or omission under this chapter.'' Thus, the major \n     rule determinations made by the Administrator of the Office \n     of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of \n     Management and Budget are not subject to judicial review. Nor \n     may a court review whether Congress complied with the \n     congressional review procedures in this chapter. This latter \n     limitation on the scope of judicial review was drafted in \n     recognition of the constitutional right of each House of \n     Congress to ``determine the Rules of its Proceedings,'' U.S. \n     Const., art. I, Sec. 5, cl. 2, which includes being the final \n     arbiter of compliance with such Rules.\n       The limitation on a court's review of subsidiary \n     determination or compliance with congressional procedures, \n     however, does not bar a court from giving effect to a \n     resolution of disapproval that was enacted into law. A court \n     with proper jurisdiction may treat the congressional \n     enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval as it would \n     treat the enactment of any other federal law. Thus, a court \n     with proper jurisdiction may review the resolution of \n     disapproval and the law that authorized the disapproved rule \n     to determine whether the issuing agency has the legal \n     authority to issue a substantially different rule. The \n     language of subsection 801(g) is also instructive. Subsection \n     801(g) prohibits a court or agency from inferring any intent \n     of the Congress only when ``Congress does not enact a joint \n     resolution of disapproval,'' or by implication, when it has \n     not yet done so. In deciding cases or controversies properly \n     before it, a court or agency must give effect to the intent \n     of the Congress when such a resolution is enacted and becomes \n     the law of the land. The limitation on judicial review in no \n     way prohibits a court from determining whether a rule is \n     in effect. For example, the authors expect that a court \n     might recognize that a rule has no legal effect due to the \n     operation of subsections 801(a)(1)(A) or 801(a)(3).\n\n  Enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval for a rule that was \n                           already in effect\n\n       Subsection 801(f) provides that: ``Any rule that takes \n     effect and later is made of no force or effect by enactment \n     of a joint resolution under section 802 shall be treated as \n     though such rule had never taken effect.'' Application of \n     this subsection should be consistent with existing judicial \n     precedents on rules that are deemed never to have taken \n     effect.\n\n           Agency information required to be submitted to GAO\n\n       Pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(B), the federal agency \n     promulgating the rule shall submit to the Comptroller General \n     (and make available to each House) (i) a complete copy of the \n     cost-benefit analysis of the rule, if any, (ii) the agency's \n     actions related to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, (iii) the \n     agency's actions related to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, \n     and (iv) ``any other relevant information or requirements \n     under any other Act and any relevant Executive Orders.'' \n     Pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(B), this information must be \n     submitted to the Comptroller General on the day the agency \n     submits the rule to Congress and to GAO.\n       The authors intend information supplied in conformity with \n     subsection 801(a)(1)(B)(iv) to encompass both agency-specific \n     statutes and government-wide statutes and executive orders \n     that impose requirements relevant to each rule. Examples of \n     agency-specific statutes include information regarding \n     compliance with the law that authorized the rule and any \n     agency-specific procedural requirements, such as section 9 of \n     the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2054 (procedures for consumer product safety rules); \n     section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, \n     as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 655 (promulgation of standards); \n     section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7607(d) (promulgation of rules); and section 501 of the \n     Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7191 \n     (procedure for issuance of rules, regulations, and orders). \n     Examples of government-wide statutes include other chapters \n     of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 551-\n     559 and 701-706; and the Paperwork Reduction Act, as amended, \n     44 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3501-3520.\n       Examples of relevant executive orders include E.O. No. \n     12866 (Sept. 30, 1993) (Regulatory Planning and Review); E.O. \n     No. 12606 (Sept. 2, 1987) (Family Considerations in Policy \n     Formulation and Implementation); E.O. No. 12612 (Oct. 26, \n     1987) (Federalism Considerations in Policy Formulation and \n     Implementation); E.O. No. 12630 (Mar. 15, 1988) (Government \n     Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected \n     Property Rights); E.O. No. 23875 (Oct. 26, 1993) (Enhancing \n     the Intergovernmental Partnership); E.O. No. 12778 (Oct. 23, \n     1991) (Civil Justice Reform); E.O. No. 12988 (Feb. 5, 1996) \n     (Civil Justice Reform) (effective May 5, 1996).\n\n                       GAO reports on major rules\n\n       Fifteen days after the federal agency submits a copy of a \n     major rule and report to each House of Congress and the \n     Comptroller General, the Comptroller General shall prepare \n     and provide a report on the major rule to the committee of \n     jurisdiction in each House. Subsection 801(a)(2)(B) requires \n     agencies to cooperate with the Comptroller General in \n     providing information relevant to the Comptroller General's \n     reports on major rules. Given the 15-day deadline for these \n     reports, it is essential that the agencies' initial \n     submission to the General Accounting Office (GAO) contain all \n     of the information necessary for GAO to conduct its analysis. \n     At a minimum, the agency's submission must include the \n     information required of all rules pursuant to 801(a)(1)(B). \n     Whenever possible, OMB should work with GAO to alert GAO when \n     a major rule is likely to be issued and to provide as much \n     advance information to GAO as possible on such proposed major \n     rule. In particular, OMB should attempt to provide the \n     complete cost-benefit analysis on a major rule, if any, well \n     in advance of the final rule's promulgation.\n       It also is essential for the agencies to present this \n     information in a format that will facilitate the GAO's \n     analysis. The authors expect that GAO and OMB will work \n     together to develop, to the greatest extent practicable, \n     standard formats for agency submissions. OMB also should \n     ensure that agencies follow such formats. The authors also \n     expect that agencies will provide expeditiously any \n     additional information that GAO may require for a thorough \n     report. The authors do not intend the Comptroller General's \n     reports to be delayed beyond the 15-day deadline due to lack \n     of information or resources unless the committees of \n     jurisdiction indicate a different preference. Of course, the \n     Comptroller General may supplement his initial report at any \n     time with any additional information, on its own, or at the \n     request of the relevant committees or jurisdiction.\n\n         Covered agencies and entities in the executive branch\n\n       The authors intend this chapter to be comprehensive in the \n     agencies and entities that are subject to it. The term \n     ``Federal agency'' in subsection 804(1) was taken from 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 551(1). That definition includes ``each authority \n     of the Government'' that is not expressly excluded by \n     subsection 551(1)(A)-(H). With those few exceptions, the \n     objective was to cover each and every government entity, \n     whether it is a department, independent agency, independent \n     establishment, or government corporation. This is because \n     Congress is enacting the congressional review\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n     chapter, in large part, as an exercise of its oversight and \n     legislative responsibility. Regardless of the justification \n     for excluding or granting independence to some entities from \n     the coverage of other laws, that justification does not apply \n     to this chapter, where Congress has an interest in exercising \n     its constitutional oversight and legislative responsibility \n     as broadly as possible over all agencies and entities within \n     its legislative jurisdiction.\n       In some instances, federal entities and agencies issue \n     rules that are not subject to the traditional 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 553(c) rulemaking process. However, the authors intend \n     the congressional review chapter to cover every agency, \n     authority, or entity covered by subsection 551(1) that \n     establishes policies affecting any segment of the general \n     public. Where it was necessary, a few special exceptions \n     were provided, such as the exclusion for the monetary \n     policy activities of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, rules of particular applicability, and \n     rules of agency management and personnel. Where it was not \n     necessary, no exemption was provided and no exemption \n     should be inferred from other law. This is made clear by \n     the provision of section 806 which states that the Act \n     applies notwithstanding any other provision of law.\n\n                     Definition of a ``major rule''\n\n       The definition of a ``major rule'' in subsection 804(2) is \n     taken from President Reagan's Executive Order 12291. Although \n     President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 contains a \n     definition of a ``significant regulatory action'' that is \n     seemingly as broad, several of the Administration's \n     significant rule determinations under Executive Order 12866 \n     have been called into question. The authors intend the term \n     ``major rule'' in this chapter to be broadly construed, \n     including the non-numerical factors contained in the \n     subsections 804(2)(B) and (C).\n       Pursuant to subsection 804(2), the Administrator of the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of \n     Management and Budget (the Administrator) must make the major \n     rule determination. The authors intend that centralizing this \n     function in the Administrator will lead to consistency across \n     agency lines. Moreover, from 1981-93 OIRA staff interpreted \n     and applied the same major rule definition under E.O. 12291. \n     Thus, the Administrator should rely on guidance documents \n     prepared by OIRA during that time and previous major rule \n     determinations from that Office as a guide in applying the \n     statutory definition to new rules.\n       Certain covered agencies, including many ``independent \n     agencies,'' include their proposed rules in the Unified \n     Regulatory Agenda published by OMB but do not normally submit \n     their final rules to OMB for review. Moreover, interpretative \n     rules and general statements of policy are not normally \n     submitted to OMB for review. Nevertheless, it is the \n     Administrator that must make the major rule determination \n     under this chapter whenever a new rule is issued. The \n     Administrator may request the recommendation of any agency \n     covered by this chapter on whether a proposed rule is a major \n     rule within the meaning of subsection 804(2), but the \n     Administrator is responsible for the ultimate determination. \n     Thus, all agencies or entities covered by this chapter will \n     have to coordinate their rulemaking activity with OIRA so \n     that the Administrator may make the final, major rule \n     determination.\n\n                         Scope of rules covered\n\n       The authors intend this chapter to be interpreted broadly \n     with regard to the type and scope of rules that are subject \n     to congressional review. The term ``rule'' in subsection \n     804(3) begins with the definition of a ``rule'' in subsection \n     551(4) and excludes three subsets of rules that are modeled \n     on APA sections 551 and 553. This definition of a rule does \n     not turn on whether a given agency must normally comply with \n     the notice-and-comment provisions of the APA, or whether \n     the rule at issue is subject to any other notice-and-\n     comment procedures. The definition of ``rule'' in \n     subsection 551(4) covers a wide spectrum of activities. \n     First, there is formal rulemaking under section 553 that \n     must adhere to procedures of sections 556 and 557 of title \n     5. Second, there is informal rulemaking, which must comply \n     with the notice-and-comment requirements of subsection \n     553(c). Third, there are rules subject to the requirements \n     of subsection 552(a)(1) and (2). This third category of \n     rules normally either must be published in the Federal \n     Register before they can adversely affect a person, or \n     must be indexed and made available for inspection and \n     copying or purchase before they can be used as precedent \n     by an agency against a non-agency party. Documents covered \n     by subsection 552(a) include statements of general policy, \n     interpretations of general applicability, and \n     administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff \n     that affect a member of the public. Fourth, there is a \n     body of materials that fall within the APA definition of \n     ``rule'' and are the product of agency process, but that \n     meet none of the procedural specifications of the first \n     three classes. These include guidance documents and the \n     like. For purposes of this section, the term rule also \n     includes any rule, rule change, or rule interpretation by \n     a self regulatory organization that is approved by a \n     Federal agency. Accordingly, all ``rules'' are covered \n     under this chapter, whether issued at the agency's \n     initiative or in response to a petition, unless they are \n     expressly excluded by subsections 804(3)(A)-(C). The \n     authors are concerned that some agencies have attempted to \n     circumvent notice-and-comment requirements by trying to \n     give legal effect to general statements of policy, \n     ``guidelines,'' and agency policy and procedure manuals. \n     The authors admonish the agencies that the APA's broad \n     definition of ``rule'' was adopted by the authors of this \n     legislation to discourage circumvention of the \n     requirements of chapter 8.\n       The definition of a rule in subsection 551(4) covers most \n     agency statements of general applicability and future effect. \n     Subsection 804(3)(A) excludes ``any rule of particular \n     applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes \n     rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefore, \n     corporate and financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, \n     or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or \n     disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing'' from the \n     definition of a rule. Many agencies, including the Treasury, \n     Justice, and Commerce Departments, issue letter rulings or \n     other opinion letters to individuals who request a specific \n     ruling on the facts of their situation. These letter rulings \n     are sometimes published and relied upon by other people in \n     similar situations, but the agency is not bound by the \n     earlier rulings even on facts that are analogous. Thus, such \n     letter rulings or opinion letters do not fall within the \n     definition of a rule within the meaning of subsection 804(3).\n       The different types of rules issued pursuant to the \n     internal revenue laws of the United States are good examples \n     of the distinction between rules of general and particular \n     applicability. IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service \n     letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular \n     applicability, notwithstanding that they may be cited as \n     authority in transactions involving the same circumstances. \n     Examples of substantive and interpretative rules of general \n     applicability will include most temporary and final Treasury \n     regulations issued pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking \n     procedures, and most revenue rulings, revenue procedures, IRS \n     notices, and IRS announcements. It does not matter that these \n     later types of rules are issued without notice-and-comments \n     rulemaking procedures or that they are accorded less \n     deference by the courts than notice-and-comment rules. In \n     fact, revenue rulings have been described by the courts as \n     the ``classic example of an interpretative rul[e]'' within \n     the meaning of the APA. See Wing v. Commissioner, 81 T.C. 17, \n     26 (1983). The test is whether such rules announce a general \n     statement of policy or an interpretation of law of general \n     applicability.\n       Most rules or other agency actions that grant an approval, \n     license, registration, or similar authority to a particular \n     person or particular entities, or grant or recognize an \n     exemption or relieve a restriction for a particular person or \n     particular entities, or permit new or improved applications \n     of technology for a particular person or particular entities, \n     or allow the manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of a \n     substance or product are exempted under subsection 804(3)(A) \n     from the definition of a rule. This is probably the largest \n     category of agency actions excluded from the definition of a \n     rule. Examples include import and export licenses, individual \n     rate and tariff approvals, wetlands permits, grazing permits, \n     plant licenses or permits, drug and medical device approvals, \n     new source review permits, hunting and fishing take limits, \n     incidental take permits and habitat conservation plans, \n     broadcast licenses, and product approvals, including \n     approvals that set forth the conditions under which a product \n     may be distributed.\n       Subsection 804(3)(B) excludes ``any rule relating to agency \n     management or personnel'' from the definition of a rule. \n     Pursuant to subsection 804(3)(C), however, a ``rule of agency \n     organization, procedure, or practice,'' is only excluded if \n     it ``does not substantially affect the rights or obligations \n     of non-agency parties.'' The authors' intent in these \n     subsections is to exclude matters of purely internal agency \n     management and organization, but to include matters that \n     substantially affect the rights or obligations of outside \n     parties. The essential focus of this inquiry is not on the \n     type of rule but on its effect on the rights or obligations \n     of non-agency parties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3683-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3687-S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHERNOBYL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on April 26, 1986, reactor number 4 \nat the V.I. Lenin Atomic Power Plant in Chernobyl near Kiev, Ukraine \nexploded. The explosion released a cloud of radioactive steam into the \natmosphere reported to contain about 200 times more radio activity than \nwas released at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n  The explosion took an enormous toll on the people directly exposed to \nthe radiation emitted from the plant. Shortly after the explosion, \nSoviet officials admitted to 31 deaths among reactor operators and the \nteam attempting to contain the damage. Thousands of workers were \neventually exposed at the site.\n  However, children have been the first among the general population to \nsuffer from the effects of the explosion at Chernobyl. Children are \nmost susceptible to the radioactive iodine emitted from Chernobyl \nbecause of their active\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nthyroid glands. Researchers in the region have seen a dramatic increase \nin thyroid cancer among children. However, this is only the earliest \nproblem to make itself known and one of the few to be studied. The \nproblem with estimating the toll on human life in the region is that 10 \nyears is a short period of time to see all of the impacts. Radioactive \nfallout is only beginning to show its damaging effects on the \npopulation.\n  At the time of the explosion, the prevailing winds carried much of \nthe radiation north into Belarus and points beyond. Excessive levels of \nradiation were recorded in Scandinavia, Great Britain, the \nMediterranean, and Alaska in the first weeks after the explosion. About \n1000 acres of pine forest in the path of the first plume of the \nChernobyl explosion died immediately as a result of direct fallout. A \npermanent 30-kilometer dead zone was established around the power \nstation where human habitation is still forbidden today because of the \nhigh level of contamination. The Chernobyl area, known as the Polissia \nregion, was once famous for its old-growth forests rich with mushrooms, \nberries and medicinal herbs. The community's well-being revolved around \nthe health of the forest. Their dependency on the forest resulted in a \nvery unique spirituality and culture in the region. After the accident, \nresidents were forced to leave their homes and move to completely \ndifferent environments. The inability to return to the land they once \nknew and worries about possible exposure to radiation now cause great \nstress among the population. Two of Chernobyl's four units remain \nfunctional today. Ukraine says it wants to completely close Chernobyl, \nbut cannot function without the energy it provides and cannot afford to \nproperly close the plant, even though radioactive material is now \nthreatening water tables in the area. The American people should \nspecifically lend their support to the efforts to make the area around \nChernobyl as safe as possible. We should also work to improve the \nhealth, economic and environmental well-being of areas affected by the \nChernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl explosion has been a devastating \nevent for the entire world. Ukrainian-Americans have worked strenuously \nto lend support to their homeland. In my home State, the Michigan \nCommittee--Chernobyl Challenge 1996 will be holding events to \ncommemorate the 10-year anniversary of the explosion. On April 28, \n1996, a commemorative program will be held at St. Josaphat Ukrainian \nCatholic Church in Warren, MI. The guest speaker will be Ukraine's \nAmbassador to the United Nations, Anatoly Zlenko. There will also be \nblood drives held at the Ukrainian Cultural Center and at St. Michael \nUkrainian Catholic Church in cooperation with the American Red Cross, \nwhere volunteers will bring to the public's attention the on-going \ntragedy in Ukraine. I salute their efforts to help Ukraine recover from \nthe tragedy that occurred a decade ago at Chernobyl.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3687-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION DISCRETIONARY SPENDING \nLIMITS, APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES, AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to join the people of \nMaryland in celebrating the tricentennial anniversary of the founding \nof Prince Georges County on April 23, 1696. Over the centuries the \nresidents and leadership of Prince Georges County have demonstrated a \nremarkable commitment to preserving their rich historic legacy, while \nencouraging economic growth and cultural enrichment.\n  While evidence suggests that the first human settlements in the area \nlater to be called Prince Georges County existed over 10,000 years ago, \nthe first documented visit to the region occurred in 1608 when Captain \nJohn Smith sailed up the Potomac River to map the Chesapeake Bay region \nand search for food for the fledgling Jamestown Colony. Captain Smith \npaid only a brief visit to this region which, less than a century \nlater, would be home to about 1,700 Marylanders. This rich land \nextending from Mattawoman Creek in the south all the way to the \nPennsylvania border was proclaimed a self-governing county by the \ncolonial Governor in 1696, and was named Prince Georges County in honor \nof Prince George of Denmark, husband of Princess Anne, heir to the \nthrone of England.\n  Due to the abundance of fertile farm land, agriculture dominated the \nlocal economy in colonial times, contributing to the livelihood of \nalmost every Prince Georges County inhabitant. Preservation of this \nimportant aspect of colonial life has remained a priority to the \nresidents of Prince Georges County who, through groups such as the \nAccokeek Foundation, work to maintain the National Colonial Farm, \ndisplaying to all a continuum of American farm life from the 1600's \nthrough the 18th century.\n  Evidence of the importance of the agricultural economy in southern \nMaryland remains in many aspects of Prince Georges County life, \nincluding the Maryland higher education system. In 1856, in order to \neducate the sons of colonial farmers and to foster the exchange of new \nideas, the Maryland Agricultural College--the first of its kind in the \nNation--was established in Prince Georges County. Today we know the \nMaryland Agricultural College as the University of Maryland College \nPark, the flagship institution of the University of Maryland system.\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\n  While agriculture was the predominant force in the Prince Georges \nCounty economy, the push for western expansion in Maryland led to the \ngrowth of thriving commercial and trading centers such as Upper \nMarlboro, Laurel and Bladensburg. Cotton mills, steamboats, and \nrailroads resulted in increased commercial development, strengthening \nthe county's ties with Europe and other American colonies and leading \nto increased economic development.\n  This early entrepreneurial spirit continues to flourish and thrive \ntoday. Prince Georges County is now home to over 13,600 businesses \nwhich employ over 223,700 workers. Major employers including Giant \nFood, United Parcel Service, and Dimensions Health Corporation serve to \nmake Prince Georges County a prime example of a large and prospering \nbusiness community, while the Prince Georges County Economic \nDevelopment Corporation has been nationally recognized for its programs \nto assist individual entrepreneurs and small minority-owned businesses.\n  The county's close proximity to the District of Columbia has been \nanother factor in its evolution and maturation. Over the years towns \nand cities have sprung up to meet the needs of a growing community of \nFederal employees who increasingly choose to live outside the Federal \ncity in suburban Maryland. Towns such as Takoma Park, New Carrollton, \nGreenbelt, and District Heights are home to the over 87,000 Federal \nemployees who work both in the District and at the many Federal \ninstallations which are located in modern Prince Georges County.\n  Prince Georges County is today one of the Nation's largest and most \nvibrant subdivisions, winning widespread acclaim and national \nrecognition for its success in promoting diversity and opening up the \ndoors of opportunity for all of its citizens. This well-deserved \nreputation as a national model is due to a strong sense of community \nand cooperation among its residents and to enlightened and visionary \nleadership. In the forefront of these efforts have been our respected \nGovernor and former Prince Georges County Executive Parris Glendening, \ntwo of my distinguished colleagues in the Congress, Representatives \nSteny Hoyer and Albert Wynn, and the present dynamic County Executive \nWayne Curry.\n  Such citizens and leaders throughout history have guided Prince \nGeorges County from a region of frontier wilderness and rural \nplantations to today's modern urban communities and advanced \nagricultural centers. Prince Georges County has adapted to meet the \nchanges wrought by the centuries, while preserving the evidence of 300 \nyears of growth and progress. This tricentennial celebration pays \ntribute to the rich legacy of our Maryland ancestors and bears \ntestament to the limitless promise and potential of Prince Georges \nCounty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3688-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3689-S3691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A FOND FAREWELL TO AN HISTORIC AIRCRAFT\n\n( Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on April 20, 1996, the last of the \nIdaho Air National Guard's F-4G ``Wild Weasels'' will be retired.\n  As we bid farewell to this reliable workhorse that has served this \nNation well for nearly three decades, let me recognize the historic \naccomplishments of the Wild Weasel and the superb men and women of the \n124th Fighter Group stationed at Gowen Field in Boise, ID, who have \nflown and maintained this remarkable aircraft.\n  Since June 1991, the 124th has flown the F-4G Wild Weasel. It is a \ntwo-seat, twin engine jet that can travel at more than twice the speed \nof sound. Armed with radar and heat seeking missiles as well as \nconventional bombs, the Wild Weasel is often the first aircraft to \nenter combat and the last to leave. Its mission is to find and attack \nenemy radar and missile sites--clearing the path in a hostile \nenvironment for friendly fighters and bombers to enter enemy airspace.\n  When the Wild Weasels first arrived at Gowen Field, the 124th \nconverted to the new mission and was combat ready in record time.\n  Six months later, these men and women were called on to leave their \nhomes, families and jobs to serve their Nation. Without a Presidential \ncall-up, these troops volunteered for service and became the first Air \nNational Guard unit activated for a combat mission during peace time \nwhen they were deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Southern \nWatch.\n  The Group was fully integrated into the Air Force Wing deployed to \nthe region. They were given day to day mission responsibilities for \npatrolling southern Iraq and escorting coalition aircraft into enemy \nairspace that had proven over time to be a hostile environment.\n  As I visited the men and women of the Idaho Guard stationed in Saudi \nArabia, I saw how effectively the active duty and National Guard forces \nwere working together to defend our Nation's interest. I also heard \nBritish and French pilots state they would not fly over Iraq unless \nthey knew the Wild Weasels were also in the sky to protect them against \nsurface to air missiles.\n  Maj. Gen. Darrell V. Manning praised his men and women for their \ncritical role in this international enforcement effort. He said, ``They \nwere the only trained organization in place that could perform this \nmission and we had the trained and motivated people required to succeed \nin this critical role.''\n  But this success required the support of hundreds of personnel who \nperformed their duties to near perfection. The mechanics, refuellers, \nweapons handlers, and every other member of this team--and I mean \nteam--contributed to the effectiveness of the 124th Fighter Group.\n  The 124th was again called to service in Operation Provide Comfort--\nthis time to Turkey where they enforced the northern Iraq no-fly zone \nas part of combat-ready patrol along with other United States, British, \nFrench and Turkish coalition forces.\n  In the fall of 1995, the Idaho Air National Guard made Air Force \nhistory by flying the 50,000th aerial mission in support of Operation \nProvide Comfort II.\n  I had the privilege of visiting the 124th Fighter Group in Turkey in \nearly October, 1995. Once again I saw a well trained and well \ndisciplined group of men and women serving our Nation's interests. I \nalso saw the pride that these men and women from Idaho had in their \nvenerable aircraft, the Wild Weasel. And while there, I let them know \ntheir State and country were proud of the 124th's dedication and \ncommitment to peace in that troubled region.\n  Mr. President, it is clear the men and women of the 124th Fighter \nGroup have established themselves as one of the premier Guard units in \nthe country. And while I have some parochial pride in making that \nstatement, that distinction was hard-earned and well-deserved.\n  Based on the Wild Weasel's performance in Saudi Arabia, the Secretary \nof the Air Force came to Boise, ID in December 1993 to honor the 124th \nFighter Group. Secretary Sheila Widnall and Maj. Gen. Philip G. Killey, \nDirector of the Air National Guard, presented the men and women of the \n124th Fighter Group with the Air Force's Outstanding Unit Award for \ntheir role as the leading edge of force projection during peacetime, \nand the first to assume this new and difficult role for Air Reserve \nforces.\n  Mr. President, we all knew the time would come for the Wild Weasel to \nbe retired, and with the downsizing of active and reserve units that \nhas taken place, there were concerns over future missions for Gowen \nField.\n  As we looked for a new mission for Gowen Field, it was clear the men \nand women of the Idaho Air National Guard had already presented their \ncase. The performance of the Wild Weasel was well-documented. The \ndependability of the Idaho Air Guard was second to none. Together, they \nhad earned not one, but two new missions to replace the Wild Weasels--\nthe A-10's and the C-130's.\n  And while we say goodbye to this trusted airframe, we know the \ntradition of the Wild Weasel will live on with the men and women of the \nIdaho Air National Guard where the motto is ``First Class or Not At \nAll.''\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Dole/Roth amendment adopted \nearlier today includes a provision designed to address the problem of \nrenunciation of U.S. citizenship by Americans who move abroad in order \nto avoid U.S. taxation. On April 6, 1995, shortly after this issue \nfirst came to light, I introduced S. 700, a bill to close the loophole \nin the Tax Code that permits expatriates, as they have come to be \ncalled,\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\nfrom evading U.S. taxation. I said here on the floor that the Senate \nwould act expeditiously to end this abuse, and would act in a careful \nand judicious manner to do so. The amendment before us today, which \nincludes a modification of S. 700, would do just that.\n  Although expatriation to avoid taxes occurs infrequently, it is a \ngenuine abuse. The Tax Code currently contains provisions, dating back \nto 1966, intended to prevent tax-motivated relinquishment of \ncitizenship, but these provisions have proven difficult to enforce and \nare easily evaded. One international tax expert described avoiding them \nas ``child's play.'' Individuals with substantial wealth can, by \nrenouncing U.S. citizenship, avoid paying taxes on gains that accrued \nduring the period that they acquired their wealth--and while they were \nafforded the many benefits and advantages of U.S. citizenship. \nMoreover, even after renunciation, these individuals are permitted to \nkeep residences and reside in the United States for up to 120 days per \nyear without incurring U.S. tax obligations. Indeed, certain wealthy \nindividuals have renounced their U.S. citizenship and avoided their tax \nobligations while still maintaining their families and homes in the \nUnited States. They need only take care to avoid being in the United \nStates for more than 120 days each year.\n  Meanwhile, ordinary Americans who remain citizens continue to pay \ntaxes on their gains when assets are sold or when estate taxes become \ndue at death.\n  I regret to say that the expatriation issue has been the subject of \nmore controversy than it probably deserves, so in the interest of \nsetting the record straight, I will briefly review the history of its \nconsideration in the Congress. On February 6, 1995, the President \nannounced a proposal to address expatriation in his fiscal year 1996 \nbudget submission. Three weeks later, on March 15, 1995, during Finance \nCommittee consideration of legislation to restore the health insurance \ndeduction for the self-employed, I offered a modified version of the \nadministration's expatriation tax provision as an amendment to the \nbill. My amendment would have substituted the expatriation proposal for \nthe repeal of minority broadcast tax preferences as a funding source \nfor the bill. The amendment failed in the face of united opposition by \nmembers of the majority on the Committee. The vote against the \namendment was 11-9.\n  Subsequently, Senator Bradley offered the expatriation provision as a \nfree-standing amendment, with the revenues it raised to be dedicated to \ndeficit reduction. Senator Bradley's amendment passed by voice vote. \nThat is how the expatriation tax provision was added to the bill that \ncame before the Senate.\n  After the Finance Committee reported the bill, but before full Senate \naction and before our conference with the House, the Finance Committee \nheld a hearing to review further the issues raised by expatriation. At \nour hearing, we heard criticisms of some technical aspects of the \nprovision, as well as testimony raising the issue of whether the \nprovision comported with Article 12 of the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992. \nSection 2 of Article 12 states: ``Everyone shall be free to leave any \ncountry, including his own.''\n  Robert F. Turner, a professor of international law at the U.S. Naval \nWar College, testified that the expatriation provision was problematic \nunder the Covenant because it constituted a legal barrier to the right \nof citizens to leave the United States. The State Department's legal \nexperts disagreed, as did two other outside experts who provided \nwritten opinions to the Committee: Professor Paul B. Stephan III, a \nspecialist in both international law and tax law at the University of \nVirginia School of Law; and Mr. Stephen E. Shay, who served as \nInternational Tax Counsel at the Department of the Treasury in the \nReagan administration.\n  Given this division in authority, it seemed clear that the Senate \nshould not act improvidently on the matter. Genuine questions of human \nrights under international law, and the solemn obligations of the \nUnited States under treaties, had been raised. We therefore sought the \nviews of other experts. Opinions concluding that the expatriation \nprovision did not violate international law were received from \nProfessor Detlev Vagts of Harvard Law School and Professor Andreas F. \nLowenfeld of New York University School of Law. The State Department \nissued a lengthier analysis supporting the legality of the provision, \nand the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service \nreached a like conclusion. However, there were dissenting views, most \nnotably the powerful opinion of Professor Hurst Hannum of the Fletcher \nSchool of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, who first wrote to me \non March 24, 1995.\n  This is where things stood when the House-Senate conference met on \nMarch 28, 1995. Although the weight of authority appeared to support \nthe validity of the provision under international law, very real \nquestions remained. Yet the underlying bill had to move at great speed. \nAs my colleagues well know, the legislation restoring the health \ninsurance deduction for the self-employed for calendar year 1994 needed \nto be passed and signed into law well in advance of the April 17, 1995 \ntax filing deadline, so that self-employed persons would have time to \nprepare and file their 1994 tax returns. The conference committee had \nto decide immediately whether to retain the expatriation provision; \nthere was no time for further inquiry into its validity under \ninternational law. We accordingly chose not to risk making the wrong \ndecision with respect to international law and human rights, and so the \nexpatriation provision was not included in the conference report. The \nconferees instead adopted a provision directing the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to study the matter and report back.\n  This decision, which was the only prudent one at the time, met with \nsome not very pleasant criticism in the Senate. This was surprising, \nsince I believed it was axiomatic that government should proceed with \ngreat care when dealing with human rights--particularly the rights of \npersons who are despised. The persons affected by the expatriation \nproposal--millionaires who renounce their citizenship for money--\ncertainly fall into that category.\n  Since that time, a general consensus has developed that the provision \ndoes not conflict with the obligations of the United States under \ninternational law. Professor Hannum, after receiving additional and \nmore specific information about the expatriation tax, wrote a second \nletter of March 31, 1995 stating that he was now ``convinced that \nneither its intention nor its effect would violate present U.S. \nobligations under international law.''\n  In the interim, there has been time to consider other approaches to \nthe problem. On June 1, 1995, the Joint Committee on Taxation published \nits report on the tax treatment of expatriation. Shortly thereafter, on \nJune 9, 1995, Chairman Archer introduced an expatriation bill that \nadopted a different approach than S. 700, the bill introduced by the \nSenator from New York. The Archer bill, rather than impose a tax on \naccrued gains, would build on the current law approach of taxing only a \nportion of the income of an expatriate received during the 10-year \nperiod following expatriation. A version very similar to the Archer \nbill was included in House-passed version of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995.\n  We held a second Finance Committee hearing on expatriation on July \n11, 1995 to consider the two competing approaches. Soon thereafter, the \nSenate in the Senate-passed version of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 \nadopted the accrued gains approach from my bill, rather than the House \nalternative, as the superior response to the problem.\n  During the conference on the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, the \nconferees opted for the House approach. This was, I believe, a serious \nerror. Fortunately, that version did not become law because the \nPresident vetoed the conference agreement. The conferees on the pending \nbill will be faced with the same choice. The House version of the \nexpatriation provision is included in the House-passed companion to the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill. We ought not repeat the mistake made in the \nBalanced Budget Act.\n  I am convinced that the House approach has serious defects and would \nfail to eliminate the very substantial tax advantages that currently \naccrue\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nto those willing to give up their citizenship. Under the House \nproposal, several categories of taxpayers would continue to owe no tax \nat all should the IRS be unable to prove a tax avoidance motive for \nexpatriating. As under current law, taxpayers who are patient would \navoid all tax on accrued gains by simply holding their assets for 10 \nyears. A wealthy expatriate in need of funds during the 10-year period \ncould simply borrow money using his or her assets as security. Since \nthe income from foreign assets generally would remain exempt as under \ncurrent law, clever tax practitioners would continue to find ways to \nconvert U.S. assets into foreign assets in order to avoid tax on the \nincome earned during the 10-year period.\n\n  The House approach also would be destined to fail because it relies \non the voluntary payment of taxes by people who have moved beyond the \nreach of U.S. courts. In contrast, the Senate version would collect tax \nwhile the individual is still subject to the taxing power of the United \nStates, which is surely a more administrable approach.\n  A separate objection to the House bill is that it would unilaterally \noverride existing tax treaties. In its report on expatriation, the \nJoint Tax Committee staff stated that the House version may ultimately \nrequire that as many as 41 of our 45 existing tax treaties be \nrenegotiated and that it might be necessary for the United States to \nforego benefits to accomplish renegotiation. This is a serious matter.\n  Article VI of our Constitution states:\n\n       . . . [A]ll Treaties made, or which shall be made, under \n     the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law \n     of the Land.\n\n  Further, our treaties come into being through a singular exacting \nsequence. Treaties are entered into by the United States with other \nnations either directly or through adherence to a common document. They \nare signed by a member of the executive branch. Thereafter, the Senate \nof the United States must by resolution, two-thirds of the Senators \npresent concurring therein, give its advice and consent to \nratification. This advice and consent having been given--by an \nextraordinary majority--the President then ratifies and confirms the \ntreaty in an instrument of ratification. Only at that point shall the \nsaid treaty become ``the supreme Law of the Land.'' Matters that \nsurvive this singularly exacting process should not be abrogated \nlightly.\n  One final point, of utmost importance. During the time we have taken \nto write this law carefully and well, billionaires have not been \nslipping through the loophole and escaping tax by renouncing their \ncitizenship. The President announced the original proposal on February \n6, 1995 and made it effective for taxpayers who initiate a renunciation \nof citizenship on or after that date. This was an entirely appropriate \nway to put an end to an abusive practice under current law. Likewise \nall the proposals considered by the Senate, including my bill S. 700, \nused February 6, 1995 as their effective date. The House conferees on \nthe self-employed bill had proposed moving the effective date forward \nto March 15, 1995, the date of Senate Finance Committee action on the \nprovision. But the two chairmen of the tax-writing committees \nultimately--and wisely--resisted that overture, and issued a joint \nstatement giving notice that February 6, 1995 would be the effective \ndate of any legislation affecting the tax treatment of those who \nrelinquish citizenship.\n  Now that the Senate has had adequate opportunity to fully explore the \nbest way to address the expatriation problem, it is time to act. As the \nfirst Senator to have introduced legislation to end tax avoidance by \nso-called expatriates, and as one who urged that it be acted upon by \nthe Senate expeditiously, I am pleased that the Dole/Roth amendment \nincorporates the expatriation changes I have favored. I hope that the \nconferees will retain the superior Senate expatriation provision, and \nthat it will be enacted as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3689-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMENDING THE INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, at this moment, though the hour is \nlate, and I apologize to those who are inconvenienced while I make my \nremarks, this is a topic of great importance to me and my home State of \nNew Jersey, and a number of communities across the country--that is, \nthe cleanup of toxic waste.\n  Mr. President, 73 million Americans live near toxic waste sites. That \nis\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nabout one of every four of our citizens. Many people think of hazardous \nwaste as a problem of ugly dump sites that harm a community's \nappearance and property values. But it is far more than that, Mr. \nPresident. Toxic waste is a huge threat to public health. By \ncontaminating our drinking water, our air and our soil, dangerous waste \ncontributes to a wide range of health problems, and these include \ncancer, birth defects, cardiovascular problems, immune disorders, and \neven something as simple and obvious as dermatitis.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is difficult to say how many people are harmed \nbecause of exposure to toxic waste. But the number is considerable. \nUnfortunately, New Jersey, where there are more Superfund sites than \nany other State, is being hit especially hard. Recent studies found \nthat in all but one of New Jersey's 21 counties, cancer rates and areas \naround hazardous waste sites exceeded the national average.\n  Studies from other parts of the country also suggest that those \nliving near toxic waste sites have suffered disproportionately from \nserious health problems. Beyond the public health problems associated \nwith toxic waste, these sites also have serious economic effects on \nlocal communities. They discourage investment and occupy otherwise \nvaluable real estate that could be used for productive economic \nactivity. If we do not clean up these sites, we are depriving \ncommunities of good jobs and local tax revenues.\n  Mr. President, Congress created the Superfund Program in 1980, \nlargely to respond to health problems, to save lives and protect and \nrestore the environment. The program was designed to ensure that toxic \nwaste sites were cleaned up promptly and that polluters took \nresponsibility for cleaning them up.\n  Unfortunately, as many know, the Superfund Program got off to a very \nslow start for a variety of reasons, including a lack of Presidential \ncommitment. Many cleanups were delayed. However, in recent years, the \nprogram has turned around. Under the Clinton administration, toxic \nwaste cleanups have been 20 percent faster, 25 percent cheaper, and \nthere is real progress in cleaning up sites. Although we have a long \nway to go, many more sites are being cleaned up, and delays have been \nreduced significantly.\n\n  Like any program, Mr. President, Superfund has its share of problems \nand critics. And there are many legitimate concerns that must be \naddressed. We do need to speed cleanups, reduce unnecessary litigation, \nand make the program work more efficiently.\n  Still, Mr. President, there has been tremendous progress. And \nPresident Clinton and EPA Administrator Carol Browner deserve real \ncredit for that.\n  Unfortunately, just as the program has picked up steam, the Congress \nhas permitted its funding mechanism to expire. This funding source \nsimply must be reestablished, or the whole program could be threatened.\n  It is important, in my view, to pass a Superfund reform bill. Many of \nus in the Congress have been working long and hard, and in a bipartisan \nway, to develop reform legislation, and to make needed improvements in \nthe program.\n  As ranking minority member of the Senate's Superfund Subcommittee, I \nhave worked with many of my colleagues on this issue for several years \nnow, especially my distinguished colleague from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Last congress, after a long and arduous process involving all \naffected parties, we developed a bill that would have made \ncomprehensive changes in the Superfund program.\n  Our bill would have made Superfund fairer, more efficient, and less \ncostly. It addressed every major issue raised by those affected by \nSuperfund, and provided relief on every front.\n  It would have fostered greater and earlier community involvement in \ncleanup decisions. It speeded up cleanups and made them more efficient. \nIt would have slashed private litigation costs in half, and established \na mechanism to efficiently resolve disputes involving polluters, their \ninsurers, and the Government.\n  It allowed qualified States to play a greater role in remedy \nselection and cleanup of sites, including federally-owned facilities. \nIt promoted the voluntary cleanup and economic redevelopment of \ncontaminated properties. And it provided much-needed relief to lenders, \nsmall businesses, municipalities and others who have been caught up in \nthe liability scheme.\n  Unfortunately, despite very broad support from environmentalists, \nindustry, small businesses, State and local governments, communities, \nlenders, and others involved in Superfund, this reform bill was killed \nin the waning days of the 103d Congress. And so, last year, a new \neffort began to reauthorize the Superfund Program.\n  Senator Smith, our new chairman of the Superfund Subcommittee, \nintroduced a proposal last October.\n  And for the past few months, Senator Chafee, chairman of the \nCommittee, and Senators Baucus, Smith, and myself have spent countless \nhours trying to resolve our differences and produce a bill that can \nenjoy broad, bipartisan support. Representatives from the Clinton \nadministration have worked with us virtually every day to support this \neffort.\n  Last month, Senators Chafee and Smith introduced another measure that \nproposed a new liability scheme and made some other changes.\n  Mr. President, I remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement on \ncomprehensive reform, and note that the latest bill introduced by \nSenators Chafee and Smith--apart from the provisions on liability--\ninclude improvements over the earlier draft.\n  For example, the new measure would require that Superfund cleanups \ncontinue to meet Federal and State cleanups standards, and would allow \nStates to impose their own liability and cleanup requirements. I am \npleased by this progress and hope that it continues. Of course I would \nlike to see it continue.\n  At the same time, I remain deeply concerned about provisions in the \nchairmen's latest proposal that would dramatically reduce the \nresponsibility of polluters to clean up their own waste.\n  Before I go further, Mr. President, let me emphasize that Senators \nChafee, Smith, Baucus and I share many goals. And I know every one of \nthese senators is genuinely committed to making progress. We all want \nto reduce unnecessary litigation, and make Superfund more fair. Yet, I \nbelieve the approach embodied in their legislation has serious flaws.\n  Their legislation essentially would eliminate polluters' liability \nfor all actions causing pollution that took place before 1980.\n  By letting so many polluters off the hook entirely, the proposal \nwould fundamentally alter a basic principle of the Superfund Program: \nthe principle that, in general, polluters--not taxpayers--should pay \nfor cleaning up their own toxic waste.\n  Mr. President, abandoning this principle would have serious \nconsequences. It would lead to fewer cleanups. It would impose huge new \nburdens on State and local governments, which would be left holding the \nbag for cleaning up hundreds, if not thousands, of sites. And it would \nmean, in the end, that many fewer toxic waste sites will get cleaned \nup.\n  Mr. President, Senator Baucus and I, along with the administration, \nhave developed a different approach to reforming Superfund liability. I \nask unanimous consent that an outline of our proposal be printed in the \nRecord. I hope my colleagues will take a close look at it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Liability Counterproposal to S. 1285\n\n\n                      I.

For a municipality with a population of fewer than \n     100,000 that is or was an owner or operator of a landfill \n     listed on the NPL that contains predominantly municipal solid \n     waste (MSW) or municipal sewage sludge (MSS), its response \n     costs liability at the facility shall not exceed the lesser \n     of the cost of closing the facility under RCRA Subtitle D or \n     10% of the total response costs for remediation of the site;\n       unless the President determines that the municipal owner or \n     operator seeking the liability limitation does not meet the \n     following criteria:\n       1. the municipality has complied with all requests made \n     under authority of CERCLA section 104(e);\n       2. the municipality provides full cooperation, assistance \n     and facility access in connection with the implementation of \n     response actions at the facility;\n       3. the municipality, during its period of ownership or \n     operation, accepted predominantly MSW or MSS, and any \n     materials, other than MSW or MSS, containing hazardous \n     substances accepted at the site do not contribute \n     significantly to the costs of the response or to natural \n     resource damages; and\n       4. for activities occurring after 1/1/96, the municipality \n     had a qualified household hazardous waste collection program \n     in effect, and accepted for disposal only materials that it \n     was permitted to accept by law.\n       B. Funding: Shares of responsibility attributed to \n     municipal owners or operators in excess of the amount \n     specified under II.A. above shall be included in the orphan \n     share, subject to the provisions of para.

Small MSW contributors: Exempt all generators and \n     transporters of MSW or MSS that are businesses with fewer \n     than 100 employees, residential homeowners, and small non-\n     profit organizations who:\n       1. are liable solely under CERCLA sections 107 (a)(3) or \n     (a)(4) as generators or transporters;\n       2. contributed only MSW or MSS;\n       3. have complied with all requests made under authority of \n     CERCLA section 104(e); and\n       4. provides full cooperation, assistance and facility \n     access in connection with the implementation of response \n     actions at the facility.\n       B. Other MSW contributors: Exempt all other generators and \n     transporters of MSW or MSS (including federal government \n     entities) at NPL sites for activities occurring wholly prior \n     to 1/1/96. The party seeking the exemption must demonstrate \n     that:\n       1. it is liable solely under CERCLA sections 107 (a)(3) or \n     (a)(4) for activities occurring prior to 1/1/96;\n       2. a) it contributed only MSW or MSS; or\n       b) it contributed predominantly MSW or MSS--in which case \n     the exemption under this paragraph shall apply only to the \n     portion of its waste that is demonstrated by the generator or \n     transporter to be solely MSW or MSS, and the generator or \n     transporter shall become an allocation party, or an expedited \n     settlement party, and shall pay its allocated share for the \n     waste that is not demonstrated to be MSW or MSS;\n       3. it has complied with all requests under authority of \n     CERCLA section 104(e); and\n       4. it provides full cooperation, assistance and facility \n     access in connection with the implementation of response \n     actions at the facility.\n       For activities occurring after 1/1/96, no generator or \n     transporter that otherwise demonstrates that it satisfies \n     criteria (1)-(4) above shall be liable for more than 10 \n     percent of total response costs at a facility listed on the \n     NPL, provided its waste was disposed of pursuant to a \n     qualified household hazardous waste collection program. Where \n     more than one generator or transporter qualifies under this \n     paragraph, the 10% limitation shall apply to the aggregate \n     liability for response costs of all such generators and \n     transporters.\n       C. Funding: The allocator shall not assign a share of \n     responsibility to the parties exempt under paragraph III.A. \n     above. Shares of responsibility attributed to parties \n     exempted under paragraph III.B. above shall be included in \n     the allocation and shall be attributed to the orphan share, \n     subject to the provisions of para. VI below.\n\n\n         iv. exempt de micromis contributors of hazardous waste\n\n       A. Exempt all generators and transporters (including \n     federal government entities) who contributed to a site 110 \n     gallons or less of liquid materials containing hazardous \n     substances or 200 pounds or less of solid materials \n     containing hazardous substances wholly before 1/1/96, \n     provided that:\n       1. the party has complied with all requests made under \n     authority of CERCLA section 104(e); and\n       2. the party provides full cooperation, assistance and \n     facility access in connection with the implementation of \n     response actions at the facility,\n       unless the President has determined that the waste \n     contributed significantly or could contribute significantly \n     to the costs of response or natural resource restoration.\n       B. Funding: The allocator shall not assign a share of \n     responsibility to exempt de micromis parties.\n\n\n                  v. expedited de minimis settlements\n\n       The government will provide expedited settlements to any \n     small volume (de minimis) waste contributors (including \n     federal government entities). A ``small volume'' is presumed \n     where the President estimates the volume to be 1% or less of \n     the total waste at the site. The President may determine that \n     site specific conditions indicate that another amount \n     constitutes a small volume. To provide finality for these \n     settling parties, such settlements shall include premia that \n     cover the risks of, among other things, cost overruns. \n     Recovery from these settlements will be used to reduce the \n     liability of other settling responsible parties.\n\n\n           VI. Full Funding--Maintaining the Pace of Cleanup\n\n       A. Orphan share includes shares of responsibility for \n     response costs specifically attributable to:\n       1. identified but insolvent or defunct allocation parties \n     who are not affiliated with any other person liable for \n     response costs at the facility, through any direct or \n     indirect familial relationship, or any contractual, \n     corporate, or financial relationship;\n       2. the ability to pay settlement ``delta'';\n       3. small businesses that are exempt under section I.A. and \n     that do not also qualify for the exemptions described in \n     sections III.A. IV.;\n       4. municipal owners and operators for whom liability is \n     limited under section II.A., to the extent that their shares \n     of responsibility exceed this liability limitation; and\n       5. the shares of responsibility attributable to parties \n     exempt under section III.B.\n       B. Responsibility for hazardous substances that the \n     allocator cannot attribute to any identified party shall be \n     distributed among the allocation parties, including the \n     orphan share.\n       C. The bill shall authorize up to $450 million per year for \n     orphan share payments funded under para. A.\n       D. The amount of funding available for orphan share \n     payments in any fiscal year:\n       1. shall not exceed the amounts that have been specifically \n     appropriated by Congress for that purpose in the fiscal year \n     in which the claim for payment is presented; and\n       2. must be in excess of the President's budget request for \n     Superfund (excluding those amounts identified in section \n     VI.A.) or the budget for the Superfund program as established \n     in a Budget Reconciliation Act signed by the President \n     (excluding those amounts identified in section VI.A.).\n       Shortfall: If claims for such payments exceed available \n     funds, any deficit shall be allocated pro rata among the \n     parties presenting the claim in that fiscal year. If funds \n     appropriated for this purpose are not fully obligated in the \n     fiscal year appropriated, the funds shall be carried over and \n     made available for claims in subsequent years.\n\n\n                           VII. Other Issues\n\n       A. NPL Listing Cap: Delete the cap in NPL listings.\n       B. Burden of proof: For each liability exemption or \n     limitation described in this document, the party claiming the \n     benefit of the exemption or limitation or seeking to \n     establish the availability of an orphan share payment shall \n     demonstrate the applicability of that exemption or \n     limitation.\n       C. Related allocation issues: Establish an allocation \n     process to enable PRPs to reach settlement with the United \n     States based on their allocated shares and to provide a \n     mechanism for determining the Trust Fund payments provided \n     for above. The allocation process would have the following \n     key features:\n       1. Allocations shall be required for sites with 2 or more \n     potentially responsible parties, for which\n       a. a remedial action is selected after enactment; and\n       b. a remedial action was selected prior to enactment, if \n     requested by the parties performing the remedial action.\n       2. The Administrator shall have discretion to provide \n     allocations at other sites.\n       3. Allocations shall not be required for sites where there \n     has been a previous adjudication or settlement determining \n     liability\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n     of all parties or the allocated shares of all parties, or at \n     sites where all parties are liable under sections 107(a)(1) \n     and (2).\n       4. Allocations under 1.b. and 2. shall not be construed to \n     require the payment of orphan shares, to confer reimbursement \n     rights, or to permit the reopening of a settlement.\n       D. Additional exemptions, limitations and clarifications: \n     Liability exemptions, limitations and clarifications should \n     be provided, as appropriate, for the following additional \n     parties: lenders; fiduciaries; bona fide prospective \n     purchasers; inheritors of real property; federal, state and \n     local governments who own rights-of-way or issue business \n     licenses; federal agencies providing disaster relief; \n     contiguous landowners; religious, charitable, scientific or \n     educational organizations who receive property as gifts; \n     owners of railroad spurs; and recyclers.\n       E. Settlements: any settlement or judgment signed or \n     entered prior to date of enactment shall not be affected by \n     any exemption or limitation set forth above.\n       F. Fee Shifting: Any party who seeks to bring a non-liable \n     party or a party who has fully resolved its liability to the \n     United States into the allocation system will be responsible \n     for paying the attorney fees and other costs of the nominated \n     party for participating in the allocation system. Any party \n     who sues another party during the allocation moratorium or \n     who sues a party who has fully settled its liability to the \n     United States will be responsible for paying that party's \n     attorney fees and other litigation costs.\n       G. Small business ombudsman: The Administrator shall \n     establish a small business assistance section within EPA's \n     small business ombudsman office, to act as a clearinghouse of \n     information for small businesses regarding CERCLA. The office \n     will also provide general advice and assistance to small \n     businesses regarding the allocation and settlement process, \n     but will not give legal advice or participate in the \n     allocation process.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we think our proposal addresses many \nof the concerns that have been raised about Superfund's liability \nsystem. It would increase fairness, increase efficiency, and reduce \ntransaction costs. At the same time, it would protect both the pace and \nprotectiveness of cleanups.\n  It would provide greater fairness and efficiency by establishing an \nallocation system under which those responsible for pollution pay only \ntheir fair share. Under this system, they would be able to do this \nquickly and without litigation.\n  Second, the proposal increases fairness and efficiency, and cuts down \non lawsuits, by pulling out of the process people who never should have \nbeen pulled in. This is accomplished through a series of exemptions and \nlimitations on liability for small businesses, contributors of small \namounts of waste, municipalities, charities, lenders, and other \nparties.\n  The proposal would exempt as many as 30,000 small businesses from \nSuperfund liability. It would limit the liability of up to 525 \nmunicipal owners and operators of municipal landfills. It would exempt \ncountless individuals, businesses, and small nonprofit organizations \nthat otherwise would be liable as a generator or transporter of \nmunicipal solid waste.\n  It would exempt cities whose involvement is due solely to household \ntrash created by its citizens. And it would exempt approximately 10,000 \ncontributors of small amounts of waste.\n  This means that parties like the Girl Scouts, local taxpayers, pizza \nparlors, and churches will be protected from frivolous lawsuits--suits \nbrought by polluters who have tried to force innocent parties to bear \ncleanup costs, simply because they have sent ordinary household garbage \nto Superfund sites.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, our proposal would reaffirm the \nprinciple that polluters should pay. It would ensure the availability \nof funding for more cleanups. And it would ensure that those \nresponsible for pollution are held accountable for cleaning up the mess \nthey have made.\n  It is important to provide relief to many who have been swept into \nthe Superfund system unfairly. But it is equally critical that toxic \nwaste sites not be left untended as a result, or passed off as a burden \nto local taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I remain committed and hopeful about the possibility \nof enacting a Superfund bill in this Congress. I also want to express \nmy appreciation to Senators Smith and Chafee for their acknowledgment \nthat the only way to get Superfund reform this year is through a \nbipartisan effort.\n  That kind of cooperation is part of a long tradition at the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and it has resulted in landmark \nlegislation protecting our citizens and environment. It will also be \nnecessary if President Clinton is to sign a reform proposal into law.\n  Chairman Chafee has scheduled hearings next week on Superfund, and I \nhope we will have an opportunity to discuss this proposal, among \nothers.\n  We have shared this proposal with our Republican colleagues, and we \nhope they will view it favorably. If we work together, we believe there \nis still time left in this session of Congress for the full Senate to \nconsider a bill and work with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to approve a bipartisan, consensus bill the President \ncan sign.\n  We believe our proposal is a serious effort to address concerns \nraised by our Republican colleagues. It also has the strong endorsement \nof the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol \nBrowner, and the White House.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this proposal represents the best hope \nof securing a bipartisan Superfund bill this year that not only will be \napproved by the Senate, but which will be signed into law. And I remain \ncommitted to working hard with my colleagues to reach an agreement.\n  Mr. President, we can have a Superfund program that is both more fair \nand more efficient at protecting public health and the environment. To \naccomplish this goal, we need to continue working together in a \ncooperative fashion.\n  Seventy-three million Americans in every State of the country are \ncounting on us to get the job done. I hope we will not let them down.\n  With that I conclude my remarks. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/18/senate-section/article/S3691-5", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
