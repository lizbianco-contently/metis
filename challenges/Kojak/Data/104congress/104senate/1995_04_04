Mr. President, let me say that the 30 minutes has been \nreserved for Members of the freshman class to take some time, and that \nwill be divided among several of us.\n  We want to talk a little bit this morning about the future--the \nfuture for America, the future for Americans, and the future as it \npertains to spending and spending limitations in this Government. More \nspecifically, where will we be in the year 2000 if we continue to do as \nwe have done over the past number of years? Where will we be at the \nbeginning of the next millennium unless we make some changes in the \ndirection that we are going?\n  The question before us, I think, as Americans and American taxpayers \nand American citizens, is, unless we make some changes, unless we set \nsome priorities for ourselves now and do something about spending, will \nwe have any options at the year 2000? Will we be able to set priorities \nfor ourselves or, in fact, will our priorities be set by the bond \nmarket? Will our priorities be set simply by the financial condition of \nthis country? So that is what we want to talk about.\n  There is nothing that can be more important to us than how we enter \nthe new millennium with opportunities for people to be successful, with \nopportunities for people to earn a living for their families, and to \nhave the American dream as we dreamed it in the past. And that is what \nwe are talking about.\n  We are talking about spending and what has happened to spending over \nthe last number of years and, frankly, the momentum to continue \nspending as it has been. And if that does continue, then by the year \n2000, we will not have options. All of our money will be spent for \nSocial Security, for interest on the debt, for defense.\n  One indication of where we have been is that the interest on the debt \nas part of our budget has soared from $14 billion a year 25 years ago--\nin 1970, $14 billion--to now $234 billion; on interest alone, $234 \nbillion, which is more than the Government spent in 1970.\n  So this, it seems to me, is what we need to be prepared for. We need \nto take a look at where we are and where we are going. And we have a \ngreat opportunity to do that.\n  Unfortunately, the administration is resisting change and is seeking \nto extend the programs that we have had over the last 25 years, the \nlast 30 years, seeking to extend and fund programs like the welfare \nprogram, which has been a failure. The poverty program \n[[Page S5088]] has been a failure. There are more people in poverty now \nthan there were when we began.\n  So the choice is basically to continue what we have been doing and \nresist change or to take the opportunity to take a look at the things \nwe are doing and really examine them.\n  It seems to me it is an exciting opportunity in this Congress. It is \nan exciting opportunity for the House and the Senate to examine \nprograms and say, ``Here's what we have been doing. How does it work? \nHow does it impact the people that need it?'' To take a look at it and \nsay, ``Are there better ways to deliver services?\"\n  No one is talking about discontinuing services. Nobody is talking \nabout hungry children. The people who are for change, I submit, have \nequally as much compassion for people in need as those who resist \nchange. We have a great opportunity to see: Is there a better way for \nus to deliver services?\n  What we really ought to do is measure what we have been doing against \nthe principles that we all agree on, and that is that welfare programs \nand Social Security programs ought to be designed to help get people \noff welfare, to help people get back into the marketplace, to get back \ninto an opportunity for self-esteem and self-sustenance, to reduce the \ndependency that has developed in this country and give people the \nopportunity to have jobs and be in the workplace; to provide incentives \nnot only for people to work and to take care of themselves and their \nfamilies, but incentives for business to invest to provide those jobs.\n  Now is a great opportunity for us to change some of the measurements \nof success, the measurement of welfare, not how many people you cover. \nThe measurement of welfare is how many people you help to get off of \nwelfare. And that is what we are talking about here.\n  It is unfortunate, I think, that the White House has apparently \ndetermined their approach to the next election by fear tactics of \nsaying each time we take a look at changing some program, that somehow \neveryone is going to be thrown out in the cold. That is not true. That \nis not true. We are looking for better ways to deliver services.\n  I think it would be a shame, Mr. President, to pass up the \nopportunity that we have now. Americans voted for change in 1994, not \nfor reckless change, but for fundamental change. They voted for fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Let me show you this chart, just as an example of what we are doing. \nEveryone has to have a chart here. We do not want to be without a \nchart. In any event, this shows spending and revenues over time from \n1974 to 1980 to the year 2000. Look at the difference. All of this will \nbe taken up in three categories and there will not be an opportunity \nfor educational grants, there will not be an opportunity for training \nfor work because there will not be money for that.\n  Now we can make the changes. Now we can make changes to do it and \nthat is what it is all about, Mr. President. That is why we are on the \nfloor this morning.\n  I want to share this time with a number of Senators who have worked \nvery hard in this area.\n  The Senator from Arizona worked in the House and has been the author \nof a number of bills to make some fundamental changes to move us in \nwhat I believe to be the right direction.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona for 6 minutes.\n\n\n               Consequences of Lack of Fiscal Discipline\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I think my \ncolleague from Wyoming makes an excellent point that I would like to \nspeak to, and that is the issue of the balanced budget, of getting rid \nof our Federal budget deficit and balancing the budget has more than an \neconomic dimension to it. It is really a matter of the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren, it is a matter of right and wrong and what \nwe ought to be doing as a society.\n  Bill Bennett, who is the former Secretary of Education, testified \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee recently, and he said this:\n\n       We have created a nanny state that takes too much from us \n     in order to do too much for us. This has created \n     inefficiency, sapped individual responsibility and intruded \n     on personal liberty.\n\n  Mr. President, that, as much as the economic consequences of our lack \nof fiscal discipline, is what this debate about balancing the Federal \nbudget is all about. The bigger the Government gets, the more taxes it \nneeds. The more revenue it takes, the less American families are able \nto provide for themselves, and that brings dependency on the \nGovernment. And the cycle continues: More spending, more taxes, a \nweaker economy, and ultimately more dependency on the Government.\n  The net result of that is a change in the personality of America, \nliterally. Our welfare state has created a dependency by the people who \nhave not found a way to get off welfare because of the kinds of \nincentives that have been built into the program over the years.\n  One of the things that the Republicans in the House and the Senate \nare trying to do is to change the welfare state to end this cycle of \ndependency. It is more than an economic matter. We are literally trying \nto give people a hand up rather than a handout to end the dependency, \nto enable them to provide for themselves.\n  The great debate in the House of Representatives in the next couple \nof days is whether we can modestly reduce some taxes at the same time \nthat we are balancing the Federal budget. Of course, the answer is yes. \nIf we have the discipline, we can both get to a balanced budget in 7 \nyears and make some modest changes in the Tax Code. Here is the reason \nwhy we need to do it.\n  The chart behind us shows in the bars the level of Federal spending, \nand it shows a green line running in about 19, 19.5 percent of the \ngross national product which represents revenues from 1970 through the \nyear 2030.\n  We have had several tax rate increases during that period of time. \nHas it produced more revenue? No. The economy adjusts. When tax rates \ngo up, people adjust their behavior accordingly. Likewise, when we have \nreduced taxes, has it reduced revenues to the Federal Treasury? No. As \na percent of the gross national product, as you can see on that green \nline, revenues remain constant. Now that is in a growing economy.\n  So despite the fact that the economy is growing larger, revenues to \nthe Treasury are keeping up when you reduce taxes, and that is one of \nthe reasons that we want to reduce the taxes, both on capital gains so \nthat people can sell assets that they have been holding but do not want \nto pay 28 percent tax on the profit they make on that--profit which is \nlargely generated by inflation, by the way, so it is not real profit at \nall--and why we are interested in the $500 tax credit for children. \nThat helps to restore the balance in who does the spending.\n  One of our colleagues was here yesterday talking about cuts in \neducation, and I made the point that we are not talking about cuts in \nspending on education. What we are talking about is who does the \nspending. Who do you think can do a better job of making decisions on \nhow to spend money on our children, a Federal bureaucrat in Washington \nor the family of that child? We say leave the money with the family \nthat earned it. They will make smarter decisions about what to spend on \nthat child.\n  So, Mr. President, my point is this: There is more to this than just \nthe pure economics of it, than the dollars and cents of it. That is \ncritical. It is very important. But there is more to it than that. It \nis fundamentally what our society is all about. We are trying to reduce \nthe power, the authority, the intrusiveness of the Federal Government \ninto our lives.\n  We are trying to restore power to the States and local governments \nand to the families. One way we do that is by giving the Federal \nGovernment less money to spend and by limiting the growth in that \nspending to the revenues that we take in.\n  The other way we do it is by not just limiting how much money the \nFederal Government takes in, but by actually reducing it through \nselected tax cuts. I think it is very important, as the House of \nRepresentatives will do in the next 3 days, as they will pass these \nreductions in taxes, it is very important for the U.S. Senate to follow \nsuit, to follow what the House of Representatives does. We do not \nnecessarily have to cut exactly the same taxes and the same amount. But \nit is important that we begin to put this Government on a diet, and the \nway to do that is begin to ratchet down the amount of money \n[[Page S5089]] that the Government takes from the workers of our \nNation, from the families of our Nation, and leave that money with them \nto make the decisions on how best to spend it.\n  Mr. President, Members of the freshman Republican class are going to \nbe conducting these conversations every week throughout this entire \nyear, I suspect even beyond that, to try to make the point that we just \nheard from the voters out there, we heard what was on their minds. We \nlistened, and I am still hearing the same thing: They want us to reduce \nthe power and the size and the expense of the Federal Government. And \nwe freshmen Republicans are committed to that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota brings that \nmessage from the recent election as well.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n                          the deficit lockbox\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to dispell a misconception \nthat has become popular in Washington--the idea that tax cuts cannot go \nhand in hand with deficit reduction.\n  There are some who suggest that the massive deficit we have today is \ndue to the tax-cutting policies of the 1980's.\n  What they ignore is the fact that during the 1980's, the number of \njobs increased, the amount of taxable income increased, and as a \nresult, tax revenues increased--all due to the Reagan tax cuts.\n  What did not happen were the spending cuts promised by Congress but \nnever delivered.\n  In fact, spending during the 1980's increased significantly more than \nthe increase in revenue, leading directly to the deficit we face today.\n  This year we are on the verge of making the same mistake, but in the \nopposite direction.\n  This time, Congress may pass spending cuts without providing the tax \nrelief we promised the American people.\n  One of the worst ideas I have heard during the budget debate, and \nfrankly, it came from a member of my own party, was the idea of a \ndeficit lockbox to stall enactment of the $500 per-child tax credit.\n  Under the lockbox proposal, the tax cuts promised by Congress would \nbe repealed if Congress fails to meet specific deficit targets.\n  In other words, if Congress were to act as irresponsibly in the \nfuture as it has in the past, Congress would not suffer the \nconsequences, Washington would not suffer the consequences.\n  The taxpayer would.\n  Even now, our colleagues in the House have come up with a compromise \nto tie tax cuts to deficit reduction. If the deficit targets are not \nmet, the tax cuts are not delivered. But is it not just like Congress \nto think that way?\n  If we were not in a collegial body, I would say the idea was just \nplain stupid. Instead, let me just label it misguided.\n  Mr. President, we cannot compromise the taxpayers of this country or \nthe future of their children.\n  Instead of a deficit lockbox involving tax cuts, what we should have \nis the automatic spending reduction mechanism Senator Coats and I have \nproposed in our Families First bill.\n  Under our legislation, if Congress fails to keep the growth of \nspending capped at 2 percent each year, an automatic, across-the-board \nsequester, excluding Social Security, would take effect.\n  In other words, every spending program would be held to a growth rate \nof 2 percent.\n  That way, Congress would have to pay the price for its own failings. \nCongress would have to explain to the taxpayers why they couldn't make \nthe tough choices to slow the rate of growth of spending in order to \nbalance the budget.\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that deficit reduction must be a top \npriority of this Congress.\n  But it is also clear that tax relief is equally urgent. And while \nthere are some in this Chamber who say the two cannot go hand in hand--\nI say the two must go hand in hand. We cannot allow the opponents of \nmiddle-class tax relief to pit one against the other.\n  Mr. President, I am reminded of the animal trainer who walks into the \nlion cage.\n  There is a lion to the left of him and a tiger to the right. Both are \nready to devour him if he makes a wrong move.\n  Do you believe for one instant that the lion-tamer will be foolish \nenough to focus his attention on either animal, while completely \nignoring the other?\n  Like the lion-tamer, Congress is facing a pair of equally dangerous \nbeasts.\n  In one corner looms the Federal deficit, in the other sits the \noppressive tax burden American families are being asked to bear.\n  We cannot ignore one at the expense of the other. They both need to \nbe dealt with before they overpower us and eat this Nation alive.\n  The mandate of the November election is clear, and the people are \ndemanding change.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                       Need for a Balanced Budget\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussions of \nmy distinguished Senators and fellow Republican freshmen from \nMinnesota, Arizona, and Wyoming.\n  Our discussion this morning is on the balancing of our Nation's \nbudget. And, again, coming off the campaign trail, coming to this \ndistinguished body, I believe that there is no more pressing issue than \nbalancing the budget before this Congress. Along with my 10 other \nfellow Republican freshmen Senators and over 70 freshmen Republican \nMembers of the House, I was elected with a simple mandate: to restore \nfiscal sanity to the Federal Government.\n  If this Congress today does not take steps to change the profligate \nspending habits of the Federal Government, the Members of this \nCongress, Republicans and Democrats alike, will be to blame for leaving \nan enormous mountain of debt to be paid by our children, the next \ngeneration, and future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot continue the current trend of Federal \nspending. Already the Federal debt is fast approaching $5 trillion. A \nfamily of four currently pays $440 per month in taxes just to pay the \ninterest on our national debt. For the long term, the statistics are \nastounding. By the year 2000, just 5 years away, the Federal debt will \nexceed $6.7 trillion. This trend creates a debt of $25,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in America. That is a debt burden of $100,000 for \nevery family in this country, a debt burden created by this body over \nthe past several decades.\n  Speaker Gingrich noted recently that a child born today will pay \n$187,000 in interest on the Federal debt during his or her lifetime, if \ncurrent spending continues unchecked.\n  Mr. President, as shown in this chart behind me, all Federal revenues \nwill be consumed by entitlement spending in less than 15 years. This is \n1970, 1990, the year 2000, the year 2010, 15 years from now. The \ngreenline here are total revenues brought in. Expenditures are the \ncolumn, the red being entitlement spending, the yellow net interest and \nthe blue discretionary spending, like defense, education, and \ninfrastructure. By 2010, all revenues will be spent for entitlement \nspending, as well as net interest with no money left over for things \nlike defense, education, support of our infrastructure unless we do \nsomething about it today.\n  Every group interested in deficit reduction today, from the Concord \nCoalition to the Kerrey-Danforth entitlement commission has recognized \nthat the long-term health of the Federal budget depends on the ability \nof this Congress to restrain growth of Federal programs. In fact, the \nboard of trustees of the Medicare trust fund will come out today with \nan annual report. It says that the Medicare Program is predicted to be \nbankrupt in 7 years. At the beginning of fiscal year 1997, the Medicare \ntrust fund will begin to run a cash-flow deficit. Medicare is just one \nof the many Federal programs that must be restructured, be improved, \nrestructured by allowing more choice for seniors in order to achieve \nlong-term viability.\n  But, Mr. President, there are powerful interests that have already \nbegun to resist even initial efforts to curb Federal spending. \nDefenders of the status quo would have us believe that there is no \nwaste in Federal programs, that all of our Federal programs are \n[[Page S5090]] run efficiently, that there is no room to trim back this \nmammoth Federal bureaucracy. Yet, a Florida task force recently \nuncovered more than $100 million in Medicare and Medicaid fraud and \nabuse, according to the Health Care Financing Administration.\n  Opponents of spending reform argue that we must spend more and not \nless, out of compassion. Mr. President, where is the compassion for the \nchildren of the next generation? The debate about Federal spending is \nmore than a debate about cold budget numbers. It is a debate about \nrestoring the American dream for future generations, making that \nAmerican dream a reality for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I wonder what the opponents of Federal spending reform \nwill tell their grandchildren when they are paying lifetime income tax \nrates of 84 percent to pay off the debt we created, when they cannot \nafford college tuition or a mortgage on their first home. Will it past \nmuster to say we just could not find a way to reduce the growth?\n  To reduce the growth, we are not talking about cutting spending in \nthe sense that an American family today thinks of cutting spending. \nPeople in Washington engage in what I call Congress-speak. In Congress-\nspeak, cutting spending means letting a program grow at 4 instead of 5 \npercent. If you told an American family today that they could spend 4 \npercent more next year than this year, they would think they are doing \npretty well. Not here. Not in Congress. The liberals in Congress \nshamelessly oppose such reforms, leaving the public to believe that \nGovernment services will be drastically reduced. In reality, all of the \nhue and cry is not about compassion for the poor or children, but \ninstead about a desperate attempt to maintain the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, by the outcry in Washington over even modest savings \nproposals, you would think the Federal Government is about to pack up \nand go home. Far from it. The Federal Government will spend \napproximately $9 trillion over the next 5 years. To get a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, we must save $385 billion in mandatory \nspending. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has called the task \nof balancing the Federal budget a modest restructuring. While the job \nof balancing the Federal budget will be difficult, by no means will it \nresult in drastic reductions in Government services or benefits. I \nbelieve Americans are ready to tighten their belts, so long as our plan \nis fair and balanced.\n  Yes, it disturbs me that the President has not joined Republicans in \nthe task of achieving a balanced Federal budget. As shown in this chart \nwhich depicts Federal budget deficits, the Clinton plan is in red \nversus the Republican budget here, which comes down to be balanced in \nthe year 2002. We see that the Clinton budget throws up its hands and \nsays that the budget cannot be balanced, keeping $200 billion deficits \nover the next 5 years. The Republican plan, in contrast, balances the \nbudget in the year 2002.\n  The President's advisers are trying to put an effective spin on the \nfact that they have thrown up their hands on any attempt to balance \nthis budget, and they say that the stable deficits over the next 5 \nyears will remain at $200 billion with a deficit declining to 2.1 \npercent of the gross domestic product by the next century. But even \nthose modest claims have been refuted.\n  The Congressional Budget Office took a look at the President's budget \nand found that the President had understated the deficit by \napproximately $209 billion over 5 years. The CBO also found the deficit \nas a percentage of gross domestic product, the administration's \nfavorite measure will actually increase from 2.5 to 3.1 percent. The \nPresident has completely abdicated his duty to lead on fiscal issues.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say a word about economic growth. Not \nonly do we have a moral obligation to reduce the Federal deficit, but \nfrom an economic perspective, we simply must reduce the amount of \nGovernment borrowing in order to free up capital for productive \ninvestment in the private sector.\n  No Government program can substitute for economic growth led by \nentrepreneurs, small businessowners, and other risk takers.\n  Our economy will make room for everyone, but we must unleash \nAmerica's capital for investment and put a stop to massive Government \nborrowing.\n  In closing, we should remember what this debate is all about. It is \nabout the moral imperative to pay off a debt we created. It is about \nthe responsibility we have to the children of future generations. It is \nabout increasing economic growth and access to capital. And it is about \nthe strength of our system to survive.\n  If we cannot stand up to those who would oppose real reform, then our \nvery democracy is threatened.\n  I thank the Chair, and I would like to yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first congratulate my colleague \nfrom Tennessee for his description of the problem that we face.\n  I think it is appropriate and significant that this week, the 11 new \nMembers of this body are coming to the floor to talk about really the \nmost important problem facing our country; that is, our inability to \ndeal with our budget deficit.\n  This week, Mr. President, there is going to be a lot of discussion \nabout the close of the first 100 days of this Congress. There will be \ntalk about the Contract With America.\n  I think that, by and large, the American people are pleased with what \nthey have seen. We have begun to make progress; we have a way to go. We \nhave passed in this body the line-item veto. We failed by one vote to \npass a balanced budget amendment, but I am hopeful, as I know many of \nmy colleagues are and as the majority leader is, that we will get that \none additional vote and that we will be able to come back on this floor \nand pass that balanced budget amendment.\n  We passed the unfunded mandate bill which, for the first time, will \nreally hold Congress accountable for unfunded mandates that are passed \ndown to the local communities with no money, but just telling the \ncommunities what to do.\n  With unfunded mandates, line-item veto, making Congress live by the \nsame laws that everyone else has to live under, I think we have made \nprogress. We have a way to go.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I believe the tough votes are ahead of \nthe Senate, not behind the Senate. I believe that this Congress really \nshould be looked at in two different sections. The first part of the \nCongress deals with the items we have just talked about. Then we will \nmove in--and frankly we have already begun to do this with different \ncommittees--the Budget Committee particularly--to the hardest and most \ndifficult task that we have; that is, to do something that we have not \ndone for a quarter of a century. That is to get ahold of Federal \nspending and bring it under control.\n  I think the American people should understand that this week, while \nthe focus is on the first 100 days, we now must turn to where we go \nfrom here. Mr. President, it is not going to be easy.\n  Over the next few months, the U.S. Senate and this Congress is going \nto face some very, very tough choices. This Congress must do what prior \nCongresses have not done. We have to write a realistic budget for the \nU.S. Government. All Americans must be prepared for what lies ahead. \nMr. President, this will not be pretty. It will not be easy.\n  Indeed, the votes we have cast so far in this body are very easy \ncompared to what lies ahead. We have to begin, Mr. President, by being \nabsolutely candid and honest with the American people about the tough \nchoices that lie ahead.\n  We can no longer postpone the day of reckoning. The day of reckoning, \nMr. President, is here. The current direction of U.S. budget policy is \nsimply not sustainable.\n  Congress has already amassed a $4.7 trillion national debt that our \nchildren and grandchildren will have to pay. That is what the American \npeople in the past election voted to change. The people of this country \ndemand change because they know what is going to happen if we do not \nchange.\n  Mr. President, we are already paying over $235 billion a year just in \ninterest on the national debt. By the year 2003, just 8 years from now, \nspending on entitlements and interest alone will exceed 70 percent of \nthe entire Federal budget.\n  [[Page S5091]] If we take out defense, we leave just 15 percent of \nthe budget for all the discretionary spending on our domestic needs. \nThat is 15 percent of the whole budget--15 percent, Mr. President, for \neducation; job training; for the Women, Infants, and Children Program; \njust 15 percent of all these domestic needs. That is, if we just stay \non our present course.\n  It does not get any better after the year 2003. In fact, it gets \nworse. By the year 2012, just 17 years from today, there will be \nnothing left in the budget for these social needs--zero. No money for \nour children, no money for our future--everything consumed. Every last \nred cent of the Federal budget will go to entitlements and interest \npayments.\n  Mr. President, Congress' fiscal insanity has had a terrible human \ncost. The year 2012, the year the money is scheduled to run out if we \ndo not change our ways, is 1 year after my wife, Fran, and I expect our \ngrandson, Albert, to graduate from high school, and 1 year after our \ndaughter, Anna, should enter college.\n  Mr. President, if we do not succeed in writing a sensible budget, a \nbudget that leads toward balance instead of further and further into \nbankruptcy, I shudder to think of the America we are going to leave \nthese children.\n  Another way of looking at it, when my parents graduated from high \nschool in the early 1940's, the debt attributable to each child \ngraduating from high school that year was $360. By the time my wife, \nFran, and I graduated, in the mid-1960's, that figure was up to $1,600 \nfor each child. When our older children, Patrick, Jill, and Becky, \ngraduated in the mid-to-late 1980's, that figure was up to $9,000. If \nwe continue, Mr. President, to go the way we have been going, by the \ntime our grandson, Albert, graduates from high school in the year 2012, \nthat figure will be up to almost $25,000. That is $25,000 in debt, and \nno money at all to pay for urgent national needs.\n  Mr. President, this is much more than simply a budget question. It is \nmuch more than a question of accounting and bookkeeping. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, it is a fundamental moral question about the kind of people \nwe are, the kind of Americans we are.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I contend that we do not have the right \nto leave our children a bankrupt America. They deserve a lot better. \nThat is why we are here on the floor today.\n  It is our challenge over the coming weeks to create another picture \nof America, another picture of America in the year 2012, an America \nwith a balanced budget, an America that is gradually paying off its \ndebt and coming back to fiscal sanity, an America in which Albert, \nAnna, and other children of their generation are liberated from the \ncrushing burden of debt and have, finally, the freedom to cope with the \nchallenges of the 21st century. That is what, Mr. President, the coming \ndebate is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I heard a discussion this morning about \nfiscal policy, about the future, about Federal deficits, about \naccountability, about jobs, about opportunity. All of those issues \ninterest me and I think interest every Member of this Senate.\n  Our country is, I think, unique in that we have a democratic system \nin which we create some pretty aggressive battles between the parties \nand between the individuals in political parties, contesting ideas. \nEven as we contest those ideas, differences in approaches, and \ndifferent ideas, we essentially have the same goals.\n  The Senator from Ohio, who is now the Presiding Officer, comes from a \nbig State. I am from a small State. He is a Republican. I am a \nDemocrat. I would guess, if we sat and discussed goals, he and I would \nhave very few differences in the goals we have for our country. We want \na country that expands and grows and provides opportunity. We want \nchildren to be well educated. We want our streets to be free of crime. \nWe want our air to be air we breathe without getting sick. We want \nhealth care that is available to us at a decent price. The fact is, we \nwould very quickly discover--as we do all across this country when we \ntalk politics--that our goals are the same. But, our methods of \nachieving those goals take very different paths.\n  Since the first of this year, we have been undergoing some very \ninteresting times. We have, I think, because the American people \nregistered a significant protest in the last election. Since then, we \nhave passed more legislation on more significant issues than Congress \nhas passed during any similar time period in the past.\n  Now, how was that protest registered? What was the score in November \n1994? The American people said by their vote: 20 percent of us who are \neligible to vote, voted for the Republicans; 19 percent of us who are \neligible to vote, voted for the Democrats; and 61 percent of us who are \neligible to vote decided it does not matter. They said, ``I am not \ngoing to vote.''\n  So that is the score: 20 percent to 19 percent--but 61 percent said, \n``Count me out, I am not going to participate in that process.''\n  As a result of the 20-to-19 victory, there is a great clamor about \nwhat in politics is called a mandate for the Republicans. Probably only \nin politics could you get a mandate from a 20-to-19 victory.\n  You see, they had printed something called a Contract With America. \nIn fact, on the House side, Speaker Gingrich--now Speaker Gingrich, but \nthen Congressman Newt Gingrich--lined all the Republicans up in front \nof the Capitol, had the television cameras there, and had them all sign \nthis little contract called the Contract With America which proposed \nsome very substantial changes.\n  Some of that Contract With America made eminent good sense. In fact, \nsome of it embraced the very things we tried to pass in the previous \nsession of Congress here in the U.S. Senate, that the Republicans \nfilibustered and opposed. They prevented us from getting it passed.\n  That is fine. Times change and so do opinions, and so the contract \nembraced some of the very things that we supported and tried to get \ndone.\n  Since that election and since this contract the Senate has passed \nsome of those things that make good sense. I supported them, as did \nmost of my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle.\n  Unfunded mandates: Let us decide to stop telling everybody else what \nthey have to do while saying to them you pay for it. Mandates are easy. \nUnfunded mandates are even easier. But it is irresponsible, and we \npassed legislation that says let us be more responsible when we talk \nabout mandates. Let us find out what it is going to cost somebody and \nmaybe let us decide, if we are going to stick them with a mandate, we \nhave a responsibility to pay the bill. We passed an unfunded mandates \nbill that made good sense.\n  Congressional accountability: In effect saying if you pass a bill in \nCongress you have a responsibility to live under that same law you \npassed. It made good sense. I supported that this year and I supported \nit in the previous Congress as well.\n  Regulatory 45-day veto? That made good sense. I supported that. It is \nsaying let us stop these unintended consequences. When we pass a law \nthat we think is going to be a good law and somebody puts out a half-\ngoofy regulation, let us have the opportunity to veto the regulation if \nit does not work, if that is not what we meant. I voted for that as did \nalmost all of my colleagues. It made good sense.\n  Line-item veto: That was more controversial, but I voted for it \nbecause Governors have it--almost all Governors have a line-item veto.\n I have thought for 10 years that a President ought to have a line-item \nveto.\n\n  That is a menu of things we have done that make good sense.\n   [[Page S5092]] There are other things that have been done since the \nfirst of the year that make no sense at all. I want to talk about some \nof them as well. Because there is, it seems to me at least in some \nmargins in this public policy debate, a mean-spiritedness, one in which \npeople say, ``Well, I won, and what I intend to do now is help my \nfriends and I do not care about the rest.''\n  Unfortunately, some of those who won have very wealthy and very \npowerful friends, and those friends are getting some very big help.\n  We also have in this country some very vulnerable people. We have \nhomeless, we have poor, we have people who are down and out, people who \nare suffering, and we have a lot of children who count on us and look \nto us. The fact is too many of these constituencies have been given the \ncold shoulder in the last several months.\n  Let me start with a central question of deficits because the Senator \nfrom Ohio talked about that. I agree with him. I think the Federal \nbudget deficit cripples this country's ability to grow, and we must \ndeal with it. We had a proposal on the floor of the Senate to amend the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget. In fact, we had two votes on \nan amendment to the Constitution, one of which I voted for, one of \nwhich I voted against. I did not vote for the one that would loot the \nSocial Security trust fund to provide the money to balance the budget \nbecause I do not believe that is honest budgeting.\n  But it is interesting. I noticed yesterday in a publication called \nThe Congress Daily that a Member of the Senate, one of leaders in the \nSenate, said that there is a feeling among some Senate Republicans that \nwe should not move toward a balanced budget in our budget resolution--\nwhich they are required to bring to the floor--because if we did, we \nwould lose steam to move toward a balanced budget amendment in the \nConstitution.\n  In other words, if the Senate shows it can achieve a balanced budget \nwithout changing the Constitution, that would be a problem. I read this \nlast evening, and I could not believe anybody could really say that. \nBut that's what was said: ``We should not try to balance the budget \nbecause, if we did, that would take the steam out of the initiative to \nchange the Constitution.''\n  Now, I ask you. What is the most important thing that we have facing \nus? Balancing the Federal budget or changing the Constitution? \nBalancing the Federal budget. We can do that without changing the \nConstitution.\n  The fact is, if we changed the Constitution 2 minutes from now, 3 \nminutes from now, we would not have made one penny's worth of \ndifference in the deficit. We ought to, with every single budget \nresolution that comes to the floor of this Senate, grit our teeth and \nroll up our sleeves and start doing the heavy lifting that is required \nto balance the budget.\n  But this sort of nonsense, saying as some say, that maybe we should \nnot move toward a balanced budget with our budget resolution because \nthat will take the steam out of this effort to change the Constitution \nis just ridiculous. What on Earth can they be thinking of? How absurd a \nposition.\n  Well, nothing surprises me much anymore.\n  But the cynicism expressed by those who would argue that we should \nnot balance the budget because that will take the steam out of our \neffort to change the basic framework of our government, the \nConstitution, is both amazing and appalling to me. It really ranks very \nhigh up there on the scale of cynicism.\n  Our job is to do the work here, not to take the pose.\n  So, the first requirement and first job for us is to address this \nbudget deficit honestly, because to do that then opens up opportunity \nin the future and economic growth. Failure to do that means that we \nconsign this country to slow anemic economic growth, an economic future \nnone of us want for our children.\n  Even as we do that, I want to say that the job requires spending \ncuts. Yes. It requires significant spending cuts.\n  I am always interested in seeing how people characterize spending \ncuts because there is some notion around here that one political party \nwants a lot of spending cuts and the other political party essentially \ndoes not want any spending cuts.\n  It is alleged that one side, the majority side, the Republican side, \nare tigers when it comes to cutting spending. The other side? Gee, they \njust want to spend more.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not a plugged \nnickel's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats in terms \nof how much money they want to spend.\n  All you have to do is look at the record, and you can look at the \nrecord for 15 years. Oh, there is a substantial difference in what they \nwant to spend money for, but there is not a plugged nickel's worth of \ndifference in how much money they want to spend.\n  During the last 15 years, we have had mostly Republican Presidents. \nCongress has spent less than Presidents have requested in their \nbudgets. Translated--Republican Presidents have requested more spending \nthan Democratic Congresses up until this Congress have actually spent.\n  I see the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee is \non the floor. I have heard him refer to this as well. The question is, \n``Who has the appetite to spend how much money?''\n  There is some notion that the Republicans always want to cut \nspending, that they are for less spending and the Democrats are for \nmore spending. The record does not show that to be true.\n  Yes, there is a difference in how we want to spend money. The \nRepublicans always want to pack more money into the defense pipeline. \nThey say, ``You cannot spend enough in defense for us.''\n  In fact, at a time when we have this massive deficit, at a time when \nthe Soviet Union has evaporated and gone, the Republicans are saying \nwhat we really need to do now is we need to start building star wars \nonce again. If we can just resurrect star wars, somehow we will all \nsleep better. America will have a better future.\n  The fact is they will resurrect star wars and cut school lunches and \nsay Democrats want to restore school lunches so they are big spenders. \nIt does not wash. It does not work. The evidence does not demonstrate \nthat what is being alleged on the floor of the Senate is true.\n  Both sides of the political aisle in the U.S. Senate by and large \npropose about the same measure of public spending. We simply disagree \non what the money ought to be spent for. That is a legitimate \ndisagreement. It is a legitimate disagreement, it seems to me, for one \nside to say we want to cut our revenue base in a way that provides the \nbulk of the benefits to those families who make over $100,000 a year; \nto say, ``We want to increase spending for star wars because we think \nit is necessary for our Nation's defense.'' That is a legitimate thing \nto say and do. I do not happen to agree with it. But certainly it is an \nidea, a bad idea but an idea.\n  On the other hand, they would say to us, as we intend to cut taxes, \nthe bulk of the benefit of which will go to wealthiest Americans, and \nas we intend to start building a new gold-plated weapons system--which, \nin my judgment, we do not need--they would say, let us now, in order to \npay for all of this, cut funding for foster care--as they have done--\nlet us decide that nutrition programs should go to the States in the \nform of block grants, and we will cut the block grants. Then we will \nlet the States use 20 percent of the money we have now cut to do \nanything they want to do with, including creating pork projects or \nbuilding roads, having nothing to do with nutrition.\n  Then they say, Well, let us cut adult literacy grants for the \nhomeless. Let us decide to eliminate funding for summer youth programs. \nLet us decide to end the entitlement or the requirement that poor kids \nought to get a hot lunch at school. Let us decide, they say, to cut \n1995 funding for financial aid for needy students to attend college. \nLet us decide, they say, to cut legal services to the poor back to \nzero. Let us decide, they propose, to cut 1995 funding for the Healthy \nStart infant mortality initiative.\n  This is a country, incidentally, that ranks way down, when you rank \nfrom best to worst in countries on infant mortality.\n  They say, we do not have money here to fund that. Let us cut that \nbecause we want to go off and build star wars. We want to provide tax \ncuts, much of which will go to the wealthy. And of \n[[Page S5093]] course, my favorite, Let us propose--while we are \ncutting all of these things that would try to give a decent opportunity \nto those who are down and out, to those who are disadvantaged, to those \nwho suffer, to those who are unfortunate enough to be young, the \nchildren in this country,--they say--We don't have enough money to \nrespond to that, but maybe we should give them all a laptop computer.\n  ``Let us give laptop computers to the poor. That will just sort of \nunleash a whole series of opportunities.'' They actually said that.\n  The second prize, it seems to me, goes to the folks who say we should \nget additional revenue for the Federal Government by charging an \nadmission fee to tour the U.S. Capitol. I only come from a town of 300, \nbut I suspect if you proposed in a town of 300 that you should charge \nsomebody to tour a house they own they would laugh you out of town, \nsaying you were not thinking straight.\n  My point this morning is if we are going to celebrate the first 100 \ndays, we ought to be look at what is really going on.\n  When I started these remarks today, I said that I think there is \nmerit in some of the proposals that have been passed by the Congress on \na bipartisan basis during these first several months. I supported some \nof them because I thought they made a lot of sense.\n  Now, some of those proposals, the current majority party filibustered \nagainst in the last session of Congress and would not allow to be \npassed. But then came this Congress, and they said, ``We want to pass \nthem,'' and we joined them and said, ``This makes sense. We supported \nthis before and support it now.'' And we passed unfunded mandates, \ncongressional accountability, regulatory veto. All of those make sense, \nand I supported them.\n  But there is much more to the story than just that.\n  The first 100 days, when it is celebrated this week, will be \naccompanied by a chart that shows the first 100 ways as well. The first \n100 days and the first 100 ways in which the majority party in this \nCongress decided to use their power to help their friends, the wealthy \nand the big, powerful, economic interests in the country at the expense \nof a lot of vulnerable Americans.\n  Those are exactly the priorities they have exhibited.\n  Anybody who thinks that the priorities in this country should be to \ngive a big tax break to very, very wealthy Americans so that we can \njustify taking a school lunch entitlement away from a poor kid, or to \ntake opportunity away from America's children in dozens of ways--in \nnutrition programs, in education programs, and dozens of other ways--\ndoes not understand there is still a lot of fight left in a lot of us \nwho care about what is right for this country.\n  This country, and this country's future rests on our ability and our \nwillingness to invest in our children. It is that simple. A country \nthat turns its back on its children and decides selfishly to provide \nmore comfort to the already comfortable is a country that is not \nthinking ahead.\n  We have before us in the Senate now a amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle on the rescission package. This is a proposal that is the first \nof a series of proposals that we will offer in this Congress that \nrepresents our commitment to kids.\n  If this country cannot afford to decide to invest in its kids, to \ntake care of its children, to care about its children; if we cannot do \nthat in a whole range of areas, from school financial aid, to giving \nkids the opportunity to go to college if they do not have any money, to \nschool hot lunches to allow poor kids the only hot meal they are going \nto eat during that entire day, to money that protects children against \nfamily abuse and violence; if we do not have the capability as a \ncountry to decide that these are our priorities, then this country, in \nmy judgment, does not have its heart in the right place.\n  I think this country understands what the priority is. The priority \nis our children, because our children are our future. The amendment \nthat has been offered by Senator Daschle in this Chamber to the \nunderlying legislation talks about these programs: Women, Infants, and \nChildren--the WIC program. Anyone who has seen anything or knows \nanything about the WIC program understands it is a program that works.\n  I almost hesitate to describe it again because almost everyone should \nknow it. But here's how it works. A low-income mother who does not have \nresources and does not have money but is pregnant, is going to have a \nbaby. She needs help feeding it, both before it is born and after.\n  WIC provides that help.\n  We understood a long time ago that if you provide the correct \nnutrients and provide nutritious help to that young mother, she is \ngoing to have a child that will not have to spend an extra 4, 5, or 10 \ndays in the hospital because the baby was a low-birthweight baby \nbecause she was unable to provide needed nutrition to that fetus while \nshe was carrying it in her.\n  We have discovered that for just a few dollars a month--for only a \nfew months--we will save an enormous amount of money and provide an \nopportunity for that poor woman to have a healthy child.\n  That is a wonderful program. There is no waste. It is not money. It \nis certificates to buy juice and eggs and specific kinds of nutrients. \nIt is one of the best programs the Federal Government has ever offered \nand it saves enormous amounts of money and is very helpful to children.\n  The Head Start Program. Gee, I do not think anybody who has toured a \nHead Start center can adequately debate any longer whether that program \nis helpful to children who come from families that are disadvantaged, \nlow-income families. You see these young boys and girls at Head Start \ncenters getting a head start in circumstances where they would \notherwise be left behind. You see their mothers and their fathers \nthere, some of them, getting an education, also at this Head Start \ncenter. They are learning about nutrition programs, about hygiene, \nabout how to raise children. It is a wonderful program that produces \nenormous rewards.\n  We ought to understand by now what works and then invest in it, not \ncut it. We ought not cut the WIC Program--Women, Infants, and Children \nfeeding program--or cut Head Start in order to fund a tax cut for some \nof the wealthiest Americans. We ought not to cut Head Start in order to \nfund the Star Wars Program. That does not make any sense to me.\n  I could go on, and there are about 10 or 15 similar initiatives that \nwe have that I think represent the best in this country, an impulse and \na determination to make life better for our children, to decide that \nyou cannot move ahead as a society by leaving some else behind.\n  You just cannot do that. You have to care about people, especially \nthe most vulnerable people.\n  I started by talking about how we in this Chamber share largely \nsimilar goals. I think that is true. I think most of us would agree \nthat there is a requirement and an incentive in this country that must \nbe exhibited to say to people,''You have a responsibility for \nyourselves as well.''\n  ``Yes, we are going to help. We will extend a helping hand when you \nare down and out, but you have a responsibility to pull yourself up and \nstep up and stand up and create opportunity for yourself.''\n  That is true. I understand all that.\n  But it is hard to say that to an 8-year-old kid. It is hard to look \nin the eye of a kid, as I did one day, a 9-year-old kid from New York \nCity named David, who said to us that it hurts to be hungry. He said, \n``No kid like me should have to lay their head down on their desk at \nschool because it hurts to be hungry.'' You cannot look a child like \nthat in the eye and say it does not matter.\n  These programs do matter. The choices being made here during the \nfirst 100 days have real consequences in the lives of young children. \nAnd that is what this debate is about. It is about what are our \nresponsibilities and how do we meet those responsibilities.\n  I start with the understanding that there is good will on all sides. \nI am not claiming one side is all wrong and one side is all right. In \nfact, I think a lot of new ideas that have been generated and developed \nwill advance the interests of this country.\n  But there are also some timeless truths that we ought to understand.\n   [[Page S5094]] New ideas will never replace the timeless truth that \nwe have a responsibility for our children in this country.\n  Time and time again this year, some of us will come to this floor to \ntalk about our commitment to children, our commitment to our kids, \nbecause that is a commitment to America's future. But it needs to be \nmore than talk.\n  If we decide that we do not have adequate resources to invest in our \nchildren's lives, in our children's opportunities, in our children's \npotential, then this country will never achieve its full potential.\n  That is what the debate will be about on the Daschle amendment. It \nwill be a debate that will recur and recur and recur throughout this \nyear as those of us who believe kids are a priority come to the floor \nto fight for kids and for their future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5091-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5094-S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             REGARDING IRAN\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss Iran. While \nthis administration contemplates its next move regarding Iran, the \nbrutal terrorist regime in Iran is plotting its next move. Will it \nreinforce its troops on disputed islands in the Persian Gulf, or will \nit add to its weapons stocks in the region? Only the regime in Teheran \nknows.\n  What we do know, is that this band of terrorists is planning an \noffensive military buildup. It is planning for the projection of its \naggressive actions even further in the region. This administration \nshould take this to heart and not appease these terrorists like it did \nwith the dictators in Pyongyang. What the administration should do is \nsupport my legislation banning all trade with Iran and place sanctions \non those foreign corporations that continue to trade with Iran.\n  To this end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nfollowing the text of my remarks, the February 1995 edition of the \nFocus on Iran. This publication details current events in Iran, with \nthis particular issue centering on Iran's ongoing efforts to obtain \nnuclear weapons.\n  This is a vitally important issue and this important brief will shed \nfurther insight into a dangerous regime bent on violence and \naggression.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n           Iran: Nuclear Weapons and Irresponsible Leadership\n\n                  [From Focus on Iran, February 1995]\n\n       Within the past year, much attention was given to Iran's \n     continuous military rebuilding effort since its disastrous \n     and costly war with Iraq. In particular, there has been great \n     emphasis on Iran as a potential regional military power, and \n     more ominously, as a potential nuclear power. The realisation \n     of Iran as both a regional and nuclear power would certainly \n     cause concern to its neighbors. The international community--\n     particularly the United States--is concerned with two \n     developments. First is the growing conventional and nuclear \n     capability of Iran, and second, the increasing \n     authoritarianism of the Rafsanjani regime and its support for \n     domestic and international terrorism.\n       It is a truism based on historical experience that the \n     greater the absoluteness/authoritarianism of a regime, the \n     less its confidence in dealing with the international \n     community, and the more likely it would resort to force to \n     solve problems. In this context, the current regime in Tehran \n     could hardly be considered a responsible and reliable \n     participant for ensuring regional peace, stability and \n     security.\n       It is clearly recognized that all nations have fundamental \n     rights to provide for their own national security interests \n     and those of others through mutual security treaties such as \n     NATO, the former Warsaw Treaty Organization and other \n     regional security pacts. Moreover, Iran itself, prior to the \n     revolution of 1979, was a member of the former Central Treaty \n     Organization (CENTO) together with the United States, United \n     Kingdom, Turkey and Pakistan. Subsequently, the former regime \n     undertook mutual security agreements with the United States. \n     All the preceding agreements, treaties, pacts, etc., alluded \n     to above, were undertaken by governments on the basis of \n     perceived defensive security needs, with no outward \n     declaration of aggressive intent. This in contrast to the \n     bellicose rhetoric and state-sponsored terrorist and \n     subversive activities of Iran's present regime. It is no \n     wonder that a more powerful and nuclear-armed Iran, \n     controlled by the clerics, poses a great concern for future \n     regional peace and security.\n       Traditionally, Iran's security defense policy has been \n     dictated by its geostrategic situation: From World War II to \n     1979, for defense against threats from the north, Iran relied \n     heavily on the US deterrence. After the clerics took over in \n     1979, and especially after the aborted rescue mission of the \n     US hostages, Iran, although its foreign policy was nominally \n     ``neither East nor West'', tacitly relied on the Soviet \n     deterrence against possible US attack.\n       After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the Iraqi \n     invasion of Kuwait, and consequently, the defeat of Saddam \n     Hussein, Iran decided to put its energy and resources to \n     develop weapons of mass destruction, not for defensive \n     purposes, but to give Iran leverage to lead the Muslim World. \n     In November 1991, Mr. Mohajerani, Vice-President of Iran, \n     referred to Iran's activity to develop nuclear weapons. He \n     said Moslem nations including Iran must acquire nuclear \n     capability that would make them strong. This idea was \n     probably reinforced after the Iraqi defeat in the Persian \n     Gulf War, by the Indian Defense Chief, who reportedly said in \n     an interview that one of the results of the Gulf War was ``* \n     * * never challenge the US unless you have nuclear weapons''.\n\n\n                       the post war arms build-up\n\n       Since the end of the war with Iraq (in 1988), Iran has \n     undertaken an extensive rebuilding and upgrading of its \n     greatly depleted armed forces, as might be expected, \n     especially since the threat from its recent adversary, Iraq, \n     is real, even though seemingly lessened at present. It is \n     noteworthy that much of Iran's arms purchases are best \n     described as offensive in nature and not necessarily designed \n     to counter what one might imagine to be its real concern, \n     Iraq. For example, since 1988, the arms purchases include: 10 \n     fast attack missile boats, 75 SCUD-C surface-to-surface \n     missiles, an unknown number of Su-24 fighter/bombers, 12 Tu-\n     22 (Backfire) bombers, 72 AS-16 (Kickback) air-to-ground \n     missiles, and three Kilo-class ocean-going submarines (two \n     already delivered and one to be delivered soon). In addition, \n     there are on order other weapons systems with both offensive \n     and defensive capabilities.\n       Of particular interest in the above listing is the SCUD-C \n     procurement from North Korea, because of the potential \n     offensive threat it poses to Iran's neighbors to the South. \n     It must be noted that this missile system is capable of being \n     fitted with both conventional as well as nuclear warheads. \n     Furthermore, there is every likelihood that the clerical \n     regime in Iran will purchase the NO-DONG-1 medium-range \n     ballistic missile or its follow-on, within the next five \n     years, also from North Korea. With a range of about 600-800 \n     miles and improved accuracy, the NO-DONG missile would be a \n     direct threat to Israel, more so than the SCUD-B system \n     deployed by Iraq in the Persian Gulf War of 1991.\n       The acquisition of several ocean-going submarines and fast \n     attack missile boats presents a realistic threat to Persian \n     Gulf oil flow, in as much as these naval craft could easily \n     block the Straits of Hormuz by a missile or underwater \n     attack. In the hands of an unstable and irrational regime, \n     they also pose a direct danger to the U.S. and Allied naval \n     vessels needing to access the Persian Gulf in periods of \n     crises.\n       The acquisition of the long range Tu-22 (Backfire) bomber \n     has no other use than extending Iran's offensive ``punch'' \n     far into the Indian Ocean (against the U.S. and Allied \n     Navies) or to the entire Middle East and beyond; a capability \n     far beyond the accepted defensive needs of the clerical \n     regime.\n                       The Nuclear Weapons Issue\n\n       The ``conventional'' arms threat is multiplied many times \n     over when nuclear weapons are added to the equation. Much has \n     been written recently concerning the activities of the \n     clerical regime in regards to its involvement in the \n     development of nuclear weaponry. The question does not seem \n     to be one of the probability of such a development, but one \n     of timing. In a recent article in The New York Times (January \n     4, 1995), Chris Hedges wrote a detailed and well-crafted \n     article indicating that in five years, Iran may be able to \n     fabricate a nuclear weapon, with the fissionable materials \n     supplied by its nuclear facilities at Bushehr. If we examine \n     the ``conventional'' weapons already purchased or on order, \n     it is apparent that most of these systems can be readily \n     adapted and modified to carry and deliver nuclear weapons.\n       In order to place the potential ``nuclear threat'' in \n     proper perspective, it must be recognized that we are dealing \n     with a contingency that is at least two to five years in the \n     future. It will depend on the clerical regime's ability to \n     receive or develop the requisite technological capability, \n     and produce sufficient nuclear fuel, at which time the threat \n     does became apparent and a focal point of international \n     concern.\n       Apropos the issue of Iran gaining technological competence \n     in nuclear weapons fabrication, much has been written in \n     various intelligence sources. It has been reported that Iran \n     has acquired at least two nuclear weapons (one missile and \n     one 152mm artillery round) from Kazakhstan. Some sources \n     allege that Iran may also be receiving technological \n     assistance from North Korea. In any event, it makes little \n     difference whether Iran currently has nuclear warheads; in \n     time, it will develop the capability either by virtue of its \n     native talents and/or with the help of ``scientists of \n     fortune'' from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n\n\n            The Economic Consequences Of Nuclear Acquisition\n\n       The more compelling question is not whether ``Iran has the \n     bomb'', but rather, \n     [[Page S5095]] why it should want a massive offensive \n     conventional and nuclear strike capability. Secondly, who or \n     what are the ostensible targets requiring such national \n     commitment of human, economic, and material resources, to say \n     nothing of the political capital expended in the \n     international community.\n       The ``why'' of the clerical regime's military build-up can \n     be answered simply as a normal action in light of the recent \n     war with Iraq. More importantly, however, the up-grading of \n     offensive conventional and future nuclear strike capabilities \n     must be seen in the light of the Mullahs' determination to \n     ensure their survival in the seat of power in Tehran, and \n     more ominously for the future, perhaps to further their \n     political-religious goals elsewhere in the Middle East and \n     North Africa.\n       The importance of Iran's current rearming and upgrading of \n     fire-power can be measured in terms of its economic cost to \n     the nation. The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \n     (ACDA) estimates that between 1987-91 the clerical regime \n     ruling Iran spent an estimated US$8-billion in hard currency \n     for weapons imports. At least a similar amount has been spent \n     since 1991 for further purchases of weapons systems. This at \n     a time when the country is experiencing significant economic \n     distress as indicated by the fact that the per capita share \n     of the GNP (i.e. the individual economic worth) has fallen to \n     around $1,000.\n       From these bare economic facts, it is apparent that the \n     clerical regime in Tehran is choosing ``guns over butter'', \n     and, consequently, is perpetuating the economic misery of the \n     Iranian population. Compounding this economic situation is \n     the fact that Iran's external debt is at least US$40-billion, \n     and given the relatively modest world prices for crude oil, \n     Iran's main foreign currency earner, there is little hope for \n     debt reduction in the foreseable future. What this simply \n     means is that as the external debt burden grows, the clerics \n     will find it more difficult to acquire credit for domestic \n     needs such as imports of necessary goods and services that \n     are urgently needed to stop the nation's rapidly declining \n     living standards.\n       Moreover, the great economic burden of the massive arms \n     build-up has serious long term implications for Iran's \n     development of its industrial economic base, notably, the \n     petro-chemical infrastructure. Authorities estimate that Iran \n     needs US$5-billion for repairs, replacement parts and \n     maintenance of its petroleum extraction and processing \n     equipment and facilities, and an additional US$1-billion for \n     the maintenance of attendant petro-chemical equipment. If \n     this investment in the petroleum infrastructure is delayed or \n     slowed down, it is likely that within 15 years, the entire \n     infrastructure will collapse, bringing about economic \n     catastrophe.\n       The salient question is at what cost to the welfare and \n     well-being of the Iranian people, and at what cost to the \n     goodwill and economic credibility within the international \n     community is the clerical leadership willing to expend for \n     illusionary and self-destructive goals of religious \n     fanaticism and domestic and international terrorism.\n\n\n           the likely targets of the clerics' nuclear policy\n\n       The second salient question, given the above discussion \n     regarding the excessive level of rearmament effort, is, who, \n     what and where are the targets of the arms build-up. If one \n     surveys the current Middle Eastern political, relgious and \n     social environment, it becomes evident that there is an array \n     of differences that are not in accord with the clerics' \n     concept of religious ``fundamentalism'' and its attendant \n     political and social ways of life. These range from Israel's \n     inherent Judiac nature, Egptian, and Syrian political \n     secularism, Saudi Arabia's Sunni sectarianism, the economic \n     per capita wealth of the Persian Gulf States, the Turkish \n     security links to the U.S., and the overall instability of \n     the former Soviet Caucuses and Central Asian Republics and \n     Afghanistan.\n       It is well within reason that the clerical leadership in \n     Tehran may perceive some, if not all, of these differences as \n     a threat to its ``way of life'' and ideology. Perhaps they \n     also see them as targets of opportunity for some future date, \n     when through armed threats and other coerive means, they look \n     forward to imposing their hegemony, and forcing them to \n     accede to their religious and political ideology.\n       The clerics' support of political terrorism in Lebanon, \n     Egypt, Sudan, ALgeria and elsewhere lends credence to their \n     once far-fetched claim of converting the world of Islam to \n     Khomeinism. In light of their actions and pronouncements, \n     this indeed may be their first step on the road to achieving \n     their avowed goals.\n       The nuclear strategic doctrine of the Islamic Republic was \n     formulated by ``The Strategic Islamic Research Center'' \n     headed by Hojatol Islam Khoeiniha. Following are the main \n     conclusions and goals of the Center which were reached in a \n     secret meeting in May 1991:\n       1. After the collapse of communism, Islam is the only force \n     and Islamic Republic the only leader and supporter of the \n     liberation of the oppressed masses.\n       2. Iran will naturally be on a collision course with the \n     U.S., and must consider the U.S. a real threat to the Islamic \n     world.\n       3. Iran needs to develop nuclear power and prestige.\n       The result of this meeting, which was never publicized, \n     should not be taken lightly. Nuclear weapons can be either \n     the guarantor of state, or a threat to the whole region and \n     survival of the country itself. The difference lies in the \n     responsibility, wisdom, and the sophistication of the \n     leadership, and the nuclear strategy it adopts. In the hands \n     of responsible leaders, one can assume that nuclear weapons \n     would not be used unless absolute survival of the country was \n     at stake. In the case of the current clerical leadership in \n     Tehran, it could present a real threat.\n       Like the United States, Israel is seen as the ``Satan: the \n     extreme negation of all that is held religiously and \n     politically sacred to the clerics in Tehran. Moreover, the \n     Islamic shrines in Jerusalem must be ``redeemed''. The \n     clerics' success in this effort would most certainly evoke \n     the Moslem masses to respond to its cause and jihad: a tide \n     which none of the Middle Eastern States could withstand.\n       It is the opinion of many specialists that Israel is the \n     lynch-pin for Iranian religious/political hegemony in the \n     Middle East. Others point to the clercs' claim of the right \n     to administer the holy shrines in Mecca and Medina. Another \n     important target is likely to be Egypt which is already \n     facing very serious challenges to its political and economic \n     infrastructure from radical Moslem fundamentalists. The long \n     arm of Khomeinism is most definitely felt in Egypt through \n     the clerics' financial, material and moral support for the \n     Egyptian religious radicals. The fall of the Egyptian \n     Government would be a world-wide political event, and would \n     pose a grave threat to the security of Israel and Saudi \n     Arabia, and, most likely, would destabilize Jordan and \n     Lebanon. The military assets of Egypt in the hands of radical \n     extremists is difficult to contemplate for the United States \n     and its Allies; for Iran, it would be a bounty worth all its \n     effort and cost.\n\n\n                     comments on iranian leadership\n\n       Finally, in our assessment, the current clerical leadership \n     in Tehran seems to be totally incapable of comprehending the \n     dangerous consequences of their course of action. The clerics \n     seem oblivious to the historic lessons of this century. All \n     those who overreached their power paid dearly. Irresponsible \n     policies and actions by irrational and despotic leaders \n     brought untold hardship and misery on the civilian \n     population. The overreaching of military power by the clerics \n     in Iran could bring about the destruction of the Iranian \n     nation. It should be made clear that the imperatives of \n     Iran's security needs are recognized, and the bravery and \n     dedication of its Armed Forces in defending the nation is \n     lauded. It is our belief that the course of military \n     expansion exceeds the requirements for defense of the \n     frontiers against any adversary for the foreseeable future. \n     The course pursued can only lead to the destruction of the \n     patriotic Armed Forces needlessly.\n       In order to prevent the dangers of irresponsible military \n     expansion and adventurism, we categorically support the \n     replacement of the current regime with one dedicated to \n     democratic principles well-grounded in the realities of the \n     international security environment and balance of power \n     concept. Furthermore, we insist that a new regime must have \n     the support, respect and confidence of the Iranian people as \n     well as that of the international community.\n       First and foremost on its agenda must be the well-being of \n     the people, and guarantees for individual freedom and human \n     rights. Along with economic security, it must work to ensure \n     their physical as well as national security. These can be \n     achieved by reversing the current aggression-oriented arms \n     build-up and support for terrorism. Instead, the new \n     leadership must be dedicated to, and must take an active role \n     in promoting regional and world peace.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5094-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to \ncommemorate the long and distinguished life of my dear friend, Richard \nH. Reiners, an outstanding American, who passed away earlier this year.\n  Dick Reiners was born September 24, 1907, on a small farm east of \nLennox, \n[[Page S5096]] SD, and passed away on January 15, 1995, at his rural \nhome north of Worthing, SD. Throughout his life he was dedicated to his \nfamily, his community, and the land on which he lived.\n  As a father and husband, Dick epitomized the term, family values. He \nwas faithful, honest, and loyal, and he passed those values onto his \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  As a member of the community, Dick was constantly active in improving \nthe quality of people's lives. He served on numerous boards, including \nhis church, his children's school district, the Farmers Home \nAdministration, and the South Dakota Farmers Union. He was also \nactively involved in politics and labored tirelessly for the people he \nbelieved in.\n  As a farmer, Dick held a reverence for the land and its capacity for \nproduction. He was a hard worker and an eternal optimist.\n  Dick spoke his mind. He never gave up. He was always a kind and \nthoughtful man.\n  During my travels as a U.S. Senator, I am constantly humbled by the \npeople of my State--people like Dick Reiners and the basic principles \nby which they live their lives: a love of family, an obligation to \ncommunity service, and a strong commitment to an honest day's work. \nThose who knew Dick Reiners learned much from him, and I am honored to \nsay that he was my friend.

HERTER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, March 28, 1995, marked the 100th \nanniversary of the birth of Christian A. Herter, one of Massachusetts' \nand the Nation's most respected leaders and public officials in this \ncentury.\n  After a distinguished early career in the Foreign Service, Chris \nHerter returned to Massachusetts and was elected to the State \nlegislature in 1930 at the age of 35. In the next 6 year, he rose to \nbecome speaker of the house, and 4 years later, he was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives, where he played an influential role in making \nthe Marshall plan a reality.\n  In 1952, the same year President Kennedy was elected to the U.S. \nSenate, Chris Herter was elected Governor of Massachusetts. After \nserving two terms, he accepted the position of Under Secretary of State \nunder John Foster Dulles in the Eisenhower administration, and \nsucceeded Dulles as Secretary of State in 1959. President Kennedy \nthought so highly of him that he appointed him to be U.S. Special Trade \nRepresentative in 1961, and the GATT Agreement still stands as one of \nhis greatest monuments.\n  Christian Herter was admired and respected by leaders and citizens \nalike in Massachusetts, America, and throughout the world. On this \noccasion of the centennial of his birth, Emanuel Goldberg, who served \non his staff as Governor, has written an eloquent tribute to this \nextraordinary son of Massachusetts, and I ask unanimous consent that it \nmay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Centennial of Chris Herter\n\n                         (By Emanuel Goldberg)\n\n       He was one of the Commonwealth's most highly regarded and \n     distinguished public servants, on a tri-level of state, \n     national and international affairs, yet if you questioned \n     people today--senior citizens possibly excepted--I doubt if \n     one in 10 could lucidly recall Christian A. Herter of Millis \n     and Manchester.\n       Last March 28, 1995 was the 100th anniversary of Chris \n     Herter's birth, actually in Paris where his artist parents \n     lived abroad. Twice he became not only a serious presidential \n     prospect when ``Dump Nixon'' drives were surfacing but, in \n     Massachusetts, served as Governor and Speaker of the House \n     and, in Washington, as an outstanding Congressman, Secretary \n     of State in the Eisenhower administration and the first U.S. \n     Trade Negotiator for both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. \n     There is a state scholarship fund in his name--rarely \n     publicized because his family rejected a brick and mortar \n     memorial and preferred practical direct help to needy \n     students. Thanks to former MDC Commissioner John W. Sears, \n     there is also a public park, near Harvard Stadium (Herter's \n     alma mater), named for him. Also an academic chair in \n     international relations at Brandeis and Herter Hall at U. \n     Mass-Amherst.\n       The 1952 gubernatorial election was memorable when underdog \n     Herter in a close election, defeated by 14,500 votes the \n     powerful Democratic incumbent Paul A. Dever. The major \n     campaign issue revolved about Dever's outgoing public works \n     commissioner, Bill Callahan, whose heralded highway program \n     was attacked by Republicans as the most costly in the nation, \n     as well as two and a half times more than the next highest \n     state.\n       The Herter program for Massachusetts was highly and quickly \n     successful because in just one year after taking office, the \n     new administration got through most of its legislative \n     program and also a 25 percent tax reduction in earned income. \n     TIME put Herter on its magazine cover; also labeled him ``to \n     millions, a hero'' (1/18/54). That year he was the only U.S. \n     governor to produce such dramatic tax savings.\n       In the late 1940's, while a Congressman, Herter chaired a \n     19-member delegation that toured 18 foreign countries to lay \n     the foundations for the Marshall Plan. He later won the 1948 \n     Collier's Magazine award as the outstanding Congressman for \n     that historic undertaking. Ironically, then Congressman \n     Richard M. Nixon served on Herter's diligent and highly \n     productive committee. The generous Collier's prize money was \n     later donated by Herter to Washington's Johns Hopkins School \n     for Advanced International Studies, an institution he was a \n     prime mover in founding.\n       The awkward 6' 5\" angularity of Chris Herter caused his \n     military rejection in 1917 (he later suffered from severe \n     arthritis) but catapulted him at once into public service. He \n     served President Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference, \n     in 1918-1919, as Secretary of the American Peace Commission. \n     Following an attache post in Germany's American Embassy, he \n     found himself, at age 22, operating the American legation in \n     Brussels.\n       Thence commenced a close association with Herbert Hoover--\n     Herter becoming at first the future President's principal \n     assistant as executive secretary of the Europe Relief Council \n     and later, when Hoover was named U.S. Secretary of Commerce \n     in 1921,\n      his personal assistant.\n       On a personal level, the jovial, modest Herter, who \n     frequently assuaged his arthritic back pain with bufferin and \n     a cigarette, nevertheless was a fisherman, boatsman, \n     gentleman farmer, breeder of golden retrievers and an expert \n     bridge player. He was one of the Boston Red Sox's greatest \n     fans and reveled in the Governor's prerogative of throwing \n     out the first baseball of the season. One scheduled April \n     opening day, when it actually snowed in Boston, causing the \n     game to be cancelled, this frustrated Governor intentionally \n     messed up a preplanned photo assignment by heaving a huge \n     snowball at (and hitting) this writer, who was supposedly \n     supervising a substitute news picture. My recollection is \n     that simultaneously a distinguished, newly-formed Educational \n     TV Commission was just entering the Governor's office--and \n     its VIP members were quite perplexed to encounter an \n     embarrassed, snow-covered young assistant and a hilariously-\n     roaring chief executive.\n       Actually, Herter was very considerate about his staff's \n     welfare. He was capable, even when busy, of phoning the \n     switchboard operator to inquire about her cold. On one \n     occasion, long after he'd left the Governor's office. Herter \n     traveled from Washington to help a former staff state \n     trooper, who'd encounterd some job difficulty in Boston.\n       Testament to his wide popularity on both sides of the \n     political aisle, when the Undersecretary Chris Herter was \n     nominated by President Eisenhower to succeed John Foster \n     Dulles as U.S. Secretary of State, the Senate on April 21, \n     1959, approved the appointment in 4 hours and 13 minutes. The \n     Senate had suspended its usual confirmation rule of requiring \n     a minimum of seven days.\n       Family-wise, Herter's father, Albert, an internationally \n     renowned artist, created the huge murals now hanging in the \n     Massachusetts House of Representatives. His older brother, \n     Everit, was killed by German shrapnel in World War I. He \n     married the former Mary Caroline Pratt, granddaughter of one \n     of Standard Oil's founders, for whom a memorial garden as \n     been affectionately dedicated in the MDC's Herter Park.\n       Chris and ``Mac'' Herter had four children; Chirstian A. \n     Herter Jr., now teaching at the Hopkins School, who also once \n     served in the Massachusetts legislature; Dr. Frederic P. \n     Herter, a prominent physician at New York's Columbia-\n     Presbyterian Hospital (medicine has also been a long family \n     tradition for an uncle, also named Christian Herter, founded \n     the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, while a \n     young student named Jonas Salk was helped through his \n     doctoral training via a Herter scholarship); E. Miles Herter \n     of Manchester, prominent for years in the Boston financial \n     community, and Mrs. Joseph (Adele) Seronde, wife of a \n     pathologist and a widely admired artist now residing in \n     Arizona. She, collaborating with Kathy Kane, was responsible \n     for bringing ``Summerthing'' to Boston and also originating \n     the outdoor murals that are now emulated throughout the \n     nation.\n       Chris Herter, boots on at 71, was victim of a heart attack \n     on December 30, 1966, while still U.S. Trade Negotiator. \n     Ironically, a day before his passing, Herter, an ardent \n     proponent of free trade, was cheered by news that Britain was \n     lifting tariff restrictions among the European Free Trade \n     Association.\n       Though William F. Buckley, Jr. and Chris Herter (a GOP \n     Young Turk type) were probably at opposite ends of the \n     Republican spectrum, I know of no-one who more precisely \n     summarized Herter's essence than this noted \n     [[Page S5097]] conservative. In a private letter, Bill \n     Buckley commented that Herter was ``a reminder of how \n     civilized the world used to be.''\n       There is a gap: no scholar has yet written a definitive \n     biography about Chris Herter's multi-faceted contribution to \n     history and the public welfare. His gigantic stature, both in \n     size and character, will always remind us that moral and \n     intellectual integrity can flower even in American politics.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5096-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  PINEY WOODS OPRY IN ABITA SPRINGS, LA, RECEIVES ARTS ENDOWMENT GRANT\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those of my \ndistinguished colleagues in the Senate to pay tribute to our colleague, \nSenator Howell Heflin of Alabama who announced his intention to retire \nfrom the Senate at the end of this Congress. I too will miss him, not \nonly as a U.S. Senator, but as a very dear friend.\n  The Senate will not be the same without Howell Heflin. He brought the \nhighest dignity, integrity, and diligence to this body along with his \nunique sense of humor.\n  Mr. President, he is a big man with a big heart; his life is marked \nwith patriotism and service to mankind; clearly Howell Heflin has led \nan unselfish life dedicated to leading and helping people. He was twice \nwounded in World War II as a marine captain while leading his troops in \nbattle on Guam. He was awarded two Purple Hearts and the Silver Star \nfor bravery. As a young trial lawyer in Alabama, he was known as one of \nthe best. His reputation as an excellent lawyer led to his eventual \nelection as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. It just made \nsense that the ``Judge'' would eventually become a member of this \ndistinguished body.\n  As a Member of the Senate, Howell Heflin brought great wisdom, and he \nused this wisdom for 13 years as a member of the Senate Ethics \nCommittee and for two periods he served as its chairman. He has always \nfought for what was right for the country and for his constituents in \nAlabama. Mr. President, people may not agree with Howell Heflin's \ndecisions all the time but they did respect them.\n  Mr. President, I could speak at length about Howell Heflin's many \naccomplishments. But for myself, I will always cherish the close \nfriendship we have enjoyed over the years.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will never be the same without Howell \nHeflin. The people of Alabama and the people of this country have \nbenefited from the service of the ``Judge,'' one of the most \noutstanding Members to have served in this body. I look forward to \nworking with him in the remaining months of the 104th Congress. My wife \nMillie and I wish both his lovely wife ``Mike'' and Judge Howell all of \nGod's blessings. Mahalo for being such a good and faithful servant. \nWell done, Judge.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5097-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, [Mr. Hatfield], the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, wishes to be on the floor when the debate \nstarts and that he wishes a quorum call. I understand he is on his way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, although there are a number of rescissions \nproposed in the amendment by Mr. Dole with which I agree, I am unable \nto vote for the amendment because of its rescissions of appropriations \nfor the Nation's physical infrastructure, its proposed $100 million \ncuts in IRS personnel, and its additional rescission of funding for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  The Dole amendment would cut $323.7 million from appropriations for \nhighway construction. Of this amount, $280 million would be cut on a \npro rata basis from every State's allocation of Federal-aid highway \nfunds. These Federal highway funds are used by the States for highway \nand bridge construction, as well as for reconstruction and repair. \nFederal highway spending is one of the most productive areas of Federal \ninvestment in the creation of new, well-paying jobs. The Dole \namendment, by reducing highway spending by more than $320 million, \nwould cause a loss of up to 20,000 highway construction jobs.\n  Mr. President, while it is true that we have a horrific national debt \nand we must continue to cut Federal deficits, as the pending bill would \ndo, we must simultaneously address our investment deficit in critical \nareas such as our Nation's highways and bridges.\n  And I made this point at the budget summit in 1990, at which time I \nsaid we have not only a trade deficit, we have not only a fiscal \ndeficit, but we also have an investment deficit.\n  For a moment, I would like to recount some of the maladies we will \npass to the next generation for our failure to invest in our \ntransportation infrastructure. So we still have an investment deficit. \nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there are currently more \nthan 234,000 miles of the nearly 1.2 million miles of paved, nonlocal \nroads which were in such bad condition that they require capital \nimprovements either immediately or within the next 5 years. The \nNation's backlog in the rehabilitation and maintenance of our Nation's \nbridges currently stands at $78 billion. According to the Federal \nHighway Administration 118,000 of the Nation's 575,000\n bridges--around one out of five--are structurally deficient. While \nmost are not in danger of collapse, they are required to restrict \nheavier trucks from using them--an action that has an immediate adverse \nimpact on the Nation's economy. Another 14 percent of the Nation's \nbridges are functionally obsolete, meaning they do not have the lane \nand shoulder widths or vertical clearance to handle the traffic they \nbear.\n\n  No area of infrastructure investment is as critical as our Nation's \nhighway system. The system carries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate \ncommerce and more than 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist \ntraffic. I, therefore, strongly oppose the rescission of highway funds \ncontained in the amendment by the majority leader.\n  I am also seriously concerned about the proposed $100 million cut in \nthe Internal Revenue Service Compliance Initiative. This initiative is \ndesigned to generate $9.2 billion in additional revenue over its 5-year \nlife.\n  The Internal Revenue Service advises that it would not be able to \naccommodate a $100 million reduction in personnel funding between now \nand September 30, without furloughing all 70,000 compliance personnel \nfor up to 10 days. A furlough of this magnitude would cost the \nGovernment approximately $500 million in lost tax collections in \naddition to substantial losses in revenue from the 5-year initiative. \nAll of these losses in tax revenues would have the effect of increasing \nthe deficit.\n  I am gravely concerned about the continued plundering of one of this \nNation's cultural lifelines--the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  The majority leader's amendment would cut an additional $86 million \nbelow the committee-passed rescission of $55 million for public \nbroadcasting. This is not thoughtful budget trimming. This is carnival-\ncut politics. It is flash-and-glitter knife tossing. Its intent is to \ngive the illusion that there is some threat to a real target--the \nmassive budget deficit--while, in a great and noisy show, it is merely \npopping balloons around the edges.\n  But, in the case of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, we are \nnot merely popping bright balloons.\n  This knife has sailed into the heart of the crowd. It is hurtling \ntoward children and adults whose lives are bettered by the exposure to \nthe quality educational and cultural programming of public \nbroadcasting.\n  In many communities throughout the Nation, public broadcasting \nprovides the only glimpse some citizens will ever have of faraway \ndestinations, ancient civilizations, and the words of the great \nmasters. It beams into the homes of children their first lessons, in \nmany instances, concerning the alphabet, their first lessons about \nscience and math, and of geography and English literature.\n  Many in my own State of West Virginia, without local access to \ncollege-level classes, rely on public broadcasting for the courses they \nneed to earn a college degree.\n  It is shameful and arrogant for some to sit here in the grandeur of \nthe Nation's Capitol surrounded by museums housing the works of great \nartists, with close-by theaters offering the plays of Shakespeare, \nopera, ballet, and the music of great orchestras and thoughtlessly snip \naway at the only access many of our constituents have to these \ntreasures.\n  So as we debate ways to address the Federal fiscal deficit, many of \nmy colleagues have spoken tirelessly of the debt that we leave to our \ngrandchildren, I am equally concerned with the state of the Nation that \nwe leave behind to our grandchildren--the quality and value of our \nnational assets--the ability of those national assets to provide the \ncapability for sustained economic growth. The true challenge facing \nthis Congress is how to address the Federal fiscal deficit and our \nNation's infrastructure and education deficits simultaneously. The Dole \namendment addresses only half of this equation, namely, the fiscal \ndeficit. It, in fact, exacerbates our infrastructure and education \ndeficits. In my view, it makes no sense to rob Peter in order to get \nthe funds to pay Paul.\n  So I urge when the time comes that the amendment be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia for his remarks and, in \nparticular, I want to pick up on one point that he made which has to do \nwith the investment deficit. I really do believe the Senator from West \nVirginia is correct, that sometimes, unless you invest, decline begets \ndecline. I think it is myopic and shortsighted not to make an \ninvestment in education and children and in our infrastructure. \nSometimes you make an investment in the short run and are much better \noff in the long run. I think that is what my colleague from West \nVirginia is really trying to say today.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me just simply take issue with the \nmajority leader's substitute which is now before us and then talk a \nlittle bit about some \n[[Page S5099]] of the rescissions that are also before us.\n  The Dole substitute, as I understand it, contains all of the \nrescissions in the committee bill--in education, Head Start, in WIC, in \nchild care. I want to talk about some of those rescissions. But above \nand beyond those rescissions, there are yet others. I would like to \nhighlight a couple of areas where I do take very serious exception.\n  I visited in Appleton, MN--southwest Minnesota--with Pioneer Public \nTelevision. I can assure you that Pioneer Public Television is not a \nsandbox for the rich. I can tell you that the people in greater \nMinnesota, in rural Minnesota, are very connected to Pioneer Public TV, \nand they are connected to public television, for a number of reasons.\n  First and foremost, they appreciate the focus on children's \nprogramming. I have to say to the Chair, whom I know has a strong and \nsincere concern about children, that as I look at what is on commercial \nTV in the name of children's programming, with precious few exceptions, \nI do not find anything there very positive and enriching. Public \ntelevision has done a truly magnificent job of presenting those of us \nwho are parents and grandparents with some wonderful children's \nprogramming.\n  Second of all, Pioneer Public Television in southwest Minnesota is a \nreal tool for education and empowerment for people in the community. It \nbroadcasts programs that provide people with the kind of information \nthat we encourage citizens to have to be more fully involved in their \ncommunities on the economic, political, and cultural issues.\n  So I find the additional cuts proposed in this substitute for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting to be egregious.\n  I also have to say KTCA channel 2--and also channel 17--in Minnesota \nhas really been a flagship public television.\n  Public television provides some superb public affairs programming. I \ndo think people yearn for something more than the 10-second sound \nbites. I think they really do yearn for some substantive and thoughtful \ndiscussion of public issues. The effort to attack part of the cultural \ninstitution in this country, namely, public television or public radio, \nis a huge mistake. It takes us backwards.\n  I am concerned about other proposed cuts as well. I heard some of my \ncolleagues talk about AmeriCorps last night, so I will not, except to \nsay that I was lucky enough to be at the founding gathering of \nAmeriCorps for the volunteers in Minnesota. I think there must have \nbeen about 300 young people. It was truly inspiring--the diversity of \nthe young men and women that were there, the idealism, and their \ncommitment to community. This is a program which encourages the very \nbest ideals of this country, serving community, and providing young \npeople, many of whom were from backgrounds that would not have enabled \nthem to afford higher education, with some financial assistance to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, there is a strong record of service to community \nalready in this AmeriCorps program. I find it difficult to understand \nthe effort to attack such a program. I find it difficult to understand \nwhy some of my colleagues spend so much time attacking a program which \nhas barely begun which, calls upon young people, to be their own best \nselves. I think people yearn for models of community involvement. I \nthink people yearn for alternatives to cynicism, and I think the \nAmeriCorps is an alternative to cynicism. Again, I find the Dole \nsubstitute very troubling on this count.\n  Finally, there may be discussion of this section of the amendment \nlater, but I am concerned about cuts to legal services. I have done a \nlot of work with low- and moderate-income people over the years, with \nmany citizens in Minnesota. Whether or not it is protection vis-a-vis \ntheir rights as tenants or consumers--or on other issues--the Legal \nServices Program is the way in which we make sure our civil legal \nsystem is open and serves all citizens, regardless of income. It is a \nprogram that has never operated on a very large budget.\n  This program provides dedicated legal services lawyers who do not \nmake much money, but who make sure that those citizens who do not have \nthe economic means to purchase or to have good legal representation are \nable to receive it.\n  It has strong backing from the bar association in Minnesota; strong \nbacking from the bar association nationally. Instead, we should be \nmaking cuts in programs like star wars, or programs that have to do \nwith a variety of different tax dodges and loopholes and deductions \nwhich go to people who, in fact, do not need representation. But this \nfocus on legal services makes very little sense.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to the initial rescission bill that we \nhave in the Senate. I, first of all, would like to congratulate my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, because I think that some of \nthe work that he has done is extremely important. I fully appreciate \nhis commitment and certainly his ability as a Senator.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about a few programs where there \nare slated cuts in this rescission package which are simply a profound \nmistake for the country.\n  I start out with the call for $35 million to be removed from the WIC \nProgram. That is for this year, fiscal year 1995.\n  This was a program that was authorized in the Congress in 1972 under \nthe leadership of such able Senators as Senator Robert Dole, now the \nmajority leader, and Senator Hubert Humphrey.\n  I have said it on the floor before: Senator Humphrey's framework is a \nlegacy that is very important to me.\n And the late Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota said that the test of a \ngovernment and the test of a society is how we treat people in the dawn \nof life, our children; how we treat people in the twilight of their \nlives, the elderly; and how we treat people who are in the shadow of \ntheir lives, those that are sick, disabled, and needy. I think that is \na pretty powerful framework for examining our actions.\n\n  Mr. President, the WIC Program has been astonishingly successful. It \nworks. The Women, Infants; and Children Program is an investment we \nmake to make sure that women, while pregnant, receive adequate \nnutrition and newborn infants also receive adequate nutrition.\n  Mr. President, I have had an amendment on the floor of the Senate \nover and over again, which was finally accepted a few days ago, that we \nwould not take any action that would increase hunger and homelessness \namong children. It strikes me that proposed cuts in the Women, Infants, \nand Children Program, which has been a huge success, which decreases \nthe number of low-birth-weight babies and the chances of infant \nmortality, goes precisely in the opposite direction.\n  Mr. President, according to a GAO report, the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program averted 13,755 very low-weight births in 1990. \nAssuming that all the funds would be used, if the $35 million--this is \nthe rescission cut--is distributed evenly throughout all of the \ncategories (women, infants, and children)--then 138 very low-birth-\nweight babies will not be averted because of this rescission cut.\n  Mr. President, the problem is that low birth weight greatly increases \nthe chance of infant mortality and, in addition, a variety of different \nconditions, from high rates of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, \nserious congenital anomalies, and so forth.\n  Let me just ask the question, if we go on record saying we will not \ntake any action that will increase hunger or homelessness among \nchildren--and the Senate is now on record--why do we have proposed cuts \nin the Women, Infants, and Children Program when we know that the WIC \nProgram speaks precisely to this problem in the Nation? Again, if you \nwant to make sure that a child, at birth, has the same chance as every \nother child, the one thing you certainly do not want to do is cut into \na program that makes sure that that expectant mother has a diet rich in \nminerals and protein. You want to make sure that you do not have \nrescissions in programs that will lead to more severely low-birth-\nweight infants, with the possibility of greater infant mortality as \nwell a whole set of huge medical problems for those children. This is a \nprogram that reaches down to the poorest of the poor. This is a program \nthat provides invaluable nutritional assistance for expectant women, \nchildren, and newborn infants. Mr. \n[[Page S5100]] President, it strikes me that these cuts simply go \nagainst the very best of what we are about in this Nation.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, in 1993, over 3,000 people were on the \nwaiting list for WIC benefits.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard the statistics before. You invest $1 \nin WIC and you save yourselves $3 that you would be paying over the \nfirst 18 years in additional medical assistance. So we have waiting \nlists, we have children in need, women and children. I believe the WIC \nProgram right now only serves about 60 percent of those that are \neligible for such assistance. Yet in the initial rescission package we \nhave cuts in the WIC Program.\n  Mr. President, this debate really is about priorities. I simply have \nto argue that what we see in this package, in the Dole substitute, with \ncuts on top of cuts, is very distorted priorities. Yesterday, Senator \nKennedy was on the floor talking about this expatriate tax dodge and I \njoined in. We were talking about a tax dodge that goes to individuals \nor families with, roughly speaking, over $5 million of net worth. We \nwere talking of revenue losses to the tune of several billion dollars \nover the next 5 years.\n  At the same time we have that kind of tax dodge, at the same time we \nare talking about spending more money on star wars, at the same time we \ncontinue to talk about more money for military weapons, in preparation \nfor war with the Soviet Union which no longer exists, weapons which are \nnot essential to our having a strong defense, we have all of these \nloopholes and deductions. Yet when we look to where the deficit \nreduction is going to come from, all of the tax dodges, and loopholes \nand star wars weapons are left untouched, because in this rescission \npackage, we are talking about cutting into the WIC Program.\n  I believe there is a contradiction between the Senate going on record \nthat we will not do anything to increase more hunger or homelessness \namong children and talking about cuts in the WIC Program.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus on one other rescission and then I \nwill yield the floor. There are many I could talk about. But I would \nlike to talk about the rescission package which includes an $8.4 \nmillion cut in the child care development block grant. Yet again, Mr. \nPresident, we have children bearing the brunt of a budget cut. This cut \nis painful to participants in a program with long waiting lists. No \naccusations of mismanagement. This is a program which subsidizes child \ncare for the working poor. This child care increases the ability of \nlow-income families to become or remain independent and to assure \nminimal uniform health and safety standards in the child care settings \nthese children are in.\n  Mr. President, it makes no sense to have cuts in a child care \nprogram. Cutting child care will hurt children. Mr. President, if \nparents cannot afford quality child care and we are talking about low- \nand moderate-income families, many of them hard-working families who \nare trying to, on the one hand, work and also afford child care, if \nthey cannot afford quality child care, then we know what happens. \nEither you have very haphazard arrangements, because parents have no \nother choice, in which case, all too often their children may be placed \nin dangerous situations. Some reports have come out which should be \nextremely upsetting to all of us, which have pointed out that the \nconditions of child care, both home based and center based, in this \ncountry are all too often very dangerous, really quite deplorable. It \nis not a good picture.\n  So if you are going to make it impossible for families to afford \nchild care, either the children become latchkey children and nobody is \ntaking care of them because they are home alone, or they are going to \nbe receiving child care; but it will not live up to the standards that \nall of us would apply to our own and any other children.\n  Mr. President, I do not think there is one Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, here in this Chamber who would desire for his or her child \nor grandchild anything less than good developmental child care. To have \nthese cuts in child care programs when there are long waiting lists in \nthe State, when it is a program that works well, when it is the key to \nindependence is shortsighted. I will tell you right now it is also the \nkey to welfare reform.\n  I think it is a huge mistake.\n  I would say to my colleagues, if we do not invest in children when \nthey are young, if we do not provide a nurturing environment, if those \nchildren are not given encouragement, if those children are just \nreceiving custodial care, if those children are in arrangements that \nsometimes are dangerous, then we have not served the children of this \ncountry well.\n  Now, Mr. President, understand that we have a whole decade plus of \nhistory of abandonment of children in this country, if we just look at \nthe state of children in America. We have been trying, slowly but \nsurely, within tight budgets to invest a little bit more by way of \nresources in decent child care. Now we have these proposed cuts.\n  Mr. President, Florida has about 19,000 on its working poor waiting \nlist. Minnesota has a waiting list of 7,000. The State of Washington, \n3,000. In Minneapolis alone, there is a waiting list of 2,100 families. \nIn rural Minnesota, in proportion to need, there is even a greater \nwaiting list.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that these cuts--and it is why indeed I \nsupport the Daschle amendment--are unacceptable. They are unacceptable.\n  Once again, who pays the price? Children do. Why are we targeting \nchildren? Why are we making cuts in an affordable child care program, \nwhich already is severely underfunded, which we know will have the \npredicted results of: First, parents not being able to provide their \nchildren with decent child care; and second, families not being able to \nbecome independent.\n  As a matter of fact, quite often what happens with welfare families, \nif we are talking about welfare families, but when we talk about child \ncare, we are also talking about working families, as well--in the case \nof welfare families, about 75 percent of welfare mothers within 2 \nyears, right now, go to work, but many of them go back to welfare.\n  There are several reasons for that. One of those reasons is that, in \nthe absence of affordable child care, and then quite often losing their \nhealth care coverage, their families are worse off by the mothers going \nto work. We cannot have welfare reform unless there is affordable child \ncare. We cannot expect families to become more independent unless we \nhave affordable child care.\n  Here we have a proposed cut, Mr. President, which is an $8.4 million \ncut in the child care development block grants. Mr. President, I just \ndo not understand. It seems to me that we would want to spend a lot \nless money on star wars in space, and we would want to spend a little \nmore money taking care of our children right here on Earth.\n  In that sense, I find this to be a distorted priority. I think the \nDaschle amendment is hugely important. For that reason, I support it.\n  I think the Dole substitute, which is, as I said, in addition to all \nthe rescissions that were in the committee bill in education--and I \nhave not talked about some of the chapter I cuts; I have not talked \nabout the Safe Schools Program, as well, in child care, in Head Start, \nin WIC, in addition to even more cuts--strikes me as being harsh, \nstrikes me as being a distorted priority.\n  Mr. President, this leads me to my last point. What we are doing here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate, in this rescissions package made far \nworse with the Dole substitute, is looking at this year's budget, but \nunfortunately this is exactly what some of my colleagues intend to do \nas they budget this out over the next several years: We are going to \nmake cuts based upon the path of least political resistance.\n  I have said this over and over again. That is why I brought this \namendment out on children. I could see it happening. We are going to \nmake cuts based upon the path of least political resistance. We are \ngoing to avoid the heavy hitters. That is why so far there has not been \nany discussion of reductions in subsidies for oil companies, or \nsubsidies for tobacco companies or coal companies or pharmaceutical \ncompanies or insurance companies, and on and on and on. They are not \nasked to tighten their belts.\n  When it comes to child care; the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram; education; Head Start, we are more than willing to move \nforward with cuts in programs that already do not even serve nearly as \nmany children \n[[Page S5101]] as need such assistance so they will have the same \nchances that we all want for our children.\n  Mr. President, in this context of who has the power and who does not, \nin this context of who decides who benefits and who is asked to \nsacrifice, I do not see a standard of fairness operative here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 450\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 450.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.  . It is the sense of the Senate that before the \n     Senate is required to vote on the question of whether the WIC \n     Program and other nutrition programs should be converted to \n     block grant programs to be administered by the States, a full \n     and complete investigation should be conducted by the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture to determine whether, and if so, to \n     what extent, such a proposed substantial change in national \n     policy is the result of the improper influence of the food \n     industry and lobbyists acting on the industry's behalf.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to ask the Chair, would it be in \norder to read excerpts from a newspaper article which refers to the \nother body and to Members of the other body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inform the Senator, under the \nprecedents, as it is, it is improper for a Senator to make reference to \nor reflect on the Members of the House, to refer to a Member of the \nHouse by name, to criticize the action of the Speaker, or to refer to \ndebate of a Member of the House in terms that are imputative of \nunworthy motives.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just so I can be clear on the ruling, if I were to \nread from an article and without using the names of any Members--would \nthat be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, that would be in \norder.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That would be in order. Let me, then, give my \ncolleagues a little background for the ``why'' of this amendment.\n  I refer to a piece today in the Washington Post that I believe is one \nof the best investigative pieces I have seen in a good many years. I \nspeak as a political scientist.\n  Mr. President, would it be in order for me to insert this article in \nthe Record?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, it would be in \norder.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is an article by Michael Weisskopf and David \nMaraniss, and it deals with our nutrition programs. I refer my \ncolleagues to this article. It appears in today's Washington Post, and \nI would just like to read from excerpts that I think will give my \ncolleagues the background for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 4, 1995]\n\n  Inside the Revolution: A Moderate's Dilemma: Food Program Defender \n                          Becomes a Dismantler\n\n               (By David Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf)\n\n       The congressional office of Bill Goodling, Room 2263 of the \n     Rayburn building, is a quaint and cozy place straight out of \n     the 1950s, with the ambiance of a small-town Pennsylvania \n     school principal's den. Portraits of Ike at Gettysburg grace \n     the front wall. In the far right corner stands a century-old \n     upright piano, a clangingly out-of-time instrument that \n     nonetheless brings the congressman great comfort when he \n     pounds out Methodist church hymns alone at midnight. Behind \n     his desk sit rows of potted African violets, which the \n     grandfatherly Goodling fondly refers to as his children.\n       This old-fashioned hideway is hardly the first spot one \n     would look in search of leading characters in the House \n     Republican revolution, with its New Age rhetoric and \n     antigovernment fervor. Yet William F. Goodling somehow \n     reached center stage in one of the most compelling \n     productions of The First 100 Days, a drama that tested his \n     political soul as he struggled, at the twilight of an obscure \n     career, to attain and hold power in an institution dominated \n     by young partisans pushing him from the right.\n       Since he entered Congress in 1975 after a career as an \n     educator in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, Goodling \n     had earned a reputation on the House Education and Labor \n     Committee as a moderate who worked in bipartisan fashion to \n     protect the federal role in food and nutrition programs for \n     needy children, infants and pregnant mothers. It was a \n     natural extension of his paternalistic personality: taking \n     care of his children, just as he\n      had as father, public school teacher and administrator and \n     cultivator of African violets.\n       When the Republicans took power this year, he suddenly \n     became chairman of a committee that had been repopulated with \n     antigovernment conservatives and went by a newfangled Third \n     Wave name, Economic and Educational Opportunities. His first \n     assignment from Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Majority \n     Leader Richard K. Armey (Tex.) was to carry out one of the \n     most controversial missions in the ``Contract With America.'' \n     They directed him to dismantle and send back to the states \n     the very nutritional programs that he had long championed.\n       Goodling's personal dilemma--how to respond to the \n     pressures of the conservative leadership without repudiating \n     his past legislative career--illuminated a larger morality \n     play in the House: the struggle of the Republican majority to \n     maintain the populist appeal of antigovernment rhetoric \n     without appearing to acquiesce to special interests.\n       On one side, pushing hard for more power and freedom, were \n     the nation's newly ascendant Republican governors, who \n     visited Washington so often to lobby for block grants that \n     they virtually set up a shadow White House two blocks from \n     Goodling's congressional office. On another side were major \n     cereal companies, infant formula manufacturers, \n     agribusinesses and fast-food giants for whom the federal \n     retreat from the nutrition field presented an opportunity for \n     new markets and less government regulation. And finally there \n     were the most vulnerable members of society, whose needs \n     historically had been met by a bipartisan coalition in \n     Congress under the precept that hunger in America was a \n     nationwide crisis too dire to be left to the states and was, \n     as President Richard M. Nixon had declared in a seminal \n     speech 26 years ago, a federal responsibility.\n\n\n                          profit and ideology\n\n       At first, Dale Kildee could not imagine that his friendly \n     adversary bill Goodling was changing. This must be a \n     technical error, the veteran Democratic congressman from \n     Michigan later remembered thinking to himself when he entered \n     the Opportunities Committee room one day late in February for \n     the vote to send the nutrition programs back, to the states.\n       The bill as the Republicans had drafted it left out any \n     requirement that states use competitive bidding procedures \n     when buying infant formula from the major companies supplying \n     the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and \n     Children (WIC)--a nutritional program assisting 7 million \n     people that had an effective record combating infant \n     mortality and premature births.\n       In the early days of the WIC program, infant formula was \n     bought at market prices. Since the federal government began \n     requiring competitive bidding six years ago, the prices had \n     dropped dramatically, saving more than $1 billion last year \n     alone and nearly $4 billion over the last five years. All of \n     those savings were put back into the program, meaning that \n     more needy infants and pregnant women could be served.\n       When he noticed that competitive bidding had been left out \n     of the Republican bill this year, Kildee assumed that it was \n     an unintentional omission, so he drafted an amendment \n     restoring it. He took the amendment to Chairman Goodling \n     confident that it would be accepted quickly. But Goodling's \n     reaction was cool and distant. Go ``work out'' with Hoekstra, \n     he told Kildee, referring to Peter Hoekstra, a second-term \n     congressman from western Michigan, one of the youthful free-\n     enterprise Republicans on the committee who was gaining \n     stature as a confidant of Speaker Gingrich.\n       Nothing was to be worked out. Hoekstra had a strong \n     distrust of the federal government and was one of the \n     staunchest proponents of devolving power back to the states. \n     ``Philosophically,'' he said, ``it was a no-brainer'' that \n     Congress should eliminate federal mandates whenever \n     possible--even the competitive bidding requirements that had \n     saved money.\n       Hoekstra's philosophical commitment in this case coincided \n     with the desires of one of the major corporations in his \n     congressional district--Gerber Products, a Fremont-based \n     company that is the nation's largest manufacturer of baby \n     foods and is WIC's leading supplier of infant cereals. Unlike \n     in the infant formula field, competitive bidding is not \n     required of infant cereal suppliers, but the government \n     seemed to be moving in the direction and Gerber wanted to \n     maintain the status quo. The company lobbied hard against \n     competitive bidding requirements in the infant cereal \n     industry and had consulted with Hoekstra in the drafting of \n     the legislation.\n       When Kildee's amendment came to a vote in committee, it was \n     defeated on a near party-line vote, with only one Republican \n     supporting it, Marge Roukema, a veteran moderate from New \n     Jersey. Roukema said \n     [[Page S5102]] later that she was not even aware that \n     competitive bidding was omitted from the Republican bill \n     until the deliberations that day.\n       In the committee room after the vote, Roukema asked several \n     Republican members seated near her why they had done what \n     they had done. Their responses, she said, were shrugs of the \n     shoulders and the words, ``We trust the governors.''\n\n\n                              big winners\n\n       Only a few blocks from the land of Opportunities sits a \n     venerable Republican redoubt called the Capitol Hill Club, \n     where members of Congress mix easily with important visitors \n     from back home and corporate lobbyists. It was there, beneath \n     crystal chandeliers and oil paintings of GOP stalwarts, that \n     key committee members met with the big winners in the \n     transfer of money back to the states, Republican governors \n     such as John Engler of Michigan, Tommy G. Thompson of \n     Wisconsin, Pete Wilson of California and William F. Weld of \n     Massachusetts.\n       The governors, said Opportunities Committee member Steve \n     Gunderson, a moderate Republican from Wisconsin, had become \n     the loudest constituents. ``We can't give them more money,'' \n     Gunderson said. ``So we had to give them something else.''\n       The state executives did not get everything they had \n     demanded. Their bid for a single enormous block grant for all \n     the programs was rebuffed by Goodling and Rep. Rady ``Duke'' \n     Cunningham (R-Calif.), the nutrition subcommittee chairman, \n     who thought they could define the terms of the transfer \n     better with two separate block grants. But the governors did \n     receive more power and flexibility to run the school lunch \n     and WIC programs. For years, some governors and corporate \n     interests had bristled at regulations that they considered \n     too intrusive--from dictating the amount of sugar allowed in \n     WIC foods to when and where soft drinks could be sold in \n     public schools.\n       Michigan's Engler was among the loudest critics of federal \n     rules and regulations, which he derided at a committee \n     hearing as a ``crazy quilt.'' There were, as in the case of \n     fellow Michigander Hoekstra and the Gerber connection, \n     narrower economic consequences of devolution important to \n     engler as well, in this case involving another major \n     manufacturing constituent--the Kellogg Co.\n       The cereal giant from Battle Creek has fought for years to \n     modify a federal limit on sugar content that excludes Raisin \n     Bran, one of its top-selling products, from the nutrition \n     program for needy pregnant women and their young children. \n     Purchased separately, raisins and bran both fall within the \n     sugar standard, but combined in Raisin Bran they represent \n     twice the amount that government nutritionists consider \n     healthy in a single serving.\n       Until the Republican revolution in Washington, Kellogg's \n     efforts to revise the standard and compete in the $285 \n     million-a-year market for WIC adult cereals had proved \n     futile--``like hitting a brick wall,'' in the words of \n     company vice-president James Stewart. This year Kellogg saw \n     an opportunity to accomplish on the state level what it could \n     not do with the federal government. The firm employed John \n     Ford, son of the former committee chairman, retired \n     Democratic Congressman William D. Ford of Michigan, to head \n     its lobbying effort. Kellogg also enlisted the support of \n     Gov. Engler and his staff, who pressed the committee to keep \n     the block grants silent on the question of nutritional \n     standards.\n       Not even the harshest critics of block grants predict an \n     abandonment of sound nutrition by the states. But the \n     devolution process will create a long-sought opening for many \n     food industries to carve out larger niches in the annual $8.5 \n     billion school lunch and WIC programs. Financially strapped \n     state governments and part-time legislatures, many \n     nutritionists believe, are ill-equipped to make sound public \n     health judgments and can be more easily swayed by corporate \n     lobbyists.\n       The return of nutrition programs to the states would lift \n     federal controls on the lunchtime sale of junk food in school \n     cafeterias--a prospect that several corporate food giants are \n     already anticipating. Coca-Cola Co., which last year fought \n     off a legislative effort to extend the junk food ban to all \n     high school grounds, is now showing signs of interest. Last \n     month, as the devolution legislation was moving through the \n     House, the company's law librarian called the national \n     association of school cafeteria personnel for a breakdown of \n     state laws on soft drink sales in schools.\n       Also at stake in the transfer of power to states is one of \n     the cornerstones of the war on hunger, a 1946 requirement \n     that school lunches provide one-third of the recommended \n     dietary allowance of protein, vitamins and minerals. The \n     dietary guideline is intended to assure at least one healthy \n     serving a day of milk, vegetables, grain, fruit and meat for \n     the 25 million children in the program. Federal agriculture \n     officials were planning this summer to add limits on fat, \n     saturated fat and sodium for school lunches.\n       With standards defined by states, food companies and \n     agricultural interests with special regional standing would \n     have more power, some nutritionists contend. ``You could find \n     a battle going on in a state legislature over what drinks to \n     serve at school lunch,'' said Lynn Parker, a child \n     nutritionist for the Food Research and Action Center. ``In a \n     dairy state, it might go one way. If soda interests are \n     strong, it could go another way. Whatever way it goes, it may \n     not be fought out on the grounds of what's best for the \n     kids.''\n       Goodling and his Republican colleagues on the Opportunities \n     Committee express confidence that the states will demonstrate \n     sound nutrition and financial practices in dealing with the \n     programs. Their critics are less certain, and cite the recent \n     history of the WIC program as evidence.\n       The infant formula industry, dominated by Mead Johnson & \n     Co. and Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories, had \n     raised prices a dozen times from 1981 to 1989, gobbling up \n     more and more of the funds allocated for cereals, milk, eggs, \n     cheese, juice and other foods in the program. After \n     competitive bidding was imposed nationwide, with Goodling's \n     support, prices dropped enough to feed another 1.5 million \n     needy women and infants.\n       In defending the decision to drop competitive bidding \n     language from the devolution legislation this year, Goodling \n     said governors would be ``idiots'' not to impose it \n     themselves. But as a recent case in California shows, states \n     are not always as cost-conscious or resistant to industry \n     pressures. When California's competitively awarded contract \n     with Ross expired last December, it sought to extend the deal \n     without rebidding it. The Agriculture Department said no, \n     forcing a new round of solicitations and a new low bid--half \n     the price of the old deal. The state ended up saving $22 \n     million a year.\n       If ever there was a case of narrow corporate interests over \n     broad societal interests, this is it,'' said Robert \n     Greenstein, head of the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities.\n\n\n                           The Transformation\n\n       By the time he reached Washington two decades ago, Bill \n     Goodling already had a reputation for compassion and a deep \n     interest in children and nutrition. As superintendent of the \n     Spring Grove school district, he ate lunch every day in the \n     cafeteria with his students. When the truck from Harrisburg \n     pulled up with vegetables and meats from the federal \n     commodities program, he helped carry the food down to the \n     freezer in the basement of the administration building. When \n     the mother of one of his students dies, he taught the young \n     man how to cook dinner for himself and his father.\n       Goodling's own father, George Goodling, ran an apple \n     orchard on the old Susquehanna Road and served in Congress \n     for six terms. When he retired, Bill Goodling replaced him. \n     The small-town educator transferred his interests to the \n     broader stage of the Education and Labor Committee. He became \n     known as one of the staunchest defenders of the nutrition and \n     school lunch programs on the GOP side of the aisle. In 1982, \n     he was the chief Republican cosponsor of a resolution \n     opposing a Reagan administration proposal to send nutrition \n     programs back to the states through block grants.\n       Three years later, when conservative Republicans in the \n     House were considering ways to trim the budget and broached \n     the possibility of cutting back on the national school lunch \n     program, Goodling swiftly killed the idea before it advanced \n     beyond the discussion stage. According to Tom Humbert, then a \n     budget aid to then-Rep. Jack Kemp (R) of New York, Goodling \n     called him one day. ``Please come and see me,'' Goodling \n     said. Humbert soon appeared in Goodling's office, where he \n     found the congressman tending his African violets. ``Mr. \n     Humbert,'' Goodling said, ``I hear that you are considering \n     cutting the school lunch program. That would be a very bad \n     idea!''\n       This same Tom Humbert, who came from Goodling's home \n     district, returned to York County in 1992 and ran against the \n     incumbent in a heated three-way general election contest--a \n     race that Humbert and others see as the beginning of \n     Goodling's political transformation. Humbert ran as an \n     independent, challenging Goodling from the right. He and the \n     Democratic candidate Paul Kilker, both blasted Goodling for \n     his role in the House Bank scandal--it came out that year \n     that Goodling had hundreds of overdrafts.\n       In Goodling's moment of need, he received a visit and \n     timely endorsement from an unlikely friend--the leader of \n     House conservatives, Newt Gingrich. That visit formed a bond \n     between Goodling and Gingrich that grew stronger: Goodling \n     supported Gingrich in his rise to power, and Gingrich \n     elevated Goodling to the chairmanship after the revolution. \n     Former aides on the committee's minority staff say they \n     detected a noticeable shift in their boss's politics as he \n     linked his fortunes to Gingrich. Even his moderate colleague \n     on the committee, Steve Gunderson, said he noticed Goodling \n     moving to the right last year. Gunderson attributed it to \n     positioning by new members of Goodling's staff who wanted to \n     be in favor with Gingrich.\n       The word inside the committee and around the nutrition \n     community was that Goodling was instructed by the leadership \n     to ``carry the water'' for the committee's portion of the \n     Contract With America, as one former aide put it.\n       By the time he took over the committee this year, Goodling \n     had little choice in any case. The panel, once a haven for \n     moderates, had been transformed into a strong-hold of free-\n     enterprise true believers, many recruited by their \n     intellectual leader, Richard Armey of Texas, who served on \n     the panel before becoming majority leader. The sense of these \n     committee conservatives, as expressed by Rep. Cass Ballenger \n     (R), a garrulous good \n     [[Page S5103]] old boy from North Carolina was ``to get rid \n     of Washington whenever and wherever we can.''\n       Ballenger had a personal interest in trying to remove the \n     federal bureaucracy from the school lunch program. He and his \n     wife founded the Community Ridge Day Care Center in his home \n     town of Hickory, a federally subsidized program that serves \n     school breakfasts and lunches. The paperwork for \n     reimbursements, Ballenger said, now goes through Raleigh, \n     then Atlanta and finally Washington, a process that means \n     Ballenger's center ``has to underwrite'' the meals for a \n     month. He will get his money quicker, the congressman said, \n     with the federal government out of the way.\n       The Opportunities panel, by Ballenger's account, is now \n     attracting what he proudly calls free-enterprise ``wild men'' \n     and ``nuts'' who have various similar frustrations with the \n     federal bureaucracy. They were in such a mood of cutting and \n     slashing, Ballenger declared, that they would ``kill \n     motherhood tomorrow if it was necessary.''\n       Goodling would not go that far. He and Duke Cunningham, who \n     was once a teacher and coach himself, as well as a fighter \n     pilot who was the real-life model for Tom Cruise's character \n     in ``Top Gun,'' managed to prevent efforts by committee \n     conservatives to curb the school lunch program more \n     drastically. Hoeksta and Ballenger wanted to limit the \n     increase in the block grants to half the 4.5 percent that \n     eventually was allowed. Goodling and Cunningham also rebuffed \n     an attempt by governors and conservative committee members to \n     lump all the program in one block grant. ``I said, `No way, \n     Jose' to that one,'' Goodling boasted.\n       Compared to projections for family and school nutrition \n     programs under current law, the two block grants shaped by \n     Goodling's committee and passed by the House represent a \n     reduction of $6.6 billion over five years, according to the \n     Agriculture Department. But Goodling said that the states \n     deserved the opportunity to run the programs--``We can't \n     dictate everything,'' he said--and that the reduced \n     bureaucracy would lead to savings that could be passed along \n     to those who need the programs.\n       The sight of Bill Goodling leading the way for the end of \n     federal involvement in the anti-hunger programs surprised \n     some longtime colleagues. It seemed as though to some extent \n     he was being forced to eat something that he did not find \n     entirely palatable. His training as an educator might have \n     helped there, too. Once, while eating lunch with first-\n     graders at one of the Spring Grove elementary schools, \n     Goodling found himself staring down at a steaming heap of \n     cooked spinach. He hated cooked spinach. But there was a \n     little boy staring at him, and he felt that he had no choice \n     but to ``push this slimy stuff down my throat to show that \n     I'm eating everything that's on the plate.''\n       (About This Series: Propelled by a wave of populist \n     discontent with Congress and the Democrats, the new \n     Republican congressional majority now confronts the reality \n     of power. The struggle to fulfill the demands of the \n     Republican mandate while also responding to the special \n     interest groups traditionally allied with the party will be \n     examined in a series of occasional articles in the months \n     ahead.)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is under a section titled ``Profit \nand Ideology,'' and I will have to be careful to make sure I leave out \nall names.\n\n       The bill as the Republicans had drafted it left out any \n     requirement that States use competitive bidding procedures \n     when buying infant formula from the major companies supplying \n     the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and \n     Children (WIC)--a nutritional program assisting 7 million \n     people that had an effective record combating infant \n     mortality and premature births.\n       In the early days of the WIC program, infant formula was \n     bought at market prices. Since the Federal Government began \n     requiring competitive bidding 6 years ago, the prices had \n     dropped dramatically, saving more than $1 billion last year \n     alone and nearly $4 billion over the last 5 years. All of \n     those savings were put back into the program, meaning that \n     more needy infants and pregnant women could be served.\n\n  ``When he noticed that competitive bidding had been left out of the \nRepublican bill this year,'' and there is a blank, a colleague \n``assumed that it was an unintentional omission, so he drafted an \namendment restoring it. He took the amendment * * *'' and hoped that it \nwould be accepted quickly, but that did not happen. Nothing was worked \nout.\n  The philosophical commitment to not have competitive bidding --and I \nam now just kind of paraphrasing here, not using names--coincided with \nthe desires of one of the major corporations, Gerber Products. This is \na company which is the Nation's largest manufacturer of baby foods and \nis WIC's leading supplier of infant formulas.\n  Unlike in the infant formula field, competitive bidding is not \nrequired of infant cereal suppliers, but the Government seemed to be \nmoving in that direction and Gerber wanted to maintain the status quo. \nThe company lobbied hard against competitive bidding requirements in \nthe infant cereal industry, and was successful.\n  Part 1. So you have Gerber and the whole question of whether there is \ngoing to be competitive bidding. I thought we were trying to be \nefficient, which would save money that can be plowed back into serving \nthe poorest children in America. But apparently that did not happen, \nand I will have the amendment read again so my colleagues will know \nwhat we will have an up-or-down vote on.\n  Then, part 2:\n\n       The cereal giant from Battle Creek has fought for years to \n     modify a federal limit on sugar content that excludes Raisin \n     Bran, one of its top-selling products, from the nutrition \n     program for needy pregnant women and their young children. \n     Purchased separately, raisins and bran both fall within the \n     sugar standard, but combined in Raisin Bran they represent \n     twice the amount that government nutritionists consider \n     healthy in a single serving.\n       Until the Republican revolution in Washington, Kellogg's \n     efforts to revise the standard and compete in the $285 \n     million-a-year market for WIC adult cereals had proved \n     futile--``like hitting a brick wall,'' in the words of \n     company vice president. This year Kellogg saw an opportunity \n     to accomplish on the state level what it could not do with \n     the federal government. The firm employed--\n\n  Someone who did the effective lobbying, and the whole effort was,\n\n     . . . to keep the block grants silent on the question of \n     nutritional standards.\n\n  The final part.\n  So now we are talking about Kellogg and sugar content.\n\n       The return of nutrition programs to the states would lift \n     federal controls on the lunchtime sale of junk food in school \n     cafeterias--a prospect that several corporate food giants are \n     already anticipating. Coca-Cola Co., which last year fought \n     off a legislative effort to extend the junk food ban to all \n     high school grounds, is now showing signs of interest. Last \n     month, as the devolution legislation was moving through the \n     House, the company's law librarian called the national \n     association of school cafeteria personnel for a breakdown of \n     state laws on soft drink sales in schools.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``If ever there was a case of narrow corporate interests \n     over broad societal interests, this is it,'' said Robert \n     Greenstein, head of the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we have Gerber lobbying against competitive \nbidding on baby food. I thought we were interested in competitive \nbidding, efficiency. But no, there is no competitive bidding. Then we \nhave Kellogg: We do not want any standards on sugar content having to \ndo with what our children are eating, though there is not a \nnutritionist in the United States of America who would not tell you \nthat is important. Then finally you have Coca-Cola eying junk food.\n  Mr. President, let me simply read this amendment again to the \nunderlying bill, I certainly hope and I plan to have an up-or-down vote \non this.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that before the Senate is \n     required to vote on the question of whether the WIC program \n     and other nutrition programs should be converted to block \n     grant programs to be administered by the states, a full and \n     complete investigation should be conducted by the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture to determine whether, and if so, to \n     what extent, such a proposed substantial change in national \n     policy is the result of the improper influence of the food \n     industry and lobbyist acting on the industry's behalf.\n\n  Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk and speak on this \namendment because I was talking about distorted priorities earlier, and \nthat was in the context of some the rescissions in the Dole substitute \non top of what is already before us. I was arguing why the path of \nleast resistance? Why is everybody so excited about star wars in space \nbut unwilling to invest resources to feed children right here on Earth?\n  Now we have a different kind of priority. We have a situation where \nyou have your big lobbyists, large corporations, well represented: We \ndo not want competitive bids on formula, although competitive bids held \nthe price down and would enable us to feed more hungry children. We do \nnot want to have any standards in relation to sugar content, or \nworrying about that, so we try to make sure the Federal Government does \nnot set any kind of standards here. Then of course you have these \ncompanies eyeing the junk food market in our School Lunch Program. All \n[[Page S5104]] of them are apparently very well represented.\n  Do you know what, Mr. President? I did not see mentioned anywhere in \nthis lengthy piece in the Washington Post today of any of the women and \nmen who are involved in these nutrition programs, who devote their \nlives to serving children--their voice, apparently, was not heard at \nall.\n  Mr. President, I did not in this article read a word about any of the \nchild advocates or, for that matter, any children who figured into this \ndiscussion at all. But, instead, what we have here is, unfortunately, \nan example of the tremendous influence of the food industry and \nlobbyists acting on behalf of the food industry on legislation, while \nchildren, those concerned with the needs of children, with the concerns \nand circumstances of children's lives, are left out of the loop. That \nis the ``why'' of this amendment. I ask the clerk to read this \namendment one more time, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.  . It is the sense of the Senate that before the \n     Senate is required to vote on the question of whether the WIC \n     program and other nutrition programs should be converted to \n     block grant programs to be administered by the states, a full \n     and complete investigation should be conducted by the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture to determine whether, and if so, to \n     what extent, such a proposed substantial change in national \n     policy is the result of the improper influence of the food \n     industry and lobbyists acting on the industry's behalf.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Then maybe that will get White House attention.\n  This is a Jordan aid amendment that has wide support. It is supported \nby the President. Many of us met with King Hussein this year. It has \nbroad bipartisan support. All I do in my amendment, in lieu of the \nmatter proposed by the Senator from Minnesota, I insert the following. \nAnd if we are going to proceed with this bill, then we will have a vote \non this amendment. Maybe then the White House will become interested in \nthis bill because now I do not think the White House cares, and I do \nnot see any reason to continue this spectacle on the Senate floor, have \neverybody offering some little amendment to score some political \npoints. We will move on to something else.\n  So I have asked Mr. Panetta, the White House Chief of Staff, to let \nme know after he has a discussion with the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, and then after lunch we decide whether we pull the bill down \nor whether we proceed to vote on this amendment and on the Daschle \namendment and on the amendment offered by Senator Ashcroft of Missouri. \nBut if there is no interest in passing this supplemental bill--there \ndoes not appear to be any in the White House--then it would be my \nintent to just take the bill down. Then we are not going to send the \nother supplemental to the White House either. If they do not want to be \ninvolved in this process, that is up to them. But they cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  So the amendment is simply the Jordan amendment, which we have \ndiscussed and which has been a matter of intense interest to the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and this amendment is offered by \nme on Senator McConnell's behalf.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nebraska for an \nadditional question.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator from Kansas yield without losing his right \nto the floor for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I would say to the majority leader and other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle that it is not the intention of this Senator to \ncause any unnecessary delay. I think every Senator should be protected \nwith his or her right to offer any amendments that they think are in \norder. I do happen to think this is an important piece of legislation.\n  [[Page S5105]] I have an amendment that I talked about on Friday \nmorning with regard to eliminating the mandates on the States with \nregard to funding of rape and incest that I talked about and ever since \nthat time there seemed to be one roadblock or another to bringing this \nup. I had stood aside and said I just want to place this in the flow of \nbusiness somewhere along the line. So I would certainly ask the \nmajority leader to recognize the rights of the Senator from Nebraska, \nwith the other amendments that the Senator said were being considered, \nas to whether or not the Senator was going to pull down the bill.\n  I hope that maybe we could get together with some kind of a \nunanimous-consent agreement to protect the rights of every Member of \nthis body and still expedite the process, which I assume is what the \nSenator, the majority leader would like to have. In other words, there \nmay be some filibuster, minifilibuster, call it what you want. I have \nno objection to that. I would think though that if we are going to be \nable to have the recess we had scheduled for this weekend, we are all \ngoing to have to recognize there is going to have to be some give and \ntake somewhere along the line on this. And if there are reasons why \nfilibusters are going to be mounted, maybe we could reach a time \nagreement to expedite the cloture process after a reasonable time of \ndebate and not have the 3-day rule.\n  Basically, if we get into a 3-day rule with regard to a filibuster, \nit is pretty clear that we are not going to be able to finish this bill \nby the end of the week. And I share some of the concerns that the \nmajority leader has, while I will fight, as I always have, for the \nrights of Senators on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments as \nthey are entitled to under the rules.\n  I am just wondering. My question of the majority leader is, has there \nbeen a meeting recently between the majority leader and the minority \nleader with regard to the proposition of trying to come to some finite \nnumber of amendments, agree to a time limit on those; that if \nfilibusters come up, we possibly could have an agreement that we would \nhave expedited procedures where cloture could be recognized the same \nday, it could be considered the same day as a cloture motion would be \nfiled, something to move this process along?\n  Primarily, I think it is important that we do the business of the \nSenate, work our will and then let the rules apply as to whether or not \nwe are going to pass this piece of legislation.\n  I recognize the frustration of the majority leader, although I \nquestion whether it is wise to have foreign aid funds be added to this \nmeasure on top of all of the other consternation that obviously and \njustifiably surrounds this very important piece of legislation. But we \nhave to move ahead.\n  My question is: Has there been a recent meeting between the two \nleaders to see if something could not be worked out to scale down the \nnumber of amendments and at least get some unanimous consent agreements \nas to how much time we are going to spend on each amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I would say we have been meeting at a staff level. Both Senator \nDaschle and I have talked about it on the Senate floor. He indicated he \nmight be able to whittle down the 70 amendments.\n  Well, it is Tuesday. I am certain we could whittle down the 28 \namendments. Maybe we will get it down to 50 amendments. If you took an \nhour or more on each one, plus rollcalls, it is not going to happen. It \nseems to me that rather than just let everybody bring up amendments \nhere, posturing, doing whatever they are doing, it is best just to pull \nthe bill down and have those debates at some other time.\n  I know the Senator from Nebraska has an amendment. I know he is \nserious about it. It is a serious amendment. I would just guarantee \nhim, if we reach an agreement, that amendment will be in the mix unless \nthe Senator decides otherwise.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the majority leader yield for a brief comment, \nwithout his losing the floor--just a very brief comment?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me explain the Jordan amendment. It is \n$275 million debt relief for Jordan, $50 million in fiscal 1995, $225 \nmillion in fiscal 1996. And it is an effort by this administration, \nsupported by bipartisan supporters on each side of the aisle, to \nsupport the peace process.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has just arrived on the floor and can \nexplain it in greater detail. But the purpose of it and the reason for \nit is the fact that Jordan has made peace with Israel. We hope there \nwould be an overall peace in the Mideast at the earliest possible time. \nI know the White House supports the amendment. I hope they would \nsupport it on this bill and then help us bring this bill to a \nconclusion. It does not take any rocket scientist to figure out we are \nnot going to deal with 100 amendments if we are going to have sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments on everything. We had one from the Senator from \nMassachusetts, taking a couple hours on Friday, several hours \nyesterday, on a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that does not mean \nanything.\n  Now we have another one by the Senator from Minnesota on the WIC \nProgram. And we will probably have a lot of sense-of-the-Senate \namendments. Maybe that means something somewhere, but I fail to see \nwhere.\n  If we really want to get this bill done, if we are really concerned \nabout reducing the debt, we ought to be voting to do it. This is $13.5 \nbillion in rescissions, a fairly substantial package, talking about \nreal spending restraint.\n  If the White House does not want to pass it, if they do not want any \nspending restraint--which, apparently, they do not--that is certainly \nthe prerogative of the President.\n  I assume we will be hearing from the Chief of Staff momentarily. In \nthe meantime, I would ask the cosponsor of this amendment if I have \nforgotten anything in the process.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to commend the \ndistinguished leader for offering the Jordanian debt relief amendment. \nThis is exactly the same amendment which I offered earlier this year to \nthe defense bill.\n  Essentially what the leader's amendment would do, it would provide \n$50 million in debt relief, which would be obligated in fiscal year \n1995, and $225 million for 1996.\n  The point is, this is the final installment in the agreement that we \nhave with the Jordanians. The King was in town, as we all know, last \nweek. Many of us met with him. He is making a good-faith effort to turn \nhis country around and to be an important part of this growing peace \nmovement in the Middle East.\n  I think this is an extremely important measure. I commend the \nmajority leader for offering it to this bill. Maybe it will make this \nbill a little sweeter for those who seem not to want it to go anywhere. \nI, obviously, hope this will be approved at the appropriate time.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  How much time does the Senator from Minnesota need?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the majority leader--and I thank him for his \ngraciousness--I would need no more than 3 or 4 minutes, just a brief \ncomment in response to where we are, without the Senator losing his \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Would the Senator want 5 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Five minutes would be fine.\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut want any time?\n  Mr. DODD. Five or 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, after the Senator \nfrom Minnesota proceeds for 5 minutes and the Senator from Connecticut \nfor 10 minutes, that we stand in recess under the previous order until \n2:15.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky want any more time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. I would just make the point that this is \ncompletely paid for. This Jordanian debt relief is totally paid for.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me add, I failed to recognize that, with the adoption \nof the Shelby amendment, it actually raised the rescission package to \n$15 billion, not $13.5 billion. So I was in error.\n  Is there objection to my request?\n   [[Page S5106]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Not at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes, and the \nSenator from Connecticut will be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, just so my colleagues understand and the majority \nleader understands, I understand that Senators have a right to second-\ndegree amendments and I am pleased for us to have this debate, and \nthere will be a vote. But I will bring this amendment back to the floor \nafter the vote on the second-degree amendment.\n  I do not understand why my colleagues have any fear of an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment. I say to you, Mr. President, it is very \nrelevant and timely. We are talking about the WIC Program. We are \ntalking about nutrition programs.\n  At the same time, we see the power of the food industry. We do not \nhave competitive bidding on infant formula which would save money, \nmoney that could be used to feed more children.\n  We are talking about an effort to strip away, I fear, some nutrition \nstandards. We are talking about an effort to move in by the junk food \nmarket. And so my amendment is hardly, Mr. President, for show. It is \nvery serious.\n  It reads:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that before the Senate is \n     required to vote on the question of whether the WIC Program \n     and other nutrition programs should be converted to block \n     grant programs to be administered by the States, a full and \n     complete investigation should be conducted by the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture to determine whether, and if so, to \n     what extent, such a proposed substantial change in national \n     policy is the result of the improper influence of the food \n     industry and lobbyists acting on the industry's behalf.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not filibuster. I am quite willing to agree to \na time limit. I just want an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  Here we have these proposed cuts in nutrition programs, talking about \nblock-granting, and, in addition, unfortunately, we have evidence of an \nindustry and lobbyists having, I think, too much influence in \ndeveloping some of this legislation as it moves along in the Congress.\n  I am just simply saying: What happened to competitive bidding? What \nabout nutrition standards for children?\n  We should investigate before we move forward. I think the operative \nlanguage is to investigate ``to what extent, such a proposed \nsubstantial change in national policy as the result of the improper \ninfluence of the food industry and lobbyists acting on the industry's \nbehalf.''\n  Mr. President we ought to have an up-or-down vote.\n  So I say to the majority leader, I understand the second-degree \namendment. We will have that debate. But then I will come back with \nthis amendment, and we will have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. \nAnd I will keep bringing this amendment to the floor until we do have \nthat up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is germane to the debate of rescissions \nand cuts in nutrition programs. It is relevant to the debate about \nwhether we go in the direction of block grants. It is very relevant to \nwhat is happening in the 104th Congress.\n  I think the Senate sends a very positive message to the people of the \ncountry that we certainly want to make sure that the final nutrition \nlegislation that we pass, I say to my colleague from Connecticut, has, \nfirst and foremost, the interests of children, not the interests of the \nfood industry. That is what this amendment speaks to. Nobody should be \nafraid of this amendment. Everybody should want to vote for it up or \ndown, and I would assume that we would have 100 votes in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Under the unanimous-consent \nagreement, the Senator from Connecticut now has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to return, if I could, to the basic \nthrust of the legislation before us, and that is the rescission bill.\n  You are going to almost have to hire a mountain guide to find your \nway through the legislative process that is unfolding here, with \nvarious amendments that are now being offered to the underlying bill \nand to the substitutes that have been suggested.\n  Let me, if I can, get back to the core set of issues here. What is \nprimarily before us is the rescission bill that cuts into the heart of \nan awful lot of critically important programs that affect the most \nvulnerable of people in our society. It seems to me that we ought to \ntry and keep our eye on that debate. Adding elements here that deal \nwith Jordan and other issues, no matter how laudable and appropriate at \nsome point for us to debate and discuss, I think it becomes rather \nobvious, patently obvious, to anyone who is following this debate that \nthese are efforts to try and distract the attention from the central \nquestion.\n  Certainly this body ought to vote on whether or not you think the \ncuts in nutrition programs and Head Start and drug free schools ought \nto take place or not--we should not have to dwell interminably on those \nquestions--and cast your votes yes or no. If you think that these cuts \nare ones that ought to be made, then you vote for them. If you do not, \nthen you vote otherwise.\n  But I do not think we assist by doing this, since this is almost a \nself-imposed filibuster by the majority on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I want to, first of all, begin by commending the \nmajority to this extent; and that is, the bill, the rescission bill, is \na lot better than what existed in the House. No question, this is an \nimprovement over what was coming over from the House.\n  But it is still a far cry from what I think most people in this \ncountry understand are valuable investments to the future of this \nNation.\n  I was responsible for Head Start, Mr. President, 2 years ago, to \nbring the reauthorization bill of Head Start to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. It was a comprehensive bill that called for many substantive \nchanges in how Head Start was functioning, but it also called for full \nfunding of Head Start.\n  Frankly and very honestly, I prepared myself to come to the floor for \nan extensive debate--it was a fairly controversial bill, the Head Start \nProgram--and to extend full funding and to make other changes, many of \nwhich had been suggested, I might point out, by the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, now the chairperson of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Kassebaum.\n  In any event, I came over with leaflets, folders, and binders to \ndefend this reauthorization bill. I was on the floor all of about 20 or \n30 minutes. There was not a single voice raised in opposition to the \nbill. It was unanimously adopted by this Chamber.\n  It is ironic--maybe that is not the best word to be using here--that \nwe find just a matter of months later a cut coming into the Head Start \nProgram, again, a program that has never been the subject of much \npartisan debate and division over the many years that the program has \nexisted because it works. It does the job that we need to be doing to \ntry to see to it that the young children of this country get a good \nstart in their educational life.\n  It has been a program that has worked tremendously well. Regretfully, \nwe are only getting 1 in 4 of the eligible children with it. So there \nit was the collective judgment that it made sense for us to try to \nreach as many of those eligible children as possible.\n  So the reauthorization bill did that, unanimously adopted, not a \nsingle amendment offered on the floor. We had extensive hearings in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee and worked out, I think, a good \nbill. I think the best evidence of the fact it was a good bill is that \nthere was not a dissenting voice, and not a dissenting vote on that \nmeasure.\n  Now we come back this year and find out all of a sudden not only are \nwe not going to fund to the extent possible all eligible children in \nthis country, but we are actually going to go after the resources that \nare only reaching 1 in 4 of the children in this Nation.\n  There are a lot of messages and people have offered a lot of \ninterpretations as to what happened on November 8 in the election, but \nI think it is a total \n[[Page S5107]] misreading of those electoral results to assume that the \npeople who voted for the new majority anticipated that some of the very \nfirst actions we would be taking would be to go after the most \nvulnerable citizens in our society. The list goes on at some length in \nthis $13 billion rescission package that really does cut into the \ninvestment programs that are critically important for America's \nchildren and America's families.\n  I mentioned Head Start. There are also the nutrition programs and \nchild care development. Again, here we are going to be debating \nshortly, I hope, welfare reform for the country. I do not know of \nanyone--in fact, I want to begin by commending my colleague from \nConnecticut, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson, who is a leading Republican \nMember of the House. To her great credit, she was able to restore some \nof the funding for the child care block grant. She could only go so \nfar, quite frankly, with her amendment to beef up the funding in that \narea in the House package, but we are still terribly short of the child \ncare needs in this Nation.\n  There are some 10 States that have waiting lists of over 10,000 \npeople for existing child care slots before we move people from welfare \nto work. In Florida, I think the number is 23,000 on the waiting list. \nIn Georgia, it is in the neighborhood, I think, of 15,000, to cite two \nStates that come to mind immediately.\n  As we now try to move people from welfare to work, we have to try to \ncome up with a decent approach to how we care for these children. And \nyet, in this rescission package, we find again several millions of \ndollars in cuts in the block grant going back to the States, despite \nthe fact there are already literally hundreds of thousands of people on \nwaiting lists. As we move people from welfare to work, then obviously \nthere is a heightened degree of demand for those slots and additional \nslots. Again, without even expanding the present need out there, we are \ncutting into the present need as we move people in that direction.\n  The WIC Program--Women, Infants, and Children--again, this is a \nprogram for which I do not know of dissenters, never heard of them \nhere, because there is the general conclusion that investment in these \nnutrition programs in the earliest stages of a child's life--in fact, \nearlier for pregnant women--have made tremendous gains for us, not only \nethically and morally, but fiscally in this country. We know today that \na dollar invested in the proper care of a pregnant woman and an infant \nsaves $4 later in health care costs. Those numbers are not being made \nup. Those are the facts. Why in the world would we be making a \nsignificant cut in the Women, Infants, and Children Program, \nrecognizing that it is going to cost us that much more down the road if \nwe do not make those kinds of investments?\n  I might point out, I joined last year with 70 of our colleagues--70--\n70 percent of this body joined as cosponsors for full funding of this \nprogram. Now we find, again, not only are we not reaching the full \nfunding, we are cutting into the dollars that are necessary just to \nmaintain the program at its present level.\n  In education, again--I hardly think it needs repeating out here--the \ninvestment in the educational needs of our children are just going to \nbe greater year after year. Here we had the Speaker of the House offer \na suggestion that there ought to be a tax break given to people who \nmake a donation of a computer to children. People laughed at it. They \nsaid, ``That's a silly idea.'' I do not think the Speaker was silly at \nall. You might argue about whether or not a tax-cut approach is the \nbest way to go, but his instincts were absolutely correct.\n  Today, if you are not computer literate coming out of an educational \nsystem, you are so disadvantaged, and I am not talking about jobs with \ninvestment banking firms or insurance companies or defense contractors. \nEven the most basic simple functions today require a literacy in \ncomputer technology. And here we are making a $100 million cut in a \nprogram to provide computers for children in our school systems.\n  I do not understand what the thinking process is if we expect to grow \neconomically. The best deficit reducer is a growing economy, people at \nwork. That is the best way to cut into this deficit.\n  If we deny these young people the tools they are going to have to \nhave to get the best possible paying jobs in the future, then we are \ngoing to see the obvious effects.\n  In Goals 2000, again, we had increases for disadvantaged children, \nMr. President. To see 70,000 disadvantaged special-needs children being \ndropped off the list of getting help because of a $73 million cut in \nthis $13 billion package, again, I do not understand the importance of \nthat.\n  In a sense, maybe this one particular issue has more poignancy for \nme. I have a sister, Mr. President, who is legally blind, who has been \na teacher for 25 or 30 years. In growing up, my parents were fortunate \nenough to have the resources to make the investments so that my sister \ncould get all the benefits of someone who was disabled.\n  As a result of that, today she has made a significant contribution. \nShe has taught in the largest inner-city elementary school in the State \nof Connecticut, helped provide the Montessori system of teaching in \nthis country, has two master's degrees, has been a highly productive \ncitizen, and has made a significant contribution. What would my \nsister's life be like today had she not grown up in a family that had \nthe resources to make those kinds of investments for her? Would she be \nas productive? And what will happen to these children today that we are \ncutting out of these title I programs? What happens to them?\n  Again, I thought most people in this country understood the value of \ninvesting in these kids so they maximize their potential, become self-\nsufficient, become productive citizens to the maximum extent possible, \nand here we are now going to eliminate some 70,000 of these children \nand their families from that kind of assistance and support.\n  Again, I do not think that is what the message was. I think people \nunderstand that those kinds of investments truly do make a difference \nin the wealth of the Nation.\n  Let me if I can, Mr. President, move, because I know the time is \nmoving fast here, to the national service issue.\n  Again, there is a significant cut here. I want to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and others, because \nthey did a lot better than what was in the House bill.\n  I think it is important that people understand we are talking about a \ndifference here between what was in the House and what is in the Senate \npackage. Mr. President, I think this national service idea, the one \nthat enjoyed such broad-based support only a year or so ago, deserves \nthe strong backing of our colleagues.\n  Again, let me cite a personal story if I can. Mr. President, 35 years \nago another American President challenged a generation by serving in \nsomething called the Peace Corps. When I was finishing up my college, I \nheard that challenge and it excited me. And I served for 2 years as a \nPeace Corps volunteer in Latin America, in the Domincan Republic.\n  I think it was a tremendously valuable experience. The total cost for \nmy 2 years was about $5,000. That was about $100 a month I got paid as \na volunteer, and whatever benefits they provided. I think the total \namount was about that.\n  This program here is a national service program, but not to serve \noverseas. This American President said, ``I think voluntarism and \nserving one's country has tremendous value, and I am going to link it \nwith educational benefits. How about serving here at home, instead of \ngoing overseas.'' Lord knows, we could use the investment.\n  It was exciting and generating a lot of enthusiasm, particularly \namong younger Americans, to answer the call. Presently 20,000 young \nAmericans have answered the call to serve their country. That is a \nremarkable, remarkable return on such a call.\n  In the Peace Corps days, we did not get anything like that, in the \nnumber of people stepping forward to volunteer. Here, 20,000 Americans \nalready, in a little over a year, have stepped forward to volunteer, to \ntry and make this a stronger and better country and reduce costs.\n  They have taught or tutored some 9,000 preschool children. Mr. \nPresident, 9,000 preschool children have benefited as a result of the \nAmeriCorps Program. \n[[Page S5108]] They have established after-school and summer tutoring \nfor more than 4,000 young children. That is just in the first year or \nso of this program. They have organized, and supervised community \nservice projects for more than that 4,400 children, cleaning up \nneighborhoods, delivering food to the elderly.\n  In return for their service, of course, these members earn an \neducational award worth about $4,700 to pay for college courses. What \nbetter tradeoff could we be getting, than asking Americans to step in \nand help out in needed communities, help needy citizens in our country, \nin return for which they get assistance to go on to higher education. \nAgain, all of us recognizing, I think, the value of trying to defer \nthose costs.\n  Mr. President, the Daschle amendment includes funding for these \nprograms, restoring them, in the areas of nutrition, education, and \nAmeriCorps, the volunteer program, that are critically important for \ndisadvantaged children. These are small investments to be making, and \nyet the return to our country is invaluable.\n  There are many people who remember the GI bill and VA mortgages. In \nearly 1950 dollars those were expensive programs, they were not cheap. \nYet, I do not know of anyone who would say it was a bad investment to \nmake when we asked the taxpayers of this country to invest in the \neducation needs of another generation of Americans. That is what we are \ndoing here.\n  To come out on the very first efforts, the very first targets, the \nvery first constituencies that are being asked to bite the bullet are \nthe ones that we will be counting on in the future to make this a \nstronger, a healthier, more vibrant country in the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that the Daschle amendment would be \nsupported. I would hope that we could get an up-and-down vote on these \nmatters, and not cloud and obfuscate the debate by engaging in \nprocedural tactics here that avoid debate and discussion in votes on \nthe issues that are the substance of the underlying bill.\n  It seems to me no one is well served by that tactic. It only \nindicates to many Members that there is somehow some fear about having \nthe kind of votes on these issues that this Chamber ought to, if we are \ngoing to accept the kind of cuts that have been proposed.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can get back to this debate, that we can \nconsider the Daschle amendment, and not see matters be brought up that \nproperly belong on a foreign relations bill and not on a rescission \nbill dealing with the economic needs of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5097-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great team, a \ngreat school, and a great State. It is fair to say that California has \nhad its share of troubles, but it is also fair to say that we have had \nour share of victories.\n  We had a great victory last night, when the UCLA Bruins defeated the \nUniversity of Arkansas Razorbacks for the NCAA Men's Basketball \nChampionship.\n  The victory was all the more impressive because they did it without \nthe play of Tyus Edney, their little floor general.\n  In his absence, the rest of the team stepped up to the challenge. \nThey broke the aggressive defense of the Razorbacks, which has been \ndescribed as 40 minutes of Hell.\n  They won with a combination of youthful enthusiasm, guts, teamwork, \nand stamina. And they won under the watchful gaze of the Wizard of \nWestwood--the legendary retired coach, John Wooden.\n  UCLA pulled down 50 rebounds, 21 of them at the offensive end.\n  Ed O'Bannon, the senior who battled back from knee injury, played the \nentire game last night and was named Most Outstanding Player.\n  Toby Bailey, the freshman phenomenon from Los Angeles, had 26 points. \nIt was a masterful performance against a great opponent.\n  This is the 11th championship by UCLA, and the first for Coach Jim \n[[Page S5109]] Harrick. John Wooden won a remarkable 10 tournaments in \n12 years between 1964 and 1975. Now, for the first time in 20 years \nthey will be able to hang a national championship banner at Pauley \nPavilion.\n  Being the Senator from California, it is with great pride that I \npoint out that four out of five starting players are from California: \nTyus Edney from Long Beach, the sensational brothers Charles and Ed \nO'Bannon from Lakewood, and freshman Toby Bailey from LA.\n  Other Californians on the team are J.R. Henderson, Bob Myers, Kris \nJohnson, and Kevin Dempsey. I am proud to say that not only is it a \nCalifornia school, it is a California team. Other players contributing \nto last night's victory were sophomore Cameron Dollar and senior George \nZidek, an Academic All-American. The players on this team are worthy \nsuccessors of the greats of a generation ago: Alcinder, Goodrich, \nJohnson, Walton, and Hazzard.\n  I would like to extend my sincere condolences to President Clinton \nand the Razorbacks. Obviously, they made a good show. But this win is \nparticularly significant because California has been through a period \nof fire, flood, earthquake, and major grief. And when teams like the \nSan Francisco '49ers win a Super Bowl and the UCLA Bruins win the NCAA \nChampionship, it brings people together and it shows the spark and \nspirit of what made this State so great in the first place.\n  It was a special win. My sincere congratulations to UCLA. I know I am \njoined by my colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, and by every Member of \nthis Senate in saying it was a job truly well done.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I am not going to talk about the amendment \nthat I do want to offer at the appropriate time, providing we continue \nwith this bill. But I would like to talk for a moment about an item \nthat is in the underlying bill. I understand the underlying bill is the \nHouse bill which has been amended by the committee amendment, by the \nDaschle amendment, and by the Dole amendment. So there is a complicated \nstream here, but I am addressing my comments to the underlying bill and \nto the Dole amendment itself.\n  One of the things that we have heard the most discussion about in \nWashington, indeed in the country, is the problem of violence in our \nstreets and the problem of our young people. I do not think there is a \nRepublican or a Democrat who has not run for office talking about \nvalues and the importance of trying to transfer values to the young \npeople of this country.\n  The real test of this country, certainly of the U.S. Senate and the \nHouse, will be our ability to keep faith with the American people and \ntranslate the rhetoric into some kind of substantive approach.\n  Now I do not come to the floor with the notion that the Government \nhas all the answers. I think we have been sobered up and learned a lot \nin the last years. And I do not come to the floor with the notion that \nthe only way to try to deal with the values issue is to have a \nGovernment incentive or a Government program, but we have to be honest. \nAt the same time as we admit that reality, we ought to also admit that \nthere are programs that make a difference; that there are certain \nthings that the private sector will not do for itself; that there are \ncertain kinds of initiatives that only get started by virtue of the \nleverage provided by the public sector which empowers the private \nsector or nonprofits to be able to make a difference in the lives of \nother human beings.\n  One of the cuts that takes place in the underlying Dole amendment, \nwhich I must say, I do not know if it is intentional. I do not know if \nthe Senator from Kansas, who I know to be somebody genuinely concerned \nabout these matters, is aware that this slipped in there or is in \nthere.\n But the effect of the Dole amendment is to cut one of the most \nsignificant programs of accomplishment in this country and it runs \ncompletely counter to the talk of returning responsibility to the local \nlevel, because this amendment takes resources directly out of the \ncommunities and out of the private entities, the self-started entities \nof communities, and strips them of their ability to make a difference \nin the lives of our kids.\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am referring to, or a portion of \nthe Dole amendment, takes $38 million from one of the most successful \nprograms of community investment that we have in this country, a \nprogram called Youth Build.\n  Last night, I had the privilege of being in Boston attending the only \ndinner of its kind in the country about Youth Build. Youth Build is a \nprogram that began 5 years ago. It began in Boston, but it is now in 40 \ncities in America. There are 105 units around this country that seek \nfunding from HUD for Youth Build. Mr. President, there are only two \nstaff people at HUD managing this program--two staff people. So this is \nnot a bureaucratic boondoggle. This program provides money directly to \nlocal communities. It does not go to the State. It is not chewed up in \nthe administrative process. It goes directly to local communities. \nThere is no bureaucracy here. There is no waste here.\n  There is a tremendous record of success. Last night, I saw a film \nabout graduates of this program. One of these graduates was not too \nlong ago in prison. Another graduate was a member of a gang. Another \ngraduate was a drug addict. Today, they are employed in the private \nsector. They are leaders in the community; they are in college; they \nare managers of our Boston Harbor project; they are involved in \nengineering; they are in carpenters unions; they are apprentices. For \nthe first time in their lives, they are making it, and they are making \nit because this program reached out into the community to these kids \nand took kids who had dropped out of school, who have no family \nconnections, and gave them a purpose in life and a skill.\n  What Youth Build does is take these kids and puts them into 1 week of \nhigh-school equivalency and 1 week on a site in an old abandoned home \ndonated by the city, labor donated by the architects of the city, the \ncarpenters union donating the skill, and all of those are married in a \nsynergy that brings those kids into the first-time environment they \nhave ever had that gives them a sense of purpose, a sense of \nresponsibility and accountability, not just to society around them but \nto themselves--each and every one of them.\n  That is values. That is values transfer. Mr. President, it just does \nnot make sense to take the few hundred bucks per person that you are \nstripping away and leave them with the possibility of our spending \n$30,000 to $50,000 a year to house them in a prison somewhere down the \nline.\n  In Boston alone, there are 10 kids applying for this program for \nevery 1 that gets into it. Mr. President, I do not hear people running \naround the Nation saying this is where the waste is. I do not hear \npeople saying cut those programs that put kids into a useful \nenvironment. I do not see some great hue and cry in the country saying, \n``We're going to throw you all out of office if you don't cut the money \nfor Youth Build.'' But we are cutting it, and the \n[[Page S5110]] question has to be asked, why? What is the rationale?\n  We all understand we have to cut somewhere, but does it make sense to \nbe cutting this program and then turn around and spend a huge amount of \nmoney on the Market Promotion Program, for instance, where we give \nmoney to McDonalds and a whole bunch of big companies to sell their \ngoods abroad, companies that can afford to advertise on there own?\n  Mr. President, we have some $85 million, I think it is, in the Market \nPromotion Program. The Market Promotion Program gives Tyson Foods \n$937,000; International Foods, $179,000; Gold's Gym, $226,000; Mott's \nInternational; Pepperidge Farm; Tropicana; Entenmanns; Tootsie Roll; \nBeer Nuts; Ocean Spray; Friendly's; Gortons; Perdue; Giant Food; \nGeneral Mills; Pillsbury; Ralston Purina; M Mars; Campbell Soup; \nHaagen-Dazs; R.W. Frookie; Snapple; Chichita; Borden; Hershey; Brach's \nCandy; Miller beer--they all get money, but Youth Build is not going to \nget money.\n  It does not make sense, Mr. President. I think what the American \npeople said last November is, ``We want you to express some common \nsense on our behalf,'' and, for the life of me, I do not understand why \nwe would want to be cutting a program like Youth Build which has been \nproven to work.\n  Last night, I listened to a young man by the name of Robert Clark. \nRobert Clark was in prison. Robert Clark is now a full-time student at \na well-known university on the east coast of the United States. He is \ndoing well. He has testified before committees in the Congress. He has \ndone an extraordinary job of explaining to people the connection \nbetween a program like Youth Build and his capacity to rejoin society \nas a productive member. It just seems to me that if you are going to \ntalk about investing in the future of this country, we ought to \nremember what makes a difference, Mr. President.\n  Robert Kennedy spoke of this in 1968 in a high school in Scottsbluff, \nNE, and he talked about the sense of community that we ought to be \ncelebrating in a choice like this with respect to Youth Build. He said:\n\n       At every critical mark in our history, Americans have \n     looked beyond the narrow borders of personal concern, \n     remembering the bonds that tied them to their fellow \n     citizens. These efforts were not acts of charity. They sprang \n     from the recognition of a root fact of American life that we \n     all share in each other's fortunes, that where one of us \n     prospers, all of us prosper, and where one of us falters, so \n     do we all.\n\n  He said in 1968, and we ought to think about it again as we make \nthese choices in 1995, that:\n\n       It is this sense, more than any failure of good will or \n     policy, that we have missed in America.\n\n  Mr. President, in the course of exercising choices in this \nlegislation, it seems we are perhaps about to again miss that in \nAmerica, and I hope we will not. I hope we will recognize that perhaps \nthis is an oversight, and we should make a different judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5109-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5110-S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to support \nan effort to restore funding to the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service. The case for national service depends on \nunderstanding that it uniquely offers a triple investment in the future \nproductive capacity of our people and our communities: First, the \nservice performed; second, the service experienced; and third, the \npostservice educational benefit.\n  I know the word ``investment'' has been abused and debated on the \nSenate floor over the years. For some, it is just a code word for \nGovernment spending. We must not, however, become so cynical that we do \nnot see a real investment when a payoff is staring us in the face.\n  The first component of benefit of this investment is the word in the \nname of the organization--service. Critics have tried to attack \nnational service in a number of ways.\n  During the debate on the authorizing legislation, we heard cries \nabout how many more Pell grants we could fund with the money, or how \nmany more job training programs we could fund with the same money. \nThough these criticisms make valid points as far as they go, they lose \nsight of the crucial fact that national service does not exist to \nprovide student aid or job training. The most important benefit of this \nprogram is the service provided by AmeriCorps members.\n  Mr. President, I visited a number of these AmeriCorps projects, and \nbefore that, the national service projects that were the pilot projects \nauthorized before this program. I have seen young people in a small \ntown of Vidalia, GA, helping teach Spanish to young students that did \nnot understand basic Spanish. Most importantly, these students were \nfilling a huge void where there were no Spanish teachers in the \ncommunity by helping immigrants learn to speak English, because they \nhad no way of learning without someone who could converse with them.\n  I have seen young people also in the same community and in Thomson, \nGA, helping in nursing homes in crucial kinds of occupations with our \nelderly citizens. I have seen them in homes for the elderly. I have \nseen them helping the elderly stay in their own homes, which is most \nimportant in terms of both their quality of life and in terms of \nactually saving taxpayers' dollars.\n  I have seen them in tutoring and mentoring positions for young \nkindergarten, first, second and third graders in inner-city schools. \nAnd I have seen them in connection with Habitat for Humanity building \nnew homes for needy families and have begun construction on many other \nhomes.\n  I have seen them in many other occupations, as have others who have \nobserved this program throughout the United States.\n  The second kind of benefit national service provides is the personal \nand civic development of the participants. In recent years, too many \nAmericans have forgotten the relationship between rights and \nresponsibilities. We often see reports in the news media about various \ngroups or individuals proclaiming that this Government service or that \nprotection is a right. We are all so often reminded of the rights all \nAmericans should enjoy that we lose sight too often of the other side \nof the same coin: The responsibilities that we share in order to make \nthe rights possible.\n  Just as we have rights to freedom, to life, liberty and the pursuit \nof happiness, those sacred rights carry with them equally sacred \nresponsibilities.\n  National service is reconnecting the relationship between the two \nfundamental tenets--rights and responsibilities--of our democracy for \nthousands of young people. This program provides young people with \nopportunities to fulfill that obligation to give something back to \ntheir country and to their communities.\n  The third kind of benefit which is derived from the national service \nprogram is the postservice educational benefit. As most of my \ncolleagues will agree, education is the best indicator we have of \nupward mobility. Not only does the participant increase his or her \npotential to get a high-paying job and become a contributing taxpaying \nmember of the community, the community also benefits from citizens who \nrun businesses, citizens who pay taxes,\n citizens who participate in civic organizations, and citizens who \ncontribute to the community.\n\n  This sort of educational assistance becomes even more important in a \ntime when our more traditional forms of educational financial \nassistance are facing severe funding restrictions and reductions.\n  I hope all of my colleagues understand this is not a program which \nfills members' time doing calisthenics or singing ``Kum Bah Yah'' \naround the campfire. They perform hard work desperately needed by local \ncitizens, governments and businesses that is not being performed by \nothers in the community.\n   [[Page S5111]] They get their hands dirty. They are tired at the end \nof the day. They occasionally pound a thumb with a hammer in the \nbuilding occupations which many of them are doing.\n  The bottom line is that the work they do is needed by our \ncommunities. Along the way, they acquire real world skills and maturity \nthat will make them better citizens and help the country.\n  For Congress to decimate this program at a time when it has only \nbegun, before any organized results can be compiled, would be to sell \nthis program, and I believe our young people, and our Nation short.\n  There is a good analogy, Mr. President, to be found between national \nservice and our Nation's Armed Forces. We do not maintain Armed Forces \nin order to provide valuable skills and develop good character in young \nmen and women. Rather, Armed Forces personnel develop skills and \ncharacter in the military as they carry out their primary mission of \nproviding for our Nation's security. The same is true of national \nservice. Members perform crucial important services in their \ncommunities, and along the way they gain important life skills.\n  Additionally, we often hear from some critics who attack national \nservice as coerced voluntarism--as if the provision of a stipend for \nliving expenses somehow cheapens the service performed or stains the \nmotives of the participant.\n  I note the critics seldom raise the same objections to our Nation's \nAll-Volunteer military force. I believe these points are made very \nclear in a recent op-ed by Charlie Moskos, a respected sociologist at \nNorthwestern University, and I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed \npiece be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 14, 1995]\n\n              Building a Constituency for National Service\n\n                          (By Charles Moskos)\n\n       My first and only meeting with Newt Gingrich was in the \n     spring of 1981. The second-term congressman already had a \n     reputation for new ideas and he wanted to talk about national \n     service for young people. He certainly seemed supportive of \n     the concept. Yet, Speaker Gingrich is now quoted as \n     ``totally, unequivocally opposed to national service.'' He \n     lambasted the newly established AmeriCorps as ``coerced \n     voluntarism'' and ``gimmickry.''\n       The quick explanation for this turn-around is that the \n     Republican leader is making points against one of the most \n     significant accomplishments of the Clinton administration. \n     With a GOP majority on Capitol Hill, national service is \n     targeted for elimination in the next budget authorization. \n     Gingrich's present hostility to national service also has an \n     upside, however. Now is the time to refocus public attention \n     on the philosophy and program of AmeriCorps. To bring \n     Gingrich back on board, supporters of national service should \n     be responsive rather than confrontational.\n       First, clarify the terminology. AmeriCorps members are not \n     ``volunteers.'' They receive a minimum-wage stipend and a \n     modest education benefit--$4,725--for each year of service \n     completed. AmeriCorps participants should be called corps \n     members, servers or enrollees.\n       Gingrich's designation of ``coerced volunteerism'' is an \n     oxymoron that misses the point. Does he object when we call \n     our military an ``All-Volunteer Force'' where soldiers earn a \n     decent salary? Or that a member of the Peace Corps is \n     officially called a ``Peace Corps Volunteer'' when paid a \n     stipend equivalent to that of an AmeriCorps server? And, \n     while on the subject, let us not forget volunteerism does not \n     always come free, either. In its first year of operation, the \n     volunteerism-boosting Points of Light Foundation, a George \n     Bush pet project, granted $4 million to service organizations \n     while spending $22 million on promotions and administrative \n     expenses.\n       AmeriCorps was set up to be run mainly through local \n     agencies and non-profit organizations. But national service \n     faces a core paradox. Everyone is for local control and \n     decentralization, but only federally-run and centralized \n     organizations have name recognition and credibility. The \n     blunt fact is that not many Americans have never heard of \n     AmeriCorps and even fewer know what it is doing. Contrast \n     this with Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, \n     John Kennedy's Peace Corps and even Lyndon Johnson's VISTA. \n     National service is, after all, national.\n       Even though the membership of AmeriCorps in its first year, \n     20,000, is greater than that of the Peace Corps at any time, \n     its visibility does not faintly approach the Peace Corps. \n     More striking, the glow of the highly centralized and Army-\n     run CCC remains strong in the national consciousness, even \n     though it expired a half century ago. Yet, the National Youth \n     Administration, the larger but decentralized contemporary of \n     the CCC, is all but forgotten.\n       Two changes are needed if AmeriCorps is to capture the \n     public imagination. At the federal level, the National \n     Civilian Community Corps, presently a minor component of \n     AmeriCorps, must become a modern version of the CCC, one of \n     the most successful programs of the New Deal era.\n       At the local level, AmeriCorps must focus its mission. \n     Currently, it does too many things leaving a diffuse image. \n     An impressive example of what national service can do comes \n     from Germany. Conscientious objectors to the draft perform \n     alternative service. One key duty--meals on wheels, \n     transportation to shopping and medical facilities--allows the \n     elderly to continue to live in their own homes. Savings are \n     tremendous. The value of each server is estimated at more \n     than $25,000 per year above costs. These ``civilian servers'' \n     are now so highly valued that they are used as an argument to \n     maintain military conscription.\n       Whether federally or locally organized, the emphasis in \n     national service must always be on the service delivered, not \n     on the good done for the server. AmeriCorps tends to get \n     mushy--or, as Gingrich puts it, ``gimmicky''--on this score. \n     Proponents of AmeriCorps too often stress how community \n     service benefits the young person, rather than what the \n     server is exactly doing. Young people doing calisthenics in \n     youth corps T-shirts is not the way to guild a constituency \n     for national service.\n       We do not have armed forces to mature young men and women. \n     But the military performs these functions well precisely \n     because it is not defined as remedial organization. The same \n     must be the case for civilian service. We should remember \n     that when FDR introduced the CCC, he stressed the concrete \n     works that would be accomplished not the self-improvement of \n     the corps members. The standard for AmeriCorps should be \n     simple: If the server disappeared would anybody miss her or \n     him?\n       Another trouble spot must be pointed out--a skewed \n     political base. Support for youth corps is by no means to \n     come across that way. After all, it was the centrist \n     Democratic Leadership Council that initiated the contemporary \n     move to national service. Conservative icon William F. \n     Buckley Jr. has long been an eloquent advocate for the cause. \n     Liberal proponents of AmeriCorps must practice diversity when \n     they seek counsel on national service. Bipartisan input is a \n     prerequisite of bipartisan support.\n       One more thing liberals ought to raise with Newt Gingrich. \n     Without AmeriCorps who will staff all those orphanages coming \n     on line?\n\n  Mr. NUNN. We call the military services now a volunteer force, but \nthey are paid substantially more, even at entry levels, than any of the \nyoung people in national service. I think that is appropriate.\n  The educational benefits are also higher, substantially higher, than \nthe national service educational benefits. If we add educational \nbenefit to the total pay package, there is no real comparison between \nthe pay and benefits of the military, which is much higher than \nnational service, and that is the way it should be, because military \npersonnel are also in harm's way on many occasions.\n  It is a different occupation, but the thing that is very similar is \nthat they are both called voluntary and they both are voluntary. No one \nis compelled to take either occupation or either program.\n  I think we should be very careful in saying on the one hand that \nnational service is not voluntary because these young people are being \npaid, and the military is voluntary because they are also being paid \nand they are also in many of the occupations, getting special bonuses. \nThey are still volunteers.\n  Considering all the benefits national service provides, at the \ncommunity level, it is difficult to see why some of our colleagues \nobject to it. Indeed, given the debates we have heard on unfunded \nmandates legislation and the, I think, justifiable move for continued \ndevolution of responsibilities from the Federal to State and local \ngovernments in this body, I would hope that our colleagues would agree \nthat national service represents the type of government we ought to \nsupport.\n  National service is not a Federal mandate for any specific type of \nservice. That is left up to the communities, and the communities decide \nwhether they want to participate at all. National service gives \ncommunities and service organizations the chance to voluntarily \nidentify and perform the kind of service which best meets the local \nneed, with the Federal Government providing most, but not all, of the \nfunding.\n  At the same time, it allows young people to serve their communities \nand \n[[Page S5112]] to address real problems without Federal \nmicromanagement.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would make the point that the proposed \nrescission of national service funds is, to say the least, premature. \nThe first full funding year is only half complete and the data on the \nprograms' accomplishments is only available in anecdotal form.\n  We need analysis on the program. Rather than making a decision to cut \nthis program based on incomplete information now available to the \nappropriations process, we should save this debate on the scope and the \ndirection of the program for the authorizing committee next year, when \nmore complete information is available.\n  I am confident that the program, if given a chance to do so, will \nadmirably prove its worth. At least we should give it a chance.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to restore funding of the \nnational service program. I urge them not to fail the students and the \nyoung people who are learning maturity and life skills through their \nservice in the program. Most important, I urge them not to fail the \ncommunities, the churches, the schools, the businesses, and the \nindividuals who benefit from the hard work of our young people. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask to speak 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to respond to the \nSenator from Georgia, who I have the utmost amount of respect for, and \nrespect his views on the national service plan. I just happen to \ndisagree with them. I wanted to comment on a couple of the points he \nmade.\n  I have heard often this analogy that national service corps members \nare volunteers as much as people who are in our military are volunteers \nbecause we have an all-volunteer force. The reason we call it an all \nvolunteer force, it is the only area that I am aware of where we have \nthe Government authority that can force people to do something they \nwould not otherwise do. Force people to work. In other words, work in \nthe military.\n  The Government, through our authority as a Government, can if we so \nchoose, force people, conscript people into the military.\n  As I am sure the Senator from georgia knows, there is a whole body of \nemployment law out there that says an employer cannot force an employee \nto perform for the employer. If I am an employer outside of the \ngovernment, outside of the military--not just outside of the \ngovernment, outside the military--I cannot force someone to go to work \nfor me. If a person wants to leave my employment, I cannot force them \nto stay.\n  So the reason it is called a volunteer army is because the military \nhas the authority to make a person work for them even if they do not \nwant to.\n  To suggest that AmeriCorps and national service is volunteer, based \non that motto, makes me a volunteer. No one forced me to run for the \nU.S. Senate. So I guess I volunteered for it. So I guess people could \ncall me a volunteer. The young lady standing in front of me who is \ntaking down my words, is, in fact, a volunteer. No one made her take \nthis job. She took it because she volunteered for it.\n  So we are all volunteers. Well, that is nice. That is sort of fuzzy \nand makes the waters a little murky. If we are all volunteers, then--\nnone of us are volunteers, really. And that is really the point. This \nis no more a volunteer than any other job in any other agency of the \nFederal Government.\n  In fact, I believe the Senator from Missouri who came up here \nyesterday, Senator Bond, had a chart that showed that about 10 percent, \nor 15 percent of AmeriCorps employees work for the Federal Government, \nwork for the Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Energy, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the National Endowment for the Arts. A lot \nof them are, in fact, plain old Government employees, paid for through \nthis AmeriCorps Program.\n  I just hope we get the rhetoric right here. This is not voluntarism. \nThere really is not any other example that would suggest that someone \nwho is making what an AmeriCorps volunteer makes is a volunteer.\n  Senator Grassley was on the floor yesterday talking about employees \nfrom ACORN, which is a housing organization, funded with $1 million for \nAmericorps. The average cost for each AmeriCorps volunteer is $41,000. \nThat is what each ACORN volunteer is paid in compensation packages, \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has a $1 million AmeriCorps grant. \nThese volunteers make $48,000 a year. Now, it is hard to sell, at least \nto me and I think a lot of Americans, that people making that amount of \nmoney are truly volunteers.\n  What the Senator from Georgia did say that I agree with is that there \nare worthwhile projects going on within Americorps. I do not think \nthere is any question there certainly is a need to help children learn \nhow to read or help people who need some assistance. The AmeriCorps \nprogram does fill in some gaps and holes and can be very helpful.\n  What I have suggested in the past, and I suggest to the Senator from \nGeorgia, is that there will be a bill coming to the floor of the Senate \nthis year, and it is a welfare reform bill that is going to have work \nprograms in place for people who truly are in need of the work \nexperience, the training, the education. Those people are the folks we \nshould be targeting these kinds of projects on, these kinds of duties \nthat can be done by people who truly need them.\n  The problem with AmeriCorps is you do not have to be poor to be in \nAmeriCorps. You do not have to be young. You always hear people \ndefending AmeriCorps, saying, ``All these young people, we need to help \nthem.'' You can be in AmeriCorps if you are 60 years of age. You can be \nin AmeriCorps if you are a millionaire. There is no age limitation up \nto 60; there is no limitation on income. In fact, 25 percent of the \npeople already in AmeriCorps have family incomes of $50,000 or more.\n  So when you hear of all these wonderful images of poor young children \nout there doing these things and this is what these programs are for, \nthat is just a few examples. That is not the norm. What we should do is \ntake this idea of community service, which is a very beneficial one, \nand focus it on the people who need it the most and create those work \nprograms for the people who are already receiving the Government \nbenefit, and that is people on welfare who desperately need, \ndesperately need the opportunities that these kinds of worthwhile \njobs--and many of them are worthwhile jobs--would have.\n  So I am not against community service. I do not think anybody who \nstands up here says we are against community service. We believe \ncommunity service is a laudable thing. We also believe it should still \nbe a volunteer thing, not a paid position.\n  I think it undermines the whole volunteer spirit in America if you \ntake a selected class of people and say these people are somehow better \nvolunteers, and therefore should be paid, than those who are not.\n  So again, I commend the Senator from Georgia for his idealism, but I \nthink we can better focus it on the people who are in need, the people \nwho already receive Government assistance, the people who need the \nopportunity to move forward as opposed to folks who are being targeted \nfor the AmeriCorps Program today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, the leaders of both parties have been \nmeeting and working on an agreement and I believe we are about ready to \nmake some requests here. I understand perhaps we will be ready to go \nwith that in just a moment. So in order to facilitate the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, if I could at this point observe the absence of a \nquorum so we could get this unanimous-consent agreement put in.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  [[Page S5113]] Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield for a question. We \nwant to get this unanimous-consent request as quickly as possible, but \nI will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Do I understand from the Senator from Mississippi that \nfinally, at long last, the two leaders are working and are, according \nto the information that he has, about to come on the floor to outline \nsome unanimous-consent type of agreement that will move the process \nahead?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that has been occurring. I know the leaders met \nwithin the last few minutes and they are looking over an agreement \nwhich we hope to be able to announce momentarily. I see the \ndistinguished Democratic leader is here, so maybe we are ready. We are \nnot quite ready yet?\n  Mr. EXON. I was about ready to try to get the amendment before us set \naside for the purpose of calling up an amendment that I first presented \nat the desk way back last week, sometime Friday. I had it ready \nWednesday, almost a week ago, and have been trying to accommodate \neverybody else. But there does not seem to be much accommodation.\n  But I guess I can wait for another 10 minutes to see whether or not \nwe can bring some reality out of the morass that we seem to be in from \nthe standpoint of procedure in the Senate as of now.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senate is underway and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska for his patience.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Snowe).

Madam President, I rise to speak on a portion of this \nconsideration regarding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It has \nbeen my concern for some time that we could make the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting self-funding, or, if I may use the term, \nprivatized, although I think self-funding would be better.\n  Presently the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a private \ncorporation with Federal funding. At the end of their programming each \nday you see it says, ``The Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded \nby the Federal Government''--a private corporation funded by the \nAmerican people.\n  I am of the opinion that through a program that I recently presented \nin the Washington Post, the corporation can become private, can become \nself-funding, and it is not necessarily by increasing advertising. It \nis rather by digitizing, compressing its programming, and making it \navailable for sale to such outlets as Arts and Entertainment, to the \nLearning Channel, to the History Channel, and to the hundreds of new \nvideo dial tone channels that are springing up across the country from \nthe regional telephone companies.\n  Also, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its public \nbroadcasting entities could get a great deal larger percentage of the \nthings that appear on the free public platform. They have already voted \nto start getting a larger percentage of that.\n  For example, whether it is Barney, or whether it is Bill Moyers' \nJournal, or whatever else, if there is money made from the sale of \ntapes of that show and paraphernalia, I think the taxpayers ought to be \nentitled to 20 percent or 30 percent of it--or maybe more--whatever \nthey can negotiate in a businesslike way.\n  In addition, public broadcasting will be digitizing and compressing \nparts of its spectrum, and they can rent part of that spectrum or sell \nit or use it in some way, and they can have far more money than they \nhave now.\n  So my point is, Madam President, that the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and the other public broadcasting entities are sitting on \na treasure trove that they can utilize. The taxpayers of this country \ndo not have to subsidize them. They can do just as well. They can \nprovide more money to rural radio and TV and more money to children's \nprogramming than they are now.\n  If this body wishes, when it comes to zeroing out and to replacing \nover a 3-year period or 2-year period their moneys, they can place a \nrequirement for certain rural programming and for children's \nprogramming--just as when Conrail was privatized on this Senate floor \nand we placed certain covenants or requirements on Conrail to provide \ncertain local service, just as we require airlines to provide certain \nsafety for the public, just as we require that other private companies \nmeet service requirements, such as the regional telephone companies who \nhave a universal fund to provide long-distance services in rural areas \nand small towns. All of this can be done.\n  Vice President Gore talked about reinventing and privatizing. I think \nand have thought that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the \nPublic Broadcasting Service, and National Public Radio can do so.\n  Madam President, the defenders of the status quo have waged a \nnationwide campaign that is very misleading. They say that Senator \nPressler and others are out to kill Big Bird or out to kill rural \nradio. Is it not strange that they do not talk about cutting anything \ninside the beltway? When we look at the National Public Radio building \nand its equipment; at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its \nsalaries; at the nonprofit organizations that have sprung up alongside \nthat receive their grants and which in turn pay salaries two and three \ntimes higher than Senators make--we should remember that this is \ntaxpayers' money.\n  So I join in this effort that is on the Senate floor, and also I am \nworking with the Budget Committee to have a 3-year plan to phase out \nthe Federal subsidy.\n  Earlier this year, Madam President, there was some controversy about \na questionnaire that I sent to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nAs chairman of the oversight committee, I asked a lot of questions \nabout where and how the money moved. In my State of South Dakota, we \nget $1.7 million from Washington, DC, but instantly have to send over \n$1 million back for programming. My State and small rural States should \nbe able to shop around. Maybe they would want to buy some digitized \ncompressed programming from Arts and Entertainment, or from \nNickelodeon. This children's programming is marketed to France, \nincidentally, and dubbed. It is about the only cultural import the \nFrench welcome, educational children's programming made privately.\n  The point of the whole matter is that there are plenty of \nopportunities for public broadcasting to make money, and it is most \nunfortunate that they are not carrying that out. But they put forth the \nargument that we are trying to take away children's programming and \nrural radio. That is not true.\n  In my State, our State legislature voted down a resolution urging \nthat more Federal moneys be sought for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting because people understand that there is a very misleading \ncampaign underway here. My State is one of those that has the most \nrural radio perhaps of all.\n  Let me say, Madam President, that I have contributed every year to \npublic broadcasting, long before this debate. I contributed again this \nyear because I think it has its place. But those small States are not \ngetting their fair share under the present formulas that are used. And \nfar more of the moneys go to grants to their favorite foundations and \nnonprofit groups here inside the beltway that pay salaries up to \n$750,000 a year as Senator Dole published on this Senate floor, and \nother salaries of $450,000, and so forth. Those are taxpayers' dollars, \nincidentally.\n  So the next time someone comes up to me and says, ``Ah, you are \nagainst rural radio,'' I would say to them that one salary here paid at \nthe favorite foundations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is \ngreater than my whole State gets in a year's time.\n  So let us put things into perspective. The Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and its related entities here inside the beltway have \nbecome a bloated bureaucracy, and reform is needed.\n  They are making some reforms now, and I commend them for those \nreforms. One of the reforms was that they voted \n[[Page S5114]] to start getting a percentage of those items that appear \nand make profits on the free public platform that is provided. Another \nreform that they are making, I believe, is that they are starting to \nlearn to partner with the information superhighway to compress and \ndigitize their programming and sell it, or swap it, and that is \nsomething that I have advocated for a long time. So I think what will \ncome out of this is a better Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a \nbetter public TV and radio in this country.\n  So far as the questions that I submitted, they are the same questions \nthat every broadcaster in this country must answer every year regarding \nminority hiring, but public broadcasting somehow feels they are exempt \nfrom it. They have the stories written in the paper that I asked about \nthe ethnicity and race of employees. That is what every broadcaster in \nthis country must answer every year, and every small businessman who \nhas contracts with the Federal Government can be called upon to produce \nat any time. And they also, if questioned, have to say who the \nminorities are. It is alleged, though I cannot prove it or disprove it, \nthat they do not meet their minority hiring requirements with permanent \nemployees. They do it with part-time employees. A small businessman in \nmy State can be prosecuted for doing that, but they think they are \nexempt from responding to the committee that has oversight, apparently. \nSo I find that the attitude there is very unusual.\n  Now, I have another interesting thing that I learned, which is that \nthe reporters who wrote about this for the New York Times and the \nWashington Post, coincidentally, are paid to appear on public \ntelevision, although they did not say that in their stories. It is hard \nto get a story correct. I do want to commend the Post though. They did \nallow me to publish an op-ed that laid out my point of view after I met \nwith the board of editors of the Washington Post.\n  I think what we have is a very arrogant system, from a management \npoint of view, that has been built up in the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. I never really looked into it until I became chairman of \nthe committee this year. That is my job. That is what I am supposed to \ndo. But they are forward-funded through next year. I think the House of \nRepresentatives has done an excellent job of laying the groundwork to \nphase out the Federal funding as they phase in these self-funding \ndevices. That is a positive thing. But the Corporation and its allies \nhave run a misleading campaign around the country telling people that \nthose Republicans are out to kill Big Bird and are out to shut off \nrural radio. That is simply not true.\n  Madam President, there are many reasons that the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting was created in 1967. But public radio and TV \nexisted before that. I gave my first speech in a debate at the \nUniversity of South Dakota on public television in 1963 before we ever \nhad the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And so I join with my \ncolleagues here on the Senate floor, and I hope I can say I join with \nthe leadership of public broadcasting in this country, to move toward a \nbetter system, a system not so bloated with bureaucracy.\n  In our States, our State legislatures pay most of the costs of our \npublic radio and television. Individual contributors also, such as \nmyself and, I might add, Newt Gingrich, have contributed to public \nradio and TV. The State legislatures pay for most of the public radio \nand television in this country. The corporation was founded so there \nwould be a national clearing house, so to speak, and it did a lot of \ngood things. But we have now entered an age where it has been proved \nthat this quality programming can be marketed, and their programming \ncould be marketed. It does not need to mean more ads.\n  Incidentally, public radio and TV in many cases has more revenue from \nads than does commercial radio and TV in many markets. That is another \nunknown. They call them enhanced underwriting, but they are \nadvertisements, and that is fine with me. I think we should analyze the \nthing as it really is. In the oversight committee, we should look at \nthe facts as they really are, and so for that reason I join in efforts \nhere on this floor to do what the House of Representatives has done, to \nstart a phaseout over a 3-year period of the moneys, of the taxpayers' \nmoney. To replace that, there is an abundance, a treasure trove from \nwhich it can be done.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at this point to have \nprinted in the Record my op-ed that was published in the Washington \nPost that deals with the subject of how public broadcasting can become \nself-financing.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 1995]\n\n                       Reality-Based Broadcasting\n\n                      (By Senator Larry Pressler)\n\n       ``Public broadcasting is under attack!'' ``Congress wants \n     to kill Big Bird!'' These and other alarmist cries have been \n     common in recent weeks. The problem is they are lies. That's \n     right, lies. I tried to conceive of a more polite way to say \n     it. I could not. With rare exceptions the press largely has \n     ignored the specifics of the position taken by members of \n     Congress seeking to reinvent public broadcasting.\n       I have struggled to make my position clear Yet the \n     misrepresentations continue. I am convinced many simply do \n     not care to report the facts--facts they do not find as \n     interesting as the scenarios they create. That is too bad. \n     The average American taxpayer would find the facts extremely \n     interesting.\n       As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science \n     and Transportation, I am not seeking to destroy public \n     television and radio. I am a strong supporter of public \n     broadcasting, both in my home state of South Dakota and \n     nationally. Pull the plug? Absolutely not. Rather, my plan \n     would expand opportunities and save taxpayer dollars.\n       Why do I seek change? Because times have changed. Today's \n     electronic media are vastly different from those of the \n     1960s, when the current system of federal subsidies for \n     public broadcasting was established. The old theory of \n     ``market failure'' for educational programming is completely \n     untenable in today's environment. Educational and cultural \n     programs can and do make profits when their quality is good \n     and marketing astute. The only money losers in today's \n     arrangement are the taxpayers.\n       A Feb. 24 Post editorial stated it is time for the public \n     broadcasting industry to face reality. The issue no longer \n     should be whether federal subsidies for public broadcasting \n     will be cut. I could not agree more. Congress now is debating \n     when and how much. The House Appropriations subcommittee on \n     labor, health and human services already has cut the public \n     broadcasting budget. The House leadership promises more to \n     come. I fully expect the Senate to follow suit.\n       Instead of crying over public cash, it would be more \n     prudent for public broadcasting executives to use their \n     talents and resources developing the numerous potential \n     sources of revenue available to replace the federal subsidy \n     rather than continuing to fan the flames of fear and \n     exaggeration. As captains of a major corporation, their \n     responsibilities should be clear. The Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting (CPB), National Public Radio (NPR) and the \n     Public Broadcasting System (PBS) need to learn to stand on \n     their own feet.\n       To help in that effort, I recently provided the chairman of \n     the board of CPB with a plan to end its dependency on federal \n     welfare in three years. Ideas to end CPB's addiction to \n     taxpayer dollars include:\n       Profits from sales. CPB should renegotiate sales agreements \n     and improve future agreement to get a larger share of the \n     sales of toys, books, clothing and other products based on \n     its programming. In 1990, Barney-related products retailed at \n     $1 billion! Steps have been taken by the CPB board to improve \n     its share of such sales. More should be done.\n       Make the most of new technology. Use of new compressed \n     digitization technology would permit existing noncommercial \n     licensees to expand to four or five channels where once they \n     had only one. Public broadcasting stations could rent, sell \n     or make use of the additional channels for other \n     telecommunications and information services.\n       End redundancy. At least one-quarter of public television \n     stations overlap other public television stations' signal \n     areas. Public radio also suffers from the inefficiencies of \n     redundancy. Ending this overlap and selling the excess \n     broadcast spectrum would provide substantial revenues to \n     public broadcasting.\n       Switch channels. Moving public television stations from \n     costly VHF channels to less costly UHF channels in certain \n     markets would provide a substantial source of new revenue.\n       Team with other information services. CPB could increase \n     commercial arrangements in the computer software market and \n     with on-line services.\n       These are only a few of the ways in which the CPB could \n     reinvent itself into a self-sufficient corporation for the \n     `90s and, indeed, for the next century. Ending federal \n     dependency does not end public broadcasting. Today's subsidy \n     amounts to only 14 percent of the industry's spending! \n     Indeed, my current plan asks the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting to end its dependency on federal welfare in \n     three years--that's one year more \n     [[Page S5115]] than what current proposals would give welfare \n     recipients to get off federal assistance.\n       It would be tragic if the public broadcasting industry \n     ignores its responsibilities when the federal budget is in \n     crisis. It also would be tragic if the industry spurns \n     exciting opportunities in new markets and technologies. \n     Perhaps most tragic of all, however, would be continued \n     retrenchment from public broadcasting executives crying. ``It \n     can't be done.'' It can be done. It should be done.\n    Clinton and Gore Try to Set Back Telecommunications Competition\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, on a second subject, I was very \ndisappointed this morning in a conversation with Vice President Gore to \nlearn that the administration is opposed to my telecommunications bill \nand that the present plan is to veto that bill if it were to pass. I \nsay that because I believe in this Chamber there would be 85 to 90 \nvotes for the telecommunications bill today if it came up for a vote.\n  The Vice President said the administration was opposing it for three \nreasons. First, because they do not like the cable provisions; second, \nbecause they do not like the lack of a merger prohibition on regional \ntelephone and cable companies; and third, because they would like to \nhave a Justice Department review, in addition to an FCC review, in \ndetermining when Bell companies can enter the long-distance and \nmanufacturing markets.\n  Madam President, we have worked out these matters. Every Democrat on \nthe Commerce Committee voted for this bill. The administration did not \navail itself of the opportunity to come up here during all the long \nnegotiations and let us know of their strong feelings. Then all of a \nsudden the Vice President is working against having the bill brought \nup--and announces that the administration is opposed to it. This comes \nafter we have made substantial accommodations and we have worked out \nthe cable and long distance issues.\n  For example, with regard to cable rate deregulation, the basic tier \nremains regulated in the bill. The upper tier is deregulated with a \nbad-actor proviso--that is, rate regulation would be possible if a \ncable operator charges rates which are substantially above the national \naverage. So there is consumer protection on the cable issue.\n  And then after 2 or 3 years, or when there is at least 15 percent of \nDBS--direct broadcast satellite--in a market, basic cable is \nderegulated. Or when there is video dialtone service present in a \nmarket, basic cable would be deregulated. The Vice President feels \nstrongly that this is inappropriate. But this represents a compromise \nthat was worked out between Republicans and Democrats. In fact, every \nDemocrat on the Commerce Committee voted for it. The committee \noverwhelmingly approved the bill by a 17-to-2 margin.\n  The next objection was on cable and telephone company mergers. The \ndecision not to put that in was agreed to on both sides of the aisle. \nThe proposal to limit cable and telephone company acquisitions, mergers \nor joint ventures is redundant, as current law--Hart, Scott, Rodino--\nalready provides antitrust scrutiny in this area.\n  Regarding the Justice Department, we already have the FCC, with \npublic interest and competitive checklist language, reviewing this. \nThere is no need for a second review by the Justice Department. We are \nrepealing the MFJ. That is the whole idea of this bill, to replace the \ncourts with congressional action. The Justice Department could still \nbring antitrust action. They have that power on any aspect of American \nbusiness.\n  So I am strongly in disagreement with the Vice President's \nassessment. And I am very saddened by it because it means, as a result \nof that, we will not be bringing my bill up this week. We will bring it \nup early after we come back. But I am fearful that during that time \nthis bill will be picked apart by the various interests. It is the sort \nof bill where we had good momentum until the administration opposed it \nand began working against it here, working against its being brought \nup. I ask my colleagues from the Democratic side to contact the Vice \nPresident and to persuade him and the administration that this is a \ngood bill. It is the best bill we are going to get.\n And it is supported across the country.\n\n  I am very worried and saddened at the developments that have occurred \nhere. I am determined to go forward. We will get the bill up in April \nor May. We will proceed with it. This body will vote for it \noverwhelmingly, and should vote for it.\n  All the staffs on both sides of the aisle have been involved. I do \nnot think any bill has ever had more consultation or more staff work--\nwithout a day off, from Christmas Day, literally--on this bill.\n  It has been an open, inclusive process. The last time, people \ncomplained that nobody knew what was in the telecommunications bill; \nthere was not enough consultation. So we had meetings all day and all \nnight, even Saturday and Sunday, with staff from Members on both sides \nwho were interested. So everyone had their input--except the \nadministration, which never made a peep. Now, suddenly, the \nadministration is actively working to encourage Democratic Members to \ncontact the minority leader's office to keep it from being brought up. \nAnd that saddens me a great deal.\n  I hope, Madam President, that this is merely a delay. We will fight \non with this piece of legislation. Probably no piece of legislation \nthis year has been more widely discussed and consulted about. All 100 \nMembers of the Senate have been involved in some way. We are ready to \ngo. The bill is filed. The report is filed. The committee has voted. It \nhas amendments added to it. We need to bring it up and vote amendments \non the floor. The country needs this bill.\n  Now, what will happen if we do not pass this bill? It will reduce \njobs and hurt the United States.\n  This bill has been called a $2 trillion bill by George Gilder because \nit will cause an explosion of new activity in telecommunications. It \nwill boost our exports. It will cause a number of new devices to be \ndistributed to the American people.\n  Presently, we have very little of the so-called information \nsuperhighway here. Everybody talks about it. We have cellular phones, \nsome computer Internet, and we have cable TV. But that is all. Most \npeople are not on the information superhighway and they will not be \nuntil we pass this bill.\n  Otherwise, the people who invest in telecommunications are paralyzed, \nwaiting for a roadmap, waiting for the ground rules. In fact, many \npeople who invest in telecommunications are investing in Europe because \nthey cannot get approval, because we have economic apartheid of the \nregional Bells, economic apartheid of the long-distance companies, and \nso forth.\n  So I call upon this administration to listen to the Democrats in this \nbody and to the Republicans, and not to obstruct this bill. Indeed, we \nwill bring it up for a vote. We will get 85 votes on final passage on \nthis bill, or more.\n  It is very strange. In my time in Congress, in my 21 years, I have \nnever seen a situation where a committee votes out a bill with all the \nmembers of the President's party voting for it, and then the \nadministration, which has been absent, announces it is opposed to it \nand will veto it--without, apparently, consulting with any of the \nmembers of that committee. That is very, very strange.\n  Maybe I am misunderstanding something here. But I do not think I have \never seen anything like that happen before. I think that there is \nsomething going on in Presidential politics or something that I am not \nquite a party to. I find it very disappointing and very strange.\n  But let me say to all the supporters of the bill not to lose faith. \nWe will carry on. We will pass it. It is going to be tough.\n  I do not think, in the end, the President will veto it if it is in \nthe light of day and when the country understands what is in it. But if \nhe does, we will override the veto in both Houses, because the votes \nare there.\n  Madam President, I thank you very much for the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5113-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5116-S5118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Daschle amendment \nto the disaster supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The amendment makes needed improvements to the bill before us. It \nrestores funding for education, job training, and children's programs, \nand it renews the commitment we made in the last Congress to community \nservice.\n  It would be a grave error is the Senate defeats this amendment and \ndecides instead to revoke investments we have already made in improving \nthe lives of working families and children to pay for the Republican \ncontract's tax cuts for the rich and for tax provisions such as the \nbillionaire's loophole that we debated on the Senate floor yesterday.\n  Majority Leader Dole said recently that ``the American people want a \nbetter use of their tax dollars--starting now.'' But only half of the \ncuts in the rescission package are needed to pay for the ongoing \nrecovery costs from the 1994 California earthquake. The other half of \nthe cuts are being extracted from hard-working families to pay for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy, and that isn't fair.\n  Amerians are beginning to look behind the rhetoric at the heart of \nthe Republican revolution. The fog of rhetoric is lifting, and the \nreality is emerging--an attack on children and families to pay for tax \ncuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society.\n  Congress should not be taking from the most vulnerable and \ndefenseless in order to raise even higher the standard of living for \nthose who are already well off.\n  The new Republican majority is arbitrarily cutting and trimming \neducation programs even before our support for schools has had time to \nget to the classroom.\n  For what reason? To provide a tax cut for rich Americans? That makes \nno sense. Democrats do not believe in depriving young children of the \ngood start they need that is provided in Head Start. Democrats do not \nbelieve in depriving public schools the help they need to achieve \nreform. Democrats do not believe in depriving college students of an \naffordable education. Democrats do not believe in depriving young \nAmericans of opportunities to contribute to their community through \nnational service and simultaneously earn money to pay for college.\n  The numbers themselves demonstrate the shortsightedness of the \nRepublican proposals. Who will contribute more to our county's \ntreasury? A college graduate who earns an average of $32,000, or a high \nschool dropout who earns $13,000?\n  It is poor government policy and poor business sense to adopt short-\nterm budget savings that will inevitably result in much smaller future \ntax revenues and much more serious long-term social problems. How do \nyou support a family on $13,000 a year?\n  The Daschle amendment will restore $700 million for education, \nchildren, and training. It restores these shortsighted cuts and \npreserves the sensible education investment strategy proposed by \nPresident Clinton and Democrats.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric in the last 100 days about the \n``American people.'' One thing is unmistakably clear about the American \npeople--they solidly back the Democratic priority on investing in \neducation.\n  Two out of three Americans favor increased spending for education, \naccording to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. That confirms a \nfinding in a poll by the Washington Post/ABC News. Eight out of 10 \npeople favor a balanced budget amendment, but 2 out of 3 say they would \nnot support such an amendment if it means that education or Social \nSecurity would be cut.\n  Finally, a poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the \nPress found that 64 percent would increase spending on public schools \nif given the opportunity to set Federal budget priorities, while only 6 \npercent would decrease spending.\n  Among 14 Government programs cited, support for public schools was \nsecond only to anticrime programs. The position of the American people \non support for education is unmistakably clear. They want to cut the \nwaste and fat in Government, not the muscle of education.\n  Democrats understand why there is such strong support for education. \nWe are proud to be the defenders of increased investments in students. \nWe are proud to be on the side of all those who understand that a \ncommitment to excellence in education is the basic underpinning of our \nsociety and our democracy. Education has made our country great, and it \nwill be the key to our future strength.\n  A fresh example of the shortsighted thinking is the recommendation to \ncut investments in technology for education. Yesterday, the Office of \nTechnology Assessment released an impressive report on teachers' use of \ntechnology in the classroom. As the introduction to the report states:\n\n       OTA finds the lack of attention to teachers and \n     technologies ironic, for at the center of effective use of \n     instructional technologies are those who oversee the daily \n     activities of the classroom--the teachers.\n\n  Previous reports by OTA and others on computers in schools have \nsounded the alarm about the dangers of technological illiteracy in our \nsociety. As widely used technologies have become more sophisticated, \nteachers' roles become even more critical. The rescission packages, \nhowever, also cuts teacher training by 31 percent in the House and the \nSenate by 22 percent.\n  In an address to the National School Boards Association on February \n21, Speaker of the House Gingrich called upon school boards to vastly \nincrease the amount of money they spend on technology. Currently, \ndistricts spend three-tenths of 1 percent. ``We are two generations \nbehind in introducing technology,'' he said.\n  Our Republican colleagues respond to the obvious need for technology \nby cutting an already small Federal technology budget. Star Schools, \none of the most successful and popular Federal education investments, \nwas cut 30 percent by the House, and 15 percent by the Senate. The new \ntechnology program in title III of ESEA, just authorized last October, \nwas cut by 75 percent in the House and 12 percent in the Senate bill.\n  Families throughout the country understand that computers, CD Roms, \ninteractive video, and other technological advances have opened the \ndoor to vast amounts of scientific and academic information for \nstudents. Through these miracles of technology, pupils in classrooms in \nremote communities can meet students from many other lands, participate \nin fascinating scientific projects such as the Maya Cycling Expedition, \nand talk to experts around the world.\n  The simple fact, however, as the OTA report makes clear, and as a GAO \nreport that Senator Moseley-Braun will release this afternoon \nunderscores, is that public schools in this country are years behind \nevery other institution in providing students with these opportunities.\n  It is important to balance the budget. But it will be an impossible \ntask unless students are well-prepared and well-trained to be \nproductive workers who earn good wages and salaries, who can support \ntheir families and pay their taxes.\n  Other education investments restored by the Daschle amendment are \nequally important.\n  In the last Congress, in bipartisan action--the vote to pass the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act was 77 for and 20 against. That \nbill reshaped the way the Federal Government supports education.\n  In ESEA, in Goals 2000, in the Improving America's Schools Act, and \nin the School to Work Opportunity Act, we said to the States: ``If we \nare going to reach the National Education Goals, all students should be \nheld to the same high standards, and the States should develop these \nstandards.''\n  We said ``It's time to cut the redtape. Local schools should be given \nmore flexibility to consolidate small Federal programs to that they can \ndesign comprehensive, coherent reform plans.''\n  And finally we said ``Accountability should rest on results.'' \nInstead of telling schools exactly what to do with Federal dollars, we \nsaid ``You decide what works best and we won't monitor what you do. But \nwe will hold you accountable for how much students learn.''\n  [[Page S5117]] We backed up our commitment with Federal dollars. \nStates responded. Over 40 States have developed plans to use Goals 2000 \ndollars. Hundreds of schools have already planned to use their increase \ntitle I dollars and their new flexibility to see that students learn \nmore. At the very moment when schools and States and students are \nresponding as we hoped they would, we should not be reducing our \ninvestment.\n  Unless we restore these funds, many of those schools will believe we \ndidn't mean what we said. Seventy thousand school children will be \ndenied extra help in reading and math. Thirteen hundred schools will \nnot be able to implement their plans for school reform.\n  Consider what States have already been doing with these funds. To \npick one district at random, the Lawrence School District in Kansas is \nusing Goals 2000 funds to develop new assessments to more accurately \nanalyze whether students are meeting high standards.\n  Pennsylvania has given Philadelphia $250,000 of its Goals 2000 funds \nto develop clusters, and provide schools and their communities with \nmore freedom from local rules in designing their curricula. Some \nschools are lengthening their schoolday and extending education \nservices to parents in order to promote literacy.\n  Massachusetts is using Goals 2000 funds to support the startup costs \nof 15 charter schools.\n  My question to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is very \nstraightforward--are these the kinds of activities you want to scale \nback, just as they begin? Are our promises of support false?\n  In title I of ESEA, the rescissions are equally irresponsible. Title \nI is the Federal Government's major commitment to the country's \ndisadvantaged children. For 30 years, the Federal Government has \naccepted a responsibility to help States educate schoolchildren who \nneed help the most. But that commitment has never been well enough \nfunded to serve the large number of children who need help.\n  Title I has had successes. It has improved basic reading and \nmathematics skills of the lowest-achieving children. It has helped \nclose the learning gap between those children and their peers. With the \nhelp of title I, the achievement gap between black and white 9-year-\nolds has narrowed over the past two decades by 18 percent in math and \n25 percent in reading.\n  I hear frequently from people in Massachusetts about how their \nchildren have been helped by this program. One parent wrote: ``Chapter \nI is a blessing! For 4 years we tried to coach our son after his \nregular homework. We created more stress and there was no progress in \nmath. Our son is now proud of himself and his work. Thank you is not \nenough.''\n  One high school senior wrote: ``Chapter I has helped me to grow. \nThrough Chapter I, I am working in groups. I get along better with \nothers than I used to. Chapter I has shown me how to work hard, and \nwhen confronted with a challenge, I am patient but determined to get \nthe job done. The Chapter I math program has helped me gain confidence. \nNow I can do math with others and I sometimes offer my help to other \nstudents * * * Chapter I has shown me that no matter how stupid you \nthink you are there's always someone there to help you reach your \ngoals.''\n  One parent wrote about the Reading Recovery Program funded by title \nI. ``It has greatly affected my son. He has been able to keep up with \nhis class. [It] has lessened his anxiety and helped to make school a \npleasant experience. Had he not had the benefit of this program I feel \nthe experience could have been traumatic. I was most apprehensive about \nsending him to the first grade because I felt he was not capable of \ndoing the work. Our son has blossomed because of the attention, the \none-one-one investment his teacher has made. He now comes home and \nreads us his library books. We never thought our son capable of making \nthe strides he has this year and it's only April. It has been an answer \nto our prayers.''\n  A teacher in Haverhill writes: ``I * * * had a senior citizen from a \nlocal nursing home come to my classroom weekly. She spoke French and \nworked with a child in my class who was non-verbal because his family's \nprimary language is French. A true friendship developed between her and \nthe children in my class. Everyone enjoyed her visits and she looked \nforward to coming every week. She was in a wheelchair and the children \nlearned about people with handicaps. It was one of many rewarding \nexperiences.''\n  Finally, I heard from a student in Plymouth, MA named Steven. Steven \nwas an angry young man, aggressive toward any authority figure and \nfailing every class. Chapter I was seen as a last resort for him. Now \nhe is a corrections officer who is up for a promotion. He recently said \nto his former Chapter I teacher, ``It could have gone either way. I \ncould have been locked in these cells as an inmate if it hadn't been \nfor your helping me get through the schoolwork and giving me a chance \nto vent my anger. Thank you.''\n  Even though we know this program helps students, schools are not able \nto keep up with their needs. The education needs of disadvantaged \nchildren are growing, especially in high poverty areas. Evaluations \nshow that children in such schools are held to lower expectations than \nchildren in other schools. They are more likely to fall behind in the \nearly grades, and never catch up. First graders in poor schools start \nschool scoring 27 points lower in reading and 32 points lower in math \nthan other schoolchildren. The initial gap widens in later grades. \nEighth graders in poor schools are 57 percent more likely to leave \nschool by tenth grade than students in other schools.\n  Last year, Congress extensively examined this valuable program. We \nauthorized major new reforms, and we increased the funds by $300 \nmillion. For 6 months, teachers across the country have been working \nand planning on how to use these funds.\n  That may be then and this may be now. But that is no excuse for the \nnew Republican majority in Congress to pull the rug out from under \nschools across the country. Unless we support this amendment, 70,000 \nfewer children will benefit from title I. And schools throughout \nAmerica will be hurt because Congress is breaking its promise on \neducation.\n  Another important restoration in the Daschle amendment is $100 \nmillion for the Safe and Drug Free Schools. Among all the Republican \ncuts, this one is perhaps most bewildering of all. There is hardly a \ncommunity in America--urban, suburban, or rural--that is not struggling \nwith the tragic effects of violence and the alarming increase of drug \nuse among students.\n  Students cannot learn when their schools aren't safe. We need to do \nall we can to keep guns, drugs, and violence out of the schools. The \nSafe and Drug Free Schools Program is our primary means to give \nstudents and schools the help they need in avoiding drug abuse and \nviolence. It provides Governors and local school officials with wide \ndiscretion to assess their own problems and to solve them. It is \npreposterous that Republicans should be proposing to cut back these \nneeded funds.\n  For example, the Dade County, Florida public school system is using \nthe majority of its funds to support a program called ``TRUST''--a \ncomprehensive assistance program to help students and their families \novercome substance abuse problems. The program combines established \napproaches with curricula development, so that awareness of the dangers \nof drugs is woven into students' classes. It uses innovative approaches \nsuch as alternative intervention that offer students and their families \na chance to examine their behavior and improve their skills while \ncontinuing to attend regular classes.\n  It is fine to talk about family values and strengthening families. \nBut this bill simultaneously wipes out the kinds of help that \nstruggling families need. Hypocrisy is the word for such action.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nwith a very distinguished guest, a man I have great admiration and \nrespect for. His presence makes me speechless here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate at this time.\n  I withhold the remainder of my remarks and ask for recognition after \nwe have a recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see other Members here who wanted to \nspeak.\n  I just finish with this thought about the Star Schools Program. In \nmany different parts of the country, we do not have the highly \nqualified, highly skilled teachers, high school teachers, for example, \nin physics, in mathematics, in a number of the languages, with the \nchange of demography and the cutting back pressures on local schools.\n  What we have seen, I know in my own State and generally throughout \nNew England, is when there are pressures on the school districts there \nmay be a handful of very talented students in a particular class who \nwant to take the advanced math but there is so much difficulty in \ngetting that teacher, and so few students--in many instances brilliant \nstudents who want to take it--that the school does not provide that \nkind of education opportunity. And that is true in pocket after pocket, \nparticularly in many of the rural areas of Massachusetts, and \nthroughout New England.\n  This program provides the best math, science, physics, chemistry, \nbiology teachers, who instruct those few students that go to these \nlearning centers so those individuals will be able to take their \ncourses at the appropriate level. So they will continue their interest \nin these areas, which are enormously important in terms of our national \ninterests, for our scientific base and for our research and \ndevelopment.\n  It has been an enormously successful program. It has had the very \nstrong support of Senator Cochran, and others have spoken very \neloquently about it. I have had the chance to visit centers in his \nState of Mississippi to see what it has done in terms of a number of \nthe rural communities in the South.\n  It is something that is enormously valuable. We are talking here of \nseveral millions of dollars. But those several millions of dollars have \nenormous importance and consequence in one of the aspects of education, \nand that is technology and technology training. One of the important \nparts of the Daschle amendment restores that funding. That is the part \nof that Daschle amendment which I think is enormously important. We \nwill have an opportunity, when we reach the Daschle amendment, \nregardless of that outcome--I am hopeful it will be accepted, but if \nnot--to come back and revisit that at another time.\n  I will come back to this when some of my colleagues have finished \ntheir remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n                          little dell lake, ut\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I wish to bring to the attention of the chairman a small \nmatter that is of importance to me and the people of my State. It \ninvolves a correction in cost allocation of the recently completed \nLittle Dell Lake project in Utah. The Army Corps of Engineers \nacknowledged that an adjustment in cost allocation is warranted and is \nin the process of designing recreation facilities and redoing the cost \nallocation between the Federal and local participants of this project.\n  We expect the correction to be finalized in a revised agreement \nbetween the Department of the Army and the non-Federal sponsors toward \nthe end of fiscal year 1995. This is a matter of equity. The non-\nFederal sponsors of the project paid for 100 percent of the costs \nallocated to water supply and 25 percent of the costs allocated to \nflood control. However, because the local sponsors were inappropriately \nasked to cost share the joint costs of recreation, the costs for \nrecreation quadrupled and were unaffordable. This raised the costs for \nwater supply and flood control by several million dollars. This error \nwas only recently discovered and the Assistant Secretary of the Army \nhas expressed a willingness to correct the matter.\n  Is it the understanding of the chairman that the inclusion of \nrecreation facilities, the reallocation of costs, and the adjustment in \nthe Federal and non-Federal cost sharing can be accomplished with funds \nheretofore appropriated?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Given the facts in this matter, it would be appropriate \nto include recreation and adjust the Federal and non-Federal shares of \nthe total project cost. The project is essentially complete and, as I \nunderstand it, has already provided significant flood control and water \nsupply benefits since the dam was constructed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman and would urge that the revised \nlocal cooperation agreement be consummated in fiscal year 1995 and that \nthe funds be reprogrammed in the current fiscal year as well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from Utah that the revised \nlocal cooperation agreement and reprogramming should be accomplished \nthis year with funds currently available to the corps.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will be very brief.\n  I would like to respond to some comments made by the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, a few minutes ago on his \nconversation with the Vice President of the United States earlier \ntoday. I checked with Vice President Gore, and I am told that he did \nnot tell Senator Pressler that the President would veto the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  The Vice President told the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nthat he would like to see changes in certain provisions of the bill \nbefore he could recommend it to the President for his signature. I \nmention this because only the President issues veto threats, as the \nVice President pointed out.\n  But the Vice President is not the only person who is concerned about \ncertain provisions of this telecommunications bill.\n  The telecommunications bill that the Commerce Committee has reported \nwill have an enormous impact on multi-billion-dollar cable, phone, and \nbroadcast industries, and the economy of this Nation.\n  It was introduced just 3 days ago, and the report explaining what the \nCommerce Committee had in mind with this complex bill was filed late \nThursday night.\n  This bill is a far different bill from S. 1822, which was reported \nlast year.\n  First, this bill allows RBOC entry into long-distance phone service \nwithout a formal Department of Justice role in analyzing the \ncompetitive impact.\n  Second, I have questions about taking the lid off cable rates, and \nwhether sufficient attention has been paid to the special problems of \nsmall, rural cable companies.\n  In fact, I suspect virtually every person that is on cable in this \ncountry would have some concern about just taking the lid off the cable \nrate, because I have not met many cable users who feel they are not \npaying too much.\n  Further, I have questions about some provisions in the bill that \npreempt State laws on judicial review of State \n[[Page S5119]] regulatory commission decisions, and on dialing parity \nfor intra-LATA calls.\n  Finally, I am concerned that some provisions in this bill undercut \nprivacy protections for online communications and law enforcement's \nability to conduct necessary court-authorized wiretapping to fight \ncrime.\n  As ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee, these are questions on which we should have a hearing. There \nhas been no hearings on the final version of S. 652 that was just \nintroduced. These are issues that the people of Vermont deserve time to \nlook at and consider, before the Senate rushes into consideration.\n  I have no interest in delaying telecommunications reform, and hope \nthat we pass much-needed legislation in this session of Congress. But I \ndo want time to make sure that any legislation we pass is the best we \ncan make it. We owe this to the American people and the industries \ninvolved.\n  I think there are issues that should be answered.\n\n\n                         the daschle amendment\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the bill we are debating today is not \nabout future cuts in programs to reduce our deficit.\n  What this bill does is cut funding that States, schools, parents, \nyouth and children were assured of last September.\n  And these cuts are not going to reduce the deficit, but will go to \npay for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  In the middle of the year, Congress is taking away funds that States \nare using to implement major reforms to improve our children's \neducation.\n  Taking away funds from towns that have already set their school \nbudgets for the year.\n  Taking away funds from programs that bring local police to work in \nschools to prevent drug use.\n  Taking away from parents that are counting on child care so that they \ncan go to work.\n  Taking away from AmeriCorps participants and the communities that \nthey work in around the country.\n  This bill has brought our communities to a screeching halt. I \nquestion the logic of cutting these programs now; 6 months after the \nfact.\n  I support efforts to restore funding to important education programs \nfor disadvantaged children, programs which are designed to prevent drug \nuse and create a safe school environment, education reform, Head Start, \nchild care, AmeriCorps, and other programs that educate and invest in \nAmerica's children and families.\n  Decisions to cut these programs are based solely on shortsighted \npolitics.\n  The sad thing is that the House has made it clear that cuts in these \nprograms are not going to deficit reduction.\n  Instead, the cuts we are making today in programs that give children \nthe skills to compete in the next century are going to pay for tax cuts \nfor the walthy. In fact, the wealthiest 12 percent of Americans would \nreceive over half of the benefits under the House proposed tax cuts.\n  I hope that we will be able to restore logic and common sense to the \ncuts we are making in this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on the same subject which the Senator from \nVermont discussed, the Senator from South Dakota, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, earlier came to the floor and indicated that S. \n652, the Telecommunications Act of 1995, would not be able to be \nconsidered on the floor before the Easter recess as a consequence of \nthe administration, namely the Vice President, as someone who had \nindicated that the bill was going to be vetoed.\n  Mr. President, to be clear, while I did not put a hold on this bill, \nI agreed to allow the debate to proceed. I was tempted to put a hold on \nthe bill and not allow it to proceed. I will not, and would not allow \nthe debate to proceed and at the same time give unanimous consent to \nlimit the debate. That made it difficult to consider this piece of \nlegislation and enact it, pass it by the Senate, before the Easter \nrecess.\n  So if the chairman of the Commerce Committee is looking for the \nperson to identify as the individual who made it impossible to move \nthis before Easter, he has no further to look than the junior Senator \nfrom the State just to his south.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. I am by no means \nhostile to the idea that we should reform the 1934 Communications Act. \nI am not hostile to that idea. I believe that reform can be of enormous \nbenefit to our people. It can create new jobs. It can improve the \nquality of our education and make it more likely that our citizens can \nbecome informed.\n  But, Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation that is unique in \nmany ways. Indeed, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, the \nchairman of the committee, said on this floor earlier that it has broad \nnational support, or something to that effect. Yesterday, he said much \nmore accurately that this is not really on the people's minds at the \nmoment.\n  That is a more accurate statement, Mr. President. I have maybe 2 \nmillion household lines in the State, a million households total, so \nthere is probably a million times two residential lines in the State.\n  I just finished a campaign for reelection where very few people came \nto me and said: Gee, I am going to vote for you, but I need to know \nyour position on the deregulation of telecommunications. I need to know \nwhere you stand on this, Senator, because I am unhappy with my service. \nI do not like my long distance service or I do not like my local \ntelephone service or I do not like my cable service or I do not like \nwhat is going on.\n  They may have some concern at the margin, but no call for a radical \nrestructuring of the regulatory environment which this piece of \nlegislation represents.\n  Again to be clear, I think it is appropriate for us to consider some \nrather dramatic changes in the law to permit in particular much more \ncompetition at the local level. I would love to see an environment \nwhere the entrepreneur, that small business person that starts off in \nbusiness, can come knocking on my door or call me up or write and say I \nwant to sell you information services; I want to sell you voice; I wish \nto sell you video; I am going to sell you text. I would love for them \nto be able to sell them in an unrestricted environment.\n  This legislation, in my opinion, does not permit that. It pretends to \nbut in my judgment it does not permit it. In many ways, it combines the \nworst of both worlds, a regulatory environment without the kind of \ncompetition that I think is needed.\n  So I thank the chairman of the committee, who has been very generous \nin allowing one of my staff people, though I am not on the the Commerce \nCommittee, to participate in the deliberation of the determination of \nwhat this bill is going to look like along with the ranking member, \nSenator Hollings of South Carolina.\n  I hope they do not view me as being hostile to this piece of \nlegislation, but I object to the identification of the administration \nbeing the problem. As far as this piece of legislation not moving prior \nto recess, I am, I suspect, as responsible as anybody around here \nbecause I want this to have a full and open debate. I want us to \nevaluate title I, title II, title III, title IV. I want us to think \nabout what we are doing and make sure the public is informed. We are \nabout to give them, I think, substantial change. I think they can, if \nit is done right, be pleased with the results. But just as great a \nrisk, Mr. President, is that we could get in a hurry around here and \npass something, think that we are deregulating, think that we are \ncreating competition but, in fact, we accomplish neither of those two \nrather worthy objectives.\n  So I look forward to the debate. I hope that when we come back after \nthe recess there is an opportunity for S. 652 to be brought to the \nfloor, and I look forward to the opportunity of bringing up amendments \nand getting a full and open debate on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this bus \nsensor on the floor with me during my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5118-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n                           SCHOOL BUS SAFETY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the safety of \nAmerica's school children.\n  On February 27, Brandie Browder, an eighth grader at Ferguson Jr. \nHigh School in Beaver Creek, OH, was coming home from school. As she \nwas getting off her schoolbus that afternoon, the drawstring around the \nwaist of her coat got caught in the handrail of the schoolbus. The \nschoolbus started to move away. Brandie tried to free the coat, \nwrenched the coat free of the schoolbus and ran alongside the bus for \napproximately 50 feet. She lost her footing and fell and the bus ran \nover her and killed her.\n  Mr. President, just 4 days later in Cincinnati, a seventh grader from \nRoberts Paideia School was getting off her schoolbus when a similar \nevent occurred. The bus dragged her for about 3 or 4 feet, ran over her \nas she tried to free herself. Fortunately, she only suffered a broken \nfoot. She did survive. Mr. President, in both cases the bus driver was \napparently totally unaware of the accident as it was happening.\n  I think we should point out at this point, before I go any further in \nwhat I am saying today, that schoolbuses are among the safest modes of \ntransportation. According to the National Safety Council, there are \nabout 400,000 schoolbuses in the United States, and they transport \napproximately 22 million students every single day. I think we all know \nand I think most experts would agree if the choices are between putting \na child on a schoolbus or letting a teenager drive himself or herself, \nor ride with someone else, or even having the parents drive to school, \nmost of us, most experts would say statistically the children are \nbetter off on the bus. I do not think there is any doubt about that.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, the sad fact remains that in the \n1992-93 school year, 30 schoolchildren were killed in schoolbus \naccidents. Of these children, 5 were killed while riding on their bus. \nThe other 25 were killed while in the process of getting on or off of \ntheir own bus. The year before that, the 1991-92 school year, 35 \nchildren were killed nationwide; 10 were riding on their own \nschoolbuses and 25 were killed while getting on or off the bus.\n  An average of 30 school children are killed while getting on or off \ntheir buses every single year. This is not a new problem. According to \nthe National Safety Council, over the 10 years since 1983 a total of \n445 children were killed in schoolbus accidents; 100 of these were \npassengers and 345 were killed while getting on or off their own bus.\n  Mr. President, there are many factors contributing to these \naccidents--many. Today I should like to discuss just three of them.\n  First, an investigation of these accidents reveals that an alarming \nnumber of them involve handrails on the schoolbus. When children are \ngetting off a schoolbus, they walk down past a handrail. We have all \nseen them. We have all had that experience. Some of them hold on to it, \nothers do not. But I understand that there is a small space in most \nschoolbuses, about an inch, between the handrail and the wall of the \nbus.\n  Picture a child coming down the steps. He or she may have a backpack, \nstrings or straps trailing off of it. Maybe he or she is wearing a coat \nwith drawstrings that they can use to tighten around the waste--\nanything, Mr. President, that is trailing off of that child, like these \nstrings and straps, is liable to catch in that small space between the \nhandrail and the wall of the bus.\n  It is easy to imagine what happens next. The child is off the bus. \nBut part of the child's clothing is stuck in that small gap and the \ndoor closes. The bus starts moving. The child gets jerked with it and \ntries to pry free. We have a moving vehicle and a child swinging off of \nthat vehicle.\n  That is how Brandie was killed. And since 1991, at least four other \nchildren have been killed that way.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we as parents, as members of school \nboards, as concerned citizens, I believe, need to make sure that these \nhandrails are as safe as possible, that all precautions are being taken \nto avoid these tragedies.\n  A second problem, Mr. President, is the danger area around the bus. \nThe schoolbus, of course, is a very large object. It is very difficult \nfor other motorists to see around it. It is even difficult for the bus \ndriver to see around it. Because of this, far too many children are \nkilled by their very own buses. We need to explore ways to make those \nchildren visible to the schoolbus driver. There are at least two \ncompanies, maybe more in the United States, that produce sensors that \ncan be attached to school buses to prevent accidents.\n  I have one, Mr. President, right here.\n  This works on the same basic principle as a home security system. It \nsends out a radio signal. If the signal detects reflected energy from a \nchild in what is called a danger zone area, a frequency shift occurs \nwhich triggers an alarm and illuminates a red light in the cab of the \nbus.\n  This particular system covers the 10-foot by 10-foot area in front of \nand behind the bus, as well as the 6 by 8 areas on either side of the \nbus. There are other technologies that are involved.\n  We know though, Mr. President, no matter what technology we are \ntalking about, that ultimately it is up to the schoolbus driver. I \nthink what we should try to do is to assist those drivers, most of whom \nare great people, who do a great job every day protecting our children.\n  Maybe additional training is needed in some cases; maybe additional \nequipment on the bus. Maybe other things.\n  I intend, Mr. President, in the weeks ahead, to return to this issue, \nbecause I think it is an issue that we can have an impact on by \npublicity, by talking about it, by making people aware of the \nopportunities they have and all of us have to save lives.\n  Each one of us has a responsibility--whether we put our own child on \nthat schoolbus every day and tell that child what to be careful about, \nwhether we are on school boards, or parents--to make sure that school \nsystem has the latest equipment, to make sure that our good bus drivers \ndo in fact have the training that they need.\n  Before coming to the floor, Mr. President, I spoke to the father of \nthe little girl who was killed. I wanted to know whether it was all \nright if I came and talked about his daughter's accident. His reaction \nwas what I expected it to be--that if we could save a life by talking \nabout this issue, that if we could make other parents aware of it, \nother school boards or school systems, that we should be doing that. \nThat is why I am on the floor today.\n  I will return to this issue in the future, Mr. President.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I \nbelieve we are about to get an agreement.

Mr. President, last night the citizens of my State were \ndeeply saddened by the loss of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks to \na magnificent UCLA team in the NCAA finals. But No. 2 is not all bad. \nWe finished ahead of several hundred other NCAA mens basketball teams.\n  Sometimes, none of us performs to perfection or even to our maximum \nabilities. Last night was not a particularly good night for the \nRazorbacks, but that is not to diminish the magnificent game that UCLA \nplayed.\n  The 1995 NCAA tournament was filled with hard-fought, competitive \ngames with exciting finishes. Just 2 weeks ago UCLA barely squeezed by \nMissouri. We all remember watching Tyus Edney go the length of the \ncourt and lay one up just at the buzzer to win the game. \n[[Page S5121]] And, of course, we remember that timeout call by a \nyoungster from Syracuse that allowed Arkansas to win in overtime. Such \nis the very nature of the game.\n  But I can tell you that all Arkansans glory in the spunk of this \ngreat, magnificent Razorback team for coming back again and again. \nWhile they will lose several players who are seniors, I have confidence \nthat the Razorbacks will be back playing for the championship once \nagain next year.\n  The University's coach, Nolan Richardson, is a very talented man. He \nwas very gracious last night. He took full responsibility for the loss, \nas great men do. That resonated well with the American people, as it \nalways does. Generosity will never lose anybody a vote. It is a mark of \ngreatness. And Nolan Richardson was great in his comments last evening. \nYoungsters all over America want to play for him. So I fully expect \nthat he and the Razorbacks will be back again next year.\n  I rise just simply to say that this team, as did last year's \nchampionship team, has filled all Arkansans' hearts with pride and \nexhilaration. We are immensely grateful for the glory they bestowed on \nthemselves and our beloved Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join my senior \ncolleague, Senator Bumpers, in praising the great University of \nArkansas team and also in congratulating the UCLA team for a \nmagnificent job in winning the national championship.\n  Mr. President, it has not been too long ago since basketball really \ncome to the forefront in the Arkansas Razorbacks' territory. In fact, \nwhen I was a student in Fayetteville at the University of Arkansas, \nthey almost had to force us to go over to the field house to watch the \nRazorbacks play basketball. Usually, those basketball games were on a \nFriday or a Saturday afternoon.\n  But then along came some great coaches and ultimately some great \nteams, and finally the great support of the people of our State, \nequaling the support now, I think, of the Razorback football team; in \nfact, in some cases, even surpassing it.\n  Last year, the Razorbacks, of course, Mr. President, were the \nnational champions. This year, we were almost the national champions. \nWe lost to a great team.\n  Last night, throughout that game, I sat and watched as the momentum \nshifted back and forth between UCLA and Arkansas, and between UCLA and \nArkansas again. I thought of the many thousands of hours of practice, \ncommitment, that each of those players had committed to the splendid \nsport in this wonderful country of ours.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I was taken not only by the fine comments of \nthe coaches of both of those basketball teams--those glorious teams, I \nmight add--I was also taken by the sportsmanship exemplified by all of \nthe members of those basketball teams as they faced each other in a \nmoment of true contest, in a moment of true testing of who was going to \nbecome the championship team of the United States of America.\n  UCLA prevailed. We congratulate them.\n  We say to the Razorbacks, thank you for a splendid season and thank \nyou for making us a proud people.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 2 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate our two friends and \ncolleagues.\n  I join in congratulating UCLA for winning the championship, but also \nin paying tribute to a valiant team that had enormous success during \nthe course of the season.\n  The University of Massachusetts got to the quarter finals in that \nparticular basketball tournament. I can remember when the University of \nMassachusetts played Arkansas on Thanksgiving of last year. It was a \nvery good evening at that time when Coach Calipari's team was \nsuccessful. That team went along and had a superb year, and lost in a \nhard-fought contest.\n  I was inspired by the skill and the demeanor and the competitiveness \nof those young men, and women, as we heard yesterday, from the \nUniversity of Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5120-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5121-S5123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BOSTON UNIVERSITY WINS NATIONAL HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just take this moment, Mr. President, to mention \nthat in my State last Saturday, Boston University won the national \nchampionship in hockey. It was an all-New England contest. They played \nagainst the University of Maine in a very outstanding, competitive \ngame. Boston University represents one of our great universities and \none of the great centers for hockey. New England takes hockey \nseriously. Other parts of the country do as well.\n  But I think it is important to take a moment of time, when we have \nbeen wondering about the young people of this Nation in the period of \nthese last several days, to focus on the quality of the \ncompetitiveness, of the character, of the discipline, of the \nsportsmanship of real champions.\n  Whether it was with the UCLA and Arkansas championship last night, or \nwhether it was the superb performance of the University of \nConnecticut's women's team, or whether it was Boston University and the \nUniversity of Maine finals in hockey, I think all Americans ought to \ntake some degree of satisfaction about this next generation. I think \nall of us who are fortunate to have those teams in our State certainly \ndo.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Boston University's hockey team on winning the 48th annual \nNCAA Division I hockey championship this past Saturday in Providence, \nRI. With their brilliant and convincing 6-2 victory over the University \nof Maine Black Bears, the Terriers completed what the Boston Globe \ncalled ``college hockey's sweetest triple crown''--winning the annual \nBeanpot Tournament in Boston, the Hockey East championship and the NCAA \nchampionship all in 1 year. The only other team in school history to \nwin this triple crown was the Boston University team of 1972.\n  The Terriers completed the season with a record of 31-6-3 overall, \nthe second most wins by a BU hockey team. The team was anchored by the \npresence of 14 natives of Massachusetts, including Mike Grier of \nHolliston, an African American and First Team All-American who is a \nrole model for hockey fans in Massachusetts and throughout the United \nStates.\n  For BU, this victory marked their 4th NCAA Division I championship, \nhaving won previously in 1971, 1972, and 1978. They have appeared in \nthe Final Four a total of eight times. In their 74 years of \ncompetition, they have an overall record of 1046-607-68, for an \nextraordinary.628 percentage. Under the inspired leadership of Coach \nJack Parker, who graduated from the university in 1968, the Terriers \nhave amassed a 491-241-37 record in his 22 years as coach, along with \ntwo national championships.\n  It is a great tribute to Coach Parker and the rest of the Terriers \nthat they were able to come back from a difficult loss in last year's \ntournament to win this year's championship in such a convincing \nfashion. I commend them for their impressive victory, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the team roster and articles from the Boston \nGlobe on Sunday may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             No. and name               Cl  Pos   Hgt   Wgt    Hometown \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1.

This time the Green Line team out of a rink on a \n     deadend street in Allston took the limo all the way to the \n     top.\n       Boston University, picked as the nation's No. 1 team in \n     October, blew away Maine, 6-2, in the championship game of \n     the 48th NCAA tournament yesterday at the Civic Center, the \n     same building where the Terriers won their last national \n     crown 17 years ago. They also completed college hockey's \n     sweetest triple crown by winning the Beanpot, Hockey East and \n     the NCAA title in the same season.\n       The only team to accomplish that was the 1972 BU team led \n     by Ron Anderson, Toot Cahoon, Jake Danby, Steve Dolloff, Ric \n     Jordan, Bob Brown and goaltenders Dan Brady and Tim Regan. \n     The 1995 champions feature goaltenders Derek Herlofsky and \n     yesterday's hero, freshman Tom Noble, and goal scorers Chris \n     O'Sullivan, Jacques Joubert, Steve Thornton, Bob Lachance and \n     Mike Sylvia.\n       ``I found out about 5 past 9 [yesterday morning] I was \n     starting,'' Noble, who made 21 saves, said. ``I've played big \n     games before [at Catholic Memorial] but this is the biggest \n     game I've ever played. It's been a dream of mine to play in a \n     national championship game.''\n       This was the fourth NCAA championship for the Terriers in \n     eight Final Four appearances. The previous three came in \n     1971, 1972 and 1978. This year's Terriers, who finished 31-6-\n     3, won two Beanpot games by four goals and their three NCAA \n     tournament games by the same margin. Doesn't that say it all?\n       ``When it was 3-1 and 3-2 at the start of the third was \n     when our senior class and our goaltender took over,'' said BU \n     coach Jack Parker. ``We had another big goal by Shawn Bates \n     and the momentum started to swing.\n       ``People asked if the kids were uptight. This group didn't \n     play well uptight. We beat three of the top hockey teams in \n     this tournament when we beat Lake Superior, Minnesota and \n     Maine, and after last year we had the opportunity to get \n     back. The entire season was treading water waiting to get \n     back to this tournament.''\n       The Black Bears (31-6-6), who were picked fourth in the \n     Hockey East preseason poll, held a 2-0-2 edge over BU this \n     season, but the teams last met Dec. 3, in Orono. There was a \n     wide edge in quickness for the Terriers yesterday, in part \n     perhaps because of Maine's draining 4-3 triple-overtime \n     victory over Michigan in Thursday's semifinals.\n       Even though the Terriers were riddled by penalties, they \n     showed their mettle, even when their 3-0 lead slipped to 3-2. \n     Bates got the third-period explosion going when he slid a \n     pass to Sylvia, who made it 4-2 at 5:23. O'Sullivan jammed \n     the puck in at the 8:30 mark for a 5-2 lead and Lachance's \n     shorthanded goal at 18:47 was the icing on this glorious \n     cake.\n       The Terriers scored three powerplay goals and drew 10 \n     penalties, four on interference calls in front of the net, so \n     their special teams were a key. ``They moved the puck and \n     handled our pressure,'' said Maine coach Shawn Walsh. ``We \n     couldn't get up to\n      the puck. Down low their two defensemen outworked our three \n     forwards. They have a terrific defense and they showed it \n     today. They got the fourth goal and it put a stake through \n     our heart.''\n       The Terriers started tentatively, but part of that was \n     attributable to the Black Bears, who took it to BU on the \n     boards and bumped the Terriers off the puck. BU had just two \n     shots on goal in the first 10 minutes. This was a trifle \n     haunting, since the Terriers didn't get a shot on goal in the \n     first 10 minutes a year ago in the crushing loss to Lake \n     Superior State.\n       After killing off two power plays, the Terriers got their \n     first chance with the man advantage when Brad Mahoney left \n     for roughing at 13:50. Thornton asserted himself on a \n     faceoff, winning it, following it in and roofing a shot over \n     Maine goalie Blair Allison to stake the Terriers to a 1-0 \n     lead at 14:57 of the opening period.\n       The game's first big defensive play kept Maine from \n     answering. Wayne Conlan unloaded a shot that trickled away \n     from Noble and wound up casually behind him in the crease. \n     Lachance swept behind his goaltender and fired the puck out \n     of trouble before one of the Black Bears could get to it.\n       The tables were tipped slightly in the second period when \n     it was the Black Bears who were denied quality scoring \n     opportunities and the Terriers streaked to a 3-0 lead, Maine \n     didn't get a shot off on an early power play and the Terriers \n     seized a 2-0 lead when O'Sullivan swept into the right post \n     and put in Thornton's rebound at 7:27.\n       Less than two minutes later, Joubert followed up his own \n     rebound to convert on a power play set up by Kaj Linna and \n     Mike Prendergast, making it 3-0 at 9:15. Maine cut it to 3-1 \n     when Tim Lovell flew in to convert Jamie Thompson's pass on a \n     two-on-one break, beating Noble at 14:51.\n       As time was running out in the second period, the Black \n     Bears had a two-man advantage following penalties to Shane \n     Johnson (interference, 18:20) and Linna (slashing, 19:44), \n     but Thornton won the initial faceoff from Dan Shermerhorn and \n     the Terriers left with a shaky 3-1 lead and 20 seconds of the \n     two-man-down situation still to fend off. The first penalty \n     had expired when Trevor Roenick got Maine within 3-2 31 \n     seconds into the third, but it was all BU after that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Believe It Or Not, Boston Back in Winner's Circle\n\n                         (By Kevin Paul DuPont)\n\n       Providence--Not every floor has a trap door. The pie at the \n     buffet table isn't always there to be tossed in your face. \n     That big oak tree that shades your house and keeps it nice \n     and cool in the summer doesn't have to come crashing through \n     the roof in the middle of a winter storm.\n       Good things can happen to a Boston team. The city that \n     hasn't had much to celebrate since the Celtics won the NBA \n     championship in 1986 now has the Boston University hockey \n     team to cheer all the way down Commonwealth Avenue. (Note: \n     this column will not self-destruct upon your reading the last \n     paragraph.)\n       Boston is a winner. It's OK. You can close your eyes, click \n     your ruby slippers, and all the good of yesterday won't \n     vanish before your eyes. Boston is a winner.\n       Perhaps bigger news in the '90s: upon leaving the Civic \n     Center last night, no one had asked a state or federal agency \n     to launch an investigation and no one was looking to tell \n     his/her side of the story to ``Hard Copy'' for an extra $50. \n     No one asked the official scorer to come to the side bar.\n       It was like the old days: one team won, one team lost, and \n     no doubt a few kegs got uncorked in dorms from Kenmore \n     Square, right on up to West Campus.\n       ``This is the greatest team because it's happened right \n     now,'' said BU coach Jack Parker, following his Terrier's 6-2 \n     rubout of the Maine\n      Black Bears in yesterday's NCAA final. But don't tell that \n     to Mike Eruzione or Jack O'Callahan. They played on some \n     pretty good teams, too.\n       ``This team is one in a great line. And it's nice to be on \n     that line.''\n       Parker was one shivering slice of life in the minutes that \n     followed his second national championship (fourth overall for \n     BU). While he stood at center ice and answered all the \n     questions for ESPN, goaltender Derek Herlofsky and partner-\n     in-crime Rich Brennan conspired in giving Parker an icy \n     shower. Over came the orange tub, hoisted high, and Parker \n     was as wet as if he'd been tossed into the Charles.\n       ``I feel old,'' said the shaking Parker, his shirt and \n     pants clinging to his wiry body. ``But I felt old before this \n     started.''\n       Winning the NCAA hockey championship doesn't capture \n     America's heart and soul, or the TV lens, the way an NCAA \n     basketball championship can. The US is built for roundball. \n     President Clinton didn't interrupt his afternoon at \n     Pennsylvania Avenue to call Jack Parker and his good ol' boys \n     from Route 128 to congratulate them.\n       But no one expects that, especially at BU, a campus of \n     diverse interests with hockey just a small part of a \n     cosmopolitan landscape. When the BU hockey team packed its \n     bags for the trip down here on Wednesday, there was no band \n     playing on Babcock Street, no booster club sending the boys \n     off with a fond fairwell.\n       ``Really, it was very quiet,'' said the Terriers' longtime \n     sports information director, Ed Carpenter. ``Just a bunch of \n     college kids taking care of business.''\n       [[Page S5123]] ``Maine actually has a more avid hockey \n     following. Understandable. It's watch hockey or get back to \n     the lumberjack matchups. Shawn Walsh's team also came here \n     hoping to take care of business. After falling behind, 3-0, \n     the Black Bears closed\n      within a goal on strikes by Tim Lovell and Trevor Roenick.\n       But Maine showed the fatigue of Thursday's triple-overtime \n     win over Michigan. Forty-eight hours didn't give the Black \n     Bears enough time to recover. Tired legs and shortcomings on \n     defense brought them up short.\n       ``Short shifts,'' read the message board in the Maine \n     dressing room. ``Short passes, Stop and start.'' In other \n     words, economize, don't get into a pass-and-shoot game with a \n     BU team that had rattled off nine straight wins. Don't trade \n     punches with a club that won the Beanpot and the Hockey East \n     title. In the end, it was a breakdown, a pass picked off, \n     that buried the Bears. Bruins prospect Shawn Bates broke over \n     the line on a two-on-one, dished right to Milk Sylvia, and BU \n     had a 4-2 lead with 5:23 gone in the third.\n       ``A killer,'' said Walsh. ``It was like someone put a stake \n     right through our heart.''\n       The BU dressing room was surprisingly low key. Mike Grier \n     (how come no one calls him Big Country?) packed his red-and-\n     white bag and slung it over his shoulder on his way to catch \n     the bus. One by one, his teammates followed, quietly, smiling \n     on cue when asked how it felt to be the greatest college \n     hockey team in the USA.\n       ``Feels great,'' said Grier, ``I don't think I can describe \n     yet how it feels, but it feels great.''\n       ``I'm tired,'' said Bates, slumping in a chair for a TV \n     interviews. ``This is great. This is everything we wanted.''\n       Be careful today if you drive by the BU bridge. Ease off \n     the pedal some if you pass the dorms around 700 Comm. Ave, or \n     the cozy apartments along Bay State Road. The partying \n     promised to be long and hard. Red eyes and slow steps will be \n     the order of the day.\n       Boston has a champion this morning. We know it often \n     doesn't get better than that.\n\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think we are still awaiting one phone call before, \nhopefully, we can reach an agreement. I do not want to miss this \nopportunity to talk about the University of Kansas Jayhawks. \n[Laughter.]\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The majority leader will be proud in knowing that I \nactually picked Kansas to be in the final four in the office pool.\n  Mr. DOLE. So did I. [Laughter.]\n  But I think it is fair to say I certainly agree with the comments \nmade by both Senators from Arkansas. It is an outstanding team, \noutstanding coach. Senator Pryor indicated the momentum did go back and \nforth. It was tied, two behind, one ahead. It was one exciting game.\n  I know it is a lot more fun winning. We have all experienced that \nfrom time to time. But I do think it says a lot about the coaches, a \nlot about the fans, primarily a lot about the young men who were \ninvolved in not only the Final Four but the Sweet 16, the whole group. \nThey have all done an outstanding job. I know we are all proud of our \nrespective teams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5121-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5123-S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio wants to make what \nlooks like an address to me. Will the Senator from Ohio have any \nobjection if we reach an agreement we can interrupt to get the \nagreement?\n  Mr. GLENN. I just want to submit a bill and give a speech. I can stop \nin the middle.\n  Mr. DOLE. Why do you not go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Glenn pertaining to the introduction of S. 669 \nand S. 670 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, speaking of protections that should be \ngiven to people--in fact, last Tuesday, 1 week ago, I introduced the \nBank Customer Confidentiality and Protection Act of 1995, which became \nS. 663.\n  This legislation was crafted to address problems in the area of bank \nsales of uninsured products, such as mutual funds identified during an \ninvestigation conducted by my staff on the U.S. Special Committee on \nAging.\n  After hearing the stories of numerous older Americans specifically, \nwho claim they did not know what they were buying when they purchased \nan uninsured product through their bank and then lost much of their \nlife savings, I am today convinced that more stringent protections are \nneeded to ensure that financially inexperienced bank customers fully \nunderstand what they are buying when they invest in uninsured accounts.\n  Mr. President, I have a series of stories today. I am trying to put \nhuman faces and human concerns together with statistics. This is a \nletter I received on November 11, 1994. Let us just call our friend who \nwrote me ``Dick.'' This legislation today is intended to help \nfinancially inexperienced bank customers such as this man, a 64-year-\nold retired priest and a Vietnam veteran.\n  By last year, Dick had saved $3,000 for a cruise that he wanted to \ntake 2 years in the future when he retired. In fact, I believe in his \nletter he states that he wants to take this cruise sometime in late \n1995. He had always put his money in savings accounts and in CD's at \nthis particular bank. He had never invested before in a mutual fund or \nin any other uninsured product. After all, he is a former priest and he \nnever had a lot of money laying around.\n  When he went into his bank he told the worker there that he wanted to \nput his money in a safe account. They did the opposite. They put this \nman's money in an uninsured bond fund that lost hundreds of dollars by \nthe end of the year. Dick told our staff that had he known this was an \nuninsured product, he would never have given the bank this money. Now \nhe may not ever be able to go on that cruise that he had dreamed of.\n  Now I want to tell you, Mr. President, how this man and other \ninexperienced older customers ended up buying uninsured products. We \nsay, How could that happen? How could any individual be led to buy a \nproduct that was uninsured?\n  The truth is that some banks have elaborate sales systems set up to \nsell securities such as mutual funds to any customer who will buy them. \nThey have other types of funds.\n  Let me show you how these particular uninsured products, and the \nsales systems, work at some of our banks. Perhaps it is the bank that \nthe Presiding Officer banks with. Perhaps it is the bank that I bank \nwith.\n  Our customer case is Mrs. Jones. This is a true case of a 77-year-old \nwidow who never put her money in anything but insured products like \nCD's. Our other cast members include Sally, who is Mrs. Jones' teller \nof many years in the bank where she banked. The cast of characters also \nincludes David, a broker who was with the bank's brokerage subsidiary.\n  Teller No. 12 is Sally. She has identified a customer, Mrs. Jones, \nwith a high amount of CD's coming due who, ``came in today and wasn't \nsure what she would do with her money.'' She tells the broker about \nMrs. Jones having these CD's coming due. Sally, the teller, is so \nexcited because she gets a commission on referrals to the bank's \nbrokerage arm. So Sally prints out a copy of Mrs. Jones' account \nhistory.\n  There is Mrs. Jones' account history. She sends it over to David \nacross the hall, one of the brokers working at her branch. If Sally \nmakes more referrals than her coworkers, she could win a prize, even a \ntrip to Las Vegas.\n  Mrs. Jones is not the only bank customer whose records are shared \nwith brokers without the customer's explicit knowledge and consent. In \nfact, my staff has seen proof that this practice is very widespread. \nFor example, our staff has seen evidence that brokers have access to \nthe banking records of a very, very high ranking U.S. Government \nofficial and those of a famous actor, which have been shared with many \nother people.\n  Until we started this investigation I had never heard of blitz night.\n  Some banks hold contests to see which of their tellers and customer \nservice representatives can get the most bank customers into the bank \nto talk to a securities salesperson. Depository institution employees, \nwho are winners of the blitz telephone calling contest, can now win \nunimaginable wealth.\n  Sally the teller, for example, participates in blitz night. Mrs. \nJones, the 77-year-old bank customer, is contacted during one of these \ncontests.\n   [[Page S5124]] This basically spells it out for the bank employees, \nadvertising: Blitz night, unimaginable wealth, fabulous prizes--for \nwhat? For making referrals to the bank's own broker who would then try \nto lure from CD accounts, Mrs. Jones and her type, to put their funds \nin uninsured funding properties.\n  When Sally the teller calls Mrs. Jones, Sally tells Mrs. Jones that \nshe is calling from her branch bank, from Mrs. Jones' bank for many \nyears. They know each other. So, from the start, Mrs. Jones associates \nthe uninsured products that she will hear about later with what she \nknows about her depository institution. Such is the fact that she feels \nsecure taking the advice from the people who work there, and the fact \nthat she never has lost any money there in this bank in the past. Since \nit is somebody at her depository institution or her bank calling, Mrs. \nJones figured that she would make an appointment as Sally suggests.\n  Now we are going to demonstrate how some of the brokers who are \nassociated with the banks are trained to operate. In a moment I will \nshow a document related to one bank's training program for brokers. \nFirst let me make a few important points about the documents. The \nfollowing bank uninsured product sales system charts are an enlargement \nof selected pages from one large bank's training manual, used to train \nbank-based brokers as recently as last year. This is not something that \nwas going on 10 or 20 or 30 years ago. It went on as recently as last \nyear. And, Mr. President, it is going on this year.\n  Not all banks that sell securities did or do use this sort of \ntraining manual. However, our investigations suggest that more than a \nfew banks use similar sales techniques. These charts that we will see \nrepresent just one example of how some banks have sales systems that, \nwhile not illegal necessarily, do tend to contribute to customer \nconfusion. These training manuals are for the bank's internal purposes \nonly and they are not ever seen by the public. They are not ever seen \nby Mrs. Jones, the potential customer. Thus, what the broker actually \ntells each customer varies from customer to customer.\n  Some representatives of the banking community have pointed out to me \nthat, despite what a customer is told by a broker, all customers are \nrequired to sign a written disclosure form when they purchase an \nuninsured product. However as I explained in the statement I made on \nthe floor last Tuesday, these written disclosure forms commonly do not \nhelp financially inexperienced customers fully understand what they are \npurchasing.\n  When Mrs. Jones comes into the bank in a few days and talks to \nsomebody about getting higher rates on her money, there are things that \ncause Mrs. Jones to not totally understand the distinction between the \ndepository institution and the brokerage business which might be just a \nfew steps away.\n  These things which confuse Mrs. Jones include:\n  The bank has an FDIC emblem on the bank's doors.\n  The location of the broker's desk was near where Mrs. Jones had \nopened her CD account just last year.\n  The use of the bank's name and the bank's logo on the uninsured \nproduct's marketing material.\n  And, perhaps most importantly, Mr. President, what the broker tells \nMrs. Jones about her investment.\n  This is a ``person commercial'' we see here, presented by Mrs. Jones' \nnew broker named David. It makes it sound as if the only difference \nbetween the bank's brokerage business and the bank's depository \nbusiness is some separation on paper for ``tax reasons.''\n  Another thing I would like to point out is that the broker tells Mrs. \nJones that his ``recommendations are on the best approaches available \nto investors today.'' However, in this particular case, David, the \nbroker, receives a higher commission--this is very important--if he \nrecommends one of the bank's inhouse mutual funds that are not insured \nby the Federal Government. This means that David has the incentive to \npush the bank's product regardless of its suitability for Mrs. Jones.\n  Let us talk about how the broker and the bank sometimes downplay the \nfact that the broker's products are not backed by the FDIC. Let us take \nMrs. Jones once again. She is in ill health. She is 77. She is a widow. \nShe knows that she is going to need that money eventually. So she asks \nthe securities salesperson whether the investment he is offering--\nmutual funds, in this case --is insured by the FDIC. To Mrs. Jones, the \nFDIC seal that she saw in the bank is analogous to a ``Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval.''\n  This particular chart shows us what the broker, David, was trained to \ntell her. David does not tell her that the investment product is not \ninsured by the FDIC, it is not insured by anything else, or that she \ncould lose all of her money.\n  These are his talking points about which he is talking on the phone \nor in person with a potential customer like Mrs. Jones.\n  For example, he says, ``With this investment, you can earn $10,000 \nmore in income over the next 5 years. This will go a long way toward \nproviding you with a more comfortable retirement. Don't you agree?''\n  Then the next thing that he is instructed to ask, from instructions \nin his private book from the bank: ``Ask for the order!'' Once the \norder is given, and it is not FDIC insured, then a commission--a \nhandsome commission, I might say--is paid to the broker and to the \nteller who made the reference of Mrs. Jones' case or her interest to \nbuy some additional securities to the broker.\n  How do you change the mind, or how are these brokers and personnel \ntaught to change the mind of a customer who only wants to purchase a \nCD? Even though she may now think that the uninsured mutual fund is \nbacked by the FDIC, Mrs. Jones becomes wary and she tells the broker, \nDavid, ``I am not interested in anything but CD's.''\n  Then the broker might say--once again, this is the sales system \nsupplied by the bank and used by the broker to get money from CD's \nthrough the bank's own financial product, in this case, uninsured \nmutual funds--``If we could show you the way to cut your taxes hundreds \nor thousands of dollars a year, would you have some interest in \nlearning more?'' These are the ``three dynamite questions'' right here \nbelow that the broker is instructed to utilize in luring this poor \nwidow woman's funds from CD's into uninsured funds. We see that it \nsounds pretty good to someone who might be on a fixed income with no \nother person to advise her.\n  Now, it is not over. David keeps plugging away. The broker keeps \nplugging away. What he recommends that this lady buy is not some fund \nthat is insured by the U.S. Government. But now the bank has contrived \na new name for a new fund for people just like this. Guess what the \nname of that fund is, Mr. President? It is called ``U.S. Government \nFund.'' And it says, ``This is a mutual fund portfolio of securities \nissued by the United States Government and its agencies. The U.S. \nGovernment Fund currently pays a dividend of [blank] percent,'' and it \ngoes on explaining the U.S. Government Fund, which in no way is tied \nto, in no way is an entity of, or in no way is insured by the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  Mr. President, it is a fraud, and it is wrong, and we must now do \nsomething about it.\n  Look at the number of times that the ``United States'' and ``U.S.'' \nis mentioned on this particular chart. While the customer might not \never see this document, it is clear that the brokers are encouraged \nwith their instruction sheets to frequently mention the ``United \nStates'' and the ``United States Fund.''\n  Now, Mr. President, we come to the point where the broker has to make \nhis sale. The pressure is mounting. The customer is confused. And this \nchart shows that Mrs. Jones agrees to buy into the bank's proprietary \n``U.S. Government Bond Fund.'' Once again, it is not insured, not a \nGovernment fund, but only named the ``U.S. Government Bond Fund.''\n  Mrs. Jones may have been convinced that the product was right for \nher, or she may be just deferring to David, who is part of the \ninstitution that she trusts so much, her bank, with the FDIC seal in \nthe window. While Mrs. Jones is going to be asked to sign a disclosure \nform, this may not and probably will not help her realize that this \nproduct is probably not the right product for her.\n   [[Page S5125]] More than a few financially inexperienced bank \ncustomers have told our committee staff that when they looked over the \ndisclosure forms, they did not understand what they read. These \ncustomers typically would then ask the investment sales people to \ninterpret the forms for them. In these cases, the sales people told \ntheir customers that the documents were just a ``formality'' to open \nthe account, or that the form simply was stating what the sales people \nhad told the customers.\n  It is not hard to identify the problem because the problem is, in \nsome cases, the brokers have made misleading, false statements about \nthe nature of the uninsured products when they describe them, such as, \n``This is as safe as the money in your pocket, and you will only lose \nmoney if the Federal Government goes bankrupt,'' or, ``It is backed by \nsomething better than the FDIC.''\n  Finally, the legislation that I introduced last Tuesday, which was \ncrafted after numerous meetings with industry and consumer groups, \nwould provide needed consumer protections for financially inexperienced \ncustomers. This legislation would provide protections to financially \ninexperienced bank customers by, one, full and clear disclosure about \nthe risks associated with uninsured products; by establishing limits to \ncompensation that institution employees receive for making referrals to \nsecurities sales people. Remember the case of Sally, Mr. President, our \nbank teller who got a nice commission by referring Mrs. Jones' private \nbanking records and situation to a broker across the aisle from her; \nand to establish guidelines for uninsured products and promotional \nmaterials; common sense physical separation of deposit and nondeposit \nsales products would be another area of this legislation; and fifth, \nMr. President, we would end in my legislation the practice of sharing \nbank customers' personal financial information without the customer's \nexplicit consent; and finally, Mr. President, we would increase the \ncoordination of securities enforcement activities between the Federal \nbanking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I am very hopeful that this will begin a dialog in which we will find \nas an end result a cure for this particular problem that we are \naddressing today in the Senate. It is a problem, we think, of severe \nmagnitude. It is a problem which has not risen to the height of many of \nthe concerns we have expressed here in recent months, but we do think \nthis is a concern which should be addressed and should be one of \nprotections that we should ensure for those potential customers of \nuninsured bank products such as mutual funds and certain bond funds \nthat are uninsured.\n  Finally, Mr. President, if we do it for no other category of our \npopulation, let us do it for those individuals like Mrs. Jones, that \n77-year-old widow who has no one to lean on, no advice, no adviser, and \ntruly finds herself in the grips of, in my opinion, unethical \nsalespersons, unethical brokers, and people who are interested only in \nmaking certain that they receive a nice fat commission in selling Mrs. \nJones uninsured bank products which truly may wipe out all of her \nassets.\n  Mr. President, I see no other speakers or Senators seeking the floor. \nI wish to thank the Chair, and at this time I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5123-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5125-S5138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  GAO REPORT AND THE NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY FUNDING CORPORATION\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to present the results \nof the second in a series of five very important studies being \nconducted by the General Accounting Office on the condition of \nAmerica's schools and to announce the creation of the National \nEducation Technology Funding Corporation.\n  I first became aware of the problems facing our Nation's education \ninfrastructure while serving in the Illinois House of Representatives. \nThroughout my 10 years in office, I visited school districts across the \nState and witnessed the deteriorating condition of public school \nfacilities in both rural and urban districts alike.\n  Yet, it was not until I began working on education legislation in the \nU.S. Senate that I learned that the Federal Government had not \ncollected data on the condition of our Nation's public school \nfacilities since 1965.\n\n\n                              GAO request\n\n  Knowing that my efforts to improve our Nation's education \ninfrastructure would be limited by insufficient data, I sent a letter \nto the General Accounting Office last year, which was cosigned by \nSenators Kennedy, Pell, Simon, and Wellstone, requesting a \ncomprehensive, nationwide study on the condition of our Nation's public \nschool facilities.\n  In responding to my request, the General Accounting Office surveyed a \nrandom sample of our Nation's 15,000 school districts and 80,000 public \nschools from April to December 1994. GAO staff members also visited 41 \nschools in 10 school districts across the country to supplement their \nquantitative data with personal observations. Based on responses from \n78 percent of the schools sampled, GAO began preparing five separate \nreports on the condition of our Nation's public schools.\n\n\n                            First GAO Report\n  The first GAO report, which was released on February 1, 1995, \nexamined the education infrastructure needs of our Nation's public \nelementary and secondary schools. As expected, this report made clear \nwhat most of us already knew; that our schools are deteriorating and we \nneed to fix them.\n  The GAO report concluded that our Nation's public schools need $112 \nbillion to restore their facilities to good overall conditions; that is \nto say, without code violations and the like. This was not decorating \nissues--good overall conditions.\n  Of this amount, the GAO found that public schools needed $11 billion \njust to meet the Federal requirements--including $6 billion to make all \nprograms accessible to all students and $5 billion to correct or remove \nhazardous substances.\n  And so the first report focused in on the basic facility \ninfrastructure needs and reached the conclusion that we needed $112 \nbillion just to get our schools up to code, removed of health and \nsafety violations and threats to the students.\n                           SECOND GAO REPORT\n\n  The second GAO report, which was released today, focuses on our \nNation's education technology infrastructure needs. Once again, this \nreport concludes that our Nation's public schools are not designed or \nsufficiently equipped to prepare our children for the 21st century. And \nthat is actually the name of it: ``School Facilities: America's Schools \nNot Designed or Equipped for the 21st Century.'' It is a pretty \ndevastating title for the report itself, and this was a serious study \nthat was done by the GAO.\n  More specifically, the GAO report found that more than half of our \nNation's public schools lack six or more of the technology elements \nnecessary to reform the way teachers teach and students learn \nincluding: computers; printers; modems; cable TV; laser disc players; \nVCR's; and TV's.\n  In fact, the GAO report found that even more of our Nation's schools \ndo not have the education technology infrastructure necessary to \nsupport these important audio, video, and data systems. For example, \nthis report concludes that: 34.6 percent of schools lack sufficient \nelectrical power for computers; 46.1 percent lack sufficient electrical \nwiring; 51.8 percent lack sufficient computer networks; 60.6 percent \nlack sufficient conduits and raceways; 86.8 percent lack fiber-optic \ncable; 61.2 percent lack sufficient phone lines for instructional use; \nand 55.5 percent lack sufficient phone lines for computer modems.\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office further examined these \nnational statistics and confirmed our worst fears: that the \navailability of education technology in our Nation's public schools is \ndirectly correlated with community type, the percentage of minority \nstudents, and the percentage of economically disadvantaged students.\n  [[Page S5126]] In other words, the GAO report found that although our \nNation's education technology needs are great in both rural and urban \nschool districts, urban schools have greater education technology needs \nin every category. It also found that the education technology needs in \nour Nation's schools increase in every category as the percentages of \nminority students and students receiving free or reduced lunches \nincrease.\n  Mr. President, these results are simply unacceptable. There is \nabsolutely no reason why, in 1995, all of our Nation's children should \nnot have access to the best education technology resources in the \nworld.\n  I point out that as between urban and rural, this issue affects rural \nschool districts as much as it does urban school districts. The \nchildren in rural communities are denied access to the sources of \ninformation, the data, the resources that are out there for them to \nimprove their opportunities for education, as well as children in urban \nareas where there is a greater concentration of students.\n  As you know, we are in a new era in economic competition. All over \nthe world, barriers to trade between nations are falling. We are \nwitnessing the development of a truly global marketplace. I believe \nthat America can lead the way in this marketplace. But if we are to \nsucceed, if we are to retain our competitiveness into the 21st century, \nthere must be a renewed commitment to education in this country.\n  If there is any objective that should command complete American \nconsensus, it is ensuring that every American has the chance to \nsucceed--and that, in the final analysis, is what education is all \nabout. No issue is more critical to our country. And no issue is more \nimportant to me. Nothing makes a bigger difference in a person's life \nthan opening opportunities. Certainly nothing has made a bigger \ndifference in my life.\n  It is vital to the interest of our Nation that we maintain quality \npublic education for everyone. Education is not just a private benefit \nbut a public good as well. It is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy \nand, as a society, we all benefit from a well-educated citizenry. It is \nthe means by which we prepare our children to succeed--to make a \nliving, to participate in the community, to enjoy the arts, and to \nunderstand the technology that has reshaped our workplace and, indeed, \nto compete in this global economy.\n  Without a strong education system in this country, our young people \nwill not be prepared and will not be able to hold their own in \ncompetition with the other communities in the world, which devote a \ngreater proportion of their resources to the education of their \nchildren and the preparedness of their work force.\n                               technology\n\n  Nonetheless, it will be difficult if not impossible for us to prepare \nour children to compete in the emerging global economy through the \ncurrent educational system. In order to prepare American students to \ncompete with their foreign counterparts, systemic school reform must \noccur. Systemic school reform means taking into account and addressing \nall aspects of the educational system.\n  Mr. President, the increased competition created by the emerging \nglobal economy requires teachers and students to transform their \ntraditional roles in many ways. It requires teachers to act as \nfacilitators in the classroom, guiding student learning rather than \nprescribing it. It also requires students to construct their own \nknowledge, based on information and data they manipulate themselves.\n  Technolgoy can help teachers and their students successfully play the \nnew roles that are being required of them. Technology can help teachers \nreport and chart student progress on a more individualized basis. It \ncan also allow them to use resources from across the globe or across \nthe street, for that matter, to create different learning environments \nfor their students without ever leaving the classroom.\n  On the other hand, technology can allow students to access the vast \narray of material available electronically and to engage in the \nanalysis of real world problems and questions.\n\n\n                         centennial high school\n\n  Mr. President, by way of example, advanced chemistry students at \nCentennial High School in Champaign, IL, are currently taking advantage \nof the benefits associated with education technology.\n  Here is one of the deans of education on the floor, Mr. President, \nSenator Pell. Of course, his name is so well associated with education. \nI had someone say to me, ``Senator Pell made it possible for me to go \nto college,'' because of Pell grants, and I thought that was one of the \nfinest compliments that could ever be given to an individual.\n  Mr. PELL. Thank you very much.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. To continue, Mr. President, through an innovative \npartnership with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, \nthese students are developing experiments that allow them to move parts \nof molecules on their computer screens in response to their own \ncomputer commands. In one type of simulation, students watch the \norbitals of models in reaction to imposed actions. Another type of \nsimulation demonstrates the ionization of atoms--how the size of atoms \nchanges when ions are added or subtracted. That is precisely the kind \nof education that we want to make available to every child in America. \nIt is the challenge of the education infrastructure that I think we \nhave to meet in order to do so.\n\n\n                          local property taxes\n\n  Mr. President, we are failing to provide all of our Nation's children \nwith education technology resources like those being provided at \nCentennial High School because the American system of public education \nhas forced local school districts to maintain our Nation's education \ninfrastructure with local property taxes.\n  For a long time, local school boards were able to meet that \nresponsibility. However, the ability of local school boards to continue \nto meet that responsibility has steadily declined.\n  Local property taxes are now all too often an inadequate source of \nfunding for public education. What is even worse is that this financing \nmechanism makes the quality of public education\n all too dependent on local property wealth.\n\n  As a result, the second GAO report found that, on average, only 8 \npercent of local school bonds was spent on computers and \ntelecommunications equipment. That is, for the average $6.5 million \nbond, only $155,000 or 2 percent was provided for the purchase of \ncomputers and only $381,100 or 6 percent for the purchase of \ntelecommunications equipment.\n  Nonetheless, most States, including my own of Illinois, continue to \nforce local school districts to rely increasingly on local property \ntaxes for public education, in general, and for education technology \nprojects, in particular. In Illinois, for example, the local share of \npublic education funding increased from 48 percent during the 1980-81 \nschool year to 58 percent during 1992-93 school year, while the State \nshare fell from 43 to 34 during this same period of time.\n  I believe the Federal Government must also, frankly, accept a share \nof the blame for failing to provide our Nation's children with \nenvironments conducive to learning. The Federal Government's share of \npublic education funding has fallen from 9.1 percent during the 1980-81 \nschool year to 5.6 percent during the 1993-94 school year.\n\n\n                               goals 2000\n\n  Mr. President, Congress passed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act \nwhich President Clinton signed into law on March 31, 1994. I supported \nthis legislation because it promises to create a coherent, national \nframework for education reform founded on the national education \ngoals--including the seventh national education goal which promotes \nparental involvement at all grade levels.\n  Nonetheless, I firmly believe that it is inherently unfair to expect \nour children to meet national performance standards if they do not have \nan equal opportunity to learn.\n  If they are denied equal access and equal facilities, then they will \nhave a very difficult time meeting and supporting national expectations \nand standards.\n\n\n                      Education Infrastructure Act\n\n  That is why, last year, I introduced the Education Infrastructure \nAct. That legislation addresses the problems highlighted in the first \nGAO report by helping local school districts ensure the health and \nsafety of students \n[[Page S5127]] through the repair, alteration, renovation, and \nconstruction of school facilities.\n  More specifically, that legislation authorizes the Secretary of \nEducation to make grants to local school districts with at least a 15-\npercent child poverty rate and urgent repair, renovation, alteration, \nor construction needs. Clearly, with the needs being so great, we had \nto come up with a formula that will now begin to address the problem. \nBut at least we will give a start in that direction.\n  The legislation which will be introduced shortly, in keeping with the \nsecond report regarding technology infrastructure, takes a slightly \ndifferent tack. John Danforth--I know the Presiding Officer was \nfamiliar with former Senator Danforth from Missouri--Jim Murray, past \npresident of Fannie Mae, and Dr. Mary Hatwood Futrell, past president \nof the National Education Association, joined forces today to address \nthe problem highlighted in the second GAO report.\n  These three leaders in the area of education and finance came \ntogether today to establish the National Education Technology Funding \nCorp., as a private, nonprofit organization, dedicated to improving our \nNation's education technology infrastructure.\n  The National Education Association, the National School Board \nAssociation, the American Library Association, and I strongly support \nthis effort to link public schools and public libraries to the \ninformation superhighway. As outlined in its articles of \nincorporation--incorporated today in the District of Columbia--the \nNational Education Technology Funding Corp. is specifically designed \nto, first, leverage resources and stimulate private investment in \neducation technology infrastructure; second, provide loans, grants, and \nother forms of assistance to State education technology agencies, with \ndue regard for providing a fair balance among types of school districts \nand public libraries assisted and the disparate needs of such school \ndistricts; third, encourage the development of education \ntelecommunications and information technologies through public-private \nventures, by serving as a clearinghouse for information on new \neducation technologies, and by providing technical assistance; fourth, \nto establish criteria to encourage the States to create, maintain, \nutilize and upgrade interactive high-capacity networks capable of \nproviding audio, visual, and data communications for elementary \nschools, secondary schools, and public libraries; to distribute \nresources to assure equitable aid to all elementary and secondary \nschools in the State and achieve universal access to network \ntechnology; and finally, to upgrade the delivery of instruction to \nstudents.\n  Mr. President, former Senator Danforth, Mr. Murray, and Mrs. Hatwood \nFutrell created the National Education Technology Funding Corp. because \nthey recognized that States and local school districts need help \nfinancing education technology equipment and infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  They also recognize the need for both public and private investments \nin our Nation's education technology infrastructure. That is why their \ncorporation will be operated by a board of directors which will include \nfive members representative of public schools and public libraries; \nfive representatives of the State education agencies; and five members \nrepresentative of the private sector.\n\n\n                        Information Superhighway\n\n  Mr. President, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have also \ntaken leadership roles in addressing our Nation's technology \ninfrastructure needs. On the 15th of September, 1993, the information \ninfrastructure task force created by the Vice President released its \nreport, entitled ``National Information Infrastructure: Agenda for \nAction.''\n  That report identified nine principles for Government action to \npromote the information superhighway--the metaphor used to describe the \nevolving technology infrastructure that will link homes, businesses, \nschools, hospitals, and libraries to each other and to a vast array of \nelectronic information resources.\n  On this same day, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12864 \nwhich created the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Counsel \nto facilitate private sector input.\n  Mr. President, a substantial portion of the information superhighway \nalready exists. Approximately 94 percent of American households have \ntelephone service, 60 percent have cable service, 30 percent have \ncomputers, and almost 100 percent have radio and TV. Local and long \ndistance telephone companies are investing heavily in fiber optic \ncables that will carry greater amounts of information, cable companies \nare increasing their capacity to provide new services, and new wireless \npersonal communications systems are under development. One prototype, \nwhich I am sure the chair has heard about, the Internet, connects 15 to \n20 million people worldwide.\n\n\n                            Federal Support\n\n  Nonetheless, the results of the second GAO report suggest to me that \nthe Federal Government must do more to build the education portion of \nthe national information infrastructure.\n  Federal support for the acquisition and use of technology in \nelementary and secondary schools is currently fragmented, coming from a \ndiverse group of programs and initiatives. Although the full extent to \nwhich the Federal Government currently supports investments in \neducation technology at the precollegiate level is not known, the \nOffice of Technology Assessment estimated in its report that the \nprograms administered by the Department of Education provided $208 \nmillion for education technology in 1988.\n\n\n                           Cost of Technology\n\n  There is little doubt that substantial costs will accompany efforts \nto bring information technologies into precollegiate \neducation in any comprehensive fashion. In his written testimony before \nthe House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee on September 30, \n1994, Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, estimated that it will \ncost anywhere from $3 to $8 billion annually to build the education \nportion of the national information infrastructure. The Office of \nTechnology Assessment has also estimated that the cost of bringing the \nstudents-to-computer ratio down to 3-to-1 would cost $4.2 billion a \nyear for 6 years.\n  Mr. President, I will soon introduce legislation designed to help \nStates and local school districts meet these costs by authorizing \nFederal departments and agencies to make grants to the National \nEducation Technology Funding Corp.\n  Rather than creating another bureaucratic Federal program, this \nlegislation would provide Federal support for education technology \nthrough the NETFC--an innovative, bipartisan, public-private \npartnership.\n  The seed money will help the NETFC provide low-interest loans, loan \nguarantees, grants, and other forms of assistance to States in order to \nhelp them improve their education technology infrastructures.\n  This legislation will not infringe upon local control over public \neducation in any way. Rather, it will supplement, augment, and assist \nlocal efforts to support education technology in the least intrusive \nway possible, by helping local school boards and States improve their \nown facilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the GAO report be printed \nin its entirety in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSchool Facilities--America's Schools not Designed or Equipped for 21st \n                                Century\n\n         U.S. General Accounting Office, Health, Education, and \n           Human Services Division,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun, Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Hon. \n       Claiborne Pell, Hon. Paul Simon, Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       A skilled workforce is necessary to increase productivity \n     so that a society can maintain and enhance its standard of \n     living. Therefore, education and future employment \n     opportunities for our nation's children and teenager is a \n     concern that transcends traditional geographic, economic, and \n     political boundaries. Towards that end, in your letter of \n     February 15, 1994, you requested information on the physical \n     condition of the Nation's public elementary and secondary \n     schools. We presented national-level information on the \n     physical condition of the nation's school facilities in \n     School Facilities: Condition of America's Schools (GAO/HEHS- \n     [[Page S5128]] 95-61 Feb. 1, 1995). In that report, on the \n     basis of estimates by school officials in a national sample \n     of schools, we estimated that the nation's schools need about \n     $112 billion\\1\\ to repair or upgrade America's multibillion \n     dollar investment in school facilities to good overall \n     condition.\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In addition, you asked us to document the extent to which \n     America's 90,000 schools are designed and equipped to meet \n     the needs of today's students and tomorrow's workers. \n     Specifically, can America's schools provide the key \n     facilities requirements and environmental conditions for \n     education reform and improvement? do America's schools have \n     appropriate technologies, such as computers, and the facility \n     infrastructure to support the new technologies? In short, do \n     America's schools have the physical capacity to support \n     learning into the 21st century?\n       To answer these questions, we surveyed a nationally \n     representative stratified random sample of about 10,000 \n     schools and augmented the survey with visits to 10 selected \n     school districts. Our analyses otherwise noted, sampling \n     errors do not exceed 2 percent. (See app. VI for a discussion \n     of methodology.) We conducted our study between January 1994 \n     and March 1995 in accordance with generally accepted \n     government auditing standards.\n                            results in brief\n\n       School officials in a national sample of schools reported \n     that although most schools meet many key facilities \n     requirements\\2\\ and environmental conditions\\3\\ for education \n     reform and improvement, most are unprepared for the 21st \n     century in critical areas:\n       Most schools do not fully use modern technology. Although \n     at least three-quarters of schools report having sufficient \n     computers and televisions (tv), they do not have the system \n     or building infrastructure to fully use them. Moreover, \n     because computers and other equipment are often not networked \n     or connected to any other computers in the school or the \n     outside world, they cannot access the information super \n     highway.\n       Over 14 million students attend about 40 percent of schools \n     that reported that their facilities cannot meet the \n     functional requirements of laboratory science or large-group \n     instruction even moderately well.\n       Over half the schools reported unsatisfactory flexibility \n     of instructional space necessary to implement many effective \n     teaching strategies.\n       Although education reform requires facilities to meet the \n     functional requirements of key support services--such as \n     private areas for counseling and testing, parent support \n     activities, social/health care, day care and before- and \n     after-school care--about two-thirds of schools reported that \n     they cannot meet the functional requirements of before- or \n     after-school care or day care.\n       Moreover, not all students have equal access to facilities \n     that can support education into the 21st century, even those \n     attending school in the same district. Overall, schools in \n     central cities and schools with a 50-percent or more minority \n     population were more likely to have more insufficient \n     technology elements and a greater number of unsatisfactory \n     environmental conditions--particularly lighting and physical \n     security--than other schools.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Education Reform.--Education reform is a national movement \n     to raise standards for all students at all schools. It \n     focuses on changes designed to improve student outcomes by \n     (1) determining what students should know and be able to do\n      and (2) ensuring that the key components of the educational \n     system are directed to achieving those outcomes.\\4\\ To \n     accomplish these objectives, education reform efforts are \n     introducing new teaching methods, assessments, curricula, \n     instructional materials, and technology into school \n     buildings.\n       To improve instruction, reform advocates recommend that a \n     school use new techniques for teaching and evaluating \n     students and involve teachers in developing curricula, \n     redesigning instruction, and planning staff development. To \n     help achieve desired educational outcomes, advocates also \n     recommend that schools enlist parents to monitor their \n     children's progress and participate in school activities, in \n     part by volunteering as tutors and acting as teacher aides. \n     Finally, to further ensure the success of educational reform, \n     advocates recommend that schools help provide health and \n     social services to students as well as before- and after-\n     school care and day care.\\5\\\n       For example, when teachers evaluate students in new ways, \n     they need space to display and store student projects and \n     journals. Likewise, changes in instructional programs or \n     techniques--such as adopting an ungraded primary system or \n     creating a school-within-a-school--require space for large-\n     group and small-group instruction. Adding an all-day \n     kindergarten, extended-day programs, or even new computer \n     courses\\6\\ also call for special or dedicated space. \n     Therefore, school facilities that can support education \n     reform activities and communications technologies will not \n     resemble or operate as schools built in the 1950s.\n       Rather than uniform-sized classrooms with rows of desks, a \n     chalkboard, and minimal resources such as textbooks and \n     encyclopedias, schools prepared to support 21st century \n     education would have: Flexible space, including space for \n     small- and large-group instruction; space to store and \n     display alternative student assessment materials; facilities \n     for teaching laboratory science, including demonstration and \n     student laboratory stations, safety equipment, and \n     appropriate storage space for chemicals and other supplies; \n     and\n      a media center/library with multiple, networked computers to \n     access information to outside libraries and information \n     sources.\n       In addition, such schools would also have space for a \n     variety of support activities: private areas for student \n     counseling and testing and for parent support activities, \n     such as tutoring, planning, making materials, and the like; \n     social and health care services; day care; and before- and \n     after-school care.\n       Schools would also have the capacity to operate year round, \n     24-hours per day if necessary, providing a safe and well-lit \n     environment with satisfactory heating, air-conditioning, \n     ventilation, and air quality and with appropriate acoustics \n     for noise control. In addition, schools would have enough \n     high-quality computers, printers, and computer networks for \n     instructional use; modems; telephone lines for modems and \n     telephones in instructional areas; TVs; laser disk players/\n     video cassette recorders (VCR); cable TV; fiber optic cable; \n     conduits/raceways for computer and computer network cables; \n     electric wiring; and power for computers and other \n     communications technology.\\7\\ Networking capability in the \n     classroom allows for use of a wide range of teaching and \n     learning strategies that are not possible with stand-alone \n     computers. For example, networks allow: Groups of students \n     simultaneous access to large data sources; students to \n     communicate with each other and with teachers in their own \n     school, and with teachers and students in other schools; and \n     teachers to interact with students by computer as students \n     work--engaging in online dialogs, referring to additional \n     resources--or students to engage in group projects.\n       Communications Technology in Schools.--Although technology \n     is changing constantly and quickly becoming defined by \n     complex interactive and multimedia\\8\\ technologies and \n     standards are only beginning to emerge,\\9\\ it is helpful to \n     regard school communications technology as comprising four \n     basic electronic systems: technology infrastructure, data, \n     voice, and video. These systems transmit data--by\n      computer networks, voice--by phone lines, and video--by TV \n     within the school, among different school buildings, to \n     the outside world, and even to outer space.\n       Technology Infrastructure.--Of the four systems, technology \n     infrastructure may be the most important and least \n     understood. Data, voice, and video systems cannot operate \n     without the supporting building or system infrastructure. \n     Building infrastructure consists of what needs to be built \n     into the facility to make any technology operate effectively \n     in the school: the conduits/raceways through which computer \n     and computer network cables are laid in the school, the \n     cables and electrical wiring for computers and other \n     communications technology, and the electrical power and \n     related building features such as electric outlets. Although \n     designing a new building with this infrastructure included is \n     relatively easy and inexpensive, installing it in existing \n     school buildings can be expensive and disruptive.\n       The other type of infrastructure--system infrastructure--\n     links up various technology components. For example, computer \n     network infrastructure consists of the software that runs the \n     networking function. It links all computers in a class or in \n     the school or the computers in the school with computers in \n     the outside world--as well as special pieces of hardware such \n     as severs (computers with large information storage \n     capabilities that allow many users to share information) \n     whose purpose is to run the network. Besides the network \n     infrastructure, modems--small electrical devices that allow \n     computers to communicate with each other through the phone \n     lines--are another basic component of systems infrastructure \n     that links data, voice, video, and even multimedia systems.\n       This technology infrastructure, although initially more \n     costly than the basic computer/printer, may have \n     substantially more value. Educationally, it can link even the \n     most remote or poor school with vast resources, including the \n     finest libraries and the best teachers, for a wide range of \n     courses or course enhancements, such as ``virtual'' field \n     trips. Financially, according to the North Central Regional \n     Educational Laboratory, the Internet and the emerging video \n     and imaging technologies could be used to change the economic \n     basis of schooling by drawing upon the free or low-cost \n     resources and services to replace textbooks and other costly \n     instructional materials, software, and other programs. Those \n     funds could then be used for additional staffing, local \n     curriculum development,\n      developing technology staff, ongoing local staff \n     development, and the like.\\10\\\n       Data Systems.--Basic data systems include computers, some \n     with compact disk read-only memory (cd-rom) capability, \n     connected to printers. A baseline data system enables \n     instructional computers to communicate with similar devices \n     in the classroom or the school (local area networks). \n     Optimally, a data system also includes computer networks \n     compatible with outside resources (wide area networks) such \n     as the Internet;\\11\\ computers in the central office, in \n     other schools, and home computers; and databases from the \n     Department of Education or Library of Congress.\n       [[Page S5129]] Voice Systems.--Voice systems include \n     accessible two-way voice communication and messaging \n     (telephone) systems for staff members to communicate with \n     each other in the building and with the school community. A \n     baseline system includes a public address system, some \n     outgoing lines and telephones serving school offices and \n     staff members, and incoming lines to meet community and \n     administrative needs. Optimally, it also includes more \n     outgoing and incoming lines and sufficient capacity to allow \n     for such developing technologies as voice processing and \n     voice mail.\n       Video Systems.--Video systems provide accessibility to \n     television communication and all forms of video transmission \n     from school locations as well as from the outside. A baseline \n     system includes capability to receive instructional and \n     teacher professional programming as well as commercial and \n     public television stations whether through a master antenna \n     or cable, microwave, or satellite. An optimal system with \n     today's technology also includes capability in classrooms and \n     teachers' offices to dial up video sources in the school \n     media center and to conduct two-way video-interactive classes \n     between classrooms, inside the school, and between schools.\n       Only a Few Schools Have State-of-the-Art Communications \n     Technology.--Today new schools are being designed with these \n     changes in mind. Yet we only have a handful of schools--\n     mainly science high schools like Stuyvesant High School in \n     New York City or Thomas Jefferson High School in Virginia--\n     that model state-of-the-art communications technologies. \n     However, to prepare the nation's children and teenagers to be \n     competitive workers in the 21st century, experts and business \n     leaders say modern communication technologies should be part \n     of America's elementary and secondary education, not just the \n     sole province of a few schools.\n       An example of state-of-the-art technology can be found in \n     the new Stuyvesant High School. Serving about 3,000 students, \n     it has over 400 computers, most of which are arranged in 15 \n     networks, with access to the Internet, as well as four \n     antennae on the roof to communicate with satellites and \n     virtually anyone else in the outside world. This school can \n     directly access the latest information from the most \n     sophisticated scientific satellites and participate in \n     interactive ``classes'' with scientists in the field in the \n     Amazon rain forest via interactive, multimedia networks like \n     the JASON Project. This allows the students to talk with \n     these scientists and observe them and the rain forest on \n     their TV screens during class, allowing them to go on \n     ``virtual'' field trips worldwide.\n       Federal Legislation Supports Reform and Technology.--Recent \n     federal legislative initiatives supporting education reform \n     and technology include (1) Improving America's Schools Act of \n     1994, which authorized $200 million for technology education \n     for 1995 and an additional $200 million for the new education \n     infrastructure improvement grants; and (2) Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act, passed in 1994, which establishes an \n     Office of Educational Technology in the Department of \n     Education. Goals 2000 requires sates that wish to receive \n     funding under the statute to develop a state improvement plan \n     for elementary and secondary education. This plan should \n     include a systemic statewide plan to increase the use of \n     state-of-the-art technologies that enhance elementary and \n     secondary student learning and staff development to support \n     the National Education Goals and state content standards and \n     state student performance standards. Central to both these \n     acts is the idea that children are entitled to an opportunity \n     to acquire the knowledge and skills contained in these \n     standards, often referred to as ``opportunity to learn.''\\12\\ \n     Figure 1 depicts various school facilities around the \n     country. [Figure 1 not reproducible in Record.]\n       Most Schools Have Computers and TVs but Little \n     Infrastructure to Fully Use Technologies.--Over three-\n     quarters of the schools reported having sufficient computers \n     and TVs. Two-thirds reported having sufficient printers, \n     laser disk players/VCRs,\\13\\ and cable TV. However, school \n     officials reported that about 10.3 million students in about \n     25 percent of the schools do not have sufficient computers. \n     Although most schools report having enough computers and \n     other basic technology elements,\\14\\ they do not have the \n     technology infrastructure to fully use them.

They are limited, \n     however, in their access to the vast amount of electronic \n     information available and do not allow for new information to \n     come into the system or for the interaction between students, \n     students and teachers, or the school and the outside world.\n       Over half of America's schools reported insufficient \n     capability in modems, phone lines for modems, phone lines for \n     instruction, conduits/raceways, and fiber optics. (See table \n     1 and, for more detail, tables III.1 and III.2 in app. III.)\n       The following details emerged from the survey: In central \n     cities, over 60 percent of schools reported insufficient \n     networks, modems, phone lines (for modems or instruction), \n     conduits, and fiber\n      optic cables. Over half reported insufficient capability for \n     electrical wiring for computer technology. (For more \n     detail, see table III.4 in app. III.)\n       Regional analyses show that schools in the West reported \n     the least sufficient technology. (For more detail, see table \n     III.7 in app. III.)\n       Schools with inadequate buildings\\15\\ also were more likely \n     to report insufficient capability to support technology. In \n     every area of communications technology we asked about, \n     schools with no inadequate buildings reported greater \n     sufficiency than schools with one or more inadequate \n     buildings. However, even in schools reporting no inadequate \n     buildings, about one-half or more reported insufficient \n     capability in areas related to interconnectivity, such as \n     networks, modems, and fiber optics.\n       Site visits supported the survey results:\n       In Ramona, California, we learned that some schools needed \n     to retrofit wiring to increase power for more demanding \n     technologies; one elementary school had only two outlets in \n     each classroom. Moreover, if four teachers used their outlets \n     at the same time, the circuit breakers tripped. This happened \n     about once a month.\n       A school official in Montgomery County, Alabama, said that \n     new electrical systems to accommodate computers and other \n     technologies were the most common renovation needed in \n     schools.\n       In our site visit to Washington, D.C., officials told us \n     that while many schools have computer laboratories with new \n     computer equipment, these will need upgraded electrical \n     systems, lighting, and air-conditioning to provide an \n     adequate learning environment.\n       In one school we visited in Chicago, computers were still \n     in boxes because the school did not have sufficient power and \n     outlets to use them.\n       In looking at the uses of bond proceeds in the districts, \n     on average, school officials reported that only 8 percent of \n     the most recently passed bond was spent for purchase of \n     computers and telecommunications equipment. That is, for the \n     average $6.5 million bond issue, about $155,600 or 2 percent \n     was provided for the purchase of computers and about $381,100 \n     or 6 percent for the purchase of telecommunications \n     equipment. (See app. II.)\n       Selected respondent comments.--``Our building, built in \n     1948, was wired for a filmstrip projector.''\n       ``We live in a state where we put more technology and \n     safety in an automobile than we do in our schools.''\n       ``We are not ready to join the information network proposed \n     by Vice President Gore.''\n       ``Our computers are mostly donated. What few we purchased \n     were bought in 1984--the kids laugh at them, they have better \n     at home.''\n       ``The number of computers in the buildings is limited, and \n     we currently have one computer bus serving all six elementary \n     schools. The time for students to spend on the computers is \n     obviously limited.''\n       ``Facility adaptation for computer networks, video \n     networks, and phone access is expensive and makes justifying \n     purchase of computer hardware more difficult.''\n\n\n  schools reported lacking key facilities requirements for education \n                                 reform\n\n       When asked how well their buildings meet the functional \n     requirements of specified activities related to school reform \n     and improvement, many survey respondents reported that they \n     met these requirements ``not well at all.'' (See table 2.) \n     For example, although 58 percent of schools reported meeting \n     the functional requirements of laboratory science at least \n     somewhat well, in fact, about 14.6 million students are in \n     the 42 percent of schools where officials report that the \n     facilities requirements for laboratory science are met not \n     well at all (see fig. 3 and table 2).\n       [Figure 3 not reproducible in Record.]\n\n  TABLE 2: MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOLS REPORTING THEY MEET THE  \nFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF SOME KEY EDUCATION REFORM ACTIVITIES NOT WELL\n                                 AT ALL                                 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Number of\n                                          percent               students\n                Activity                     of     Number of   affected\n                                          schools    schools      (in   \n                                                               millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstructional activities:                                               \nLaboratory science.....................       42.0     32,100       14.6\nLarge-group instruction................       38.2     29,500       14.3\n\n\n                                                                        \n[[Page S5130]]\n  TABLE 2: MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOLS REPORTING THEY MEET THE  \nFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF SOME KEY EDUCATION REFORM ACTIVITIES NOT WELL\n                            AT ALL--Continued                           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Number of\n                                          percent               students\n                Activity                     of     Number of   affected\n                                          schools    schools      (in   \n                                                               millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStorage of student assessment materials       31.3     24,000       12.9\nDisplay student assessment materials...       27.6     21,200       11.1\nLibrary/media center...................       13.4     10,400        4.2\nSmall-group instruction................        9.5      7,300        3.7\nSupport activities:                                                     \nDay care...............................       77.5     55,900       29.0\nBefore/after school care...............       58.8     43,100       22.4\nSocial/health care services............       27.0     20,900       10.5\nPrivate areas for counseling and                                        \n testing...............................       25.7     19,900       10.1\nParent support activities..............       23.5     18,200        9.7\nTeacher planning.......................       13.1     10,200        5.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Survey respondents rated the ability of their school facilities to\n  meet the functional requirements of key education reform activities on\n  the following scale: very well, moderately well, somewhat well, and   \n  not well at all.                                                      \n\n     Only seven states--District of Columbia, Georgia, Indiana, \n     New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Texas--had 20 \n     percent or more of their schools meeting at least somewhat \n     well the functional requirements for some educational reform \n     and improvement activities. While 40 states reported that 50 \n     percent or more of their schools had three or more specified \n     requirements that they met not well at all, 5 states--\n     Arkansas, California, Maine, Ohio, and Rhode Island--reported \n     70 percent or more of their schools in this condition. (For \n     more detail, see tables IV.1 and IV.2 in app. IV.)\n       Nationwide, 42 percent of schools reported that their \n     buildings met the functional requirements of laboratory \n     science not well at all, affecting 14.6 million students. \n     Forty-three states reported that one-third or more of their \n     schools met functional requirements for laboratory science \n     not well at all. Eight states--Alaska, California, Delaware, \n     Maine, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington--reported that 50 \n     percent or more of their schools were in this condition. (For \n     more detail, see table IV.3 in app. IV.)\n       Nearly four out of five schools nationwide reported that \n     they could not meet at all well the functional requirements \n     of day care. (See fig. 3.) Forty-five states reported that \n     two-thirds or more of their schools were in this condition. \n     (For more detail, see table IV.3 in app. IV.)\n       Nationwide, about three out of five schools reported that \n     they met the functional requirements of before- and after-\n     school care not well at all. Forty-eight states reported that \n     one-third or more of their schools were in this condition.\n       About two out of five schools nationwide reported that they \n     met the functional requirements of large-group instruction \n     not well at all, a condition affecting 14.3 million students. \n     Thirty states reported that one-third or more of their \n     schools were in this condition. Four states--Alaska, \n     California, Kansas, and Nebraska--reported over half their \n     schools in this condition. (For more detail, see table IV.1 \n     in app. IV.)\n       These problems were also demonstrated on our site visits:\n       Officials in Chicago told us that only one-fourth of \n     Chicago's schools have properly equipped science \n     laboratories, with water, power, gas, vacuum, and appropriate \n     mechanisms for air and waste removal.\n       At the high school in Raymond, Washington, officials said \n     that they need flexible space for large- and small-group \n     instruction. Science classes have outdated equipment, and \n     reading areas in the media center are noisy and poorly \n     lighted. Officials also say they desperately need a day care \n     center to keep young women with babies in school.\n       In New Orleans, officials told us that most secondary \n     schools lack science laboratories that meet current safety \n     needs, such as adequate air circulation, ventilation, \n     emergency shut-offs for gas and electricity, emergency eye \n     washes, and showers.\n       Selected Respondent Comments.--``These schools, as others \n     over thirty years of age, while well-maintained, cannot \n     provide the type and variety of instructional space necessary \n     for the education programs of the 21st century without major \n     renovations.''\n       ``The buildings were built for twenty-five students per \n     class with no extra rooms, no small and/or large group areas, \n     and no planned storage space. Consequently, the facilities \n     are certainly not conducive to new or different class size \n     configurations or lesson delivery formats.''\n       Most Schools Report Most Environmental Conditions \n     Satisfactory, but Problems Remain.--Overall, most school \n     officials reported satisfaction with most environmental \n     factors associated with learning.\\16\\ (See table 3.) However, \n     22 millions students are in 53.9 percent of the schools that \n     reported that their instructional space flexibility was \n     unsatisfactory. Rates of unsatisfactory environmental \n     conditions tend to be higher in schools where over 40 percent \n     of the students are approved to receive free or reduced \n     lunch, where over 50 percent of the students are minority \n     students, in schools in the West.

Of those schools noting that they had air-\n     conditioning, 15.4 percent (6,000 schools) reported \n     unsatisfactory air-conditioning, affecting about 4.2 million \n     students.\n       The majority of schools reported that they were satisfied \n     with their air-conditioning, although only half of the \n     schools responding to our survey reported that they had air-\n     conditioning in classrooms. The\n      geographic patterns of air-conditioning in classrooms \n     generally follow climate patterns. (For more detail, see \n     fig. V.1 in app. V.) Three-quarters of schools reported \n     that they had air-conditioning in their administrative \n     areas. Only three states--New York, Oregon, and Rhode \n     Island--indicated that over a third of their schools had \n     unsatisfactory air-conditioning in their classrooms.\n       We found examples of problems caused by unsatisfactory air-\n     conditioning in our site visits. In New Orleans, nearly half \n     of the schools have no air-conditioning, despite the average \n     relative humidity in the morning of 87 percent. Faced with a \n     similar situation in Richmond, Virginia, school officials \n     told us that students with asthma get sick from the heat; \n     schools close early in the hot fall and spring months, \n     decreasing instructional time.\n\n\n                      selected respondent comments\n\n       ``Our school district facilities are currently meeting the \n     needs of our students. We have not been impacted by \n     population growth, lawsuits, or other major problems that \n     would force our resources in other areas. Due to conservative \n     spending practices by our school board and adequate funding \n     by the state of Wyoming in the past decade, we have adequate \n     carryover to provide needs without asking for state \n     assistance or a bond issue.''\n       ``Building design in the 1950s and 60s did not include air-\n     conditioning or even windows that opened for schools, thus \n     much renovation is needed in our district.''\n       ``The middle school is depressing when you walk into it. We \n     are having to use gym dressing rooms as regular classrooms.''\n       ``The appearance and condition of school buildings is an \n     important factor in positively influencing urban students. \n     The continued neglect of the public school infrastructure at \n     both state and federal levels continues to subject our \n     students and staff to conditions which do not ensure their \n     welfare and safety.''\n\n\n        best and worst schools sometimes found in same district\n\n       Although some children have access to facilities that can \n     support education in the 21st century, many do not. Schools \n     differ dramatically, even in the same district. Our site \n     visits revealed that the ability of school facilities to \n     support education reform ranges widely. Because of the need \n     to ease overcrowding in some areas, schools are constantly \n     being built, even in impoverished cities. These new schools \n     are generally equipped to implement education reform and \n     improvement activities. However, with construction of new \n     facilities taking priority over maintaining and renovating \n     current buildings, gross inequalities may result in the same\n      school district. For example, in Pomona, California, \n     officials told us that to be ready for education in the \n     21st century, Pomona's older schools need additional \n     wiring and outlets to use new technology and facilities \n     for large-group instruction, storage of student assessment \n     materials, social and health services, teachers' planning \n     areas, and the like. In contrast, the newest school has a \n     satellite dish, an electrical system built to handle \n     anticipated technology, collapsible walls that facilitate \n     team teaching or small-group instruction, enormous amounts \n     of storage space, and large amounts of space for a variety \n     of services and activities.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       Many education reformers say that holding students to \n     nationwide standards is unfair if they have not had an \n     equal--or roughly equal--opportunity to learn. If schools \n     cannot provide students with sufficient technological support \n     or facilities for instruction and services, they may not be \n     providing even a roughly equal opportunity for all students \n     to learn. This is particularly true in central cities and in \n     schools that serve high percentages of minority and poor \n     students.\n       Far from the high-tech world of interactive media and \n     virtual reality, many of our schools are wired for no more \n     than filmstrip projectors. As one respondent commented,\n       ``We need technology in the schools and teachers who can \n     use the equipment. The percentage of teachers who can use \n     computers is abysmally low, yet computers only scratch the \n     surface of technology that should be available to all \n     students, not just those who live in affluent areas. \n     Interactive TV and telecommunications is a must in all \n     schools, yet the cost of this technology remains \n     prohibitively high for most small \n     [[Page S5131]] schools. For those schools who can afford it, \n     the cost of training teachers to use it drives the costs up \n     further.''\n       In short, most of America's schools do not yet have key \n     technologies or the facilities required to support learning \n     into the 21st century. They cannot provide key facilities \n     requirements and environmental conditions for education \n     reform and improvement.

VI--Technical Appendix\n\n\n                     Scope and Methodology Overview\n\n       To determine the extent to which America's 80,000 schools \n     have the physical capacity to support 21st century technology \n     and education reform for all students, we surveyed a national \n     sample of public schools and their associated districts and \n     augumented the surveys with visits to selected school \n     districts. We used various experts to advise us on the design \n     and analysis of this project (See app. I.)\n       We sent the surveys to a nationally representative sample \n     of about 10,000 public schools in over 5,000 associated \n     school districts. For our sample, we used the public school \n     sample for the Department of Education's 1993-94 Schools and \n     Staffing Survey (SASS), which is a multifaceted, nationally \n     representative survey sponsored by the National Center for \n     Educational Statistics (NCES) and administered by the Bureau \n     of the Census.\n       We asked about the physical condition of schools and how \n     well schools could meet selected functional requirements of \n     education reform, such as having space for small- and large-\n     group instruction or science laboratories. We also asked \n     officials if their schools had sufficient data, voice, and \n     video technologies and infrastructure to support these \n     technologies. A list of the relevant survey items appears in \n     appendix II.\\18\\\n       We directed the survey to those officials who are most \n     knowledgeable about facilities--such as facilities directors \n     and other central office administrators of the districts that \n     housed our sampled schools. Our analyses are based on \n     responses from 78 percent of the schools sampled and 75 \n     percent of the associated districts. Analyses of \n     nonrespondent characteristics showed them to be similar to \n     respondents. Findings from the survey have been statistically \n     adjusted (weighted) to produce estimates that are \n     representative at national and state levels. All data are \n     self-reported, and we did not independently verify their \n     accuracy.\n       In addition, we visited 41 schools in 10 selected school \n     districts varying in location, size, and minority composition \n     to augment and illustrate our survey results. We also \n     reviewed the literature on education reform, including the \n     relationship between environmental conditions and student \n     learning. We conducted our study between January 1994 and \n     March 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government \n     auditing standards.\n                      school and district surveys\n\n       For our review of the physical condition of America's \n     schools, we wanted to determine physical condition as \n     perceived by the most knowledgeable school district \n     personnel. To accomplish this, we mailed school and district \n     questionnaires to superintendents of school districts \n     associated with a nationally representative sample of public \n     schools. We asked the superintendents to have district \n     [[Page S5136]] personnel, such as facilities directors who \n     were very familiar with school facilities, answer the \n     questionnaires. The questionnaires gathered information about \n     (1) the physical condition of schools; (2) costs of bringing \n     schools into good overall condition, which we defined as \n     needing only routine maintenance or minor repairs; and (3) \n     how well schools could meet the functional requirements of \n     education programs. For our school sample, we used the sample \n     for the 1993-94 sass.\n\n\n                           sampling strategy\n\n       The 1993-94 sass sample is designed to give several types \n     of estimates, including both national and state-level \n     estimates. It is necessarily a very complex sample. \n     Essentially, however, it is stratified by state and grade \n     level (elementary, secondary, and combined). It also has \n     separate strata for schools with large Native American \n     populations and for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. A \n     detailed description of the sample and discussion of the \n     sampling issues is contained in nces' technical report on the \n     1993-94 sass sample.\\19\\\n\n\n                            survey response\n\n       We mailed our questionnaires to 9,956 sampled schools in \n     5,459 associated districts across the country in May 1994. We \n     did a follow-up mailing in July 1994 and again in October \n     1994. After each mailing, we telephoned nonresponding \n     districts to encourage their responses. We accepted returned \n     questionnaires through early January 1995.\n       Of the 9,956 schools in the original sample, 393 were found \n     to be ineligible for our survey.\\20\\ Subtracting these \n     ineligible schools from our original sample yielded an \n     adjusted sample of 9,563 schools. The number of completed, \n     usable school questionnaires returned was 7,478. Dividing the \n     number of completed, usable returns by the adjusted sample \n     yielded a school response rate of 78 percent. Of the 5,459 \n     associated districts in the original sample, 28 were found to \n     be ineligible for our survey mainly because they were no \n     longer operating. Subtracting these ineligible\n      districts from our original sample of 5,459 associated \n     districts yielded an adjusted district sample of 5,431 \n     districts. The number of completed, usable district \n     questionnaires returned was 4,095. Dividing the number of \n     completed, usable returns by the adjusted district sample \n     yielded a district response rate of 75 percent.\\21\\\n       We compared school and district nonrespondents with \n     respondents by urbanicity, location, state, race and \n     ethnicity, and poverty. There were few notable differences \n     between the groups. On the basis of this information, we \n     assumed that our respondents did not differ significantly \n     from the nonrespondents.\\22\\ Therefore, we weighted the \n     respondent data to adjust for nonresponse and yield national \n     and state-level estimates.\n\n\n                            sampling errors\n\n       All sample surveys are subject to sampling error, that is, \n     the extent to which the results differ from what would be \n     obtained if the whole population had received the \n     questionnaire. Since the whole population does not receive \n     the questionnaire in a sample survey, the true size of the \n     sampling error cannot be known. However, it can be estimated \n     from the responses to the survey. The estimate of sampling \n     error depends largely on the number of respondents and the \n     amount of variability in the data.\n       For this survey, sampling errors for all school-level \n     estimates at the national level is estimated to be \n      2 percent or less at the 95-percent confidence \n     level. Sampling errors for school-level estimates at the \n     state level are generally within  10 percent at \n     the 95-percent confidence level. Sampling errors for a few \n     state-level estimates may go as high as  12-15 \n     percent. These are indicated on the tables in the appendixes. \n     Sampling errors for district-level estimates are not \n     available. With the exception of the information on recent \n     bond issues passed by districts, all estimates discussed in \n     this report are school-level estimates at national or state-\n     levels.\n\n\n                           nonsampling errors\n\n       In addition to sampling errors, surveys are also subject to \n     other types of systematic error or bias that can affect \n     results. This is especially true when respondents are asked \n     to answer questions of a sensitive nature or inherently \n     subject to error. Lack of understanding of the issues can \n     also result in systematic error. Bias can affect both \n     response rates and the way\n      that respondents answer particular questions. It is not \n     possible to assess the magnitude of the effect of biases, \n     if any, on the results of a survey. Rather, possibilities \n     of bias can only be identified and accounted for when \n     interpreting results. This survey had two major possible \n     sources of bias: (1) bias inherent in all self-ratings or \n     self-reports and (2) sensitivity of compliance issues.\n       Bias inherent in self-ratings may impact results of this \n     survey in two major areas. First, the self-ratings or self-\n     reports of technological sufficiency may be overly optimistic \n     for several reasons. In our analyses, we include as \n     ``sufficient'' responses that indicated moderate and somewhat \n     sufficient capability as well as very sufficient capability. \n     This could indicate a wide range of sufficiency, including \n     some responses that are very close to ``not sufficient.'' In \n     addition, our analyses showed that without any objective \n     standards with which to anchor their responses, schools \n     indicating ``sufficient'' computers and computer/student \n     ratios that ranged from 1:1 to 1:292 (a median of 1:11) for \n     those schools that had computers. About 300 schools that \n     indicated they had no computers for instructional use said \n     that was sufficient. (See table III.9 for more details.) \n     Finally, technology experts who regularly consult with school \n     systems report that the level of knowledge among school \n     administrators and staff of possible use and application of \n     technology in schools is low--further increasing the \n     likelihood that these sufficiency estimates are overly \n     optimistic.\n       Second, assessing the physical condition of buildings is a \n     very complex and technical undertaking. Moreover, many \n     facilities problems, particularly the most serious and \n     dangerous, are not visible to the naked eye. Further, any \n     dollar estimates made of the cost to repair, retrofit, \n     upgrade, or renovate are just that, estimates, unless the \n     school has recently completed such work. The only way school \n     officials actually know what such work costs is to put it out \n     for bid. Even then, cost changes may occur before the \n     contracted work is completed. Therefore, estimates and \n     evaluations reported are subject to inaccuracies.\n       A second kind of bias that may occur results from the \n     sensitivity of compliance issues. In this case, our interest \n     in securing information related to compliance with federal \n     mandates, life-safety codes, and physical security put us in \n     a highly sensitive area. For example, respondents may \n     perceive that accurately reporting problems in providing \n     access for disabled students could make the school vulnerable \n     to lawsuits, despite assurances of confidentiality. \n     Consequently, in sensitive areas\n      schools may tend toward underreporting or making \n     conservative estimates.\n       In general, survey results were consistent with what we saw \n     in our site visits.\n\n\n                              site visits\n\n       To illustrate and augment our survey results, we conducted \n     site visits in 10 districts: Chicago, Illinois; Grandview, \n     Washington; Montgomery County, Alabama; New Orleans, \n     Louisiana; New York, New York; Pomona, California; Ramona, \n     California; Raymond, Washington; Richmond, Virginia; and \n     Washington, D.C. Selected to represent key variables, they \n     varied in location, size, and ethnic composition.\n       During these site visits, we interviewed central office \n     staff, such as district superintendents, facilities \n     directors, and business managers; and school staff, such as \n     principals and teachers. We asked the central office staff \n     about their district demographics, biggest facilities issues, \n     facilities financing, assessment, maintenance programs, \n     resources, and barriers to reaching facilities goals.\n       In addition, in each district we asked district officials \n     to show us examples of ``typical,'' ``best,'' and ``worst'' \n     schools and verified reliability of these designations with \n     others. In some small districts, we visited all schools. We \n     spoke with administration and staff in the schools we toured. \n     We asked the school staff about their schools' condition, \n     repair and renovation programs, and facilities needs for \n     educational programs.\n\n\n                        classification variables\n\n       Community Type.--Central City: A large central city (a \n     central city of a Standard Metropolitan

I would like to take a moment to share with the \nChair some information. These charts are bulky, but this is information \nthat comes out of the GAO report that I think is a very telling \nstatement about where we are in our country today in terms of education \nand technology infrastructure.\n  The report which, as you may know, was entitled ``America's Schools \nNot Designed or Equipped for 21st Century.''\n  In this part of the report, most States report that at least 50 \npercent of schools have insufficient technology.\n  My own State of Illinois comes down here, where 60 to 69 percent of \nthe schools in Illinois do not have sufficient technology \ninfrastructure. The Presiding Officer's State, I think, does a little \nbetter. You are in this category. As you can see, we have a long way to \ngo to get the technology up to speed.\n  Understand that this report speaks specifically to technology. The \nfirst report talked about infrastructure. So we talk about putting in \ncomputers. We have heard stories from some of the teachers and people \nwho were questioned in this regard that one of the big problems they \nrun into is, even if they had the computers, the technology, they do \nnot have the capacity to use them. They do not have the phone lines, \nthe cables, and they do not have the ability.\n  One report was that in the classroom in a particular school--and I \nwill not name it now--there were two outlets in the classroom, and so \nif more than two teachers plug something in, the whole building would \nshut down because the circuit breaker would go. Clearly we cannot \nexpect our young people to compete in this world economy, in this \nglobal economy, with that kind of millstone around their neck, without \nhaving the ability to access the technologies.\n  The youngsters may play Nintendo, but that is not training them to \ncompete in our global economy. So if we are training them to address \nthe competition we want them to meet, I believe we have a national \ninterest in addressing the infrastructure and technology infrastructure \nso we can provide our young people with the tools they will need to \nsucceed. Certainly it is an issue that goes to our international \ncompetitiveness. Just this \n[[Page S5138]] morning in the Finance Committee, Ambassador Kantor was \nthere to talk about trade relations of the United States: Where we are \nin the balance of trade; where we are with regard to the issues \naffecting the globalization of this economy; how is our country doing.\n  The question came up, What is the most important thing we can do to \nsee to it we are able to compete in this global economy? The answer to \nthat question is investment in human capital. The answer to that \nquestion is education. The answer to that question is training, so our \npeople, our children will have the skills and the knowledge and the \nwherewithal and capacity to be competitive.\n  I point out also the national statistics. I will point out also, in \naddition to the issue of competitiveness, giving our young people the \ncapacity to compete in this world economy will be a boon to the entire \ncommunity. If you ask employers in our private sector what is the \nbiggest impediment to them hiring people, it is that they are getting \npeople who are not, right now, trained. So the private sector winds up, \nif you will, having costs shifted to them because the youngsters that \nour schools are turning out are not quite yet trained to handle the \ndemands of business.\n  If we are going to prepare our young people for the global economy, \nif we are going to prepare our young people for the world of work, if \nwe are going to stop relying on the willy-nilly haphazard shifting of \ncosts to the private sector, and make certain we have the capacity in \nthis Nation to keep America strong through having a well-educated work \nforce, I believe we have a national interest in investing in this \ninfrastructure, and in this technology infrastructure particularly.\n  This chart talks about the millions of students who attend schools \nwith insufficient technology. Again, this is putting aside for a moment \nthe basic infrastructure like do you have the plugs in the classroom, \nlike having the sufficient lighting. That was the first GAO report, and \nyou recollect that report said we were way behind and our schools were \ndeteriorating and not capable, really, of handling a lot of this stuff.\n  But look at this. Mr. President, 86 percent of our schools, or 66,000 \nschools, or 35.4 million children in the United States attend schools \nthat do not have sufficient fiber optic cables for them to access the \ntechnology. The fiber optics cable is necessary for them to access the \ntechnology and plug into the Internet. You have to have this to get \nonto the information superhighway. So 35.4 million of our students do \nnot have the capacity to get on that highway in school.\n  Phone lines for instructional use--again, 61.2 percent of our \nschools, 47,000 schools, or 24.8 million students in this country do \nnot have phone lines for instructional use.\n  Conduits, raceways for computers, the computer network cables--60 \npercent of the schools do not have it, or 24.9 million students.\n  Go right down the list, even down to televisions. TV's, 15 percent of \nthe schools do not have it; 6.8 million students.\n  It seems to me, for the kind of investment we require here, we can \nupgrade the kind of information and resources that are available to our \nyoung people, we can give them the tools they will need to learn. We \ncan help teachers teach better and in so doing we will have benefits to \nthe entire community.\n  I will close by saying what I may have said already but I cannot \nreiterate it too often. Education is not just a private benefit. It is \nnot just whether or not I can get a good job or I can get a leg up on \nthe competition or whether or not I can afford to be trained or be \neducated or to have a certain set of skills. Education is more than a \nprivate benefit. It is a public good. It goes to the stability and the \nquality of life of our community as a whole, of our entire country. \nEvery person benefits when we have a well-educated citizenry.\n  Frankly, that is how this Nation became the strong, great Nation that \nit was, because we had a work force that was better trained, better \nequipped, better provided for than any other work force in the world. \nWe are in grave danger of losing that if we do not make the kind of \ninvestment in our human capital, in our children, in education, that we \nneed to make in order to give our community the benefits of the talent \nthat I believe these young people have.\n  So, in closing, I would like to again thank Senator Pell for all his \nleadership and for his joining on the GAO letter, and thank the Chair \nfor his attention. I have introduced the GAO report into the Record.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business? Are we in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask if I may speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as many Members of the Senate know, it is my \ncustom to speak each year about a disability subject on April 14. It is \nthe date I was wounded in World War II and joined the disability \ncommunity myself. This year we will be in recess on April 14, so I will \ngive my annual message today.\n  Mr. President, I will talk about another member of the disability \ncommunity--certainly one of its most prominent members. But throughout \nhis life, his disability was not only unknown to most people, it was \ndenied and hidden.\n  I am speaking about President Franklin Roosevelt. Next week, the \nNation will commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death on April 12, \n1945. He will surely be recalled by many as a master politician; an \nenergetic and inspiring leader during the dark days of the Depression; \na tough, single-minded Commander in Chief during World War II; and a \nstatesman.\n  No doubt about it, he was all these things. But he was also the first \nelected leader in history with a disability, and he was a disability \nhero.\n\n\n                        FDR'S SPLENDID DECEPTION\n\n  Mr. President, in 1921, at age 39, Franklin Roosevelt was a young man \nin a hurry. He was following the same political path that took his \ncousin, Theodore Roosevelt, to the White House. In 1910 he was elected \nto the New York State Senate, and later was appointed Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy. In 1920, he was the Democratic candidate for \nVice President.\n  Then, on the evening of August 10, while on vacation, he felt ill and \nwent to bed early. Within 3 days he was paralyzed from the chest down. \nAlthough the muscles of his upper body soon recovered, he remained \nparalyzed below the waist.\n  His political career screeched to a halt. He spent the next 7 years \nin rehabilitation, determined to walk again. He never did. He mostly \nused a wheelchair. Sometimes he was carried by his sons or aides. Other \ntimes he crawled on the floor.\n  But he did perfect the illusion of walking--believing that otherwise \nhis political ambitions were dead. He could stand upright only with his \nlower body painfully wrapped in steel braces. He moved forward by \nswinging his hips, leaning on the arm of a family member or aide. It \nworked for only a few feet at a time. It was dangerous. But it was \nenough to convince people that FDR was not a ``cripple.'' FDR \nbiographer Hugh Gallagher has called this effort, and other tricks used \nto hide his disability. ``FDR's splendid deception.''\n  This deception was aided and abetted by many others. The press were \ncoconspirators. No reporter wrote that FDR could not walk, and no \nphotographer took a picture of him in his wheelchair. for that matter, \nthousands saw him struggle when he walked. Maybe they did not believe \nor understand what they saw.\n  In 1928, FDR ended his political exile, and was elected Governor of \nNew York. Four years later, he was President. On March 4, 1933, \nstanding at the east \n[[Page S5139]] front of this Capitol, he said, ``The only thing we have \nto fear is fear itself.'' He was 35 feet from his wheelchair. Few\n people knew from what deep personal experiences he spoke.\n\n  Perhaps the only occasion where FDR fully acknowledged the extent of \nhis disability in public was a visit to a military hospital in Hawaii. \nHe toured the amputee wards in his wheelchair. He went by each bed, \nletting the men see him exactly as he was. He did not need to give any \npep talks--his example said it all.\n\n\n                          fdr--disability hero\n\n  Mr. President, earlier I called FDR a ``disability hero.'' But it was \nnot for the reasons some might think. It would be easy to cite his \ncourage and grit. But FDR would not want that. ``No sob stuff,'' he \ntold the press in 1928 when he started his comeback. Even within his \nown family, he did not discuss his disability. It was simply a fact of \nlife.\n  In my view, FDR is a hero for his efforts on behalf of others with a \ndisability. In 1926, he purchased a run-down resort in Warm Springs, \nGA, and over the next 20 years turned it into a unique, first class, \nrehabilitation center. It was based on a new philosophy of treatment--\none where psychological recovery was as important as medical treatment.\n  FDR believed in an independent life for people with disabilities--at \na time when society thought they belonged at home or in institutions.\n  Warm Springs was run by people with polio, for people with polio. In \nthat spirit, FDR is the father of the modern independent living \nmovement--which puts people with disabilities in control of their own \nlives.\n  He also founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis--\ntoday known as the March of Dimes--and raised millions of dollars to \nhelp others with polio and find a cure. On April 12, 1955, on the 10th \nanniversary of his death, the March of Dimes announced the first \nsuccessful polio vaccine, engineered by Dr. Jonas Salk. Today, polio is \nvirtually extinct in the United States. Next week, the March of Dimes \nwill celebrate the 40th anniversary of the vaccine in Ann Arbor.\n  In public policy, FDR understood that Government help in \nrehabilitating people with disabilities is good business--often \nreturning more in taxes and savings than it costs. It is unfortunately \na philosophy that even today we often pay more lip service than \npractice.\n\n\n                     disability today and tomorrow\n\n  Mr. President, our Nation has come a long way in its understanding of \ndisability since the days of President Roosevelt. For example, we \nrecognize that disability is a natural part of life. We have begun to \nbuild a world that is accessible. No longer do we accept that \nbuildings--either through design or indifference--are not accessible, \nwhich is a ``Keep Out'' sign for the disabled.\n  We have come a long way in another respect--in attitudes. Fifty years \nago, we had a President, Franklin Roosevelt, who could not walk and \nbelieved it was necessary to disguise that fact from the American \npeople. Today I trust that Americans would have no problem in electing \nas President a man or woman with a disability.\n  Mr. President, let us not fool ourselves--this work is not done. Not \nby a long shot. And I think this is something that we can all agree on, \nRepublican or Democrat.\n  So, next week, as we honor President Roosevelt, let us remember him \nas a disability hero and dedicate ourselves to this unfinished \nbusiness.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5138-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5139-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, the State of Qatar is planning a major \nexpansion of its electric transmission system, which will be carried \nout under its phase IV transmission extension project. This project, \nwith a value of more than $500 million, is being pursued by the energy \ngroup of Black & Veatch, which has headquarters in Overland Park, KS. \nMany of the firm's employees are constituents of mine. We are proud of \nthis competitive American company. It is a world leader in the field of \nelectrical power generation and distribution, and is recognized for the \ntechnological and managerial quality of power projects that it has \nundertaken over the years in more than 50 countries around the globe.\n  Companies like Black & Veatch are part of the answer to bringing down \nour trade deficit, which is now running at an all-time high. The world \nneeds U.S. Technology and U.S. Services, and we should do everything we \ncan to ensure that our companies get the chance to compete in overseas \nmarkets.\n  I have asked the Crown Prince of Qatar to give serious consideration \nto Black & Veatch's proposal for the electric transmission system \nproject, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to the \nCrown Prince be printed in the Record. I thank the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1995.\n     His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani,\n     The Crown Prince, State of Qatar.\n       Your Highness: I wish to express my hope that the State of \n     Qatar will give serious consideration to the proposal for the \n     Transmission Extension Project by Black & Veatch \n     International.\n       I am aware that United States Secretary of Commerce Ron \n     Brown has visited with Your Highness and other top level \n     officials of the State of Qatar on this matter. In addition, \n     Secretary Brown has expressed his support of the Black & \n     Veatch International offer in a letter to Sheikh Hamad bin \n     Jassim bin Jahor al-Thani.\n       Black & Veatch International is well known to me and to \n     many other U.S. Government officials for its high quality \n     services for infrastructure projects.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to acknowledge \nthe importance of mental health to everyone's and society's well-being \nand to call our attention to counseling as a vital part of maintaining \ngood mental health.\n  Mental health counseling is provided along a continuum of patient \nneeds, from educational and preventive services, to diagnosis and \ntreatment of mental illness, to long-term and acute care. It assists \nindividuals and groups with problemsolving, personal and social \ndevelopment, decisionmaking, and self-awareness.\n  Such counseling is offered through community mental health agencies, \nprivate practices, psychiatric hospitals, college campuses, and \nrehabilitation centers. It is often provided in conjunction with other \nmental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, \nsocial workers, psychiatric nurses, and marriage and family therapists \nso that the most appropriate treatment for each patient is assured. It \nis provided by professionals with advanced degrees in counseling or \n[[Page S5140]] related disciplines, practicing within the scope of \ntheir training and experience. They are currently licensed in 40 States \nand the District of Columbia.\n  I want to congratulate the American Mental Health Counselors \nAssociation on their designation of April 30 to May 6, 1995 as \n``National Mental Health Counseling Week,'' and urge each and every \nAmerican to seek the assistance of a qualified mental health counselor \nwhen needed. After all, our mental health is just as important as our \nphysical health.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5139-5", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5140-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5140-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 2:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 831.

A bill to modernize the Federal Reserve System, to provide \nfor a Federal Open Market Advisory Committee, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the federal reserve board reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that I want to describe briefly for the Senate.\n  On my behalf, and on behalf of Senator Reid from Nevada, we \nintroduced this morning a piece of legislation called the Federal \nReserve Reform Act of 1995.\n  Anyone who has listened to the debate in the Senate the last year \nunderstands that I have had major differences with the Federal Reserve \nBoard and its policies. We all know that the Federal Reserve Board has \nraised interest rates seven times over the past year or so. And its \ndecision to tighten the money supply has had an enormous impact on the \neconomic well-being of this country. But despite its central role in \nour economy, the Federal Reserve still dwells only in the shadows of \npublic debate.\n  This organization, located downtown in a concrete temple, meets in \nsecret to make interest rate decisions that have an enormous impact on \nour economy. The Federal Reserve is the last dinosaur in what is \nsupposed to be a democratic Government because it, behind closed doors, \nmakes decisions that affect every single American family, with no \ndemocratic input or debate. So for seven times in the last year or so \nthey have decided we have a major storm brewing called inflation, and \ntherefore they should increase interest rates in order to stem the tide \nof inflation.\n  Of course there is no credible evidence that inflation is on the \nhorizon in any significant way. For the last 4 successive years, \ninflation has been declining. So what is the Federal Reserve Board \ndoing? It is serving its constituency, the big money center banks, at \nthe expense of American families.\n  But members of the Fed still meet in secret to make decisions that \nare critical to the lives of every American. Until recently, the Fed \nwould not even disclose its monetary policy decisions to the public in \na timely manner. Also, the Fed's entire budget is not published in the \nbudget of the U.S. Government. And there are currently no formal \nchannels established through which the Fed can coordinate its monetary \npolicy goals with the fiscal policies of the President and Congress. \nFinally, regional Fed bank presidents, who are not accountable to the \nAmerican people, are casting votes on interest rate decisions. In my \njudgment, these conditions are not what Congress intended when it \ncreated the Federal Reserve in the early 1900's.\n  My legislation would do the following to rectify these problems:\n  First, the President's top economic advisers would be required to \nmeet three times a year with the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve. This includes the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of \nthe Council of Economic Advisers, and the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Second, the President would be empowered to appoint a new Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve near the beginning of his term rather than toward \nthe end. The Fed is crucial to the success of any economic policy and \nthe President should have the opportunity to appoint a Chairman of the \nFed near the beginning of the Presidential term.\n  Third, the Fed would be required to disclose immediately any changes \nin its targets for the money supply. This would provide all investors, \nlarge and small, with equal and timely information about monetary \npolicy decisions. The provision merely codifies what the Federal \nReserve is doing in recent practice.\n  Fourth, the Fed would be required to publish all of its budget in the \nbudget of the U.S. Government. Only a small fraction of Federal Reserve \nbudget is published in the Federal budget; the rest is published in a \nvariety of Federal Reserve publications. The legislation requires that \nit all be published in one place for public review.\n  Fifth, the Comptroller General would be permitted to conduct more \nthorough audits of Fed operations, including policy procedures and \nprocesses. For many years the Fed was totally exempt from any such \naudits to uncover misdoing or waste. Today the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] is prohibited from auditing many of the Fed's operations, \nincluding actions on monetary policy and transactions made under the \ndirection \n[[Page S5143]] of the current Federal Open Market Committee. This bill \nwill remove many of these restrictions.\n  Sixth, only those members of the Board of Governors, who have been \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, will be \npermitted to vote on monetary policy matters. This will help take back \nthe Nation's monetary policy from the heads of the money center bankers \nwho are accountable only to their shareholders, and restore it to those \nFed officials who are accountable to the general public, as the framers \nof the original Federal Reserve Act intended.\n  My legislation is not designed to politicize monetary policy or \npoliticize the Federal Reserve Board. But, I do want the Federal \nReserve Board to be more accountable to the American people.\n  If the Federal Reserve Board is a public agency--if it belongs \nultimately to the people of this country--then the people ought to be \nable to know what is going on there, and all its voting members ought \nto answer to the American people.\n  I might say, as an aside, I am also thinking of introducing \nlegislation that renames the Open Market Committee. My central thesis \nis if the Open Market Committee is going to be closed, then let us \nrename it the Closed Market Committee until such time as it is open. \nThe American people deserve to know what goes on behind closed doors in \nthe construct of monetary policy--policy, incidentally, that affects \nevery single American family.\n  I know words do not always have specific meaning here in public \npolicy and in politics, but they ought to. Why should we close the door \nand then call the committee that closes the door, in law, the Open \nMarket Committee? Let us just call it the Closed Market Committee.\n  That is for another day. I do not include that recommendation in this \nlegislation. But the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1995 is something I \nam pleased to offer on behalf of myself and Senator Reid from Nevada.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN:\n  S. 664. A bill to ensure the competitive availability of consumer \nelectronics devices affording access to telecommunications system \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n       Competitive Consumer Electronics Availability Act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, all consumers like choice. When companies \nare allowed to compete and consumers are given more choices, products \nand services inevitably become more affordable and of higher quality. \nFor this reason, the major thrust of the various telecommunications \nbills that have been offered this year is to create a more competitive \nenvironment for communications products and services. I support this \ngoal.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that is focused on one particular \narea of telecommunications that I believe truly needs more \ncompetition--cable television.\n  Less than 20 years ago, we had little choice as to where we could \nobtain our phones. Each of us rented a standard, ordinary phone from \nour local telephone company. This monopoly ended with the break-up of \nAT Today, most people own their telephones, and the types of phones \nwe can choose are endless. Callers, for example, can go to any number \nof local retailers to buy phones that are more sophisticated than those \npreviously offered by the telephone company. Consumers now can purchase \ncar phones, phones that are connected to an answering machine, or \ncellular phones. Moreover, today's phones are considerably cheaper than \nthe rotary dial phones of the 1950's. Innovation, greater choice, and \nlower prices have been the result of intense competition in the \ntelephone market.\n  Unfortunately, consumers today do not have the same choices with \nregard to the devices necessary to obtain cable television. Cable \ncustomers are in the same situation phone customers found themselves 20 \nyears ago. Virtually all cable users get their cable set-top boxes and \nother hardware, which have security features, only from one source--the \nlocal cable company. There is no competition for these devices.\n  The bill I am introducing today would allow cable customers to buy \ntheir converter boxes and other communications access devices from \ntheir local retail stores. Cable users in Maine and elsewhere in the \ncountry would no longer be at the mercy of cable operators to get their \ncable boxes. They could buy or rent them from anyone they choose--just \nas they do currently with telephones.\n  This bill, which is identical to legislation already introduced in \nthe House by Representative Bliley, would require the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] to adopt regulations to ensure that \nconverter boxes and other interface equipment could be sold \ncommercially by non-cable operators. Cable users, of course, could \nstill choose to rent boxes from their cable operator if they desired.\n  In the near future, the Senate will consider legislation designed to \nincrease competition in all telecommunications markets. My bill would \nbring competition to a segment of the telecommunication market that \ndesperately needs it. By allowing consumers to choose how they get \ntheir cable box, prices on the boxes and other interface equipment will \nlikely drop, and manufacturers and retailers of converter boxes will \nbecome more innovative and responsive to the needs of consumers.\n  Cable companies argue that they need a monopoly over cable devices to \nprotect against theft of cable programming. I fully agree that cable \noperators should be able to protect their signals so that only paying \ncustomers get the benefit of their services. I do not, however, believe \nthat a monopoly over the cable device market is necessary to achieve \nthis purpose.\n  It should be noted that the phone companies once made the same \nargument. They argued that if phone customers were allowed to purchase \nphones from anyone other than the phone company, there would be \nwidespread theft of phone services. This, however, has not turned out \nto be the case.\n  Likewise, I am confident that the sale of cable devices by non cable \nbusinesses would not lead to the theft of cable programming.\n  Today's technology will allow cable operators to protect their \nsignals without monopolizing the hardware and restricting consumers' \nability to choose how they will get a box. Cable companies can prevent \ntheft of their signals without controlling the distribution of \nconverter boxes. For example, the Electronic Industries Association has \ndeveloped a draft standard that would allow codes to be put on magnetic \ncards, similar to credit cards. This card, which could be used with a \ncommercially sold box, would ensure that only those customers who have \npaid for services actually get them.\n  Under my legislation, the FCC would determine the rules--after \nsignificant public comment--that would promote competition in the cable \ndevice market while safeguarding against the theft of cable \nprogramming. My legislation gives the FCC significant discretion in \nmeeting this goal, but requires them to make it a high priority.\n  Competition for converter boxes and other devices can only benefit \nconsumers. As it did in the telephone market, competition will lead to \ninnovation, greater choice, as well as lower prices for converter \nboxes.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 665. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nmotor fuel taxes by 8 cents a gallon, the resulting revenues to be used \nfor mass transit, AMTRAK, and interstate, State, and local roads and \nbridges, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          FUEL TAX LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \ncalling for an 8 cents a gallon tax increase on gasoline and diesel \nfuel.\n  Revenue gained from this tax would be used for mass transit, AMTRAK, \nand interstate, State, and local roads and bridges. As the \nadministration and the Congress consider proposals to downsize the \nFederal Government and increase the responsibilities of State \ngovernments, returning some Federal taxes to States and cities would be \na very sensible step.\n  [[Page S5144]] We are all aware of the need for increases in transit \nand surface transportation investment. And returning revenue to State \nand local governments for infrastructure and capital improvement \nprojects would help State and local governments, promote job creation \nand improve the Nation's economic well-being in general. This motor \nfuel tax increase would go a long way toward meeting this goal. An \nincrease in public investment is long overdue, Mr. President. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 666. A bill to amend chapter 93 of title 31, United States Code, \nto provide additional requirements for a surety corporation to be \napproved by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide for equal access \nto surety bonding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             THE EQUAL SURETY BOND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Equal Surety \nBond Opportunity Act of 1995. This bill is designed to further equal \nopportunity for surety bond applicants and to equip bond applicants--\nparticularly small business applicants--with information to help them \nto strengthen their businesses.\n  Construction firms must have surety bonds to bid on all Federal \nprojects in excess of $25,000 and all federally assisted projects in \nexcess of $100,000. In fact, bonding is now required for most State and \nlocal government construction projects and an increasing number of \nprivate construction projects. Clearly, access to surety bonding is \nessential to the livelihood of the majority of construction companies.\n  Surety bonds ensure that a contractor is capable of completing the \nspecified work and has the financial ability to pay its bills on time. \nIf the bonded contractor fails to complete the project, the surety firm \nsteps in to fulfill the contract.\n  Furthermore, surety firms minimize their own risk by determining, \nbefore they issue a bond, whether the applicant is capable of \ncompleting the particular project in question. The principal source of \nbonds--for-profit corporate surety firms--use undisclosed underwriting \nstandards to make this determination. Essentially, they assess an \napplicant's three C's--cash, capacity to do work, and character. But \nthe personal character of a contractor may be evaluated in a very \nsubjective manner, which can result in discrimination.\n  Although classified as a type of insurance, these bonds are really \nmore like a line of credit. If a surety firm has to step in to fulfill \nthe bonded company's obligation under a contract, it expects to be \nreimbursed. Unfortunately, as with other types of lines of credit such \nas mortgage financing, women and minority contractors face serious \nproblems in obtaining surety bonds. Several studies of mortgage lending \nrates in Detroit, Atlanta, and Washington, DC have revealed a \nsignificant race-related mortgage lending gap even after adjusting the \ndata for legitimate business concerns. These studies were based in part \non data that banks and other lending institutions are required to \nreport to the Federal Government. Federal law does not require surety \nfirms to report any similar data for applications received or granted.\n  I sponsored and held hearings on the Equal Surety Bond Opportunity \nAct in the 102d Congress. Witnesses at that hearing\n included representatives of the Women Construction Owners and \nExecutives and the National Association of Minority Contractors who \ntestified in support of the bill. According to these witnesses, bond \napplicants have been rejected simply for being a woman, or being a \nminority. Clearly, these are unacceptable reasons for rejecting a bond \napplicant.\n\n  The American Subcontractors Association also presented testimony at \nthat hearing. They agreed that women and minority-owned construction \ncompanies face special problems in getting bonds, as do many small and \nemerging construction firms. They noted, however, that all of these \ncompanies would benefit if surety companies were required to give an \nexplanation for rejecting a bond application. This would allow them to \ntake corrective action for future applications.\n  By law, the U.S. Treasury Department maintains a list of federally \napproved surety firms authorized to issue bonds on Federal projects. My \nbill, which is modeled after the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, would \nmake it unlawful for a Treasury-approved surety to discriminate against \napplicants based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nmarital status, or age. Simply put, the bill makes it clear that the \nthree C's cannot be determined by reference to an applicant's race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status.\n  The bill would also require Treasury-approved firms to provide denied \napplicants, upon request, full written disclosure of the reasons for \ntheir denial. A written explanation will give all construction firms \nthe opportunity to take appropriate corrective action--an opportunity \nnow available to all prospective Federal small business contractors \nwhen denied by an agency contracting officer. The written explanation \nwould also help curb denials of bonding based on nonlegitimate reasons.\n  Again, the legislation will benefit all construction firms. It does \nnot dictate underwriting standards for the surety industry. It does not \nrequire sureties to report data on applications received or bonds \nwritten. Nor does it inflict onerous regulations on the industry. But \nit will give businesses the information they need to improve their \nbusinesses. Moreover, the bill will ensure that surety firms comply \nwith the same nondiscrimination laws that apply to banks and other \nlending institutions. If a surety firm is in compliance with these \nlaws, it has nothing to fear from this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this very simple, but \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I believe our \nlegislation provides a balance between protecting the rights of \ndefrauded investors and providing relief to honest companies who may \nfind themselves the target of a frivolous lawsuit.\n  I have serious concerns that in a rush to judgment Congress may err \ntoo far and end up curtailing suits that have merit and thus undermine \nthe American public's confidence in the integrity of our financial \nmarkets. There is no greater harm Congress could do to the capital \nmarkets.\n  The issue of securities litigation reform came to my attention \nseveral years ago when a constituent was defrauded in a real estate \nlimited partnership. On numerous occasions he raised concerns over the \ntime periods individuals had to file securities lawsuits. Little could \nhe have known that \n[[Page S5146]] a short while later the Supreme Court would rule in the \nLampf case that the statute of limitations in a major section of \nsecurities law would be shortened to 1 year after discovery or 3 years \nafter the fraud actually took place--whichever came first.\n  I do not believe the Court felt this was the appropriate amount of \ntime to uncover financial fraud but was all they could provide in a \nstrict interpretation of the statute. To make matters worse, the Court \napplied the shortened time period retroactively, thereby imperiling \nhundreds of legitimate fraud cases--many of which were in the midst of \nyears of litigation.\n  In 1992, we were successful in fixing the retroactive cases by \napplying the statute of limitations that was applicable when the cases \nwere filed. Unfortunately, we were not able to fix the standard \nprospectively.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would help rectify this \nproblem by establishing a statute of limitations of 2 years after \ndiscovering the fraud or 5 years after the fraud took place. I find it \nhard to believe reasonable people could object to such a timetable. Our \nexperience with financial crooks like Charlie Keating have demonstrated \nhow easy it is to conceal financial crimes. You would be hard pressed \nto find anyone who thinks that financial crimes are on the decline. In \nfact, the evidence shows financial crimes are escalating.\n  This legislation is designed to improve private securities litigation \nin a number of ways: eliminating certain abusive litigation practices; \ndeterring and providing sanctions against the filing of meritless \ncases; instituting procedural reforms to screen out weak cases nearly \nin the judicial process and enhancing the detection of financial fraud.\n  These measures are carefully crafted so as not to discourage \nmeritorious suits yet attack several areas of potential abuse. As \nSecurities and Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt recently noted that \n``[p]rivate securities litigation plays a prominent role in checking \nthe market excesses. To change that, we would need to recalibrate our \nentire system checks and balances.''\n  The fundamental purpose of Federal securities laws is to provide \ninvestor protection and thereby foster investor confidence and \nencourage the investment necessary for capital formation, economic \ngrowth and job creation. Our system of private litigation under the \nFederal securities laws has functioned effectively as a necessary and \nessential supplement to the enforcement program of the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  The provisions of this bill should ensure that defrauded investors \ncan recover their damages, that criminals are brought to justice, and \nthat corporations are protected from unwarranted litigation in a system \nthat is quicker, less costly and more fair to all concerned.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to passing legislation that will \ncorrect some of the abuses present in the current securities litigation \nsystem and address the issues raised by Supreme Court rulings in \nlegislation that President Clinton can sign.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 668. A bill to authorize the establishment of the National Capital \nRegion Interstate Transportation Authority, to define the powers and \nduties of the Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\nthe national capital region interstate transportation authority act of \n                                  1995\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to \nestablish the National Capital Region Interstate Transportation \nAuthority.\n  This Authority, representing Virginia, Maryland, and the District of \nColumbia, will serve the region's need to focus attention and to build \na partnership between the Federal Government, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, local \ngovernments, and other interested persons to move forward with a new \nPotomac River crossing on the Capital Beltway at the Woodrow Wilson \nMemorial Bridge.\n  This legislation will establish one entity to devote its full time \nand attention to facilitating the construction of a replacement bridge, \nor bridge and tunnel project, for the aging Woodrow Wilson Memorial \nBridge.\n  Mr. President, State and local governments have long recognized the \nimportance of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the region's economic \nvitality and its critical link to providing efficient interstate travel \nfrom Maine to Florida.\n  The Congress also recognized the needs of this facility and its \nrelationship to the efficient movement of people and commerce in the \nregion during the development of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991. That legislation established the Interstate \nTransportation Study Commission and charged the Commission with the \nresponsibility of recommending ``new mechanisms, authority, and/or \nagreements to fund, develop, and manage the transportation system of \nthe National Capital Region, primarily focusing on the interstate \nhighway and bridge systems.''\n  The 13 members of the Commission extensively examined the existing \ntransportation needs of the National Capital region and concluded that \nthe immediate demand was to focus attention on examining every option \nto provide for a new Potomac River crossing at the Woodrow Wilson \nBridge. To accomplish this, the Commission recommended the creation of \na new interstate authority to assume ownership and responsibilities of \nthe bridge and to move forward with the financing of a new facility as \nrecommended by the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Coordination Committee and \napproved by the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board.\n  The Woodrow Wilson Bridge Coordination Committee is a working \npartnership to identify options for the future of the bridge and to \ndevelop a consensus plan on fixing or replacing the deteriorating \nWoodrow Wilson Bridge. The Coordination Committee is following an open \nparticipatory process to examine alternatives to improve this vital \ncrossing and is scheduled to identify a preferred alternative, complete \nan environmental impact statement and issue a record of decision by \nmid-1996.\n  It is not my intention for the Authority established by this \nlegislation to interfere with or disrupt this valuable ongoing work. \nThe Authority will provide the next critical step in these tight fiscal \ntimes--a financing mechanism--which will provide the means necessary to \nfinance, operate, and maintain a new river crossing.\n  It is important for my colleagues to remember that the Federal \nGovernment constructed the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in 1954 and remains \nresponsible for the needs of the existing facility and the financing, \nplanning, and design work required for a new facility.\n  Today the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge is the only segment of the \n44,000 mile Interstate System that is owned by the Federal Government. \nThe bridge was designed 40 years ago to carry 75,000 vehicles per day, \nwith 10 percent of the traffic consisting of heavy trucks. Today, the \nbridge carries 165,000 vehicles per day, and 11 percent of the volume \nis truck traffic. This facility is the only drawbridge on the regional \ninterstate network, the only piece of the region's eight-lane Capital \nBeltway\n that is limited to six lanes, and the only segment of the Capital \nBeltway with a remaining lifespan of less than 10 years.\n\n  Recent studies by the Federal Highway Administration confirm that \nannual repairs to the existing bridge fail to extend the use life of \nthe facility and are no longer cost effective. Safety experts for the \nFederal Highway Administration advise me that unless a new facility is \nconstructed within the next 9 years, the Department may be required to \nenforce truck size and weight restrictions on this segment of the \nCapital Beltway.\n  Mr. President, the solution is clear. The Woodrow Wilson Bridge, a \ncritical line in the region's transportation network and a vital link \nin our Nation's intermodal transportation system, needs to be rebuilt \nwith the capacity to handle the significant demands being placed upon \nit every day. The National Capital Region Interstate Transportation \nAuthority is the first step in addressing a problem that has gone \nunresolved for far to long.\n  Recent census data reveals that half of all workers in this region \nlive and work in different jurisdictions and one-third live and work in \ndifferent States. \n[[Page S5147]] The National Capital Region Transportation Planning \nBoard forecasts that between 1990 and 2020 the volume of traffic in our \nregion will increase by more than 70 percent, while the current planned \nhighway capacity will expand by only 20 percent. Between now and 2020, \nour traffic volume could triple during the heaviest part of the evening \nrush hour.\n  Traffic congestion translates into wasted productivity and dollars. A \nrecent study by the Texas Transportation Institute found that in 1987 \ntraffic congestion in the Metropolitan Washington area cost each of an \nestimated $570 a year in lost time and wasted fuel. Today, it is \nestimated that our traffic congestion is costing each of us at least \n$1,000 per year. This is a cost both to residents and to the region's \nbusiness community.\n  Because of the gridlock that occurs on our region's roadways during \nthe morning and evening rush hours, our residents are not resistant to \nusing public transit. Indeed, we currently have the highest percentage \nof high-occupancy vehicle [HOV] users in the Nation are tied for second \nplace with Chicago for the highest percentage of mass transit users. \nWhile I fully support expanding public transportation options and \nbuilding upon our HOV road network, these efforts alone will not solve \nour region's problems with inadequate highways and bridges.\n  The National Capital Region Interstate Transportation Authority will \nenhance the ability of the system to meet expanding economic growth and \nhelp our Nation's Capital thrive in the increasingly competitive global \nmarketplace. Almost 85 percent of the Nation's freight travels at least \npart of its journey over a highway. As American companies rely more and \nmore on just-in-time-delivery to get raw materials to manufacturing \nfacilities, and American wholesalers and retailers count on rapid \ndelivery to keep their inventories lean, the economic importance of an \nefficient national transportation infrastructure is actually growing.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of \nColumbia as we advance this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (by request):\n  S. 669. A bill to revise and streamline the acquisition laws of the \nFederal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the \nFederal Acquisition Improvement Act, by request of the administration. \nI am glad to do it, because this bill represents the next step of \nreforming the way Government buys its goods and services.\n  Last year, the Congress passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \nAct, better known as FASA. That was the first major piece of \nprocurement reform legislation in over 10 years. The passage of the act \nconstituted a critical victory in the war against Government \ninefficiency and one of the most significant accomplishments of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee during the 103d Congress.\n  FASA is a comprehensive Governmentwide procurement reform effort \naimed at streamlining the acquisition process by reducing paperwork \nburdens through revision and consolidation of acquisition statutes to \neliminate redundancy, provide consistency and facilitate \nimplementation.\n  The law is the culmination of years of legislative and oversight \neffort led by the Governmental Affairs Committee, in conjunction with \nthe Armed Services and Small Business Committees of both the Senate and \nthe House, to make sense out of the complex process of supplying the \nFederal Government with the goods and services it needs just to \noperate.\n  Figuring significantly also were recommendations of the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review regarding increased reliance on \nacquisitions of commercial items and increased simplified acquisition \nthreshold of $100,000, and other recommendations mirroring those in the \nreport of the advisory panel on streamlining and codifying acquisition \nlaws pursuant to section 800 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1991. That was the so-called 800 panel.\n  Mr. President, this really was a culmination of a number of different \nactivities that came together to pass the legislation last year. We had \nbeen working in the Governmental Affairs Committee on this problem of \nstreamlining acquisition, making it more efficient for all of \nGovernment, not just the armed services.\n  At the same time, the Armed Services Committee, of which I am also a \nmember, asked the Pentagon to do a study of their own procurement \npractices, and that was done with what became known as the 800 panel.\n  Then, when the new administration was elected, the Vice President \nheaded up the National Performance Review. And it, once again, got into \nareas of procurement reform. So we all combined our efforts, and that \nculminated then in passage last year of FASA.\n  That was quite an accomplishment. As if that were not enough, I am \npleased today to be a sponsor of a bill which I hope will mark the \nbeginning of serious Senate efforts in the 104th Congress to make even \nfurther reforms to our procurement system.\n  People in the agencies and industry have already begun to refer to \nthis new set of proposed reforms as FASA 2, but its actual title is the \nFederal Acquisition Improvement Act. I think that is symbolic of what \nthe administration is trying to do. Yes, this is a further streamlining \neffort, but the administration is also trying to improve on and refine \nthe endeavor which began last year with the passage of FASA.\n  I believe this bill is a good starting point for this second round of \nreforms, and we are definitely headed in the right direction for this \nventure.\n  It appears that the administration is trying to finish what it \nstarted last year with FASA, as well as pursuing some bold new \nobjectives with this bill, and I want to commend them personally for \nthat.\n  For instance, one theme in the bill appears to be furthering the work \nbegun in FASA of attempting to bring the Government more in line with \nthe commercial world exemplified by provisions clarifying the \ndefinition of commercial services and shortening the time it takes to \ncomplete a procurement. That is a major item.\n  Consistent with this theme is the desire expressed in this bill to \nfurther streamline the award process, something also begun in FASA. \nSignificant provisions we will be watching in this realm involve the \nlowering of agency approval levels and delegation of authorities for \nusing noncompetitive procedures; limiting competitive range \ndeterminations to as few as the three highest-ranked offerors; and the \nauthorization of two-phase selection procedures for certain information \ntechnology in design-build contracts.\n  The administration has also begun to tackle the controversial, highly \ncharged issue of reform of the protest system by attempting to \nstreamline it and reduce the number of protests filed. Included are \nprovisions on making statutory and consistent the standards of review \nused for development and evaluation of the protest record; preaward \ndebriefings for unsuccessful offerors; and consolidation of the \njudicial protest forum. I will be watching suggestions in this area \nwith particular interest, especially since I know that the proposals in \nthis area do not begin and end with those made in this bill.\n  There are also some very beneficial concepts in this bill related to \nethics; recoupment of fees paid to the U.S. Government on foreign sales \nof military products and technologies developed under Government \ncontracts; FACNET, the newly established electronic commerce system \ncreated under FASA for procurements under the simplified acquisition \nthreshold; and more pilot programs to test out new and different \nconcepts.\n  This list barely scratches the surface, and it is easy to see that \nthe administration is attacking some tough and very diverse issues with \nthis bill. We will be scrutinizing each and every one of these \nprovisions for their wisdom and for their prudence.\n  As I said, at this juncture I may not support every single provision \nof this bill. Most of the proposals I am sure I will support. Others I \nsupport the concept behind but feel the language may need some work and \nwill be glad to do that. There are also ideas in the bill with which I \nmay disagree altogether, \n[[Page S5148]] and I am sure we count on being blessed with new ideas \nas we go along. In general, though, I think we are headed in the right \ndirection with this new bill, and I am very glad to be submitting it on \nbehalf of the administration.\n  The bill is being introduced today and the legislative process can \nbegin to work and we can begin to consider opinions from all interested \nparties on each provision so that we can put forth the best possible \nmeasure for the President's signature. I know that the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, and others, have testified before the House \nGovernment Reform and Oversight Committee offering many valuable \nsuggestions along this line. I look forward to engaging in that process \nagain, as I did last year.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that I believe the \nadministration's bill is a very good place to start working on the next \nround of reforms to streamline our procurement system. We have a \nchallenge ahead of us to flesh out this bill, but I am excited that the \nadministration continues to focus attention in this area.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 670. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe unauthorized inspection of tax returns or tax return information; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this bill is entitled the Taxpayer Browsing \nProtection Act. We have a problem. Criminal penalties and sanctions do \ncurrently apply when IRS employees look at taxpayer returns that they \nare not authorized to do for work purposes and willfully disclose that \ninformation to third parties. However, there is a nebulous loophole for \nwhen IRS employees engage in such browsing for their own curious \ninterests but do not disclose that information to others.\n  The bill that we are submitting here today is based on \nrecommendations by the IRS and the Department of Justice, which began \nlooking at this issue following hearings last year which publicly \ndisclosed this activity. This bill would provide in the Internal \nRevenue Code that unauthorized inspection of returns or return \ninformation is an offense punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, or \nimprisonment of not more than 1-year, or both, together with costs of \nprosecution.\n  If the offense is committed by an officer or employee of the United \nStates, they are immediately fired upon conviction.\n  Third, it will clarify that the unauthorized inspection, as well as \nthe unauthorized disclosure, of returns or return information is a \nviolation of the code's confidentiality provisions for returns and \nreturn information.\n  Mr. President, this bill addresses something that came out in our \nhearings last year where we found that some employees were just \nbrowsing through accounts on which they were not doing work. They were \njust curious about what was in the accounts. We had some that actually \ngot into accounts and changed some of the figures in there and received \nkickbacks for what they were doing. Some of those people are already in \njail now. So that area is covered.\n  We want to tighten this up, and the IRS very much favors this. \nCommissioner Margaret Richardson said this morning at our hearing that \nshe does favor this, and we worked with her on this. She feels it \ncovers a loophole in the legislation that needs to be covered. I am \nglad to submit it and help close that loophole so that we will make it \nabsolutely unequivocally illegal for IRS employees to be browsing \nthrough other people's accounts, whether for voyeuristic reasons, or \njust plain curiosity, or whatever the motives are. But people should \nexpect that when they file their tax returns and that information is in \nthe internal revenue system, those returns are confidential and will be \nworked on only by people that are dealing with business matters on \ntheir accounts and nothing more. That is what this legislation does. I \nhope we can have support on it after it has been through the committee \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am very proud that I was here at the \nmoment when Senator Glenn was introducing his two proposals, especially \nthe proposal on browsing by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  It has been my pleasure to have served as the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee's Committee on Oversight of the Internal Revenue Service for \na period of years. During that period of time, I might say that the \ncommittee in the House and the Senate, in their wisdom, did in fact \nadopt the 1988 Taxpayers Bill of Rights. The Taxpayer's Bill of Rights \nwas the very first piece of legislation ever in the history of this \nRepublic, or in the history of the Internal Revenue Service, to spell \nout the specific powers of the individual taxpayer.\n  We have now introduced something we call T-2, Mr. President, which is \nthe taxpayers Bill of Rights II.\n  This legislation goes even several steps further in the protection of \nthe rights afforded to the individual taxpayer in this country.\n  Senator Glenn's proposal is an answer to, and is a direct result of, \ntestimony which was unearthed and information which has been gathered \nby Senator Glenn's committee, his very competent staff, on the issues \nand the alarming fact that, in the past--and maybe even in the \npresent--certain overzealous Internal Revenue Service employees have \ntaken the liberty to abuse the system by looking at individual taxpayer \nrecords and accounts and sharing those facts with other individuals. I \nthink what Senator Glenn is doing today is a true service. I stand \nbehind him all the way, and I hope that the Senator will put me down as \nan original cosponsor.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will be glad to do so. If the Senator will yield for a \nmoment, Mr. President. To put this in a broader context, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Pryor, is the one who on our Governmental \nAffairs Committee took the lead in putting together the Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights. It has served us well and the taxpayers of this country \nshould be glad for what he did. I am sure they are, whether they \nrealize they are in his debt or not. What I have done here is expand a \nlittle on his efforts. To put it in an even larger context, we are \ncoming into a time with the information age, the information flow, time \nperiod in history that replaces the agriculture revolution, the \nindustrial revolution. Now we are into the information revolution. \nAlong with that is going the computerization of all of the taxpayer \nrecords that formerly were all in on a piece of paper in the file. They \nwere not as accessible as they are now to computers and hackers and \nother people.\n  One of our biggest problems in keeping confidentiality is making sure \nthat as we move into the taxpayer system modernization program, the TSM \nProgram, a very expensive modernization program--and it will be another \n3 or 4 years before completion--that will completely modernize the IRS. \nWe need protections like this and like the protections the Senator from \nArkansas put the initiative on in putting it together. So he is to be \ncomplimented for his efforts in times past on this. As he said, he has \nT-2, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, which is being prepared.\n  This bill I put in today is one that covers one loophole that we had \ndiscerned was there and which the IRS agreed we should close, and we \nare glad the Senator from Arkansas is a cosponsor because he did a lot \nof the original work and deserves a lot of the credit for it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 671. A bill to provide a fair and balanced resolution to the \nproblem of multiple imposition of punitive damages, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the multiple punitive damages fairness act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which \nwill at last deal with one aspect of one of the most serious problems \nfacing our civil justice system today--out of control punitive damage \nawards.\n  Punitive damages constitute punishment and an effort to deter future \negregious misconduct. Punitive damages are not awarded to make whole \nthe victim of wrongdoing. Punitive damages reform is not about \nshielding wrongdoers from liability, nor does such reform prevent \nvictims of wrongdoing \n[[Page S5149]] from being rightfully compensated for their damages.\n  Safeguards are needed to protect against abuse in the award of \npunitive damages. In a 1994 opinion authored by Justice Stevens, the \nSupreme Court noted, ``Punitive damages pose an acute danger of \narbitrary deprivation of property.'' [Honda Motor Co. v. Oberq, 114 S. \nCt. 2331, 2340]\n  One particular problem is multiple awards of punitive damages. While \nI do not argue that a person or company that acts maliciously should \nnot be subject to punitive damages, it is neither just nor fair for the \nrepeated imposition of punitive damages in several States for the same \nact or conduct, as our system currently permits. Moreover, exorbitant \nand out-of-control punitive damage awards have the effect of punishing \ninnocent people as well: employees, other consumers and shareholders.\n  This is not a hypothetical problem. This past September, for example, \na State court let stand a multimillion dollar punitive damage award \nagainst an automobile distributor who failed to inform a buyer that his \nnew vehicle had been refinished to cure superficial paint damage.\n  The victim, a purchaser of a $40,000 BMW automobile, learned 9 months \nafter his purchase that his vehicle might have been partially \nrefinished. As a result of the discovery, he sued the automobile \ndealer, the North American distributor, and the manufacturer, for fraud \nand breach of contract. He also sought an award for punitive damages. \nHe won and hit the jackpot.\n  At trial, the jury was allowed to assess damages for each of the \npartially refinished vehicles that had been sold throughout the United \nStates over a period of 10 years. As sought by the plaintiff's \nattorney, the jury returned a verdict of $4,000 in compensatory damages \nand $4 million in punitive damages.\n  On appeal to the State supreme court, the punitive damage award was \nreduced to $2 million, applicable to the North American distributor. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has accepted this case for review of the \nconstitutionality of the $2 million punitive damage award.\n  I should note that this same defendant can be sued again and again \nfor punitive damages by every owner of a partially refinished vehicle. \nIn fact, according to defense counsel, the same plaintiff's attorney \nhas filed 24 other similar lawsuits.\n  Defendant and consumers are not the only ones hurt by excessive, \nmultiple punitive damage awards. Ironically, other victims can be those \nthe system supposedly is intended to benefit, the injured parties \nthemselves. Funds that might otherwise be available to compensate later \nvictims can be wiped out at any early stage by excessive punitive \ndamage awards.\n  The imposition of multiple punitive damage awards in different States \nfor the same act is an issue that can only be addressed through Federal \nlegislation. If only one State limits such awards, other States still \nremain free to impose multiple punitive damages. Accordingly, a Federal \nresponse is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senators will join me in supporting this \ninitiative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 672. A bill to provide a fair and balanced resolution to the \nproblem of multiple imposition of punitive damages, and for the reform \nof the civil justice system; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the civil justice fairness act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the few things on which most \nAmericans can agree today is the need for reform of our civil justice \nsystem. In plain English, which is itself something too often absent \nfrom our courthouses and law offices, America's civil justice system \nhas gotten out of control.\n  In too many cases, the system fails to deliver justice to the \nparties. For most Americans, rich or poor, private citizen, small \nbusiness person, or major corporation, the prospect of going to court, \nregardless of the merits of the case, is about as welcome as root canal \nwork or an IRS audit.\n  The litany of problems is no secret; they include excessive legal \nfees and costs, dilatory and sometimes abusive litigation practices, \nthe increasing use of junk science as evidence, a veritable tidal wave \nof frivolous lawsuits by prison inmates, and a risk of unduly large \npunitive damage awards.\n  The problems with our current civil justice system have resulted in \nseveral perverse effects. First, all too often the system fails to \naccomplish its most important function--to compensate adequately \ndeserving plaintiffs. Second, it imposes unnecessarily high litigation \ncosts on all parties--costs that are passed along to consumers, to each \nand every American, in the form of higher prices for products and \nservices we buy--costs that ultimately harm our Nation's business \ncompetitiveness in the increasingly global economy.\n  It's time Congress faced up to the problem and enacted meaningful \nlegislation reforming our civil justice system, to eliminate its abuses \nand procedural problems and to restore to the American people a civil \njustice system deserving of their trust, confidence, and support. To \nachieve this goal, I am today introducing the Civil Justice Fairness \nAct, along with Senators McConnell and Thomas.\n  I would like to review the major provisions of this legislation and \nto explain how they would correct some of the more serious problems in \nour present civil justice system.\n  This legislation would address the problem of multiple punitive \ndamage awards. We all know that punitive damage awards are out of \ncontrol in this country. The imposition of multiple punitive damages \nfor the same wrongful act in particular, raises great concern about the \nfairness of punitive damages and their ability to serve the purposes of \npunishment and deterrence for which they are intended.\n  This past September, for example, a State court let stand a multi-\nmillion-dollar punitive damage award against an automobile\n distributor who failed to inform a buyer that his new vehicle had been \nrefinished to cure superficial paint damage. The jury was allowed to \nassess damages for each of the nearly 1,000 other vehicles that had \nbeen sold throughout the United States.\n\n  Conceivably, the company can still be sued for punitive damages in \nevery other State where it sold one of its vehicles for the same act.\n  Moreover, multiple punitive damage awards can hurt injured parties. \nFunds that would otherwise be available to compensate later victims can \nbe wiped out at any early stage by excessive punitive damage awards. A \nFederal response is critical: if only one State limits such awards, \nother States still remain free to impose multiple punitive damages. \nAccordingly, my bill limits these multiple punitive damage awards.\n  My legislation also addresses abuses of punitive damages litigation. \nIt includes a heightened standard of proof to ensure that punitive \ndamages are awarded only if there is clear and convincing evidence that \nthe harm suffered was the result of conduct either specifically \nintended to cause that harm, or carried out with conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights or the safety of the claimant.\n  This bill also provides that punitive damages may not be awarded \nagainst the seller of a drug or medical device that received pre-market \napproval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Additionally, this legislation would allow a bifurcated trial, at the \ndefendant's request, on the issue of punitive damages and limits the \namount of the award to either $250,000 or three times the economic \ndamages suffered by the claimant, whichever is greater.\n  This legislation would also limit a defendant's joint liability for \nnoneconomic damages. In any civil case for personal injury, wrongful \ndeath, or based upon the principles of comparative fault, a defendant's \nliability for non-economic loss shall be severable only and shall not \nbe joint. The trier of fact will determine the proportional liability \nof each person, whether or not a party to the action, and enter \nseparate judgments against each defendant.\n  Another provision of this bill would shift costs and attorneys fees \nin circumstances in which a party has rejected a settlement offer, \nforcing the litigation to proceed, and then obtained a less favorable \njudgment. This provision encourages parties to act reasonably, rather \nthan pursue lengthy and costly litigation. It allows a plaintiff or a \ndefendant to be compensated \n[[Page S5150]] for their reasonable attorneys fees and costs from the \npoint the other party rejects a reasonable settlement offer.\n  Another reform included in this legislation is a provision aimed at \nabusive litigation practices. This bill restores earlier provisions of \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to make sanctions for \nabusive litigation practices mandatory, and to require attorneys to \nmake reasonable inquiries into the factual allegations before they file \na pleading in court. This bill also eliminates the so-called safe \nharbor rule that allows an offending party to withdraw his offending \npleading and clarifies that sanctions would also serve to compensate a \nprevailing party under rule 11.\n  Another problem in our civil justice system that has been widely \nreported is abuse in contingency fee cases. This bill encourages \nattorneys to disclose fully to clients the hours worked and fees paid \nin all contingency fee cases. The bill calls upon the Attorney General \nto draft model State legislation requiring such disclosure to clients. \nIt also requires the Attorney General to study possible abuses in the \narea of contingency fees and, where such abuses are found, to draft \nmodel State legislation specifically addressing those problems.\n  This legislation restricts the use of so-called ``junk science'' in \nthe courtroom. This long overdue reform will improve the reliability of \nexpert scientific evidence and permit juries\n to consider only scientific evidence that is objectively reliable.\n\n  This legislation also includes a provision for health care liability \nreform. It limits, in any health care liability action, the maximum \namount of noneconomic damages that may be awarded to a claimant to \n$250,000. This limit would apply regardless of the number of parties \nagainst whom the action is brought, and regardless of the number of \nclaims or actions brought. To avoid prejudice to any parties, the jury \nwould not be informed about the limitations on noneconomic damages.\n  This legislation would also establish a reasonable, uniform statute \nof limitations for the bringing of health care liability actions.\n  Further, if damages for losses incurred after the date of judgment \nexceed $100,000, the court shall allow the parties to have 60 days in \nwhich to negotiate an agreement providing for the payment of such \ndamages in a lump sum, periodic payments, or a combination of both. If \nno agreement is reached, a defendant may elect to pay the damages on a \nperiodic basis. Periodic payments for future damages would terminate in \nthe event of the claimant's return to work, or upon the claimant's \ndeath. There is an exception for the portion of such payments allocable \nto future earnings, which shall be paid to any individual to whom the \nclaimant owed a duty of support immediately prior to death, to the \nextent required by law at the time of the claimant's death.\n  This legislation also allows States the freedom to experiment with \nalternative patient compensation systems based upon no-fault \nprinciples. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would award \ngrants based on applications by interested States according to \nenumerated criteria and subject to enumerated reporting requirements. \nPersons or entities participating in such experimental systems may \nobtain from the Secretary a waiver from the provisions of this \nlegislation for the duration of the experiment. The Secretary would \ncollect information regarding these experiments and submit an annual \nreport to Congress, including an assessment of the feasibility of \nimplementing no-fault systems, and legislative recommendations, if any.\n  Our court system, at both the Federal and State level, is facing an \never-mounting tide of lawsuits, many totally frivolous, filed by prison \ninmates. This bill improves the ability of our courts to dismiss \nnonmeritorious in forma pauperis claims and requires the exhaustion of \navailable administrative remedies in prisoner civil rights cases before \na lawsuit is filed in court. Also, the bill requires that inmates bear \nat least some of the cost of initiating litigation, by enabling the \ncourts to require the payment of at least a partial fee, or the payment \nof court fees in installments where the inmate cannot afford the entire \nfee.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a section-by-section \ndescription of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at these problems within \nour civil justice system. I believe this bill addresses these issues in \na common sense way, and I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n    Section-by-Section Description of the Civil Justice Fairness Act\n\n\n                    title i--punitive damages reform\n\n       Sec. 101: Definitions. This section defines various terms \n     and phrases used in Title I of the bill.\n       Sec. 102: Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness. This section \n     generally prohibits the award of multiple punitive damages. \n     With one exception, it prevents courts from awarding punitive \n     damages based on the same act or course of conduct for which \n     punitive damages have already been awarded against the same \n     defendant. Under the exception, an additional award of \n     punitive damages may be permitted if the court determines in \n     a pretrial hearing that the claimant will offer new and \n     substantial evidence of previously undiscovered, additional \n     wrongful behavior on the part of the defendant, other than \n     injury to the claimant. In those circumstances, the court \n     must make specific findings of fact to support the award, \n     must reduce the amount of punitive damages awarded by the \n     amounts of prior punitive damages based on the same acts, and \n     may not disclose to the jury the court's determination and \n     action under the section. This section would not apply to any \n     action brought under a federal or state statute that \n     specifically mandates the amount of punitive damages to be \n     awarded.\n       Sec. 103: Uniform Standards for Award of Punitive Damages. \n     This section sets the following uniform standards for the \n     award of punitive damages in any State or Federal Court \n     action: (1) In general, punitive damages may be awarded only \n     if the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the conduct causing the harm was either specifically \n     intended to cause harm or carried out with conscious, \n     flagrant indifference to the rights or the safety of other \n     persons. (2) Punitive damages may not be awarded in the \n     absence of an award of compensatory damages exceeding nominal \n     damages. (3) Punitive damages may not be awarded against a \n     manufacturer or product seller of a drug or medical device \n     which was the subject of pre-market approval by the food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA). This FDA exemption is not \n     applicable where a party has withheld or misrepresented \n     relevant information to the FDA. (4) Punitive damages may not \n     be pleaded in a complaint. Instead, a party must establish at \n     a pre-trial hearing that it has a reasonable likelihood of\n      proving facts at trial sufficient to support an award of \n     punitive damages, and may then amend the pleading to \n     include a prayer for relief seeking punitive damages. (5) \n     At the defendant's request, the trier of fact shall \n     consider in separate proceedings whether punitive damages \n     are warranted and, if so, the amount of such damages. If a \n     defendant requests bifurcated proceedings, evidence \n     relevant only to the claim for punitive damages may not be \n     introduced in the proceeding on compensatory damages. \n     Evidence of the defendant's profits from his misconduct, \n     if any, is admissible, but evidence of the defendant's \n     overall wealth is inadmissible in the proceeding on \n     punitive damages. (6) In any civil action where the \n     plaintiff seeks punitive damages under this title, the \n     amount awarded shall not exceed three times the economic \n     damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. This provision \n     shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed \n     to the jury. (7) This section applies to all civil actions \n     in which a trial has not commenced before the effective \n     date of this Act.\n       Sec. 104: Effect on Other Law. This section specifies that \n     certain state and federal laws are not superseded or affected \n     by this legislation. Choice-of-law and forum nonconveniens \n     rules are similarly unaffected.\n\n\n                      title ii--several liability\n\n       Sec. 201: Several Liability for Noneconomic Loss. This \n     section limits a defendant's joint liability for non-economic \n     damages. In any civil action for personal injury, wrongful \n     death, or based upon principles of comparative fault, a \n     defendant's liability for noneconomic loss shall be several \n     only and shall not be joint. The trier of fact will determine \n     the proportional liability of each person, whether or not \n     such person is a party to the action, and enter separate \n     judgments against each defendant.\n\n\n                   title iii--civil procedural reform\n\n       Sec. 301: Sanctions for Abusive Litigation Practices. This \n     section restores key provisions to Federal Rule of Civil \n     Procedure 11. It requires a party to conduct a reasonable \n     pre-filling inquiry into allegations and factual assertions \n     contained in a pleading or motion, and makes the issuance of \n     sanctions for frivolous or abusive tactics mandatory rather \n     than permissive. It also gives the courts wider latitude to \n     impose sanctions on attorneys for filing abusive pleadings by \n     eliminating the so-called ``safe harbor'' rule. The safe \n     harbor rule allows a party moved \n     [[Page S5151]] against to withdraw the offending pleading \n     within 21 days of a Rule 11 motion--an indulgent free bite at \n     the apple. The section also clarifies that the purpose of \n     sanctions is to deter repetition of abusive litigation \n     practices and to compensate a party injured by the conduct.\n       Sec. 302: Trial Lawyer Accountability. This section \n     contains two major provisions. The first provides that it is \n     the sense of the Congress that each State should require \n     attorneys who enter into contingent fee agreements to \n     disclose to their clients the actual services performed and \n     hours expended in connection with such agreements. The second \n     provision directs the Attorney General to study and evaluate \n     contingent fee awards and their abuses in State and Federal \n     court; to develop model legislation to require attorneys who \n     enter into contingency fee agreements to disclose to clients \n     the actual services performed and hours expended, and to curb \n     abuses in contingency fee awards based on the study; and to \n     report the Attorney General's findings and recommendations to \n     Congress within one year of enactment.\n       Sec. 303: Honesty in Evidence. This section amends Federal \n     Rule of Evidence 702 to reform the rules regarding the use of \n     expert testimony. It clarifies that courts retain substantial \n     discretion to determine whether the testimony of an expert \n     witness that is premised on scientific, technical, or medical \n     knowledge is based on scientifically valid reasoning, is \n     sufficiently reliable, and is sufficiently established to \n     have gained general acceptance in the particular field in \n     which it belongs. The section codifies the standard for \n     admissibility of expert testimony enunciated in Daubert v. \n     Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993). It \n     also restores the common law Frye rule that requires that \n     scientific evidence have ``general acceptance'' in the \n     relevant scientific community to be admissible. This section \n     further clarifies that expert witnesses have expertise in the \n     particular field on which they are testifying. Finally, this \n     section mandates that the testimony of an expert retained on \n     a contingency fee basis is inadmissible.\n       Sec. 304: Fair Shifting of Costs and Reasonable Attorney \n     Fees. This section modifies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n     68 to allow either party, not just the defendant, to make a \n     written offer of settlement or to allow a\n      judgment to be entered against the offering party. It \n     expands the time period during which an offer can be made \n     from 10 days before trial to any time during the \n     litigation. If within 21 days the offer is accepted, a \n     judgment may be entered by the court. If, however, a final \n     judgment is not more favorable to an offeree than the \n     offer, the offeree must pay attorney fees and costs \n     incurred after the time expired for acceptance of the \n     offer. Thus, this is not a true ``loser pays'' provision \n     where a loser pays the winner's attorney's fees, but \n     rather a narrower attorney fee- and cost-shifting idea \n     applicable only when a party has made an offer of \n     settlement or judgment. This section also significantly \n     expands the definition of recoverable costs. Currently, \n     costs are narrowly defined and do not create enough of a \n     financial incentive for a party to make an offer that \n     allows judgment to be entered. Finally, this section also \n     allows a party to make an offer of judgment after \n     liability has already been determined but before the \n     amount or extent has been adjudged.\n\n\n                 title iv--health care liability reform\n\n       Sec. 401: Limitations on Noneconomic Damages. In any health \n     care liability action the maximum amount of noneconomic \n     damages that may be awarded to a claimant is $250,000. This \n     limit shall apply regardless of the number of parties against \n     whom the action is brought, and regardless of the number of \n     claims or actions brought. The jury shall not be informed \n     about the limitations on noneconomic damages.\n       Sec. 402: Uniform Statute of Limitations. This section \n     provides a reasonable uniform statute of limitations for \n     health care liability actions, with one exception for minors. \n     The general rule is that an action must be brought within two \n     years from the date the injury and its cause was or \n     reasonably should have been discovered, but in no event can \n     an action be brought more than six years after the alleged \n     date of injury. This section also allows an exception for \n     young children. The rule for children under six years of age \n     is that an action must be brought within two years from the \n     date the injury and its cause was or reasonably should have \n     been discovered, but in no event can an action be brought \n     more than six years after the alleged date of injury or the \n     date on which the child attains 12 years of age, whichever is \n     later.\n       Sec. 403: Periodic Payment of Future Damages. This section \n     allows for the periodic payment of large awards for losses \n     accruing in the future. If damages for losses incurred after \n     the date of judgment exceed $100,000, the court shall allow \n     the parties to have 60 days in which to negotiate an \n     agreement providing for the payment of such damages in a lump \n     sum, periodic installments, or a combination of both. If no \n     agreement is reached within those 60 days, a defendant may \n     elect to pay the damages on a periodic basis. The court will \n     determine the amount and periods for such payments, reducing \n     amounts to present value for purposes of determining the \n     funding obligations of the individual making the payments. \n     Periodic payments for future damages terminate in the event \n     of the claimant's recovery or return to work; or upon the \n     claimant's death, except for the portion of the payments \n     allocable to future earnings which shall be paid to any \n     individual to whom the claimant owed a duty of support \n     immediately prior to death to the extent required by law at \n     the time of death. Such payments shall expire upon the death \n     of the last person to whom a duty of support is owed or the \n     expiration of the obligation pursuant to the judgment for \n     periodic payments.\n       Sec. 404: Non-Fault Based Patient Compensation System \n     Demonstration Project. This section allows states to \n     experiment with alternative patient compensation systems \n     based upon no-fault principles. Grants shall be awarded by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services based on \n     applications made by interested states according to \n     enumerated criteria and subject to enumerated reporting \n     requirements. Persons or entities involved in the \n     demonstrations involved may obtain a waiver from the \n     Secretary from the provisions of this Title for the duration \n     of the experiment, which shall be not greater than five \n     years. The Secretary shall collect information regarding \n     these experiments and submit an annual report to Congress \n     including an assessment of the feasibility of implementing \n     no-fault systems and legislative recommendations, if any.\n       Sec. 405: Definitions. This section defines various terms \n     and phrases used in Title IV of the bill.\n\n\n        title V--Control of abusive prisoner litigation tactics\n\n       Sec. 501: Reform of In Forma Pauperis Determinations. This \n     section reforms in forma pauperis determinations by \n     permitting courts to require a prisoner to make either \n     partial payment of fees or the payment of fees in\n      installments where the court determines that a prisoner is \n     unable to pay the total fees. This section also requires \n     that, where a prisoner files an in forma pauperis \n     affidavit, the prisoner must also file (1) an affidavit \n     listing the prisoner's assets, and (2) a statement, signed \n     by prison officials, specifying the prisoner's income and \n     assets during the preceding year.\n       Sec. 502: Improving Courts' Abilities to Dismiss \n     Nonmeritorious Claims. This section improves courts' \n     abilities to dismiss nonmeritorious in forma pauperis claims \n     by permitting courts to dismiss such claims at any time where \n     the allegation of poverty is untrue, where those claims are \n     frivolous or malicious, where the complaint fails to state a \n     claim on which relief can be granted, or where the claim is \n     insubstantial in that the plaintiff suffered no injury or an \n     insubstantial injury.\n       Sec. 503: Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies in Prisoner \n     Litigation. This section amends Section 7 of the Civil Rights \n     of Institutionalized Persons Act to require the exhaustion of \n     available administrative remedies where a prisoner files a \n     lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. It also makes minor \n     changes in the assessment of whether administrative remedies \n     are adequate, to grant greater flexibility to the Attorney \n     General. Currently, courts are required to continue a case \n     for no longer than 90 days to allow a prisoner to exhaust his \n     administrative remedies. Prisoners often merely wait out the \n     time period and make no effort to pursue an administrative \n     remedy. Thus, this section requires exhaustion of a \n     prisoner's plain, speedy, and effective administrative \n     remedy.\n\n\n                   title vi--miscellaneous provisions\n\n       Sec. 601: Federal Cause of Action Precluded. This section \n     provides that the bill does not provide any new basis for \n     federal court jurisdiction. The resolution of punitive \n     damages claims is left to state courts or to federal courts \n     that currently have jurisdiction over those claims.\n       Sec. 602: Effective Date. Except as otherwise provided, \n     this section provides that this Act shall be effective 30 \n     days after the date of its enactment and shall apply to all \n     civil actions commenced on or after that date, including \n     actions in which the harm occurred before the effective date \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 673. A bill to establish a youth development grant program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n        the youth development community block grant act of 1995\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I introduce the Youth \nDevelopment Community Block Grant Act of 1995 on behalf of myself, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens. The purpose of this \ninitiative is to reallocate existing Federal funding for preventive \nyouth program into a more effective and cohesive network of community-\nbased youth development services for 6- to 18-year-olds.\n  The United States has concentrated most of its efforts on behalf of \nyouth on specific problems that have captured the attention of the \nAmerican public. This well-intentioned response has had two major \nresults: First, the creation of a maze of narrowly defined categorical \nprograms to address the \n[[Page S5152]] specific needs of a particular population; and second, a \nlack of local flexibility in determining how best to respond to the \nneeds of youth in the community. These two factors, combined with our \nconcern about the increasing vulnerability of the American family, have \nlead to the development of the Youth Development Community Block Grant \nAct.\n  The central goal of the youth development community block grant \n[YDCBG] is to promote and support positive youth development. The bill \nwill fund services focused on prevention--programs that help children \nand youth develop the values and life skills they need to succeed. It \nreflects the belief of leaders in the field of youth development, \nincluding the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development and the Center \nfor Youth Development and Policy Research, that youth programs should \naddress the social, moral, emotional, and physical development of \nyouth, in addition to their ability to think and reason.\n  Likewise, the legislation reflects the strong consensus among these \nexperts that youth development services should focus on the needs of \nyouth in general, rather than segregate them into various categories of \nrisk. It also emphasizes the use of participatory, hands-on-techniques \nwhich have been shown to be effective in getting youth involved and \ninterested in learning critical life skills.\n  Rather than wait until young people are in crisis, this legislation \nwill fund preventive services. Rather than forcing service providers to \ndefine the needs of a youth to conform to the labyrinth of rules and \nregulations of a categorical program, they can identify the youth's \nneeds based on what is actually needed. The youth development community \nblock grant represents a comprehensive, coordinated approach to youth \nand to funding community-based services.\n  The YDCBG incorporates many of the principles which policymakers and \nservice providers have identified as necessary for effective Federal \nsupport for community-based human services--local control, flexibility, \ncoordination, and accountability.\n  Most existing youth development programs are provided not by \ngovernment agencies but by community-based organizations. The youth \ndevelopment community block grant builds on the strength, credibility, \nand expertise of existing community-based resources.\n  There is a broad and growing consensus among youth policy experts \nabout the importance of increased investment in positive youth \ndevelopment programs. For example, in major studies, both the Chaplin \nHall Center for Children at the University of Chicago and the Carnegie \nCouncil have concluded that, if youth are to succeed, there must be a \nwell-developed infrastructure of youth development services in their \ncommunities. Provisions in the legislation concentrate on improving the \nquality of community-based youth development programs and improving the \ncapacity of communities to design and deliver successful services for \nour youth.\n  The YDCBG was developed in conjunction with the National \nCollaboration for Youth, a 15-member coalition of major youth-serving \norganizations. These organizations collectively provide direct services \nto over 25 million children and youth each year.\n  Members of the National Collaboration for Youth endorsing the Youth \nDevelopment Community Block Grant Act include: the American Red Cross, \nAssociation of Junior Leagues International, Big Brothers/Big Sisters \nof America, Boy Scouts of America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, \nCamp Fire Boys and Girls, Child Welfare League of America, 4-H-\nExtension Service, Girl Scouts of the USA, Girls Inc., National Network \nof Runaway and Youth Services, The Salvation Army, WAVE Inc., YMCA of \nthe USA, and YWCA of the USA.\n  While these and other community-based youth organizations are \nproviding important services to millions of youth, millions more go \nunserved or underserved. It is critical that the existing Federal \ndollars allocated for youth prevention be used in the most effective \nand efficient way--to build a cohesive network of locally driven \nservices and programs.\n  The legislation authorizes the youth development community block \ngrant for 3 years at $2 billion per year. This authorization level \nrepresents a 10-percent savings over current Federal spending for the \nvarious programs consolidated under the YDCBG, the sum of the fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations for existing programs combined with the \nestimated appropriations level for crime bill programs aimed at youth \nprevention, less 10 percent.\n  I hope other Members of the Senate join with us as cosponsors of the \nYouth Development Community Block Grant Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n            Summary--Youth Development Community Block Grant\n\n       The Youth Development Community Block Grant (YDCBG) is an \n     effort to reallocate existing federal funding for preventive \n     youth programs into a more effective and efficient response \n     to the needs of young people, aged 6-18. The goal of youth \n     development programs is helping children and youth learn the \n     life skills which they need to succeed. This legislation \n     establishes a community driven, coordinated network of \n     positive youth development to accomplish this goal.\n       In short, the youth development community block grant:\n       Is community-based and flexible, with program \n     accountability\n       Invests money in prevention rather than crisis intervention\n       Transforms current categorical programs into a cohesive \n     network\n       Can serve as a catalyst in building stronger communities to \n     support children and their families\n\n\n        features of the youth development community block grant\n\n     Community control of local programs\n       This legislation supports the idea that the best place to \n     design and implement youth programs is within the community. \n     When created within the context of the community and by a \n     partnership of community members, the programs can draw upon \n     the strengths of existing resources and address the specific \n     needs of the youth living there.\n       All YDCBG-funded programs must address community youth \n     development priorities as defined by the Local Board; \n     recognize the role of the family in youth development; \n     involve parents, youth, and community leaders in the program; \n     coordinate services with other programs in the community; and \n     establish process and outcome objectives responding to local \n     needs.\n     Focus on prevention rather than crisis intervention\n       The second part of the equation is that it is important to \n     redirect resources to prevention activities. Most government \n     funds are focused on solving problems rather than preventing \n     problems from occurring. There are a variety of activities \n     which help youth develop their social, emotion, and physical \n     abilities, along with their ability to think and reason. \n     These activities can involve mentoring, sports and \n     recreation, peer counseling, youth clubs, leadership \n     development, educationally based youth employment, and a \n     variety of other non-academic pursuits. youth development \n     programs provide youth with hands on, active way to learn \n     life skills which will help them make a successful transition \n     from childhood to adulthood.\n       In addition, because these activities are not focused on \n     correcting a specific problem, but on providing basic life \n     skills, the programs do not need to be restricted to ``high \n     risk'' youth or a special target population. Local \n     communities and youth development agencies may choose to \n     focus the activities on a special group of children and \n     youth, such as low-income or at risk youth, in response to a \n     particular need of the community.\n     Funds go Directly to Communities\n       Nearly 95% of the YDCBG funds are funneled directly to \n     local communities; states serve as a pass through and \n     monitoring mechanism. Through a planning and priority setting \n     process, local communities determine the types of activities \n     which will be funded and who will provide those services. \n     Program accountability is demonstrated by measuring the \n     community's progress in meeting goals set in the planning and \n     priority setting process. This provides communities broad \n     flexibility to define local priorities and support local \n     initiatives, while at the same time encouraging community \n     partnerships comprehensive planning, and service integration.\n     Existing funds are consolidated into a cohesive strategy\n       Funding for the YDCBG is drawn from existing federal youth \n     prevention programs. The majority of existing youth \n     development and prevention programs are funded through \n     categorical grants awarded on a discretionary basis by the \n     federal agency administering the initiative. These \n     categorical programs are designed to respond to an identified \n     problem such as substance abuse or teen pregnancy. The YDCBG \n     recognizes that those problems are symptoms not only of youth \n     but of an ineffective service delivery system--and that the \n     new funding structure \n     [[Page S5153]] must transform the current potpourri of \n     narrowly defined categorical programs into a cohesive \n     community based strategy for youth. Current budget \n     constraints demand that existing federal funds be more \n     efficiently administered and more effectively used.\n       Although the legislation includes the repeal of several \n     federal initiatives, a ``grandfather'' clause in the bill \n     permits communities to continue funding for any local program \n     currently receiving funding from the repealed programs. While \n     the federal administration and legislation will be \n     terminated, the programs themselves can continue to operate \n     at the community level--where the service is delivered.\n     Funds will be allocated based on a formula, rather then good \n         grantwriting skills\n       The majority of programs consolidated within the YDCBG are \n     currently distributed through the discretionary grant \n     process. Distribution among states and communities varies \n     widely and is determined, in large part, by the grantwriting \n     skills of the grantees. Through a formula based allocation of \n     YDCBG funds, every county will receive some level of funding \n     for youth development activities. This allocation formula \n     gives equal weight to the size of the youth population aged \n     6-18, the proportion of the youth population living below the \n     poverty line, and increases in the rate of serious juvenile \n     crime. A small state minimum and set aside for Native \n     American populations is included in the legislation.\n     Administrative structures are streamlined\n       The primary administrative structure of the YDCBG is the \n     Local Board. This Board, appointed jointly by the Chief \n     Executive Officer of the County and a representative of the \n     local youth development community, is responsible for setting \n     the goals, determining strategies for achieving those goals, \n     and distributing funds for youth development services in the \n     community. The state serves as a pass through for \n     distributing funds to counties based on the federal \n     allocation formula. In addition, the state is responsible for \n     basic monitoring, reporting and technical assistance \n     functions to assist the counties implementation of the act. \n     The federal role in the YDCBG consists of program oversight \n     as well as state and local capacity building through \n     technical assistance, and research-based demonstration \n     projects.\n       Provisions in the bill promote the use of existing \n     administrative structures on the federal, state, and local \n     levels. Multi-county and other partnership efforts are \n     encouraged.\n     Sources for federal funding of the YDCBG\n       Department of Health and Human Services:\n       Youth Gang Prevention Program.\n       National Youth Sports Program.\n       Demonstration Partnership Program.\n       Community Coalition Demonstration Projects to Support HHS \n     Needs for Minority Males.\n       Demonstration Grants for the Prevention of Alcohol and \n     Other Drug Abuse among High Risk Youth.\n       Drug Abuse Prevention for Runaway and Homeless Youth.\n       Drug Abuse Prevention and Education Relating to Youth \n     Gangs.\n       Department of Labor: Summer Youth Employment and Training \n     Program.\n       Department of Education:\n       School Drop-Out Demonstration Assistance.\n       Drug Free and Safe Schools and Communities National \n     Programs.\n       Drug Free and Safe Schools and Communities--State Grants.\n       Drug Free and Safe Schools and Communities--Regional \n     Centers\n       Drug Free and Safe Schools and Communities--Emergency \n     Grants.\n       Department of Justice-Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention:\n       Youth Gangs.\n       Juvenile Mentoring.\n       Delinquency Prevention Grants.\n       From the Crime bill:\n       Ounce of Prevention Council.\n       Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program.\n       Family and Community Endeavor Schools Grant Program.\n       Assistance for Delinquent and At-Risk Youth.\n       Local Partnership Act.\n       Urban Recreation and At-Risk Youth.\n       Gang Resistance Education and Training.\n       The $2 billion authorization amount for the YDCBG is the \n     sum of the fiscal year 1995 appropriations for existing \n     programs combined with the estimated appropriations for the \n     crime bill programs less 10%.\n                                                                    ____\n\nYouth Development Community Block Grant Act of 1995--Section-by-Section \n                              Description\n\n       Section 1: Short Title; Table of Contents: This section \n     contains the table of contents for the Youth Development \n     Community Block Grant Act of 1995.\n       Section 2: Findings: Section 2 enumerates Congressional \n     findings for the Youth Development Community Block Grant Act \n     of 1995.\n       Section 3: Purposes: The purpose of this Act is set forth \n     in Section 3. The Act is designed to create a single, \n     comprehensive Federal strategy for community-based youth \n     development services, and to support communities in designing \n     community strategic plans for worthwhile youth development.\n       Section 4: Definitions: Section 4 defines all relevant \n     terms and phrases referred to in the Act.\n       Section 5: Distribution of Funds: Section 5 authorizes \n     appropriations up to $2,000,000,000 per fiscal year 1996 \n     through 1998. This appropriation is to be allocated in the \n     following manner: 95.5 percent for allotments to States (for \n     distribution to the community boards); 1.5 percent for grants \n     to Native American organizations; and 3 percent for \n     activities by the Administration for Children and Families. \n     The formula for distributing the funds to states and to \n     counties equally weights three factors--youth population, \n     level of poverty, and increases in violent juvenile crime \n     since 1990.\n       Section 6: Community Youth Development Board: Section 6 \n     establishes a Community Youth Development Board and a \n     multicounty Community Board. These boards shall prepare and \n     submit to the State a community strategic plan for youth \n     development, shall be responsible for establishing monitoring \n     and evaluation procedures; and shall award grants. This \n     section also sets forth guidelines for the composition, \n     administration, and duties of community boards.\n       Section 7: Duties of the State: State responsibilities are \n     set forth in Section 7. These duties include the designation \n     of a state entity to administer and conduct State activities; \n     the development of a mechanism through which to process \n     information, coordinate activities, assess program \n     effectiveness, and for the preparation and submission of an \n     annual report.\n       Section 8: Duties of the Assistant Secretary: This section \n     specifies duties of the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant \n     Secretary shall establish and implement a mechanism to \n     receive information necessary to improve the effectiveness of \n     Federal\n      youth development activities. Moreover, the Assistant \n     Secretary shall issue national policy goals and a national \n     strategic plan; shall monitor, evaluate, and coordinate \n     activities funded under this Act; and shall submit reports \n     to the President and Congress.\n       Section 9: Repeals: Section 9 enumerates provisions of law \n     which are repealed by the Act. Several provisions in the \n     Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 are \n     repealed, along with several Department of Education \n     Programs. Various provisions from other programs are also \n     repealed.\n       Section 10: Conforming Amendments: Section 10 sets forth \n     conforming amendments in the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the \n     Job Training Partnership Act, and the National School Lunch \n     Act.\n       Section 11: Transfer of Funds: Section 11 outlines the \n     transfer of funds. The total amount of funds shall be \n     transferred to the budget account for this Act. Any amounts \n     in the budget account that exceed $2,000,000,000 shall be \n     returned to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Kansas, the distinguished chairwoman of the Senate Labor \nCommittee, and the Senator from Hawaii as an original sponsor of this \nlegislation. Senator Kassebaum has summarized what is in this bill far \nmore eloquently that I can, so I won't bother to summarize this bill \nsection-by-section. But I would like to take a moment to review the \nprovisions of this bill that I think deserve special attention.\n  It has become especially obvious in recent years that there is no \nsuch thing as one size fits all when it comes to providing services to \nyouth. Many of the programs we have put into place have the same noble \nintention of providing services to children and youth who need them, \nbut vary in their approaches to delivery. Some programs work very well, \nothers less so. Youth who qualify for one program out of the Department \nof Labor may not necessarily qualify for a program out of the \nDepartment of Human Services. Additionally, we have front-loaded the \nprocess with countless regulations to be followed and forms and \napplications to be completed. As a result, our good intentions are \noften followed with confusing procedure and time-consuming oversight \nand management procedures. Plainly, the current system is not \ndelivering.\n  Our bill is based upon two encroaching realities. First, that many of \nthe problems in our current system are not always due to the nature of \nthe population served, but because of an ineffective, confusing, \ncontradictory, or overwhelming method of delivering services. Second, \nthat States and local communities know best what works best in their \nStates and local communities. Clearly, a new approach to delivering \nthese services is needed.\n  With this in mind, we did not approach this problem with the intent \nof block granting a number of Federal programs just for the sake of \nblock granting. I know there are some who question the wisdom of block-\ngranting programs, and I share the view that there are some programs \nwhich, due \n[[Page S5154]] to their comprehensive nature, do not belong in a block \ngrant. The issue is one of appropriateness--we should not lump together \nprograms which are unrelated or serve substantially different \npopulations, or deliver unrelated services. In other words, don't block \ngrant your apples with your oranges.\n  I am pleased, therefore, that our legislation focuses on block \ngranting appropriate, and related, programs. These are programs with \noverlapping jurisdictions or which duplicate programs available in \nother agencies. And, unlike some proposals that often set our phones to \nringing, the bill consolidates apples only with apples. The block grant \nestablished under this legislation would consolidate funding from \nexisting Federal youth prevention programs. The list isn't long, and it \nmay even turn out that we didn't include a program in here that others \nmay think should be included. So, I think if you look carefully at what \nwe have included in this block grant, you will see that we did not \ncreate a block grant just because everyone is doing it. We were very \ncareful in the programs we chose.\n  We are proposing a much simpler approach to delivering services to \nyoung people, and one that gives communities a much greater voice in \ndetermining what services are appropriate\n in their area. We are rejecting the current practice of moving funding \nfor youth programs through a number of assistant secretaries at the \nFederal and State level, then gluing on layer after burdensome layer of \nregulations from a number of different agencies onto those funds. \nInstead, our bill would ensure that money flows directly to the \nStates--and then directly to communities--and not to the Federal \nGovernment. Ninety-five percent of the funds available under this bill \ngo directly to local communities, who know best what their specific \nneeds are.\n\n  The State would serve mainly as a flow-through point, with an \nappropriate entity in place to administer and conduct a few activities, \nincluding monitoring, reporting, and technical assistance to counties. \nAdministration of the program is left largely to local boards, which \nwould be appointed in each community by the chief executive officer of \nthe county and a representative of the local youth development \ncommunity. These boards would determine the goals of the programs \nwithin their community, how the community would pursue these goals, and \nthen distribute the funds for the youth development services in the \ncommunity.\n  Further, the funds for this program are allocated to the States by \nformula, not through a discretionary grant process. We have found this \napproach is one that works in other large grants, such as the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant. A formula ensures that every State, regardless \nof size or grant-writing ability, will receive some funding for their \nyouth programs. We have also included a mandatory set-aside for native \nAmerican, Hawaiian, and Alaskan populations to ensure that the young \npeople in these populations will continue to receive services. I know \nSenator Kassebaum worked closely with members of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee on this language, including the distinguished ranking member \nwho is sponsoring this legislation with us, and I appreciate that \ncommittee's assistance in this matter as well.\n  Unlike the current system, the funds made available under this block \ngrant are not targeted at a narrowly defined group of young people. The \nnon-targeted nature of this block grant means that communities do not \nnecessarily have to target their programs to only at-risk, or only \nhigh-risk, or only no-risk youth. Rather, they can develop programs \nthat serve all the youth in their community. These activities can be as \nbroad or as narrow as the community chooses.\n  Another objective of this legislation is to provide for our young \npeople before they become lost in the system. Under our current system, \nwe focus our efforts mainly on solving an existing problem. Now, I \nwould certainly agree that there is an appropriate role for the \nGovernment in this area, but I do not think I exaggerate when I say \nthat many of our programs are the equivalent of ambulance chasing. We \nseem to always arrive after the fact to help pick up the pieces.\n  Again, I agree that this is an important function of Government--and \nour bill would certainly not prevent communities from operating these \nkinds of programs--but I think we serve our children and our \ncommunities better if we focus our efforts on preventing problems from \noccurring in the first place. Therefore, our bill is heavily tilted \ntoward preventative programs, and would consolidate funding from a \nnumber of prevention programs under the jurisdictions of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Justice.\n  Let me reassure my colleagues that there is no hidden agenda here. We \nare not out to get any one of these programs. In fact, I have been a \nstaunch supporter of many of the programs block granted in this bill, \nincluding the National Youth Sports Program under the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the Summer Youth Employment and Training \nProgram under the Department of Labor, and Safe and Drug Free Schools \nunder the Department of Education. However, I'm certain there are some \nin New Mexico listening to me right now who are saying, ``Wait a \nmoment, Senator--you're proposing to put into your block grant a \nprogram that we already have. What will happen to our program?'' The \nanswer to that is, nothing. The purpose of this bill is to let \ncommunities continue to make available and expand upon the kinds of \nservices these programs provide, but without the Federal Government \npeeking over their shoulders. We have grandfathered existing programs, \nallowing the communities to continue funding for any local program \ncurrently in place, but without the Federal administration.\n  Now, in all the talk about block grants, there is always the concern \nthat we will be letting the States have completely free reign, with no \naccountability, and therefore States will be spending the money from \nblock grants on unrelated items. I want to assure my colleagues and \nanyone listening that this cannot happen under our bill. Funds must be \nspent on youth development programs in the State. Period. Also, we will \nmaintain some--minimal, but some--oversight of the program, as well as \nassisting the States in training and technical assistance, as needed.\n  It has become alarmingly obvious that we will be unable to continue \nto fund programs at their existing rate of growth. However, we believe \nthat under our proposed delivery system, States will be able to perform \nmore with less funding. The funding authorized for this program is \nbased on the current authorization levels for the 23 programs we \nconsolidate, minus 10 percent. That amounts to $2 billion. That is not \na huge reduction in funding, and we believe that without having to \nworry about complying with the strict letter of the law, without having \nto worry about complying with regulation after regulation, and without \nhaving to worry about reams of paperwork, the States will find they can \ncontinue to deliver services at their current rate, and may surprise \nthemselves in finding they can do even more.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge a number of groups who are lending \ntheir support to this legislation, and who have been very helpful \nduring this process. My thanks go especially to the Boys and Girls Club \nof America, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, the American Red Cross, YMCA, \nYWCA, and the Boy Scouts of America. These are groups I have worked \nwith closely on my efforts with the Character Counts Coalition, and \ntheir support for this effort means as much to me as it does for my \nefforts with Character Counts. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith them.\n  I believe ours is a responsible approach that can work. I encourage \nmy colleagues to give it a chance to do so.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Moynihan):\n  S. 674. A bill entitled the ``Rail Investment Act of 1995''; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                          rail investment act\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rail \nInvestment Act of 1995. This legislation will ensure that America's \nrail infrastructure continues to meet the needs of the Nation. This \nbill is an update version of S. 2002 which the Senate Commerce \nCommittee unanimously approved last year and combines several \nimportant \n[[Page S5155]] rail initiatives including the reauthorization of \nAmtrak, the reauthorization of the Local Rail Freight Assistance \nProgram and other rail initiatives of critical importance to a number \nof Members of the Senate.\n  The bill before the Senate takes into account the cost-saving \nmeasures taken by the Amtrak Board and includes new provisions to help \nAmtrak generate more nontax revenues through advertising, concessions \nand intermodal coordination with America's bus companies. I know that \nthis legislation is a starting place and not a finishing place. Many \npainful choices regarding Amtrak are just around the bend. With a few \nmodifications, however, it is where the Senate left off last year.\n  As the former chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, I \nam proud of the work we did last year. I have updated the effort to \nreflect the new political and financial realities which face both \nAmtrak and this body.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee held a very good hearing on Amtrak and \nit is clear to me that there continues to be strong bipartisan support \nfor a national passenger rail system. I look forward to working with \nboth the new chairman of the full committee and the subcommittee to \nassure that Amtrak has a future.\n  The key features of the Rail Investment Act include:\n  First, an addition to the Amtrak mission statement that Amtrak should \ntreat all passengers with respect, courtesy, and dignity and that \nAmtrak should manage its capital investment to provide world class \nservice;\n  Second, a study of proposed changes of the State-requested service \nprogram;\n  Third, a renewal of the authorization for the Northeast Corridor \nImprovement Program [NECIP];\n  Fourth, a technical amendment to settle a title problem for Reno, NV, \nrail properties;\n  Fifth, the Missouri River Corridor Development Program to study the \nfeasibility of service between Kansas City and Omaha, to authorize \nstation projects and fund operation of new service in and around the \nStates bordering the Missouri River;\n  Sixth, a provision to assist Rhode Island with its double-stack \nfreight service problems;\n  Seventh, a provision which allows Amtrak to better manage its \nfinances;\n  Eighth, a provision to study D.C. to Bristol, VA, passenger rail \nservice;\n  Ninth, the addition of a passenger representative to the Amtrak Board \nof Directors;\n  Tenth, a pilot program to generate more nontax revenues from \nadvertising and concession sales; and\n  Eleventh, a provision to authorize a rail project integral to service \nbetween Massachusetts and Maine;\n  Twelfth, a continuation of the Amtrak labor management safety task \nforce.\n  The bill also includes the text of legislation I introduced with \nSenators Daschle, Pressler, Harkin, Conrad, Kerrey, and Dorgan last \nyear to reauthorize the Local Rail Freight Assistance Program [LRFA] \nfor $30 million each year. In addition, the LRFA Program is amended to \ngive authorization for emergency appropriations, and to add explicit \nlanguage to permit LRFA money to be used for crossing closures and \nupgrades.\n  I urge my colleagues to endorse this much needed legislation.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today, the day United States \nTrade Representative Mickey Kantor is testifying before the Senate \nFinance Committee about overall United States trade policy, to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate an injustice to American companies \nexporting to South Korea. Time after time, American companies are \nconfronted with nontariff barriers that impede their ability to compete \nin the South Korean market.\n  One of my constituents, the M/M Mars' Co., which makes Mars candy \nbars and employs over 900 Tennesseans, is a strong example of an \nAmerican company exporting their product, attempting to comply with the \ndomestic requirements in South Korea and encountering headache after \nheadache in the process. I am disturbed about this problem not only \nbecause it affects many Tennesseans, but because it also strains the \nrelationship between American companies and South Korea.\n  The most recent incident is a new labeling requirement imposed by the \nSouth Korean Ministry of Health. If Korea had notified the appropriate \nparties and given the company a reasonable amount of time to comply \nwith the new regulations, then I would not be here today. However, \ndespite United States protest and Korean acknowledgement of its \n``failure to notify,'' the Korean Ministry of Health refuses to agree \nto a moratorium on the requirement, which would allow the company \nsufficient time to comply with the new regulations.\n  Mr. President, I am not asking for South Korea to change its policy. \nI am asking for them to comply with their obligation under article X of \nthe World Trade Organization and publish regulations affecting trade \nand administer them in a ``uniform, impartial and reasonable manner.'' \nI am also asking them to realize this injustice and provide a \nmoratorium to allow entry to the remaining unlabeled shipments of M/M \nMars products and give the company time to relabel their products, \nwhich they have agreed to do on or before August 1, 1995.\n  American companies, such as M/M Mars, do not want special treatment. \nThey want the opportunity for their products to compete fairly in the \ninternational market.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5157-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM ON WINNING \n               THE NCAA DIVISION I NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Jacques Jourbet scored a goal.\n  The Terriers were superb in the clutch this year, winning the \nBeanpot, the last at the hallowed Boston Garden, the hockey east \nchampionship, and now the national championship, Mr. President, you can \nnot do any better than that.\n  Coach Jack Parker brings the NCAA ice hockey championship back to \nBoston University for the first time since 1978. He has done much to \ngenerate pride at B.U., and this year's accomplishment is something \nelse that justly continues that tradition.\n  The B.U. hockey team has made all of us proud with their outstanding \nplay.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VINCE YANNONE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nmade a lifework in preserving one of Montana's hallmarks, one of the \nthings that has earned it renown as ``the Last Best Place''--our \nwildlife.\n  This May Vince Yannone retires from the Department of Fish, Wildlife, \nand Parks. But he is not retiring from working with wildlife and our \nfellow \n[[Page S5159]] Montanans. And his legacy will certainly live on, as the \nschoolchildren he has worked with rediscover the joys of the Montana \noutdoors and the value of our wildness.\n  Vince is legendary in Helena and throughout Montana. For a quarter \ncentury now, Vince has educated Montanans, young and old alike, on the \nways of the wild. He spearheaded Montana's Project WILD, which teaches \nMontana's youth how to think about natural resource issues. He has \nreceived commendations from the Governor and from local media.\n  Vince will not have an easy time escaping Helena's limelight. He is a \npublic personality, having hosted a daily television program called \n``Nature Today'' for 12 years. He currently hosts another show called \n``Getting Out in Montana.'' Almost daily, Vince serves as the master of \nceremonies at some local banquet or gathering.\n  But the notoriety Vince has received during his service has not \naffected his friendly Montanan attitude. As he walks along the streets \nof Helena, everyone recognizes him. He makes a stranger feel like a \nwelcome friend. That is what people notice first about him: Vince is a \ngood person and a good friend--two qualities that mean a lot more in \nMontana than being a public personality.\n  Vince received the ``call of the wild'' at an early age. And it is \nnot a calling he is soon to get rid of--since in his so-called \nretirement he will be working for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and \ncompleting the construction of a new wild animal shelter in Helena. He \nhas been with what used to be known as the Montana Department of Fish \nand Game since his twenties.\n  Vince does not protect wildlife in some abstract, theoretical way--\nsay, by preaching about the importance of species protection without \never visiting the Flathead National Forest. He helps place orphaned \nwildlife in zoos and shelters across the country. He also takes injured \nanimals into his home, and helps the ailing critters back to health.\n  The State highway patrol has his number on their dashboards. Not \nbecause he is on the most wanted list. It is because whenever they find \nroad kill near his home in Clancy, Vince uses the remaining carcass to \nfeed whatever wild things might be lurking in his back yard--which \nthese days consists of some eagles, owls, and ravens.\n  The thing that strikes a person most about Vince is his well \ndeveloped sense of compassion. It is that sense of purpose that has \nkept him going through the years. It has made the late-night calls from \nbar-room wranglers arguing animal trivia more tolerable.\n  The Helena Independent Record, my hometown newspaper, did a series of \nstories about Vince when he announced his retirement. The one that \ncaught my attention was about a 180-pound moose calf that Vince was \nraising on his property.\n  Vince was away at a movie with his wife, Sue, as the babysitter \nwatched his two daughters, Jennifer and Christine. The babysitter ended \nup having to take care of the moose as much as the kids. When it got \nhungry for milk, the moose snuck into the window of their home.\n  Vince was more than a little surprised when he received a call at the \ntheater, even more surprised when it was his babysitter telling him \nthat Bullwinkle was roaming his house.\n  But events like these are all in a day's work for Vince. I hear he is \nwriting a book about his memorable events in raising wild animals. If \nthe moose incident is any indication, I am anxious to read the rest of \nhis memoirs.\n  With his book project and other jobs to be done, I do not think it \nneeds to be said that Vince Yannone is not settling snugly into \nretirement. Like other great Montanans--Mike Mansfield, who at 92 \ndecided to cut back his schedule to a 5 day workweek, and Norman \nMaclean, who preached an anti-shuffleboard philosophy up until his \ndeath--Vince continues to work to improve the lives of those around \nhim. Human and animal. I wish him and his family the best.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5158-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               DIESEL TAX\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Breaux and Senator Chafee, by \ncosponsoring S. 478, a bill that will correct the diesel fuel problem \naffecting the boating community, ports, and marinas in my home State of \nWashington and across the nation.\n  The problem results from the 24.4 cents per gallon tax imposed by the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on diesel fuel used in \nrecreational boats. The bill mandated two types of fuel: clear, taxable \nfuel used in recreational boats and dyed, nontaxable fuel used in \ncommercial boats. By law, the dyed nontaxable commercial diesel fuel \ncannot be sold to the recreational boaters.\n  These changes have wreaked havoc on the boating communities in \nWashington State. Many marinas are not equipped with the two separate \ntanks necessary to store the two different types of fuel. Unable to \nafford the exorbitant expense of new fuel tanks and dispensing \nequipment, these marinas are faced with the difficult choice of whether \nto sell only dyed fuel, tax free to commercial vessels, or taxable, \nclear fuel, to recreational vessels.\n  Since many marinas rely on commercial boats for a majority of their \nbusiness, they choose to sell diesel fuel to commercial vessels. This \nleads to a severe shortage of diesel fuel available to recreational \nboaters.\n  This is not only a problem for recreational boaters, but also for \nmarinas, which are forced to turn away part of their consumer base. \nThese regulations do not promote jobs and economic opportunities for \nthe employees of these businesses. It is outrageous for a small \nbusiness owner to have to turn away good business.\n  Faced with a severe shortage of fuel, recreational boaters are forced \nto travel hundreds of miles to find fuel. This creates a safety hazard, \nas boaters could end up stranded on their way to find fuel or be \nrequired to carry large amounts of extra fuel on board.\n  Last year, I introduced an amendment that would have temporarily \nresolved the burdensome problem facing boaters and marinas. The \namendment passed overwhelmingly in the Senate, but, unfortunately, was \nkilled in the House. Therefore, we have the same problem today as we \ndid last summer. The only way to permanently fix this problem is to \npass S. 478.\n  S. 478 will allow marinas to purchase the dyed fuel, collect the tax \nfrom the recreational boaters and pay the tax directly to the \nGovernment. It will solve the problem of inadequate fuel facilities for \nrecreational boaters and remedy the problems faced by marinas and \nports.\n  With the boating season soon approaching, we need to correct this \nproblem now. That is why I cosponsored S. 478. I encourage my \ncolleagues to keep me pass this bill and bring relief to our boating \ncommunities.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5159-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5159-S5160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE CHATTANOOGA NEIGHBORHOOD ENTERPRISE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nChattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise, Inc. for its innovative approach \nto revitalizing old neighborhoods and providing affordable housing and \nlow and moderate income families.\n  The neighborhood enterprise was created in 1986 to provide the \nopportunity for all Chattanoogans to live in decent, fit, and \naffordable housing, and CNE is fulfilling that mission by lending money \nto homebuyers, advocating homeownership, developing and managing \naffordable housing, and helping revitalize old neighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, more than 71 percent of all families within the city \nlimits of Chattanooga make $35,000 or less each year. With many of the \ncity's older residential neighborhoods in decline, the Chattanooga \nNeighborhood Enterprise realized that community and local business \ninvestment could revive these areas and allow more families to achieve \ntheir dreams of owning a home.\n  Since 1986, CNE has produced, rehabilitated or financed more than \n2,500 units of housing in Chattanooga, and it manages more than 300 \nunits of rental housing. Not only does it assist homeowners, \nhomebuyers, the elderly, single-parent families, the disabled and the \nhomeless in the inner-city area, CNE also helps families in the metro \narea and remote areas of Hamilton County. The neighborhood enterprise \nis helping to break the cycle of poverty for many permanent residents \nof public housing by giving them an affordable \n[[Page S5160]] alternative. Currently, about 15 percent of CNE's \ncustomers were once residents in the city's public housing.\n  By making community involvement a top priority, the Chattanooga \nNeighborhood Enterprise has become a shining example of how public-\nprivate partnership can more effectively provide the same, if not \nbetter, services and help the people who truly need it. At a time when \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development has come under serious \nscrutiny, it is refreshing to know that low-income families in \nChattanooga have an alternative.\n  Mr. President, this successful housing program receives funding from \nGovernment agencies, private corporation, and foundations alike. With a \n$21 million budget in 1994, Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise has \nmuch more money to spend on the city's housing than HUD does, and \nprivate sector involvement prevents if from becoming the ineffective \nbureaucracy characteristic of many government agencies.\n  In helping Chattanooga's residents find quality affordable housing, \nthe neighborhood enterprise also helps the city of Chattanooga. As \nareas of the city are restored and families move in, the amount of tax \nmoney the city receives increases. In fact, each year, the city brings \nin more than $1.2 million in tax money that can be directly attributed \nto the work of the Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise.\n  The Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise has touched the lives of \nthousands of Chattanoogans and for that, Mr. President, I commend them \nfor their hard work and dedication.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5159-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 1345\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a cloture motion was filed on the substitute \namendment to the appropriations bill today.\n  We have been, throughout the afternoon, trying to figure out if we \ncan reach some agreement. We have been working with the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, in good faith on both sides, to see if we can \ncome to some closure.\n  We have also had discussions through Senator Lott with some of the \nMembers of the House that will be critical in trying to get a \nconference report finished on the rescission bill. It is my hope that \ntomorrow morning we may be able to reach some agreement. If not, the \ncloture motion then would ripen on Thursday morning.\n  I do not see any other way of dealing with 100 and some amendments at \nthis point if we intend to complete action on this bill and on the \nother defense supplemental, on the DC bill, on paper simplification, \nand perhaps other items on which we can agree.\n  So a cloture motion was filed on the substitute amendment to the \nappropriations bill just a few moments ago, and if we cannot reach an \nagreement there will be a cloture vote on Thursday.\n  It is my hope that if Members feel constrained to offer amendments to \nthe bill, they will be prepared to offer those amendments tomorrow to \nexpedite action on the bill. And I would also say that if we complete \naction on everything on Thursday, we would probably either not be in \nsession on Friday or have a session where there would be no legislative \nbusiness conducted or only a pro forma session. It may be that some \npeople might want to speak on Friday. Hopefully, we might have \neverything done so there would be no legislative business on Friday. \nBut that will depend, of course, on the cooperation we have on both \nsides.\n  There are a number of things going on as we speak to see if there is \nsome way we can come together and some way we could complete action on \nthis bill. We are talking about a $15 billion rescission package in the \nSenate, $17 billion in the House. If it is not completed before the \nrecess, it seems to me that much of that money will be spent by the \ntime we are back so we could lose, it has been estimated, maybe $1.5 to \n$2 billion--if we do not act before the recess. So hopefully we could \nhave final disposition fairly soon; we could still have the conference \ncompleted and vote on the conference report either Thursday night or \nFriday morning. And hopefully, if we did that on Friday morning, it \ncould be done without the necessity of a rollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/04/senate-section/article/S5160-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
