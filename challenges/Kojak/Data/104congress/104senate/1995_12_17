The present crisis over the budget has confronted us \nwith our human inadequacy to handle things on our own.\n  So here we are on a Sunday afternoon. We all believe in You, love our \nNation, and are called to patriotism. We pray very specifically for our \nprincipal leaders. For the welfare of the Nation, the good of the \nGovernment, and the continued respect of our people, we ask You to \nmotivate President Clinton to call together Bob Dole, Tom Daschle, Newt \nGingrich, and all those involved in assisting in this negotiation. We \njoin with millions of Americans in praying that You will give these \nleaders the courage to keep working until the issues are resolved, the \ndetermination to find answers, and the desire to give as well as take \nin the disputation. You are ready to help those who confess their \ndependence on You for wisdom to find workable solutions and creative \ncompromises. When we humbly ask for Your guidance together, You open \nthe channels of communication and give us the will to negotiate. The \nplace for greatness is here; the time for greatness is now. We thank \nYou in advance for the answer to this prayer. In the name of our Lord. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18787-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think it is fairly certain we will not be \ngetting any continuing resolutions from the House today, so we will not \nbe in session but for a few moments. It seems to me that there is not \nmuch reason to stay here if we are not going to have a continuing \nresolution come over from the House side.\n  But I think in an effort to make that final determination, I would \nnow move the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair. \nAs soon as I have that information, we will come back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask the majority leader, the Senate had an \nannouncement about the LIHEAP, the President taking action to release \nLIHEAP funds, which is enormously important for many areas in the \ncountry. This is something very, very significant to many of the \npeople, I know, in my own State, New England, out in the Far West. I \njust wanted to address the Senate for 3 or 4 minutes on that subject. \nAnd there may be a lot of other people that want to talk.\n  I do not want to interrupt the normal flow, but I just wonder if----\n  Mr. DOLE. The Speaker is in my office, so I can find out rather \nquickly. It will not be a long recess. But I do not want to get into a \nSunday afternoon brawl here on the floor about the budget. If it is not \nabout the budget--I mean the President knows how to reach us up here. \nAnd we do not need to debate the budget this afternoon. We need to sit \ndown, the principals, and try to work it out.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the majority leader would yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, has \nbeen here all day, and temporarily had to leave the Capitol, but will \nbe returning. I am prepared on his behalf to offer a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I am wondering if the majority leader intends to allow us to \nbe recognized to do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Oh, yes. In fact, we may want to accept that request if we \ncan add to it the Labor-HHS bill which the Democrats will not let us \nbring up on the floor. If the Senator can add that to the CR, we might \ndo some business here this afternoon. That would put 150,000 people \nback to work, and we think that is very important. So the Senator might \nsee if he can amend that. We might be able to agree to it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Is there objection?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. \n\n[[Page S18788]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18787-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2127\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that I have met with the \nSpeaker, and I think it is unlikely that there will be any continuing \nresolution. In fact, there will not be a continuing resolution coming \nfrom the House tonight, and I do not see any reason for the Senate to \nbe in session. If there was any hope that there might be a continuing \nresolution coming over from the House side, we would have stayed here \nas long as we could.\n  Then I understood that earlier the Senator from North Dakota, on \nbehalf of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, was going to propound a \nunanimous-consent request which would in effect be a 5-day extension \nuntil December 22. It is an S.-numbered bill, which the House can \nrefuse.\n  But, in any event, it occurred to me that maybe a better way to \napproach that would be to add the continuing resolution to the Labor-\nHHS bill which has been pending here since September 15. We have had \ntwo cloture votes so far. We have had a number of unanimous-consent \nrequests rejected. We will have another cloture vote sometime on \nTuesday. That is one appropriations bill that has not left the Senate, \nand it is because of objections on the other side of the aisle. It has \nbeen along party lines, and I would hope that we could resolve it. It \ninvolves I think about 150,000 Federal workers, and if we could do that \ntonight, I understand again from the Speaker that he will use every \neffort to take the bill that we send to him and pass it in the House \nand send it to the President for his signature tomorrow.\n  So on that basis, I will propound a unanimous-consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate turn to consideration of Calendar No. \n189, H.R. 2127, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, that the committee \namendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc, the bill be further \namended with language to change section 106(c) of Public Law 10-456 to \nstrike ``December 15th, 1995'' and insert ``December 22nd, 1995,'' that \nthe bill be then immediately read a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the majority leader has just offered a \nunanimous-consent request that included a number of things, including \nconsideration of an appropriations bill that he knows contains an \nextraneous item that is very controversial that has held up that \nlegislation for some long while. It also includes a continuing \nresolution.\n  We believe there ought to be a continuing resolution adopted by the \nSenate. There is no need for a shutdown of the Government. We would \nhope that the majority leader would accept the unanimous-consent \nrequest that I will propound in a moment that will provide a clean \ncontinuing resolution for 5 days, and in 30 minutes from now the \nGovernment shutdown will end.\n  There is no reason for a Government shutdown. It does not make any \nsense. It, in effect, penalizes the American people for our failure to \nreach agreement on a budget issue here in the Congress, and it \ncertainly makes no sense at all to penalize both the American taxpayer \nand also Federal workers.\n  I was constrained to object to the unanimous-consent request by the \nmajority leader because the request that he made included not only a \ncontinuing resolution but also an appropriations bill, one of the \nlargest--the largest--appropriations bill that would come to the floor \nand that would be deemed to have been passed, which includes an issue--\nstriker replacement--which he knows is very, very controversial. It is \nan extraneous item to the appropriations bill that should not be there. \nIf it was not there, we would have passed this appropriations bill. It \nwould have gone to the White House, and presumably it would have been \nnegotiated before and signed into law, and we would not have these \nissues in front of us with respect to both Labor and HHS.\n  But we do have these issues dealing with the shutdown, and it does \naffect Labor-HHS and other appropriations. The way to solve that--not \nonly for Labor and HHS, but for all other areas that are so affected--\nwould be for us to at this moment agree to a 5-day continuing \nresolution, clean, without any riders, without any extraneous \nprovisions.\n  So I will propound the unanimous-consent request on behalf of the \nminority leader, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18788-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18788-S18790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1410\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 240, S. 1410, a clean \ncontinuing appropriations bill, that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, as amended, with the date changed until December 22, and with \nlanguage that will permit the expenditures of funds for low-income \nenergy assistance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  Let me indicate, of course, that the appropriations bill originates \nin the House. This does not have any standing in any event, but it \nwould have standing if done in the way I prescribed because it would be \nattached to the bill. It would go to the House.\n  I want to make the record very clear because I think sometimes people \nfail to understand why certain things happen. The Labor-HHS \nappropriations was reported, and it has been on the Senate calendar \nsince September 15. Senator Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, has been prepared every day since that time--along with \nSenator Specter, chairman of the subcommittee--prepared to bring that \nbill to the floor, and so has, I might add, the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. The \nleadership on the Democratic side, because of striker replacement--in \nother words, if we repeal the President's Executive order--will not let \nus bring the bill up. They are not willing to take their chances in a \ndebate and are not willing to try to strike that provision on the \nSenate floor. So we have been stymied.\n  So I would say to all of the people at the Labor Department, Mr. \nReich, Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of HHS, and others who are \nnonessential--they are not nonessential--but the nonessential workers \nwho will not be going to work tomorrow, to just take a look at the \nrecord--do not listen to the press--and take a look at the facts. The \nfacts are that since September 15 that bill has been on the calendar. \nWe have tried to get it up three or four times by unanimous consent. \nThat has been objected to by my colleagues on the other side.\n  We have had two cloture votes. We failed on cloture votes because of \nstriker replacement. We failed along party-line votes. We only have 53 \nRepublicans. We need 60 to shut off debate, and we will have another \ncloture vote on Tuesday.\n  So what I suggest--and we want to keep the Government open until the \n22--is to bring that bill up, pass it by unanimous consent, and add a \n5-day additional continuing resolution to it so the Government will be \nopen until December 22, which will be next Friday at midnight.\n  It seemed to me that was a good way to dispose of two items that are \nstill here that should have been disposed of weeks and weeks and weeks \nago. And I regret that because of one provision, because of the \nPresident's allegiance to the organized labor leaders--not the working \npeople--because of his allegiance to the labor leaders and all the \nmoney they pump into the Democratic Party, that because of this one \nlittle provision that deals only with an Executive order made by the \nPresident, we are going to keep 150,000 workers from their jobs \ntomorrow and maybe the rest of the week and a lot of other things, \nfunding for NIH, a lot of other programs, including the Low-Energy \nAssistance Program in the Labor, HHS appropriations bill.\n  So the public ought to know that when the labor leaders speak, my \ncolleagues listen. They will not let this bill come up because the \nlabor leaders are opposed to one provision--one provision. I know it is \ndifficult for the media to print the facts and report the facts, but \nthese are the facts. Do not \n\n[[Page S18789]]\ntake my word for it. It is all in the Congressional Record.\n  Where is the calendar that will show how long it has been on it, to \nmake certain I have it right? I think it is September 15.\n  Reported by the committee September 15. So it has been around \nSeptember to October, October to November, November to December. It has \nbeen around 3 months, 90-some days, and we cannot pass it because my \ncolleagues on the other side will not let us pass it because of one \nprovision--one provision and we could have opened up the Government. \nThe Speaker said if we would get consent to do this, he would try to \npass it tomorrow. So we have made an effort again, I hope in good \nfaith. We tried before to bring this bill up.\n  Let me also include in the Record, because I know I read today in the \nWashington Post how the tourists were frustrated and there may be some \nin the--the zoo is closed but the Senate is open. That ought to tell \nyou something. I know what it tells you. But we are here. The bears are \nresting. In any event, maybe it ought to be the other way around. Close \nthis up and open the zoo. If you cannot get into the zoo, this may be \nthe next best choice.\n  We wrote the President yesterday. We suggested to the President that \nhe ought to sign the three bills that have been on his desk--Commerce, \nJustice, State, the Judiciary, which employs 194,000 Federal workers; \nthe Interior bill, which employs 103,800 workers; and the VA-HUD bill, \nwhich employs 293,000 workers.\n\n  Now, that is a total of 620,900 workers. All these bills have been on \nthe President's desk. With all the stories today about the parks being \nclosed and people came all the way here, it is an unfortunate thing \nthat they came back here to see certain sights and participate in some \nof the holiday period festivities and all the buildings are closed.\n  The President can take care of that with a stroke of the pen. He can \ndo it right now. It is a little late for the weekend. But they would be \nopen tomorrow morning.\n  The bill is there, Mr. President. All you have to do is sign it, sign \nthe other bills, and a lot of people will go back to work.\n  So, again, I would like to include in the Record the list of the \nbills. If he would sign these bills, it covers the following agencies: \nJustice, Commerce, the Judiciary, State, Small Business, USIA, the \nInterior, Indian Health, Forestry, Energy, NASA, National Science \nFoundation, Veterans, Housing and Urban Development, EPA. In all these \ndifferent agencies, people would be back to work, and we think that is \nimportant. So I would like to include that information along with a \ncopy of the letter that the Speaker and I sent to the President \nyesterday indicating that we hoped that he would sign those bills.\n  We also advised the President we could pass the DC appropriations \nbill tomorrow evening. We hope we can get consent to deem that passed \nin the Senate after it passes the House. And we also suggested to the \nPresident, I might add, the Labor, HHS bill and pointed out to the \nPresident that we have made repeated efforts to bring up the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill but the \nSenate Democrats have prevented the bill from moving forward. We asked \nfor the President's help. We asked him yesterday to help us get the \nbill passed so that we can send it to him for his consideration and \nanother 150,000 workers could continue working. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that those be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The best way to avoid sending federal \n     workers home from work on Monday morning, December 18, is for \n     you to sign the appropriations bills that Congress has \n     already sent to you. You have on your desk right now three \n     bills that would allow 620,000 workers to remain on the job. \n     We urge you to sign those bills before Monday. You can keep \n     them on the job with a stroke of your pen.\n       The Interior Appropriations bill would let 133,800 workers \n     remain on the job. The Veterans Affairs, HUD, and Independent \n     Agencies bill would keep 293,000 employees on the job. And \n     the Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary bill would let \n     194,000 workers stay on the job. You should approve those \n     three bills for the sake of those federal workers and to fund \n     the federal programs included in those bills for the rest of \n     the fiscal year.\n       We also hope on Monday to deliver to you the appropriations \n     bill for the District of Columbia so that the D.C. Government \n     can continue to operate.\n       Since September 15, we have made repeated efforts to bring \n     up the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations bill for consideration on the Senate Floor, \n     but Senate Democrats have prevented that bill from moving \n     forward. We ask for your help with members of your party so \n     that we can move that bill to you for your consideration. \n     Upon your approval, another 150,000 workers could continue \n     working.\n       Your prompt approval of the remaining appropriations bills \n     is in the best interest of the Nation and will ensure \n     continued operation of the government.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker of the House.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Bills Awaiting Clinton's Signature\n\n                     What's Shut Down If He Vetoes\n\n\n                  Departments (major related functions)\n\n     Commerce:\n       (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Admin.)\n       (Maritime Administration)\n       (Federal Communications Commission)\n       (Small Business Administration)\n       (National Weather Service)\n     Justice:\n       (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\n       (Drug Enforcement Administration)\n       (Immigration & Naturalization)\n       (Federal Prisons)\n     State\n     Veterans\n     Interior:\n       (Forest Service)\n       (Indian Health Service)\n       (Smithsonian)\n     Housing & Urban Development\n\n\n                           Independent Agencies\n\n     Consumer Product Safety Commission\n     Environmental Protection\n     Federal Emergency Management\n     National Aeronautics & Space\n     National Science Foundation\n\n                  The Ball's in the President's Court\n\n       The following bills have been sent or are on their way to \n     the President's desk.

Tomorrow, if we can renew our request, maybe by that time, \nif we have some word, if we could do this tomorrow morning, we could \nstill get it over to the House; they could still act tomorrow. And \nagain it would extend the Government to December 22, the partial \nshutdown would be lifted until December 22. Perhaps at that time there \ncould be some agreement on the budget.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand why the majority leader characterized the \ncircumstances of the shutdown in the appropriations bills, but I would \nsay to him that it is not the lack of passing the Labor, HHS bill that \nwill cause a shutdown tomorrow morning. It is the lack of passing a \nclean CR for 5 days. We could pass a clean CR and in 30 minutes the \nGovernment shutdown will end, and that is what we ought to be doing.\n  For those who listen to this process and watch this process, they \nought to understand what is at work with respect to an appropriations \nbill that the majority leader described in some detail. There is a \ndiscussion about the process in the system here in Congress where \nsomebody sticks something on a piece of legislation that has nothing at \nall to do with the legislation. It has no relationship at all. And then \nit just moves along.\n  Well, some people objected to that on the Labor, HHS bill, a \nprovision that has nothing at all to do with that bill. If it were \ntaken off, it would pass very quickly. But because it was not taken \noff, that piece of legislation is not advanced. But it seems to me, at \n6 o'clock on Sunday evening, the question of whether the Government \nwill be shut down tomorrow is a question that can be answered \naffirmatively in terms of our intent to keep it open by passing a 5-day \ncontinuing resolution. \n\n[[Page S18790]]\n\n  Whether it originates here or in the House is irrelevant to me. What \nis relevant is that it does originate. I hope that one body or the \nother would originate a continuing resolution to say let us not hold \nanybody hostage, let us not make anybody pay a price at this point for \nour failure. Let us continue to negotiate around the clock and let us \nnot have the Government shut down while these negotiations continue.\n  I know that the Democrats were meeting today in the Capitol. I was a \npart of those meetings most of the day. I am sure that Republicans were \nmeeting in the Capitol. I hope that people of good will on both sides \nwant to find a way to solve this problem. The American people expect \nthis problem to be solved. But the failure to provide a CR for a very \nshort time and to have a Government shutdown remain in effect tomorrow \nmorning is, in my judgment, an approach that simply penalizes both the \nAmerican taxpayers and also Federal workers. I guess I hope that the \nway we would decide the issue at 6 o'clock on Sunday night is to pass a \ncontinuing resolution without clauses and without conditions--just do \nit, get the Government up, operating and open for the American people, \nand then let us in the next day or two or three or four solve this \nproblem of the balanced budget with the right priorities and do it for \nour country. That is what I hope the majority leader will consent to. \nAnd if he does not consent now, I hope that one way or the other very \nsoon we will find a way to consent to a clean 5-day CR to avoid the \ncontinuation of the Government shutdown.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am not a shutdown advocate. I think the \nSenator knows that I am not one of those who advocates it. I think the \nFederal workers become pawns in this exercise, which is not fair to \nthem. And I have held that view. They are sort of caught in the middle. \nIt is a very, very difficult issue that we are trying to bring \ntogether. The American people want us to balance the budget. They have \nwanted us to do that for a long time. They want a balanced budget \namendment. We failed by one vote in the Senate.\n   They want a 7-year--I think they would rather have a quicker one, \nbut a 7-year balanced budget makes a lot of sense to many Americans \nbecause they see their interest rates lowering when they go out to buy \na car or home loan or student loan. It will be much less expensive. It \nis like a tax cut for particularly middle-class Americans.\n  So the American people are on the side of a balanced budget. They \nwant welfare reform. They want us to preserve and strengthen Medicare. \nI think most Americans with children want tax cuts for families with \nchildren.\n  So there are a number of very important matters that we need to \nresolve. We are not going to do it here this evening, obviously. But I \nsay again, it seems to me that if people look at the record--and \nunderstand that this Labor-HHS bill, striker replacement, affects \nlabor. It is on an appropriations bill, but it certainly is not the \nfirst time. I bet there are a dozen other measures on that bill that \nprobably should be in an authorization bill.\n  But in any event, there has been an objection. I regret there has \nbeen an objection. We could have sent it to the House where they could \nhave taken it up tomorrow and maybe removed the partial shutdown.\n  I have just been notified that Mr. Panetta, the chief of staff of the \nWhite House, indicates that the President will call Republican leaders \ntomorrow and apparently discuss a temporary spending authority bill. I \nhope that in addition to that, the President would discuss, how do we \nresolve the dilemma, how do we get together a balanced budget for 7 \nyears?\n  Again, I think it is time for adult leadership. It is time for the \nprincipals to be principals. We are prepared to do that. This is not an \nexercise that we want to take up through the rest of this week and all \nnext week. But if necessary, I think the American people, once it is \ndone and once they see the benefits, will thank us for staying here and \ngetting our work done. That is what we get paid for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18788-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was pleased to learn earlier this \nafternoon that President Clinton plans to act tomorrow, Monday, to \nrelease $578 million in Federal funds for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, known as LIHEAP. The President's action will make \n$22.89 million available to Massachusetts immediately.\n  As we all know, the availability of LIHEAP funds had been drastically \nrestricted under the two stopgap funding bills passed by Congress since \nthe end of September. With the expiration of the latest stopgap bill at \nmidnight last Friday. President Clinton is free to release the funds \nand will do so tomorrow.\n  So this means Christmas will be arriving a week early for the 137,000 \nlow-income families in communities across Massachusetts who rely on \nFederal energy assistance to keep their homes warm in winter weather. \nPresident Clinton deserves great credit for taking advantage of this \nwindow of opportunity to release these urgently needed funds.\n  In recent weeks, with cold weather already hitting Massachusetts and \nmany States hard, we have been urging Congress and the administration \nto find a way to end the unfortunate and irresponsible impasse over \nLIHEAP funding and enable the assistance to start flowing to low-income \nfamilies facing large heating bills.\n  By this time last year, Massachusetts had received about $32 million \nin LIHEAP funds. So far this year, only $9.6 million has been received \nbecause of the restrictions in the stopgap funding bills. Under \nPresident Clinton's action, this year's LIHEAP funding will be on a par \nwith last year's, and families will be getting the relief they need and \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18790-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, following morning business on Monday, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the DOD authorization bill. I \nunderstand we are trying to get an agreement when we might vote on that \nbill Tuesday morning. The House will be taking up, in late afternoon \nbecause of the holiday tomorrow--after 4 or 5--the D.C. appropriations \nbill, which if passed by the House and passed by the Senate would then \nat least permit D.C. workers to be back on the job.\n  It is my hope that we can get an agreement on the Senate side that \nwould deem the conference report passed when received in the Senate; \notherwise we might have to stay here until late tomorrow evening. I do \nnot believe there will be any rollcall votes. If a rollcall vote is \nrequired on that bill, we would have to wait until Tuesday morning. But \nI believe under the urgency of passing this bill we can reach some \nagreement with colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  There will also be a vote on the motion to invoke cloture to proceed \nto the Labor-HHS appropriations bill sometime Tuesday morning after \nconsultation with the two leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/17/senate-section/article/S18790-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M., TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
