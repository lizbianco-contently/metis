Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 31, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 31) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to grant Congress and \n     the States the power to prohibit the physical desecration of \n     the flag of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Biden amendment No. 3093, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Hollings amendment No. 3095, to propose a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       Hollings amendment No. 3096, to propose a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       McConnell amendment No. 3097, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate must decide whether this \nis freedom or the abuse of freedom--this right here--evidenced by this \npicture of the flag being burned by a bunch of antiflag activists.\n  Mr. President, it comes down to this: Will the Senate of the United \nStates confuse liberty with license? Will the Senate of the United \nStates deprive the people of the United States of the right to decide \nwhether they wish to protect their beloved national symbol, Old Glory?\n  Is it not ridiculous that the American people are denied the right to \nprotect their unique national symbol in the law?\n  We live in a time where standards have eroded. Civility and mutual \nrespect--preconditions for the robust views in society--are in decline.\n  Individuals, rights are constantly expanded but responsibilities are \nshirked and scorned. Absolutes are ridiculed. Values are deemed \nrelative. Nothing is sacred. There are no limits. Anything goes.\n  The commonsense testimony of R. Jack Powell, executive director of \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in 1989 is appropriate here:\n\n       Certainly, the idea of society is the banding together of \n     individuals for the mutual protection of each individual. \n     That includes, also, an idea that we have somehow lost in \n     this country, and that is the reciprocal, willing giving up \n     of that unlimited individual freedom so society can be \n     cohesive and work. It would seem that those who want to talk \n     about freedom ought to recognize the right of a society to \n     say that there is a symbol, one symbol, which in standing for \n     this great freedom for everyone of different opinions, \n     different persuasions, different religions, and different \n     backgrounds, society puts beyond the pale to trample with.\n\n\n[[Page S18374]]\n\n  We all know that the flag is one overriding symbol that unites a \ndiverse people in a way nothing else can or ever will. We have no king. \nWe have no State religion. We have an American flag.\n  Today, the Senate must decide whether enough is enough. Today, the \nSenate must decide whether the American people will once again have the \nright to say, if they wish to, that when it comes to this one symbol, \nthe American flag, and one symbol only, we draw the line.\n  The flag protection amendment does not amend the first amendment. It \nreverses two erroneous decisions of the Supreme Court. In listening to \nsome of my colleagues opposing this amendment, I was struck by how many \nof them voted for the Biden flag protection statute in 1989. They \ncannot have it both ways. How can they argue that a statute which bans \nflag burning does not infringe free speech, and turn around and say an \namendment that authorizes a statute banning flag burning does impinge \nfree speech?\n\n  The suggestion by some opponents that restoring Congress' power to \nprotect the American flag from physical desecration tears at the fabric \nof liberty is so overblown it is hard to take seriously. These \noverblown arguments ring particularly hollow because until 1989, 48 \nStates and the Federal Government had flag protection laws. Was there a \ntear in the fabric of our liberties? To ask that question is to answer \nit--of course not. Individual rights expanded during that period while \n48 States had the right to ban physical desecration of the flag.\n  I should add that the American people have a variety of rights under \nthe Constitution. These rights include a right to amend the \nConstitution. The amendment process is a difficult one. The Framers did \nnot expect the Constitution to be routinely amended, and it has not \nbeen. There are only 27 amendments to the Constitution. But the Framers \nof the Constitution did not expect the Senate to surrender its judgment \non constitutional issues just because the Supreme Court rules a \nparticular way.\n  The amendment process is there, in part, as a check on the Supreme \nCourt and in an important enough cause. This is one of those causes.\n  Let me briefly address the pending amendments to Senate Joint \nResolution 31. The McConnell amendment is a killer amendment. It would \ngut this constitutional amendment. It will completely displace the flag \nprotection amendment should it be approved. A vote for the McConnell \namendment is a vote to kill the flag protection amendment. Senators \ncannot vote for both the McConnell amendment and the flag protection \namendment and be serious.\n  I say with great respect the Senator's amendment is a snare and a \ndilution. We have been down this statutory road before and it is an \nabsolute dead end.\n  The Supreme Court has told us twice that a statute singling out a \nflag for special protection is based on the communicative value of the \nflag and, therefore, its misguided view violates the first amendment.\n  Even if one can punish a flag desecrator under a general breach-of-\nthe-peace statute, the McConnell amendment is not a general Federal \nbreach-of-the-peace statute. It singles out flag desecration involved \nin a breach of the peace. Johnson and Eichman have told us we cannot do \nthat, we cannot single out the flag in that way. The same goes for \nprotecting in a special way only one item of stolen Federal property, a \nGovernment-owned flag, or protecting in a special way only one item, a \nstolen flag desecrated on Federal property.\n  We all know why we would pass such a statute. Do any of my colleagues \nreally believe we are going to fool the Supreme Court? Many of my \ncolleagues, in good faith, voted for the Biden statute and the Court \nwould not buy it. The Court took less than 30 days after oral argument \nand less than eight pages to throw the statute out, as they will this \none.\n  They will do exactly the same to the McConnell statute. Even if the \nMcConnell statute is constitutional--and it is not, with all respect--\nit is totally inadequate. Far from every flag desecration is intended \nto create a breach of the peace or occurs in a circumstance in which it \nconstitutes fighting words.\n  Of course, many desecrated flags are neither stolen from the Federal \nGovernment nor stolen from someone else and desecrated on Federal \nproperty. Indeed, most of the desecrations that have occurred in recent \nyears do not fit within the McConnell statute. Just as an illustration \nof its inadequacy, if the McConnell statute had been on the books in \n1989, the Johnson case would have come out exactly the same way. Why? \nThe Supreme Court said that the facts in Johnson do not support \nJohnson's arrest under either the breach-of-the-peace doctrine or the \nfighting words doctrine. Moreover, the flag was not stolen from our \nFederal Government. Finally, the flag was not desecrated on Federal \nproperty.\n  So the McConnell statute would not have even reached Johnson, and the \ncase would have come out exactly the same. What, then, is the utility \nof the McConnell statute, as a practical matter, other than to kill the \nflag protection amendment?\n  The Biden amendment, on the other hand, insists if we are to protect \nthe flag, we must make criminals out of veterans who write the name of \ntheir unit on the flag. If the statute that authorizes this had been \nenacted at the time, Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders would have \nbeen criminals. Why? Because they put the name of their unit on the \nflag they followed up San Juan Hill, the flag which over 1,000 of their \ncomrades died in protecting.\n  Moreover, the Biden amendment blurs the crucial distinction between \nour fundamental charter, the Constitution, and a statutory code. Read \nit. It actually puts a statute into the Constitution and, for the first \ntime, I might add, says Congress can vote up or down on it if it \nwishes. We have not done that in the 206 years during which we have \nlived under the Constitution. We cannot do that to our Constitution \ntoday.\n  This same amendment was rejected 93 to 7 in 1990. It has not improved \nwith age.\n  The two amendments by Senator Hollings on the balanced budget and \ncampaign finance reform are not relevant to the flag protection \namendment and therefore are subject to a point of order. They should be \ndebated and voted on at some other time, but do not destroy the flag \namendment because of irrelevant matters on this occasion.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support the flag protection amendment and \nreject the other amendments to be offered here today.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and ask any time be divided \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes in \nopposition be yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not believe that we are going to get \nAmericans to stop desecrating our flag as a consequence of amending our \nConstitution. I just do not believe it is going to happen.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Utah has a picture, a very \ndisgusting picture of a young man, I believe, a young boy, perhaps, \nburning an American flag. Much of the desire to pass this \nconstitutional amendment comes, in fact, from our observation that in \nsome isolated instances, young people, angry about something, will \ndesecrate a flag to make a point. Thus, we say, let us protect \nourselves from these acts by amending the Constitution or passing a \nstatute at the State level or passing, in this case, now in an amended \nform, a law at the Federal level saying that it is now against the law \nto desecrate the flag.\n  The respect for the flag is something that is acquired. One makes a \nchoice based upon an understanding of what the flag stands for, and \nthat understanding does not come in some simple fashion. It does not \ncome with a snap of our fingers: Amend the Constitution, pass a law, \nand thus, all of a sudden, young people all across the Nation--or \nadults, for that matter--will immediately acquire respect for the flag \nbased upon knowing that they will be punished if they do not.\n\n  That is basically the transaction here. We are saying, either respect \nthe flag or we will punish you by invoking the law and perhaps fining \nyou. I do not know, maybe there will be a jail sentence attached, some \nmandatory minimum perhaps that will be associated with the new criminal \nlaw of desecrating the flag. \n\n[[Page S18375]]\n\n  Let me be clear on this. Many people are very confused, because I \nheard some people say, ``It is against the law to desecrate the dollar \nbill. Why is it not against the law to desecrate the flag?'' It is \nagainst the law to desecrate our flag. You cannot go down to the Iwo \nJima Memorial or Arlington or up on the hill where the Washington \nMonument stands and burn a flag that is owned by the people of the \nUnited States of America. This issue here, this concern here is with a \nflag that some individual owns.\n  If the suspicion occurs, under this new constitutional amendment--I \nassume enabling legislation will occur as a consequence--that somebody, \nin their home, is desecrating their flag, it will now fall to the \npolice or to the Federal law enforcement officials, I suspect, \ndepending upon how the statute is written, to go into the home to make \nsure that individual is not desecrating his or her flag. That is the \nkind of response we are going to have our law enforcement people now \ncharged with the responsibility of making.\n  I understand. I have spoken many times with American Legion members \nin Nebraska who are very enthusiastic about this amendment, or Veterans \nof Foreign Wars members, or Disabled American Veterans members who are \nvery concerned about the loss of respect. They are very concerned about \nthe loss of character.\n  Indeed, one of the most impressive things in community service right \nnow, that has been over the course of my life, has been American Legion \neffort, and VFW and DAV effort, to provide programs for young people, \nto teach them the history of this country, to teach them about D-day, \nto teach them about what stands behind this flag, why this flag is so \nrevered by those of us who have served underneath it. But we see in \nthat moment, if it is Legion baseball or a VFW youth program, you see \nin that moment the kind of effort that is required to teach respect, \nfor a young person to choose to acquire the character necessary to give \nthe kind of reverence due the U.S. flag.\n\n  I know this amendment, now that it has been modified, stands an even \nbetter chance of passing. But make no mistake, there is going to be a \nconsequence to this vote. This is not one of those deals where you just \nvote on it and say, Now I have kept faith with the American Legion, the \nVFW, the DAV, that have been lobbying very hard on it. There will be a \nconsequence. We are going to pass a law and afterward there will be a \nlaw enforcement response. We are going to have an opportunity to \nmeasure, have we protected our flag as a consequence of amending the \nConstitution? Is there more reverence and respect? Do the young people \nof America now say, ``Gee, now that Congress has amended the \nConstitution, passed a law, and provided an environment where it is \ngoing to be illegal for us to burn the flag, we are now going to \nrespect the flag more''? I do not think so.\n  We see an increase today of consumption of illegal drugs by 12- and \n13- and 14- and 15-year-old youth who are using marijuana, who are \nusing cocaine, who are using illegal drugs. We already have a law on \nthe books where they will suffer tremendous consequences.\n  There is a decline in character today with the youth of America for a \nwhole range of reasons, but we are not going to reverse that decline by \nsimply passing a constitutional amendment and issuing a press release \nsaying that we respect the flag and all sorts of other glowing \nstatements that we might make.\n  I made a list of things that I would put down if I was trying to \ndetermine whether or not an individual had acquired, through effort, \nthrough work, through discipline, real character. It is not easy to do \nit. It is not just respect, reverence of the flag; it is respect and \nreverence for adults, the older people who have served, who put their \nlives at risk at Iwo Jima, who put their lives at risk at Normandy, who \nput their lives at risk at the Chosen Reservoir, who put their lives at \nrisk at Khe Sanh, who put their lives at risk in Desert Storm, who put \ntheir lives at risk in Bosnia, who put their lives at risk every single \nday they wear the uniform of the United States of America and train to \nfly a plane and train to do the work that we ask them to do to protect \nus.\n  There are 38,000 people today in South Korea, Americans serving this \ncountry, putting themselves at risk as the North Koreans continue to \npress.\n  We need to teach our young people what it means to serve, and guide \nthem in the acquisition of character and making the choices necessary \nto have character. To have character means that you are obedient to \nsomething higher than your own willful desire to satisfy short-term \nconcerns. Obedience is not easy. It is not easy to be obedient to your \nparents. It is not easy to be obedient to your country--to answer the \ncall, and say you are going to give yourself to some higher authority. \nIt is much easier to say, ``Well, you know, freedom means to be \nwillful. Freedom means to do whatever I want. It is not just burning a \nflag. If I want to consume marijuana, or consume cocaine, or do the \nopposite of what my parents tell me to do, that is what being free is \nall about. Freedom is not being obedient. That is to be a slave.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we need to teach young people that the pathway \nto freedom, in fact, is to be obedient to something other than your own \ndesire to satisfy some short-term concern, physical or otherwise. To be \nan individual that acquires character means that you pay attention to \nwhat is going on around you. You do not daydream. To pay attention \nrequires effort to note life around you--to note the passing not just \nof time. But your own life requires you to pay attention.\n  We need to help our young people learn what is necessary to do that.\n  Third, I put down on my list of things for an individual to acquire \ncharacter is that will have to learn to be considerate about others--\nnot self-centered but considerate.\n  What the flag burning issue is all about--what the desecration issue \nis all about--is do not necessarily offend somebody. Do not offend \nthem, not just by burning a flag, but by disrespecting their property \nrights, or disrespecting their right to speak. Be considerate of other \npeople.\n  That is one of the things that one needs, if they are going to \nacquire character. But you need to be conscious of time, and aware of \nthe gift of life.\n  All of us in this Chamber are old enough to have either been with \nsomebody who is dying, or seen somebody lose their life. And we know \nhow precious life is as a consequence of that loss. We have been with a \nparent, with a loved one, and have sat with them as the life left them. \nWe have sworn that moment that we would never forget how precious life \nis. And we committed ourselves, at least for a short period of time, \nto change our ways, to abolish and banish the habits that cause us to \nbehave in ways that we do not like and are not proud of.\n\n  One must acquire, in the words of Albert Schweitzer, ``a reverence \nfor life''--a respect for life as opposed to being not just \ndisrespectful but perhaps destructive as well; but all of these things, \nand more besides.\n  I made a list this morning. There are others beside the elements of \ncharacter that we are trying to teach our young people that cause us to \nbe alarmed when we watch daytime television, that lead to our wanting \nto amend the Constitution to protect the one symbol, the one icon that \ntends to bind us together as a nation. All of us have had various \nexperiences as a consequence of serving under that flag.\n  If you force people to respect the flag by amending our Constitution, \nor by passing a law, you are not going to have people respect the flag \nmore. That is not the pathway to produce less desecration of the flag--\nsomething, by the way, that happens very little at all. It is not, in \nmy judgment, a great threat to this country. What is a great threat to \nthis country is when 40 percent of our youth do not know what the cold \nwar was; when 50 percent do not know whether Adolf Hitler was an enemy \nin the Second World War; when a large percentage of people are unable \nto associate with any of the narrative of this country--any of the over \n200 years of narrative of heroic adventures and life laid down for \nfreedom that causes us in this moment to say, ``Well, let us try to \nestablish once and for all that we will have character in this country \nby amending our Constitution.''\n  Mr. President, I again know there is great desire on the part of the \nLegion, the VFW, and DAV, and many other well-intended people who are \nconcerned about the flag and want to protect the \n\n[[Page S18376]]\nflag. To protect the flag takes us down a much different and a much \nmore difficult road, one that I believe this country needs to follow. \nBut I do not believe at all that we are going to increase the amount of \nrespect that Americans have for their flag as a consequence of amending \nour Constitution. Indeed, I believe quite the opposite.\n  For those who think it is a fairly easy free vote--vote for it, and \nwalk away--there will be consequences. We are going to amend laws. We \nare going to have the spectacle of people being arrested in their home, \nthe spectacle of law-abiding citizens now being faced with all kinds of \nnew charges and accusations that they do not respect the flag \nsufficiently.\n  Mr. President, I hope that there are 34 votes in this Senate to block \nthis because I believe that the flag of the United States of America \nshould not be politicized. And I believe it will--not by the well-\nintended Senators who are here today on the floor in support of this \nresolution, but by the actions that will occur as a consequence of this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that the time of the \nopponents on this is controlled by Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). We are not certain who is \ncontrolling the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am an opponent of the amendment, so I yield myself \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be charged to \neither side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when we talk about the American flag, \nwe usually do not think of it as an abstraction. It is not just a \ndesign on canvas.\n  For most of us, the flag means even more than the treasured symbol of \nour Nation.\n  Often, we think about a particular American flag we have seen or \nowned, and the special memories that surround that flag.\n  Some of us may remember the flag our fathers took out every Fourth of \nJuly and displayed from a makeshift flagpole.\n  Some of us may remember saying the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag \nin our first grade classroom.\n  Or we may recall the beautiful sight of an American flag in a foreign \ncountry, reminding us of home and safety.\n  Personally, I think of the American flag that sits on the mantle in \nmy Senate office, folded up into a neat triangle.\n  There is not a day that goes by without me seeing that flag and \nthinking about it, if only for a minute or two.\n  I am very proud of that flag, because it was the flag that draped my \nfather's coffin at his funeral, after he died of cancer in 1990.\n  For the rest of my life, I will remember seeing that flag and being \nso proud that my father had earned the right to have an American flag \nlaid upon his casket--the highest military honor--by serving his \ncountry courageously in wartime.\n  My dad was a scout in the U.S. Army, fighting with the Allies in \nWestern Europe during World War II.\n  D-day had come and gone, and the Germans were aggressively \ncounterattacking, in the desperate hope that the Allies would lose \nheart and relent, allowing Germany to rearm and retain control over \nitself. This is what we came to call The Battle of the Bulge.\n  Being a scout was one of the most dangerous jobs in the Army, because \nyou usually went out alone or in small groups, with minimal firepower.\n  And the whole purpose of being a scout was to find the enemy--to \nlocate his position and strength, and then report that information back \nto the unit command.\n  Since you were virtually defenseless as a scout, you did not want to \nengage the enemy, but often that was unavoidable given the nature of \nthe task.\n  In fact, my dad lost two-thirds of his company in one hellish night \nof fighting; and he himself came home with the Purple Heart.\n  But at least he came home.\n  Those were difficult and anxious times, but there was also great \nclarity of purpose in America's participation in World War II.\n  And as I look at that folded-up flag in my office, what strikes me \nover and over again is that my dad voluntarily went to war--risked his \nlife like so many others of his generation--not because he was \ninterested in acquiring a piece of European real estate, but because he \nbelieved in the cause of freedom.\n  Protecting America's freedom--and restoring the freedom of other \nnations--that is why my dad went to war.\n  United States Rangers scaled the cliffs of Normandy not to conquer, \nbut to free. General MacArthur returned to the Philippines, not to \nconquer, but to free.\n  Even as we speak, American troops are deploying to Bosnia, not to \nconquer, but to bring freedom from centuries of ethnic violence and \nbloodshed.\n  Freedom is and always has been the great cause of America, and we \nmust never forget it.\n  If we have learned one thing from the astonishing collapse of global \ncommunism, it is that freedom eventually wins out over tyranny every \ntime. Ronald Reagan predicted it, and as usual, he was right.\n  Freedom is the most powerful weapon America has in a watching world. \nPreserving freedom--even when every impulse we feel goes in the \nopposite direction--sets an example for other nations to follow when \ntheir road to freedom gets rough.\n  If we allow ourselves to compromise on freedom, what can we expect \nyoung democracies like Russia and Ukraine to do, when they are faced \nwith the difficult issues and decisions that freedom brings?\n  If we want to spread freedom, we need to stand for freedom--without \nequivocation or compromise.\n  Just as importantly, freedom is what will preserve our own democracy \nfor the long run. Without freedom, America will cease to be America.\n  What does our freedom consist of?\n  Perhaps the most fundamental freedom is the first one enumerated in \nthe Bill of Rights: the freedom of speech. And freedom of speech means \nnothing unless people are allowed to express views that are offensive \nand repugnant to others.\n  The freedom of speech that is protected by the Constitution is not \nabout reaching consensus, it is about conflict and criticism.\n  Freedom of speech knows no sacred cows.\n  As all of us here are painfully aware, the high offices we hold \nprovide no insulation from attacks by the media, even those that are \ncompletely unfair and inaccurate.\n  And as much as I do not like it at times, that is the way it ought to \nbe.\n  As Justice Jackson wrote in the 1943 decision, West Virginia State \nBoard of Education versus Barnette:\n\n       If there is any fixed star in our constitutional \n     constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can \n     prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, \n     religion or other matters.\n\n  The reason we have a first amendment is that the Founders of this \nNation believed that, despite all the excesses and offenses that \nfreedom of speech would undoubtedly allow, truth and reason would win \nout in the end.\n  As one constitutional scholar put it, the answer to offensive speech \nis not more repression, but more speech.\n  To put it another way, the best regulator of freedom--as paradoxical \nas that sounds--is more freedom.\n  The Supreme Court also has made it clear that the first amendment \ndoes not protect just the written or spoken word.\n  That is because ideas are often communicated most powerfully through \nsymbols and action.\n  We do it all the time in political campaigns.\n  For example, as I have cited on this floor many times, the Supreme \nCourt has held that spending on political speech is constitutionally \nindistinguishable from the speech itself.\n  And because campaign spending is so closely linked to political \nspeech--the core of the first amendment--the Court has held that \nmandatory campaign spending limits are per se unconstitutional.\n  But that is only one example where something that appears to be \nconduct has a clear expressive purpose that falls within the ambit of \nthe first amendment. \n\n[[Page S18377]]\n\n  So to categorize something as conduct doesn't fully answer the \nquestion of whether it is also speech, and therefore protected by the \nConstitution.\n  Of course, when we see hateful people desecrating the American flag, \nwe are instantly repulsed by it.\n  It strikes at the core of our emotions.\n  And it is not only because we love the flag and all that it \nsymbolizes to us; it is also because of what is being communicated by \nsuch foul behavior.\n  Those who willfully desecrate our flag are saying that America is a \nlousy country, that its faults are beyond repair, and that it deserves \nto be torn down and reviled.\n  They are also saying--and this is something I take particular offense \nat--that men like my father--who spilled their blood to save America \nand liberate others--were involved in an unworthy cause.\n  Thus, burning the flag is a uniquely offensive way of disparaging \ntheir heroism and trivializing their sacrifice.\n  Ideas like these are not only reprehensible, they are also \ndemonstrably false.\n  They are lies: lies about America, and lies about those who fought \nand died for our country.\n  Nevertheless, as divisive and distorted as these ideas are, as much \nas they deserve to be condemned, they are still protected by the first \namendment.\n  The most revolutionary facet of our Constitution--what sets it apart \nfrom every other document in history--is that it confers its benefits \nnot only on those who love this land, but also on those who hate it.\n  For years, people in other countries saw it as a weakness that we \ntolerated so much vitriolic dissent in America.\n  Now they are realizing it is our strength.\n  I think of the powerful testimony of Jim Warner, a prisoner of war in \nNorth Vietnam from 1967 to 1973, whom I had the privilege of meeting \nthis year.\n  During his imprisonment, Jim had been tortured, denied adequate food, \nand subjected to over a year of solitary confinement.\n  When he was finally released, he looked up and saw an American flag. \nTo use Jim's own words, ``As tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I \nnever loved my country more than at that moment.''\n  One can only imagine how much it grieved this patriot when a North \nVietnamese interrogator showed him a photograph of some Americans \nprotesting the Vietnam war by burning an American flag.\n  The interrogator taunted Warner by saying, ``There. People in your \ncountry protest against your cause. That proves you are wrong.''\n  But Jim Warner mustered every bit of strength he had and replied \nfirmly, ``No--that proves I am right. In my country we are not afraid \nof freedom--even if it means that people disagree with us.''\n  As Jim tells the story, the North Vietnamese interrogator reeled \nback, ``His face purple with rage * * *. I was astonished to see pain, \nconfounded by fear, in his eyes.''\n  Drawing on that incredible experience, Jim Warner wrote the following \nabout the issue before us today:\n\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom.\n       When a flag was burned in Dallas to protest the nomination \n     of Ronald Reagan . . . he told us how to spread the idea of \n     freedom, when he said that we should turn America into a \n     ``city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.''\n       Do not be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  ``Spread freedom--spread freedom.'' If anything is a conservative \ncreed, that is it.\n  That is why so many die-hard conservatives flatly reject the idea of \na constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.\n  George Will called it a ``piddling-fiddling amendment.'' Cal Thomas \nsaid it was ``silly, stupid, and unnecessary.''\n  The National Review editorialized against it twice, saying it would \n``make the flag a symbol of national disunity.''\n  The College Republicans, in their newspaper the Broadside, argued \nthat a flag burning constitutional amendment would not accomplish much \nof anything.\n  And Charles Krauthammer warned that it would ``punch a hole in the \nBill of Rights,'' concluding that, ``If this is conservatism, \nliberalism deserves a comeback.''\n  And what about the liberals?\n  Nat Hentoff wrote that a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning \nwould itself be desecration of the flag and the principles for which it \nstands.\n  Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a hilarious essay in Time magazine, \nenvisioning all the legal conundrums that a flag desecration amendment \nwould create--especially in an age when flag motifs are used on \neverything from campaign bumper stickers to underwear.\n  At some point, flag desecration is in the eye of the beholder.\n  In all of these writings, from across the ideological spectrum, the \ntheme is the same: to use Jim Warner's deeply-felt words again: \n``Spread freedom. Don't be afraid of freedom. It's the best weapon we \nhave.''\n  Let me conclude with a brief story. The night of September 13, 1814, \nwas one of the darkest in our Nation's history.\n  The late Isaac Asimov wrote a fascinating account of this night, \nwhich was later published by Reader's Digest. I will attempt to \nsummarize it:\n  Three weeks before that fateful September night, the British had \nsucceeded in taking Washington, DC, and now they were heading up \nChesapeake Bay toward Baltimore.\n  Their strategy was clear: if the British were able to take Baltimore, \nthey could effectively split the country in two.\n  Then they would be free to wage war against the two divided sections: \nfrom the north, by coming down Lake Champlain to New England; and from \nthe south, by taking New Orleans and coming up the Mississippi.\n  All that lay in the path of the British Navy was Baltimore. But first \nthey had to get past Fort McHenry, where 1,000 American men were \nwaiting.\n  On one of the British ships was an American named Dr. Beanes who had \nbeen taken prisoner earlier. A lawyer by the name of Francis Scott Key \nhad been dispatched to the ship to negotiate his release.\n  The British captain was open to the idea, but they would have to \nwait; the bombardment of Fort McHenry was about to begin.\n  All through the night, Beanes and Key watched Fort McHenry being \npummeled by cannon shells and rocket fire.\n  They were close enough in to hear the shouts and screams of men in \nmortal combat.\n  And all night long, they could see the American flag flying defiantly \nover the fort, illuminated by the bombs and explosions.\n  But when dawn came, the bombardment ceased and a dread silence fell \nover the entire battlescape.\n  Dr. Beanes and Francis Scott Key strained to see any signs of life \nfrom the battered ramparts of Fort McHenry.\n  And what they saw brought them incredible joy: despite the brutal \nonslaught of the night before, the American flag--torn and barely \nvisible in the smoke and mist--still streamed gallantly over Fort \nMcHenry.\n  The message was clear: the British were not going to get to \nBaltimore--and the war had taken a decisive turn in America's favor.\n  So let us get one thing straight: our flag survived the British naval \nguns at Fort McHenry.\n  Our flag weathered the carnage and cannon-fire of a national civil \nwar.\n  Our flag still flapped angrily from the front deck of the U.S.S. \nArizona--even after she had been blown in half and sunk at Pearl \nHarbor.\n  And our flag stood tall in the face of machine-gun and mortar fire at \nIwo Jima.\n  Make no mistake: this is one tough flag--and it does not need a \nconstitutional amendment to protect it.\n  All it needs is hardy men and women who believe in freedom and have \nthe courage to stand up for it, whatever the circumstances.\n  Then we can say together with confidence the words Francis Scott Key \npenned after that September night in 1814: ``And the star-spangled \nbanner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of \nthe brave.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S18378]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to my friend and colleague. And \nthere are very few people I have as much admiration for as I do the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. I think he is a gracious man and \nwonderful Senator. He has led the fight on a lot of very good issues.\n  The McConnell amendment has two fundamental flaws that should \nconvince anyone who supports Senate Joint Resolution 31 or who wants to \nprotect the flag to vote to reject the Senator's amendment. First, the \nSupreme Court will certainly strike down the statute as contrary to its \ndecisions in Johnson and Eichman. Second, the McConnell amendment is so \nnarrow that it will offer virtually no protection for the flag. The \nMcConnell amendment would not even have punished Gregory Johnson, which \nis the cause celebre case that is really involved here, among others.\n  What message does that send about our society's willingness to defend \nits values?\n  The McConnell amendment's primary fault is that the Supreme Court, \nfollowing its mistaken Johnson and Eichman decisions, will strike it \ndown as a violation of the first amendment. Both Johnson and Eichman \nmake clear that neither Congress nor the States may provide any special \nprotection for the flag. Because the Court views the flag itself as \nspeech, any conduct taken in regard to the flag constitutes protected \nexpression as well.\n  As Prof. Richard Parker of Harvard University Law School concludes: \n``Since the flag communicates a message--as it, undeniably, does--any \neffort by government to single out the flag for protection must involve \nregulation of expression on the basis of the content of its message.'' \nSo a careful reading of Eichman bears this point out. Even though the \n1989 act was facially content-neutral, the Court found that Congress \nintended to regulate speech based on its content.\n  The McConnell amendment is not going to fool anyone, least of all the \nSupreme Court. Its purpose is clear: to protect the flag from \ndesecration in certain, narrow instances. Unfortunately, the Supreme \nCourt has said that the American people cannot do this, something they \nhad a right to do for almost 200 years, a right they had exercised in \n48 States and in Congress up to 1989, with the Johnson decision. Do we \nneed a third Supreme Court decision striking down a third flag \nprotection statute in just 6 years before the Senate gets the message?\n  Even if the Court were to find that the McConnell amendment was not \nintended to protect the flag from desecration, it will still find it \nunconstitutional. Under its decision in R.A.V. versus City of St. Paul, \nthe Court will strike down any statute that draws content-based \ndistinctions, even if, as in R.A.V., those distinctions are made within \na category of unprotected speech. Thus, even though fighting words or \nwords that incite a breach of the peace are unprotected, Congress \ncannot prohibit only certain types of speech within these areas of \nunprotected speech. However, it is this that the McConnell statute \nimpermissibly does.\n  In fact, the Court in R.A.V. made clear that this doctrine would be \napplied to any flag protection statute. As Justice Scalia wrote for the \nCourt: ``Burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against outdoor \nfires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation of an \nordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.'' Since the McConnell \namendment is not a law of general applicability, but instead is one \nthat singles out the flag for protection, it will be held to be \nunconstitutional by the Court.\n  Mr. President, the McConnell amendment is so narrow that it would not \neven have punished Gregory Johnson for his desecration of the flag. And \nin Johnson--this is a pretty good representation of what Johnson and \nothers did.\n  In Johnson, the Court held that unless there was evidence that a riot \nensued, or threatened to ensue, one could not protect the flag under \nthe breach of the peace doctrine. Small protection, that. Do we really \nwant to limit protection of the flag only to those narrow instances \nwhen burning it is likely to breach the peace? I think not.\n  Even if sections (b) and (c) of the McConnell amendment could survive \nconstitutional scrutiny, which I do not believe they can, they are no \nsubstitute for real flag protection. Only those who steal and destroy \nflags that belong to the United States, or only those who steal the \nflag from others and destroy it on Government property, can be punished \nunder the McConnell amendment. Gregory Johnson did not steal his flag \nfrom the United States; it was stolen from a bank building. He did not \nburn his stolen flag on Federal property. He burned it in front of city \nhall. If the amendment would not punish Gregory Johnson, who will it \npunish?\n  Adoption of the McConnell amendment will amount to the Government's \nunintended declaration of open season on American flags. Just do not \nburn it to start a riot. Just do not steal if from the Government. And \njust don't steal it and then burn it on Government property. Otherwise, \nthe McConnell amendment declares, flag burners are free to burn away, \njust like they did on this occasion, represented by this dramatic \nphotograph that is true.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support and cosponsor the McConnell \namendment to ban flag burning. I oppose the burning of our U.S. flag. I \noppose it today just as I always have.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly about this issue. I have voted \nfor legislation to prohibit flag burning, and I have voted against \namending the U.S. Constitution.\n  But, more than any other time in the past, I have grappled with \ntoday's vote to amend the Constitution to stop flag burning. This time \nthe debate is different.\n  I truly believe that our Nation is in a crisis.\n  Our country is in a war for America's future. It's that's being waged \nagainst our people, against our symbols and against our culture. And I \nwant to help stop it.\n  I firmly believe that we need a national debate on how to rekindle \npatriotism, values, and civic duty.\n  And if there is a way to do that, then I am all for it. It's \nimportant to me, and it's important to the future of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I do not--and never have--intended or wished to \ninhibit America's freedom of speech. In fact, the first amendment--and \nothers--got me where I am today.\n  I feel so strongly about this issue that I seriously considered \nsupporting an amendment to the Constitution.\n  But, my colleague from Kentucky has offered an alternative to \namending the Constitution that would protect the flag and protect the \nConstitution. I will support that alternative approach today.\n  Senator McConnell's proposal does not amend the Constitution, but it \nwill get the job done by punishing those people who help wage war \nagainst the symbol of this country and everything it stands for.\n  I know that we have gone down this road before by passing statutory \nlanguage to ban flag burning only to have the Supreme Court overturn \nit. But, the McConnell amendment should pass constitutional challenge.\n  If there is a way to deal with and punish those who desecrate our \nU.S. flag without amending the Constitution, I am all for it. That is \nwhy I support the McConnell amendment.\n  The McConnell amendment says you cannot get away with abusing the \nflag of the United States. It means that you can't get away with using \nthe flag to incite violence. The McConnell amendment says you can't use \nthis Nation's symbol of freedom and turn it into a symbol of \ndisrespect.\n  The McConnell amendment stands for the same things I do. It protects \nthe principles embodied in our Constitution--as well as our U.S. flag.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, my remarks will last a very few moments. \nI believe the Senator from Virginia was here before I was and is \nseeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. No. I will be speaking in accordance with the flag \namendment desecration, with Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to make certain very brief \ncomments on this pending resolution. For a \n\n[[Page S18379]]\nnumber of years, I have listened and been content--well, not always \ncontent, but I have listened--to the heated debate surrounding this \namendment, and I now feel compelled to interject some rich personal \nthoughts of my own.\n  Many of the comments I have heard that are taking issue with this \nplan to amend the Constitution center around the issue of free speech. \nOpponents claim that if the flag desecration amendment is adopted, it \nwill chill free speech, or will mean that a small majority will be free \nto determine exactly what activities constitute desecration. What these \noften self-proclaimed champions of free speech forget is that certain \nforms of speech are already regulated, including that category of \nspeech known as fighting words.\n  Back in the 1950's, I was honored to serve my country in the U.S. \nArmy. I served in the infantry in Germany for 2 years, in the 10th \nInfantry Regiment of the 5th Division, and with the 2d Armored \nDivision, ``Hell on Wheels,'' serving with the 12th Armored Infantry \nBattalion. Every single day for over 2 years, I got up in the morning \nand I saluted that flag, marched in military parades behind it, \nmaneuvered with it on the front of an armored personnel carrier, and \nwas ready to die for it. All of us who served in the military did that, \nfor that was our mission.\n  So when I see someone who has never been in the military--oftentimes \nyou see that--and someone who does not have a shred of respect for the \ncountry, but much cynicism--throw a flag on the ground and urinate on \nit, or burn it, and claim he or she is exercising his or her right to \nfree speech, it does rise to the level of fighting words to me, in my \nbook. And I would surely be willing to bet it does in the books of a \nlot of other law-abiding citizens of this great country.\n\n  That is where I am coming from, and there are those who have served \nin the military and those who feel just as strongly on the other side, \nand I respect those views. But I do have a lot of trouble with people \nwho were never in the military and hearing them express themselves on \nthe issue on either side. That is clear, in my mind. So I more deeply \nrespect the views of those who have worn the colors, who feel just as \nstrongly on the other side, but I have great trouble listening to the \nprattle of those who have never even served in the Civil Air Patrol.\n  Recently, I read an article on flag desecration by Paul Greenberg in \nthe July 6 copy of the Washington Times. He made several points I think \nbear reiterating. He claims, in a witty and substantial style, that \n``our Intelligentsia'' have done their level best to ``explain to us \nyokels again and again that burning the flag of the United States isn't \nan action, but speech, and therefore a constitutionally protected \nright,'' and they cannot understand why a vast majority of the American \npublic continues to want this amendment.\n  I agree with his conclusion that ``it isn't the idea of desecrating \nthe flag that the American people propose to ban.'' Anyone is free to \nstand and to state how much they detest the flag, hate the flag and all \nthat it stands for. ``It's the physical desecration of the flag of the \nUnited States that ought to be against the law.''\n  I could not agree more. For as Mr. Greenberg states so eloquently, \nsome things in a civilized society should not be tolerated--such as \nvandalizing a cemetery, scrawling anti-Semitic slogans on a synagogue, \nscrawling obscenities on a church, spray-painting a national monument \nor, surely, for that matter, burning of the American flag. It really \nought to be as simple as that. Period.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes against the time \nchargeable to those who oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise with a degree of reluctance because \nI'm taking the opposite side from so many friends, and veterans, and \nthose who believe very strongly that we ought to have some \nconstitutional protection for the flag.\n  But I myself feel very strongly that this would be the wrong move for \nus to make.\n  I, like many of our fellow Senators, served in the armed services. I \nserved in combat. I am one of those who has always respected the flag. \nI never fail to rise to render appropriate honors. Indeed, like all \nothers who served, I was willing to die for our flag if necessary--or \nfor the underlying freedoms that our flag represents. And yet I believe \nthat this amendment moves in the wrong direction.\n  We already have in place rules and regulations and statutes that \nprohibit desecration of our flag under certain circumstances. If the \nflag that is being burned does not belong to the individual that is \nburning it, there are already laws in place to cover that kind of \nphysical destruction--or desecration. If the flag is being burned for \nthe purpose of inciting a riot, or anything along those lines, there \nare already laws in place to prohibit that kind of activity.\n  Indeed, the manual that we have on our flag talks about the proper \nway to dispose of a flag. It is listed under ``Respect for the Flag.'' \nSection 176, paragraph K talks about the proper way to dispose of a \nflag that has been rendered no longer useful, one that is either \ntattered, torn, damaged, or somehow rendered less than an appropriate \nsymbol of our country. The appropriate way to dispose of that flag is \nto burn that flag.\n  The difference that we are talking about with this amendment is the \ndifference between an act and an expression of opinion, of speech. And \nit is in precisely those circumstances where the flag is burned to \nconvey a message that the freedom that the flag represents--the basic \ndemocracy of this country--is challenged.\n  We nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize many in other countries who \nstand up to dissent peacefully against their government, who say that \nthey believe their government is wrong for whatever reason. We have \nnominated, or others have nominated, everybody from Aung San Suu Kyi in \nBurma, who has just been released, to Nguyen Dan Que in Vietnam, Wei \nJing Sheng in China, Nelson Mandella in South Africa, many in the \nformer Soviet Union that were honored because they spoke up and spoke \nout.\n  And it is precisely when an individual is threatened by his or her \ngovernment when he or she begins to speak out, that basic freedoms and \ndemocracy are most threatened. We know that the first sign that freedom \nor democracy is in trouble anywhere around the world is when the \ngovernment starts locking up dissenters, when the freedom of the people \nto express their political opinions is stifled. And this is the \ndistinction--the distinction between an act and a message--that I hope \nthat we will be able to make when we consider this amendment.\n  The acid test of democracy is whether or not we can speak out in \npeaceful dissent against our Government without fear of being arrested, \nor prosecuted, or punished. And in this case, the amendment goes \ndirectly to the heart of that freedom.\n  Now I know that many who support this amendment--many of my fellow \nSenators, many other Members of Congress, and certainly leaders of \nveterans organizations, and others around this country--have a very \nnoble cause and purpose. But I happen to believe that cause and \npurpose--that expression of devotion to our country--is best served if \nwe don't amend the Constitution in this case.\n  Now I am not one that is arbitrarily opposed to amending the \nConstitution, but in this situation the amendment goes directly to the \nheart of what that Constitution protects for us and for all of our \ncitizens.\n  So I would respectfully urge all of my colleagues to think long and \nhard with all due deference to their patriotism and resist the \ntemptation to amend our Constitution in a way that would significantly \nundermine precisely the freedoms and the democracy that we seek to \nprotect.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as an American, and the daughter of a \ndisabled veteran, I take deep pride in our great Nation. To me, the \nflag symbolizes our strength, our democracy, and our unprecedented \nfreedoms--freedoms that set us apart from every other country in the \nworld. Our Constitution guarantees all of us this freedom, including \nthe right to free speech. I believe we should be very cautious about \n\n[[Page S18380]]\naltering this document, because to do so alters the fundamental ideals \non which our country was built.\n  I am deeply troubled by the implications of this proposal; namely, \nthat some people believe it is now necessary to force Americans to \nrespect their flag by enacting legislation demanding they do so. That \nis wrong and unnecessary. I do not believe this constitutional \namendment will result in Americans having greater respect for \nauthority, for our Government, or for our flag. Rather, I believe this \namendment reinforces the idea that reverence for one's country and the \nsymbols of one's nation must be imposed by law. And, I do not think \nthat is what the American people need, nor do I believe this principle \nis consistent with our Nation's history of uncoerced respect for our \ncountry and flag. Instead, I hope parents will instill in their \nchildren, just as I have in mine, a deep respect for the flag. I also \npray our Nation will never again be so divided that burning the flag \nbecomes popular or acceptable.\n  But it is my father who spoke most directly to my heart on this \nissue. In World War II, my father fought for this Nation in the Pacific \ntheater. He was wounded in battle and some doctors believe that the \nshrapnel in his leg may even be the cause of the multiple sclerosis \nfrom which he has suffered for the last 30 years. When I asked him his \nfeelings about this constitutional amendment, he was saddened and \noffended. He explained that he had not fought for the U.S. flag; he had \nfought and suffers still for the freedom that our flag symbolizes. That \nfreedom is what this Congress may vote to limit.\n  Mr. President, for the ideals embodied in our Constitution, for the \nrespect I have for all our flag represents, and most personally, for my \nfather's sacrifices, I will vote against this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \ndesecration of the U.S. flag because of what it says about our culture, \nour values and our patriotism. But I must vote against this amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I absolutely do not support the desecration of our \nflag. In 1989, I voted for legislation to prohibit flag desecration. \nAnd I regret that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I not only support the flag. I support what the flag stands for. Our \nflag stands for our Constitution. The meaning of our flag is embodied \nin our Constitution--especially the first amendment.\n  Today, I continue to oppose the desecration of our flag, and I call \non Americans to rekindle their patriotism, their values, and their \ncivic duty.\n  I ask with all the passion and patriotism in me, that those who speak \nabout constitutional rights, who talk about their freedom of speech, \nwho talk about their freedom of expression--that they exercise \ncommunity responsibility.\n  By community responsibility, I mean that each person take the right \nyou have to speak, to march, and to organize, but remember when we \ndesecrate symbols, we desecrate each other.\n  I do not wish to inhibit freedom of expression. But I want us to live \nin a culture that calls people to their highest and best mode of \nbehavior. But we are not doing that in our society today.\n  We cannot build a society for the 21st century that advocates \npermissiveness without responsibility. For every right there is a \nresponsibility. For every opportunity, there is an obligation.\n  I am very frustrated about what is going on in our country. I believe \nthere is a war being waged--against our people, against our symbols, \nand against our culture.\n  When I go into the neighborhoods, moms and dads tell me that the \ntoughest job in this country today is being a parent, providing for \ntheir families and teaching their children the values of our society.\n  Love your neighbor; love your country; be a good kid; honor your \nfather and your mother; respect each other. These moms and dads feel \nthat no one is looking out for them. The very values they teach in the \nhome are being eclipsed and eroded by the culture that surrounds us. \nAnd some children do not even get that much attention.\n  We should--and need to--have a national debate on these issues.\n  But we cannot change the culture by changing the Constitution. We \nchange the culture by living the Constitution--by speaking out \nresponsibly and by organizing. I support amendments to expand the \nConstitution, not constrict it.\n  Mr. President, I am a U.S. Senator because of amendments to the \nConstitution--amendments that allowed me to organize and to speak--\namendments like the 1st amendment and the 19th amendment.\n  The first amendment allowed me to speak up and speak out in protest \nto save a Baltimore community whose homes were about to be leveled for \na 16-lane highway.\n  We organized. We protested. We exercised free speech. I challenged \nthe thinking of city hall and all the road planners. The community \nliked what I was saying. I spoke for them and their frustrations, and \nthey encouraged me to run for political office.\n  That experience took me into neighborhoods where they said no woman \ncould win. But, I did. And the 19th amendment--which gave women the \nright to vote--helped me get here. And I made history. That happened \nbecause of amendments to the Constitution.\n  So, I know the power of the Constitution. And I know the power of \namending it.\n  But all the past amendments have expanded democracy and expanded \nopportunity. This amendment we consider today would constrict the very \nfreedoms that have allowed me to be here.\n  Mr. President, I am thankful to the people of Maryland who sent me \nhere, and America's veterans should know today I am voting for what \nthey fought for and all the people who work every day to make our \ncountry great.\n  Yes, I believe we can and should have a law to end the desecration of \nour flag. Yes, we need more community responsibility, more patriotism, \nmore civic participation, values, and virtue.\n  I hope to cast my vote today to continually use the Constitution to \nexpand democracy and not to constrict it.\n  Now is not the time to change the course. Now is not the time to \ntamper with laws, precedents and principles that have kept us in good \nstead for two centuries.\n  Mr. President, I take amending the Constitution very seriously, and I \nwill not vote today to change it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I support Senate Joint Resolution 31, \nthe Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995, introduced by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. Let \nme compliment my friend from Utah for his steadfastness on this complex \nand at times emotional issue.\n  As one who saw the Stars and Stripes go up at Iwo Jima, I can say I \nshare the feelings of pride for our flag that have been sincerely \nexpressed by Senators on both sides of this debate. If the flag \nsymbolizes this Nation and the freedoms it provides, the Constitution \nis the living legal document under which this nation was created and \npursuant to which those freedoms are guaranteed. While I have \nconsistently supported legislative measures to protect the flag from \nthose misguided souls who would deface it, I have been reluctant to \namend the Constitution to do so.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that passage of an amendment to the \nConstitution is the only avenue available to address this problem given \nthe fairly clear decisions that have been issued by the Supreme Court \non this precise legal point. In June 1989, the Supreme Court handed \ndown the landmark decision of Texas versus Johnson, in which it \noverturned a Texas statute punishing flag desecration on the grounds \nthat it violated the free speech protection guaranteed by the first \namendment to the Constitution. This holding had the effect of \noverturning 48 State flag desecration statutes, including the Texas \nstatute, and one Federal statute.\n  In October of that same year, this body passed the Flag Protection \nAct in direct response to the Johnson case. Legal scholars, including \nHarvard's Lawrence Tribe, advised Congress that the statutory approach \nbeing considered would pass constitutional muster. I supported this \nstatutory effort and opposed the constitutional amendment voted on \nlater that month.\n  On June 11, 1990, the Supreme Court, in U.S. versus Eichman, struck \ndown the flag protection statute which I had supported the prior year. \nOn June 26, \n\n[[Page S18381]]\n1990, the Senate failed in its attempt to assemble the two-thirds \nmargin necessary to pass the constitutional amendment. However, on this \noccasion I voted in favor of the constitutional amendment because of \nthe direct rejection of the statutory approach by the Supreme Court.\n  I intend to support Senate Joint Resolution 31 when it is voted on \nthis week. While I will continue to listen to the arguments in favor of \nand against the amendment proposed by my friend from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, I am not convinced it would be upheld by the Supreme Court. \nFurthermore, I am concerned that it would apply only in rare cases and \nthus leaves too great a loophole for those who wish to deface the flag.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is an important debate we are \nundertaking here today, in the Senate, because it focuses on changing \nthe cornerstone of American democracy: the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Constitution's principles transcend the few words which are \nactually written. Hundreds of thousands of American men and women have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in defense of these principles. And this \nremarkable, living document continues to inspire countless others \nstruggling in distant lands for the promise of freedom.\n  In the 204 years since the ratification of the Bill of Rights, we \nhave never passed a constitutional amendment to restrict the liberties \ncontained therein. In our Nation's history, we have only rarely found \nit necessary to amend the Constitution. There are only 27 amendments to \nthe Constitution--only 17 of these have passed since the Bill of \nRights.\n  The first amendment to the Constitution states:\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the \n     right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  The amendment before us would create a new constitutional amendment \nto enable the Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. \nflag.\n  Desecration of the flag is reprehensible. The issue for me is since \nthere are countless examples of actions and speech which are, in my \nopinion, morally reprehensible, are we starting down a path that will \nlead to amendment after amendment to the Constitution--changing the \nvery nature of that magnificent document. Some of these reprehensible \nareas for me are: Shouting obscenities at our men and women in uniform; \nburning a copy of our Constitution or the Declaration of Independence; \nspeaking obscenely about our country or its leaders; demeaning our \nNation in any way; burning the Bible; vile speaking about religion or \nGod; and denigrating the Presidency as an institution, no matter who is \nin office.\n  All these things are vile to me and I have nothing but contempt for \npeople who do such things. But, I think the question is this: Is it \nnecessary for the greatest Nation in the world to amend the greatest \ndocument in the world to outlaw each of these offenses?\n  The passage of a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag \ndesecration is a priority for this Republican Congress. The House of \nRepresentatives led the charge by passing the constitutional amendment \nin June.\n  So, I say to my colleagues here in the Senate: We have a choice to \nmake. Do we stand behind Speaker Newt Gingrich and the House of \nRepresentatives? Or do we stand with the Founding Fathers? I, for one, \nchoose to stand with the Founders--Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and \nBen Franklin, among others.\n  I believe that many flag burnings can be addressed by existing \nconstitutional statutes passed by the States and localities to prohibit \nor limit burning and open fires. States and localities have the ability \nto enforce these fire code provisions, thereby prohibiting or limiting \nincidents of flag burning for valid safety reasons.\n  For example, in the city of San Francisco, the city fire code \ncontains a general ban on open burning. It states:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to ignite, kindle, \n     light or maintain, or cause or allow to be ignited, kindled, \n     lighted, or maintained, any open outdoor fire within the city \n     and county of San Francisco.\n\n  In the cities of Chula Vista in San Diego County and Fountain Valley \nin Orange County, CA, open burning may only be conducted by notifying \nthe fire department or obtaining a permit. An individual who fails to \ncomply with the code can be found guilty of a misdemeanor.\n  In addressing open fires, the fire prevention code of New York City, \nstates:\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to kindle, build, \n     maintain or use a fire upon any land or wharf property within \n     the jurisdiction of the city of New York.\n\nViolation of the code results in money fines or imprisonment.\n  So, it is clear that authority already exists for States and \nlocalities to control or limit the burning of flags under their ability \nto protect the safety of their residents. And while this only covers \none form of desecration--burning--where a flag being desecrated belongs \nto someone else, or the United States, State laws against larceny, \ntheft, or destruction of public property can be invoked against the \noffender.\n  In addition, S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of \n1995, introduced by Senators McConnell, Bennett, and Dorgan, would \ncreate new statutory penalties for damage or destruction of the flag. I \nsupport S. 1335 as an effort to punish the reprehensible conduct of \nflag desecration in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\n  S. 1335 would criminalize the destruction or damage of the flag in \nthree circumstances. Where someone destroys or damages the flag with \nthe intention and knowledge that it is reasonably likely to produce \nimminent violence or a breach of the peace, under S. 1335, such actions \nwould be punishable with fines up to $100,000 and 1 year of \nimprisonment.\n  The McConnell legislation also creates stiff new penalties where an \nindividual intentionally damages a flag belonging to the United States, \nor steals a flag belonging to someone else and damages it on Federal \nland. In either situation, the individual could be subject to penalties \nof up to $250,000 in fines and 2 years of imprisonment.\n  By creating tough criminal penalties for desecration of the flag \nthrough statute, we punish reprehensible conduct without having to \namend the Constitution. Moreover, in a Congressional Research Service \nanalysis of the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995, the \nAmerican Law Division opined that S. 1335 should survive constitutional \nchallenge based on previous Supreme Court decisions.\n  Mr. President, desecration of one our most venerated objects --the \nAmerican flag--is deeply offensive to me and most Americans. But I do \nnot believe we need to modify our Constitution in order to protect the \nflag. We can protect the flag with existing laws and through the \nenactment of new criminal penalties for damage and destruction of the \nU.S. flag without having to alter our guiding document, the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I went to Vietnam because another Congress \ntold me I had to go to protect freedom--including the first amendment--\nand defeat communism. I went; and I am honored to have served, but, \nhere I am--today--forced to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nfight for freedom once again and engage my colleagues in a debate about \na flag burning amendment.\n  Those same colleagues--on one hand--want to amend the first amendment \nfor the first time in 200 years and abridge our most basic freedom in \nthe name of patriotism--and on the other--cut benefits for veterans \nwhich is--in my view--the most unpatriotic thing we can do.\n  This is the ultimate irony.\n  Over the last few months--they have come to this floor with endless \nspeeches about preserving this democracy--their agenda does exactly the \nopposite. It dishonors veterans with the most destructive budget to \nveterans that I have ever seen in my years here. My Republican \ncolleagues came to the floor with Medicaid cuts this year that would \nhave eliminated coverage for 4,700 Massachusetts veterans--2,300 of \nthem under the age of 65, disabled, and ineligible for Medicare \ncoverage. The remaining 2,400 are over 65 and 1,200 of them are in \nnursing homes.\n  Mr. President, if we vote to amend the Constitution and raise the \nsymbols of this Nation to the level of freedom itself, and we chip away \nat the first amendment to protect the flag--then what next? What other \nsymbol do we \n\n[[Page S18382]]\nraise to constitutional status? We all have special symbols to us that \nrepresent America and democracy, but to give them constitutional status \nis, at best, an extraordinary overreaction to a virtually nonexistent \nproblem. According to the Congressional Research Service there were \nthree--count them--three--incidents of flag burning in the United \nStates in 1993 and 1994. That is not exactly a major problem in our \ncountry.\n  Even Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute, in a recent editorial, said \nthat, and I quote:\n       This issue is left-over from the dimmest days of the Bush \n     administration, when a desperate grasp for symbols masked an \n     abject want of ideas.\n\n  And it was Ronald Reagan who said, as my colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, pointed out in his editorial yesterday in the \nWashington Post, ``Don't be afraid of freedom; it is the best weapon we \nhave.'' But here we are again--debating a constitutional amendment to \nabridge that freedom.\n  Mr. President, I, like everyone in this Chamber, abhor seeing anyone \nburning the flag under any circumstances. It hurts me to see it. It has \nalways hurt me. I thought it was wrong in the Vietnam era, just as I do \nnow, but I never saw the act of flag burning--nor could I ever imagine \nseeing it--as unconstitutional. To burn the flag is exactly the \nopposite--it is the fundamental exercise of constitutional rights--and \nwe cannot fear it, stop it, or set a precedent that abridges basic \nfreedoms to show our outrage about it.\n  What we must do is tolerate the right of individuals to act in an \noffensive, even stupid manner.\n  Mr. President, as a former prosecutor I know that most flag burning \nincidents can be prosecuted under existing law. If a person burns a \nflag that belongs to the Federal Government--that constitutes \ndestruction of Federal property, which is a crime.\n  Mr. President, 54 years ago last week, was the day that Franklin \nRoosevelt said would ``live in infamy.''\n  And I ask: Do we honor those who have served their country so ably, \nso bravely--do we honor our veterans by changing the first amendment, \nby trimming out fundamental freedoms they fought for?\n  In fact, I suggest that if we pass this constitutional amendment, \nthis day will go down--once again--as a day that will live in infamy. \nFor it will be the day when the greatest country on Earth limited the \nbasic freedoms because of the stupid, incentive, hurtful acts of a very \nfew people on the fringes.\n  We are better than that, Mr. President. We are smarter than that. We \nare smart enough to honor our Nation, our liberty, and our veterans \nwithout sacrificing our freedom.\n  In the final analysis, I think if Congress and the country want to do \nsomething serious to help our veterans, then we should focus on the \nquality of veterans benefits, the ability of veterans to have access to \nhealth care--on the POW/MIA issue and issues like agent orange. These \nare the serious bread-and-butter and health issues for those who \nsacrificed so much for America, and I'm working hard to make sure that \nAmerica keeps its contract with our veterans.\n  But I do not believe that keeping the faith with our veterans means \nchanging the first amendment for the first time in 200 years.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution is hardly a political tool to be \npulled from the tool chest when someone needs to tighten a nut or a \nbolt that holds together one particular political agenda.\n  This is not an easy vote for me. I've been told that there are \nveterans in my State--in Massachusetts--who feel so strongly about this \nissue that they will follow me all over the State if I vote against \nthis amendment; but let me make it very clear that to me the flag is a \nsymbol of this country, it is not the country itself. The Bill of \nRights is not a symbol; it is the substance of our rights--and I will \nnot yield on that fundamental belief and I will not yield in my deep \nand abiding commitment to the men and women who served this country and \nsacrificed so much for the freedoms symbolized by the Stars and \nStripes.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Members of this body should not risk the \ndesecration of our Constitution simply to express outrage against those \nwho desecrate the flag.\n  The issue before us today has absolutely nothing to do with condoning \nthe behavior of those few who choose to defile one of our most \ncherished national symbols. Every Senator is troubled when someone \nburns, mutilates, or otherwise desecrates an American flag. There is no \nquestion about that. The issue is whether we tinker with the Bill of \nRights in an attempt to silence a few extremists who openly express \ntheir contempt for our flag.\n  I am very reluctant to amend our the Constitution. In over 200 years, \nwe have only amended that fundamental text 27 times, and we have never \namended the Bill of Rights. In my view, we should not risk undermining \nthe freedoms in the Bill of Rights unless there is a compelling \nnecessity. I do not believe that the actions of a few flag burners has \ncreated that necessity.\n  Throughout our history we have recognized that the best remedy for \noffensive speech is more speech, and not a limitation on the freedom of \nspeech. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed this idea \nvery eloquently in his opinion in Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. \n616, 630 (1919):\n\n       [W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting \n     faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe \n     the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate \n     good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas--that \n     the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get \n     itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that \n     truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can \n     be carried out.\n\n  Clearly, flag burning has not fared well in the marketplace of ideas. \nAcross this country, Americans are quick to express their disdain for \nthose who desecrate the flag. The powerful symbolic value of our flag \nremains unscathed.\n  In the past, I have supported Federal statutes designed to balance \nthe need to protect the flag with the freedom of speech. In 1989, I \njoined with other Members of Congress to help pass the Flag Protection \nAct. In my view, that legislation was a measured response to this \nissue. Regrettably, the Supreme Court struck down that statute in \nUnited States versus Eichman.\n  This year, Senator McConnell has offered a more narrowly crafted \nmeasure. I will support that amendment and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same. We should continue to try to address this issue statutorily, \nrather than through the more dramatic step of amending the \nConstitution.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this effort to amend the \nConstitution. We should continue to speak out against those who would \ndesecrate the American flag, but we should not weaken its power by \nundermining the freedoms for which it stands.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today, the Senate is undertaking the solemn \ntask of the considering an amendment to our Nation's Constitution. \nIndeed, the proposed language we are considering would, according to \nthe Supreme Court and numerous legal observers, amend the Bill of \nRights, the very core of personal liberties and freedoms enshrined and \nprotected in our national charter.\n  The Congress has considered this issue before and while it has \nassented to statutorial protection of the flag, it rejected amending \nthe Constitution for the same purpose, positions that I supported. I do \nso again today, believing that the our flag should be cherished and \nrevered and find deliberated acts to desecrate it offensive. I also \nbelieve that the flag can be protected without infringing upon our \nfirst amendment guarantee of free expression.\n  In the Congress' last attempt to do so our approach was rejected by \nthe Supreme Court. I believe that this time, however, the more \ncarefully constructed statutes protecting the integrity of the flag \noffered by Senators Biden and McConnell today stand a much better \nchance of passing constitutional muster and hope that my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting them.\n  However, when it comes to amending the Constitution to prohibit flag \ndesecration, I simply believe that that approach goes too far. The \nprinciples enshrined by our Founding Fathers in the Bill of Rights have \nnot been altered in over 200 years and I cannot support the effort to \ndo so here. Make no mistake: I love and respect the American flag \n\n[[Page S18383]]\nand all that it symbolizes. Nevertheless, as I have often said, I \nsimply believe that our flag will wave more proudly if as we seek to \nprotect it, we also protect the Bill of Rights.\n  Accordingly, I cannot support the proposed constitutional amendment \nto prohibit flag descration.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our American flag is best protected by \npreserving the freedom that it symbolized. I cannot support a \nconstitutional amendment that would limit that freedom. At the same \ntime, I believe that anyone who burns the American flag is an \nungrateful lowlife who fails to understand how special and unique our \ncountry is, and I tremendously respect those New Jerseyans who support \nthis amendment and have urged my support with great dignity and \nconviction.\n  Like most Americans, I revere the flag as a symbol of our national \nunity. I want it protected from abuse. That is why I strongly supported \nthe Flag Protection Act of 1989, which sought to punish those who would \ndestroy our flag. That is why I regretted the Supreme Court's \nsubsequent decision in United States versus Eichmann, which declared \nthe law in violation of the first amendment. That is also why I \nenthusiastically support and today urge passage of another law that \nwould make it illegal for someone to burn a flag, if the act itself \nwould incite violence.\n  In our system, the first amendment is what the Supreme Court at a \nparticular time says it is. The Court has said that the Flag Protection \nAct violates freedom of expression. A future Supreme Court may reverse \nthat decision. Although I wish the Supreme Court had ruled the other \nway, it did not. The question now is whether protecting the flag merits \namending the Bill of Rights.\n  In making the decision to oppose this amendment, I consulted my heart \nand my mind. My heart says to honor all those who died defending \nAmerican liberty. My heart conjures up images of the marines holding \nthe flag on Iwo Jima, the crosses in the fields at Flanders, the faces \nof friends who never came back from Vietnam.\n  My heart says, what a nation believes in, what it will preserve, what \nit will sacrifice for, fight for, die for, is rarely determined by \nwords. Often people cannot express in language their feelings about \nmany things. How do I know?\n  Because I struggle with it every day.\n  Remember the pain you felt when the Challenger exploded before your \neyes? Remember the joy you felt when World War II and the Korean war \nended? Remember the shock you felt when you learned of the \nassassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King? Remember \nthe feelings of attachment you have for the Lincoln Memorial, the \nStatue of Liberty, the U.S. flag?\n  These are symbols and shared memories for places, events, and things \nthat tie us to our past, our country, and to each other, even when \nthere are no words at all. When someone gives respect and recognition \nto them, we are moved, sometimes to tears. When someone demeans them or \nshows disrespect, we are outraged.\n  My heart says honor the flag, and I do. My mind says, when our \nchildren ask why America is special among the nations of the world, we \ntell them about the clear, simple words of the Bill of Rights, about \nhow Americans who won our independence believed that all people were \nblessed by nature and by God, with the freedom to worship and to \nexpress themselves as they please. We found these truths to be self-\nevident before any other nation in the world did, and even before we \ncreated the flag to symbolize them.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed that fundamental to our democratic \nprocess was the unfettered expression of ideas. That is why the \namendment that protects your right to express yourself freely is the \nfirst amendment, and politicians should never put that right at risk.\n  Now if this constitutional amendment passes, we will have done \nsomething no Americans have ever done--amended the Bill of Rights to \nlimit personal freedom.\n  Even if you agree with the flag amendment, how can you know that the \nnext amendment will be one you will like? You cannot. So let us not \nstart. Once you begin chipping away, where does it stop? Do not risk \nlong-term protection of personal freedom for a short-term political \ngain.\n  America's moral fiber is strong. Flag burning is reprehensive, but \nour Nation's character remains solid. My best judgment says we are in \ncontrol of our destiny by what we do every day. We know the truth of \nMrs. Barbara Bush's words that America's future will be determined more \nby what happens in your house than by what happens in the White House.\n  I have traveled America for over 25 years. I know we still have \nstandards, insist on quality, believe in hard work, honesty, care about \nour families, have faith in God.\n  A rapidly changing world looks to us to help them define for \nthemselves what it means to be free. Our leadership depends more than \never on our example. This is the time to be confident enough in our \nvalues, conscientious enough in our actions, and proud enough in our \nspirit to condemn the antisocial acts of a few despicable jerks without \nnarrowing our basic freedoms.\n  My mind says that the best way to honor those who died to preserve \nour freedom is to protect those freedoms and then get on with the \nbusiness of making America a better place.\n  I took an oath to support and to defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Each Senator has to decide in her own mind and in his \nown heart what he feels he must do, to fulfill the promise he made to \npreserve and to stand by the Constitution. Different Senators will \narrive at different answers. For me, this amendment does not preserve \nthe Constitution. To the contrary, it constricts, narrows, limits--\nmakes it less than it was before. To preserve means to keep intact, to \navoid decay, but this amendment would leave freedom of expression less \nintact, less robust, more in a state of decay. To support an amendment \nwhich would, for the first time in 204 years, reduce the personal \nfreedom that all Americans have been guaranteed by the Constitution \nwould be, for me, inconsistent with my oath. I will never break my \noath.\n  Finally, in his dissenting opinion on flag burning, Justice Stevens \nwarned us about using the flag ``as a pretext for partisan dispute \nabout meaner ends.'' Politics can be a mean business, but it can also \nbe a glorious business. Sometimes an event has unexpected consequences. \nLet's be frank; there is patriotism on both sides of this debate. So \nlet me tell you what I believe about patriotism.\n  Patriotism--I know how it feels to be proud to be an American. I \nremember how I felt back in 1964 when the United States Olympic \nbasketball team defeated the Soviet Union in the finals--I remember \nstanding on the victory stand, with the gold medal around my neck, \nchills running up and down my spine, as the flag was raised and the \nnational anthem played.\n  I was proud to have won--for myself and for my country.\n  Patriotism--it is like strength. If you have it, you do not need to \nwear it on your sleeve.\n  The patriot is not the loudest one in praise of his country, or the \none whose chest swells the most when the parade passes by, or the one \nwho never admits we could do anything better.\n  No, a patriot is one who is there when individual liberty is \nthreatened from abroad, whether it is World War I, World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, or even the wrongheaded action in Beirut in 1983--yes, that \ntoo. All those who served in these conflicts were defending liberty as \nour democracy chose, in its sometimes fallible way, to define the need \nto defend liberty.\n  But you do not need a war to show your patriotism. Patriotism is \noften unpretentious greatness. A patriot goes to work every day to make \nAmerica a better place--in schools, hospitals, farms, laboratories, \nfactories, offices, all across this land. A patriot knows that a \nwelfare worker should listen, a teacher should teach, a nurse should \ngive comfort. A patriot accords respect and dignity to those she meets. \nA patriot tries, in a secular as well as a spiritual sense, to be his \nbrother's keeper.\n  When the only grandfather I ever knew came to America, he went to \nwork in a glass factory. He worked with his hands, and he worked long \nand hard. After work he lived for three things: The first thing he \nlived for was going to the public library on a Saturday night to check \nout western novels, \n\n[[Page S18384]]\nwhich he would read and reread over and over again. The second thing he \nlived for was to sit on his front porch on summer nights with a \nrailroad whistle in the background and listen on the radio to his real \nlove, baseball. And the third thing he lived for was to tell his \ngrandson--me--what America meant to him.\n  He said America was great because it was free and because people seem \nto care about each other. Those two, freedom and caring, are the two \ninseparable halves of American patriotism. As Americans who love our \nflag, we must not sacrifice the substance of that freedom for its \nsymbol, and we must learn to care more about each other. We must not \nrestrict our fundamental freedom. To do so, I believe, would betray the \nmeaning of the oath I took to support the Constitution and the promise \nI made to myself to always do what I thought was right.\n  I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the proposed \nconstitutional amendment. I detest flag burning, but I also love the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  This country stands for a set of ideals of human freedom that are \nembodied in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and symbolized by \nthe American flag. There are a handful of individuals who hold these \nideals in such disrespect that they choose to express their hostility \nby taking a copy of the Constitution--or the flag--and burning it or \ntearing it up. The Supreme Court has ruled that however despicable this \naction may be, our Constitution protects these misguided individuals in \nthe expression of their views--just as it protects the expression of \nhateful and despicable ideas by other misguided individuals.\n  As much as I revere the flag, I love the Constitution, the Bill of \nRights, and the liberties that are enshrined in them. In a 1989 \nWashington Post article, James Warner--who was captured and held as a \nprisoner of war by the Vietnamese--eloquently explained the vital \nimportance of the principles of freedom embodied in our Bill of Rights. \nMr. Warner stated:\n\n       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph \n     of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No,'' I said. ``That proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.''\n\n  I cannot let the despicable actions of the few who choose to express \ntheir misguided impulses by attacking our flag cause me to amend the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights that have served us so well for 200 \nyears. To do so would be to enable those few individuals to achieve \nsomething that no power on earth has been able to accomplish for over \ntwo centuries--to force us to modify the basic charter of our liberties \nthat are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.\n  Our Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the adoption of \nthe Bill of Rights in 1789. The Bill of Rights itself has never been \namended. A constitutional amendment is an extremely serious step, which \nis justified only to address a grave national problem. In this case, \nthe proposed constitutional amendment is directed at an extremely small \nnumber of cases that have had no discernible impact on the health or \nsecurity of the Nation. As the Port Huron Times Herald pointed out on \nOctober 14--\n\n       Less than a handful choose flag-burning as their means of \n     protest. It is so distasteful a display that no clear-\n     thinking citizen could endorse it.\n\n  We should not agree to amend the Bill of Rights, which protects our \nmost basic freedoms, to address the extreme behavior of a few erratic \nindividuals.\n  I also do not believe that the proposed amendment is likely to \nsucceed in actually protecting the flag in any case, because people who \nare so deluded or misguided as to burn a flag simply to get our \nattention are no less likely to do so just because there is a law \nagainst it. Indeed, they may be more likely to burn the flag if they \nbelieve that violation of a constitutional amendment will attract more \nattention to their antics. As the Traverse City Record-Eagle stated on \nNovember 2, a constitutional amendment--\n\n       . . . won't even stop those few people who want to raise a \n     ruckus by burning the flag from doing so. In fact, the extra \n     attention a constitutional amendment would focus on the act \n     might even encourage it.\n\n  Mr. President, the proposed amendment, as drafted, could also be \neasily evaded. The amendment does not define the flag. Does it cover \nJasper Johns' famous painting of overlapping flags? Does it apply to a \nT-shirt with a picture of the flag on it? How about wearing a flag T-\nshirt with holes in it? Is a 49-star flag a flag of the United States? \nDoes it apply if a flag is hung upside down? Would it prohibit the use \nof the flag in commercial advertisements? These questions, and dozens \nlike them, would be left unanswered.\n  So the amendment would not only amend our Bill of Rights for the \nfirst time, it would do so without realistic prospect of successfully \npreventing the offensive activity at which it is directed.\n  Senator Biden's substitute amendment, unlike the underlying proposal, \nwould at least address the objective actions of a person who burns or \ndestroys a flag, rather than the subjective state of mind of that \nindividual. I voted for the Biden alternative because it is preferable \nto the underlying proposal, even though it does not correct most of the \nproblems that I have outlined.\n  Flag burning is reprehensible. If we could bar it by statute, without \namending the bill of rights, I would do so. Indeed, I have voted for a \nflag-burning statute in the past and I voted for the McConnell-Bennett-\nDorgan statute when it comes up for a vote. But I am not willing to \ntinker with our Bill of Rights and for this reason, I cannot vote for \nfinal passage of the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  In my view, Mr. President, we can show no greater respect to the flag \nthan by showing contempt for those who disrespect it, while preserving \nthe freedoms for which it stands. The constitutional amendment that is \nbefore us today is the same amendment that I voted against in 1990. My \nposition has not changed, and I shall again vote against this proposed \namendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 31, the flag protection constitutional amendment. As an \noriginal cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 31, I am pleased to see \nthat this important measure will be coming before the Senate for a \nfinal vote today.\n  Mr. President, the flag of the United States is the central, \nunifying, and unique symbol of our great Nation. Throughout our \nhistory, tens of thousands of Americans have given their lives while \nserving under our flag in time of war. In my own family, my father, \nDonald E. Smith, died in a Navy service-related incident during World \nWar II. My family was presented with his burial flag. That flag means a \ngreat deal to us.\n  Desecrating the American flag is a deliberately provocative act. It \nis also an attack on the Nation itself, as symbolized by our flag. Such \nacts do not merit the protection of the law. On the contrary, those who \ncommit them deserve to be punished by the law.\n  Mr. President, this constitutional amendment ought not to be \nnecessary. The need for it became clear, however, when the Supreme \nCourt of the United States struck down as unconstitutional both a State \nand a Federal flag protection statute. The Court held that such \nstatutes violate the free speech protections of the first amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I strongly disagree with those Supreme Court decisions. As the Court \nitself has recognized, our Nation's treasured right of free speech is \nnot absolute. One does not have the right to yell fire! in a crowded \ntheater, for example. In exceptional cases when the Government's \ninterests are sufficiently compelling, the right to free speech may be \ncarefully circumscribed. The Government's interest in protecting our \nNation's central, unique symbol are sufficiently compelling, in my \nview, to justify limiting the right of political dissenters to \ndesecrate the flag.\n  Mr. President, while the great Constitution that the Founders framed \nhas survived many tests, it also has been amended 26 times. The people \nof the United States are not forced to accept a Supreme Court decision \nwith which they fundamentally disagree. The Constitution itself grants \nthe people, as represented by the Congress and the State legislatures, \nthe right to amend it in order to reverse erroneous decisions by the \nCourt. \n\n[[Page S18385]]\n\n  I recognize that amending the Constitution is serious business. That \nis why we took the intermediate step of fashioning a Federal flag \nprotection statute in the wake of the Court's decision striking down \nTexas's State law. When the Court also struck down the Federal statute, \nwe had no choice but to move forward with this flag protection \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nconstitutional amendment authorizing the Congress to enact legislation \nto protect our Nation's great flag. I am optimistic that this measure \ncan be passed by the requisite two-thirds majority of the Senate today \nand will be submitted to the States for prompt ratification.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Hatch and \nHeflin to urge passage of the proposed constitutional amendment \ngranting Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nflag of the United States.\n  Our flag occupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of \ncitizens as a cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. As a national \nemblem of the world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be \ntreated with respect and care. Our free speech rights do not entitle us \nto simply consider the flag as personal property, which can be treated \nany way we see fit including physically desecrating it as a legitimate \nform of political protest.\n  We debate this issue at a very special and important time in our \nNation's history.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Allies' victory in the \nSecond World War. And, 54 years ago last week, Japanese planes launched \nan attack on Pearl Harbor that would begin American participation in \nthe Second World War.\n  During that conflict, our proud marines climbed to the top of Mount \nSurabachi in one of the most bloody battles of the war. No less than \n6,855 men died to put our American flag on that mountain. The sacrifice \nof the brave American soldiers who gave their life on behalf of their \ncountry can never be forgotten. Their honor and dedication to country, \nduty, freedom, and justice is enshrined in the symbol of our Nation--\nthe American flag.\n  The flag is not just a visual symbol to us--it is a symbol whose \npattern and colors tell a story that rings true for each and every \nAmerican.\n  The 50 stars and 13 stripes on the flag are a reminder that our \nNation is built on the unity and harmony of 50 States. And the colors \nof our flag were not chosen randomly: red was selected because it \nrepresents courage, bravery, and the willingness of the American people \nto give their life for their country and its principles of freedom and \ndemocracy; white was selected because it represents integrity and \npurity; and blue because it represents vigilance, perseverance, and \njustice.\n  Thus, this flag has become a source of inspiration to every American \nwherever it is displayed.\n  For these reasons and many others, a great majority of Americans \nbelieve--as I strongly do--that the American flag should be treated \nwith dignity, respect and care--and nothing less.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone shares this view.\n  In June 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the Flag Protection Act of \n1989, legislation adopted by the Congress in 1989 generally prohibiting \nphysical defilement or desecration of the flag, was unconstitutional. \nThis decision, a 5-4 ruling in U.S. versus Eichman, held that burning \nthe flag as a political protest was constitutionally protected free \nspeech.\n  The Flag Protection Act had originally been adopted by the 101st \nCongress after the Supreme Court ruled in Texas versus Johnson that \nexisting Federal and State laws prohibiting flag-burning were \nunconstitutional because they violated the first amendment's provisions \nregarding free speech.\n  I profoundly disagreed with both rulings the Supreme Court made on \nthis issue. In our modern society, there are still many different \nforums in our mass media, television, newspapers and radio and the \nlike, through which citizens can freely and fully exercise their \nlegitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have \nto say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of Americans \ncitizens.\n  When considering the issue, it is helpful to remember that prior to \nthe Supreme Court's 1989 Texas versus Johnson ruling, 48 States, \nincluding my own State of Maine, and the Federal Government, had anti-\nflag-burning laws on their books for years.\n  Whether our flag is flying over a ball park, a military base, a \nschool or on a flag pole on Main Street, our national standard has \nalways represented the ideals and values that are the foundation this \ngreat Nation was built on. And our flag has come not only to represent \nthe glories of our Nation's past, but it has also come to stand as a \nsymbol for hope for our Nation's future.\n  Let me just state that I am extremely committed to defending and \nprotecting our Constitution--from the first amendment in the Bill of \nRights to the 27th amendment. I do not believe that this amendment \nwould be a departure from first amendment doctrine.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to uphold the great symbol of our \nnationhood by supporting Senator Hatch and the flag amendment.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my firm \nsupport for Senate Joint Resolution 31. As an original cosponsor of \nthis resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to prohibit the \ndesecration of the flag, I believe enactment of this resolution is an \nimportant step in restoring the right of this society to protect the \nsymbol of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the people of Idaho have clearly expressed their \ndesire to be able to protect Old Glory. I am pleased to note the Idaho \nState Legislature passed a resolution to this effect 2 years ago. In \nasking the Congress to present an antiflag desecration amendment to the \nStates for ratification, the Idaho Legislature stated, ``. . . the \nAmerican Flag to this day is a most honorable and worthy banner of a \nnation which is thankful for its strengths and committed to curing its \nfaults, and a nation which remains the destination of millions of \nimmigrants attracted by the universal power of the American ideal . . \n.''.\n  Some have claimed the passage of this resolution will weaken the \nsanctity of the first amendment. To these people I would ask, was the \nfirst amendment weak during the first 198 years after its ratification? \nUntil the Supreme Court ruled flag desecration to be protected free \nspeech in 1989, 48 States and the Federal Government had statutes which \npenalized an individual for desecrating the flag. I do not believe the \ntime in our Nation's history prior to 1989 may realistically be viewed \nas a dark period in which Americans were denied their constitutional \nrights. The truth is, protecting the flag of the United States has long \nbeen a proud part of our national history. What we are attempting to do \ntoday is preserve that history.\n  In fact, I believe it is interesting to note that the Supreme Court \nspecifically noted in 1974 Smith versus Goguen that flag desecration \nwas not protected speech under the Constitution. In overturning a \nMassachusetts State law which protected the flag, the Court ruled that \nthe problem was the vagueness of the State law, not the underlying \nprinciple of the law. The Court went on to say, ``Certainly nothing \nprevents a legislature from defining with substantial specificity what \nconstitutes forbidden treatment of United States flags.'' The Court \nfurther noted that the Federal flag desecration law, which was in \neffect at the time, was acceptable because it prohibited ``only acts \nthat physically damage the flag.'' This law remained in effect until \nthe Court s 1989 ruling.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to meet the men and women of our Armed Forces around the \nworld. These individuals put their lives on the line regularly, so that \nwe may live in peace and safety. And while they are serving us, the \nAmerican public, they do so under the Stars and Stripes. For those who \nare stationed overseas, the flag represents the rights and freedoms \nwhich they stand prepared to defend, even while on foreign ground. It \nalso stands for their home, the Nation which proudly awaits their \nreturn when their duties are completed. For those who have finished \ntheir service to their country, the flag is a constant \n\n[[Page S18386]]\nreminder that the ideals for which they fought still live, and that \ntheir sacrifices were not in vain.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe any of us here today wants to limit \nor restrict the right of Americans to speak out in an appropriate \nmanner. In fact, numerous Members of this body on both sides of the \naisle have taken advantage of this right to speak out against \nGovernment policies, and, undoubtedly, will continue to do so whether \nor not they are Members of the Senate. I simply believe the physical \nmutilation of the flag falls outside the range of speech which should \nbe protected. I also believe the citizens of the United States should \nhave the opportunity to decide for themselves, whether they also feel \nthe flag deserves special protection. That is what this resolution is \nall about. And it is this principle that I ask my colleagues to support \ntoday.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nto amend the Constitution of the United States to protect the American \nflag. We have recently revised the language in order to address the \nconcerns of a few of my colleagues. They have voiced reservations about \nallowing behavior toward the flag to be governed by a multiplicity of \nState laws. The language we have added to the amendment establishes \nthat Congress, and not the States, must adopt a uniform standard for \nprohibited conduct as well as for a definition of the ``flag of the \nUnited States.'' I believe the amendment as it now stands is \nstrengthened by these revisions.\n  Although much has been said about how this amendment will put a \nmuzzle on the first amendment, this is not true. The adoption of this \namendment will not diminish the first amendment's hallowed place among \nour liberties. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson, the \nmajority of the States had laws on their books which banned the \ndesecration of the American flag. Prior to Johnson, free speech under \nthe first amendment flourished, including unpopular opinions and \npolitical speech. I do not expect this to change once the amendment is \nadopted.\n  The opponents have hinged their fight against this amendment on the \ndecisions of the Supreme Court in two opinions. First is the case of \nTexas versus Johnson, a 5-to-4 decision, in which the Court held that a \nTexas statute protecting the flag granted it special legal protections \nwhich offended the Court's concept of free speech. Second is United \nStates versus Eichman, in which the Supreme Court, again in a 5-to-4 \ndecision, struck down a content neutral statute enacted by the Congress \nfollowing the Johnson decision.\n  In their dissent in Johnson, the Justices make clear the reasoning \nthat I believe is behind many of the supporters of the amendment. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist for himself and Justices O'Connor and White stated:\n\n       For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a \n     unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness \n     that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag \n     burning in the way respondent Johnson did here.\n\n  It is the flag's uniqueness which we realize makes it more than \nsimply a piece of cloth that needs special protection. It is a symbol \nthat stands for patriotism, love of country, sacrifice, freedom--values \nthat are the essence of what it means to be an American.\n  Senator McConnell has introduced a bill, S. 1335, which is designed \nas a statutory protection for the flag. While I appreciate the efforts \nof the Senator from Kentucky, I do not believe that a statute would be \nupheld under the strict scrutiny of the Supreme Court. The Court in \nEichman was clear that no statute will pass muster if it singles out \nthe flag of the United States for protection against contemptuous \nabuse.\n  S. 1335 invokes the fighting-words doctrine, and seeks to punish any \nperson who destroys a U.S. flag ``with primary purpose and intent to \nincite or produce imminent violence or breach of the peace.'' According \nto legal experts, the Supreme Court in Johnson expressly rejected the \napplication of the fighting words or imminent breach of the peace \nrationales offered by the Texas statute. This precedence in hand along \nwith other recent decisions of the Court will not allow this statute, \nif passed, to stand.\n  It has been suggested that a statute which is facially neutral or \ncontent neutral could survive the strict scrutiny of the Supreme Court; \nI do not believe that is so. First, for the statute to be truly \nfacially neutral it would have to ban any and all forms of destruction \nof the American flag. Second, a facially neutral statute which did not \npermit an exception for disposal of a worn or soiled American flag by \nburning would not be desirable nor acceptable to most Americans.\n  Unfortunately, for the statute to be truly content or facially \nneutral, it could not allow for any intentional destruction of the \nflag, including the burning of a worn or soiled flag. Any variation \nfrom completely neutral language would undermine the entire statute \nand, in all likelihood, would be found to be in violation of the first \namendment under the Court's strict scrutiny test.\n  During the debate surrounding this amendment, a question has been \nraised as to precisely what conduct is prohibited under the amendment. \nIt has been claimed that by using the term ``desecration,'' we would \noutlaw almost any use of the flag or its image outside of displaying it \nin a parade or on a flag pole. I think that this is an incorrect and \nunfair interpretation of the conduct we are attempting to prohibit.\n  Those who interpret the language as overly broad have suggested that \nthis amendment should be limited to outlawing only the burning, \nmutilation, or trampling of the flag. Although these are acts which I \nfind despicable, I find acts such as spitting, urinating, wearing the \nflag as underwear to be equally outrageous. Unfortunately, under the \nlimitations some have suggested to the amendment, these acts would be \nallowed. I do not think that this is what the American people had in \nmind in their support of this amendment.\n  Since the Supreme Court persists in striking down State and Federal \nstatutes, regardless of how carefully crafted those statutes are, we \nhave no alternative. The only avenue which remains open for protecting \nthe American flag from desecration is through the procedure required to \namend the Constitution of the United States. This procedure is \ndifficult, and for very good reasons. The last time an amendment was \nratified was almost 4 years ago; that was the 27th amendment, which \ntook over 200 years to ratify.\n  Because of the sanctity of the Constitution, I do not take lightly an \namendment, but as I stated, we have no alternative. I believe that the \ncitizens of this Nation do not want to see the Constitution amended in \nmost instances, but I also believe that they have shown through their \nactions that the protection of the flag is an important issue. Those \nactions include the grassroots support of groups such as the Alabama \nDepartment of Reserves Officers Association of the United States, which \npassed a resolution urging the U.S. Congress to pass this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of passage of this resolution. \nBy voting in support of this resolution we send this matter to the \nStates and let the people in each State make the final decision on this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I approach any constitutional amendment \nwith hesitancy--especially one induring the first amendment.\n  At the outset, I believe there is a major difference between an \namendment seeking to change the text of the first amendment--as is now \npending in the House of Representatives on freedom of religion--and one \nto overrule a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  For me, a 5 to 4 decision on flag burning does not merit the \ndifference due the language of the Bill of Rights. There is nothing in \nthe text on freedom of speech requiring protection for flag burners. \nWhile their speech will still be protected, their acts will be \nprohibited.\n  In a somewhat analogous context, I have sponsored and pressed for a \nconstitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in \nBuckley versus Valeo, which extended the protection of freedom of \nspeech to an individual who spends unlimited amounts of his or her own \nmoney for a candidacy for public office.\n  It is accepted that freedom of speech is not absolute or unlimited. \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes articulated the classic statement that a \nperson is not free to cry fire in a crowded theater. In a similar vein, \nthe Supreme Court has interpreted the first amendment to exclude from \nits protection incitement to \n\n[[Page S18387]]\nimminent lawless action, fighting words, obscenity, libel, and \ninvasions of privacy.\n  Based on the precedents and general principles of constitutional \ninterpretation, it is my judgment that Texas versus Johnson was \nincorrectly decided. The burning of the flag is conduct--not speech. I \nhave great respect for robust debate to the extreme. But a speaker may \nexpress himself or herself with great vigor without insults or \nexpressions that would be reasonably interpreted as fighting words.\n  Since I studied Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire in law school, I have \nbeen impressed with the import of the fighting-words doctrine. In \nChaplinsky, the defendant was criminally charged when his speech \nangered a mob and almost caused a riot. He claimed his speech was \nprotected by the first amendment. The Supreme Court unanimously \nrejected his argument, holding:\n\n       . . . the right of free speech is not absolute at all times \n     and under all circumstances. There are certain well-defined \n     and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and \n     punishment of which have never been thought to raise any \n     Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, \n     the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or `fighting' \n     words--those which by their very utterance inflict injury or \n     tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been \n     well observed that such utterances are no essential part of \n     any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social \n     value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be \n     derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social \n     interest in order and morality.\n\n  I take a back seat to no one in protecting constitutional rights and \ncivil liberties. For years I have stood against those who have sought \nto strip the Federal courts of their jurisdictional to hear \nconstitutional cases involving subjects such as school prayer and \nbusing. I have opposed efforts to breach the wall of separation between \nchurch and state and to weaken the exclusionary rule. Earlier this \nyear, I opposed proposals in the counterterrorism bill to expand wire-\ntap authority and to deport aliens using secret evidence in violation \nof the basic norm of due process.\n  Our law acknowledges and respects expectations. People have real, \nlegitimate and reasonable expectations that the flag of the United \nStates will be treated with honor and respect.\n  Some of the Supreme Court's most liberal Justices, the greatest \ndefenders of our civil liberties, have forcefully held flag burning is \nnot protected speech. Chief Justice Earl Warren:\n\n     . . . the States and the Federal Government do have the power \n     to protect the flag from acts of desecration and disgrace.\n\nJustice Hugo Black, the ardent exponent of first amendment absolutism:\n\n     [i]t passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American flag an offense.\n\nJustice Abe Fortas articulated:\n\n     . . . the reasons why the States and the Federal Government \n     have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \n     committed in public.\n\n  The Bill of Rights has a special sanctity in establishing our \nNation's values. There is no part of the text of the Bill of Rights \nwhich I would agree to amend.\n  While substantial deference should be given to Supreme Court \ndecisions on constitutional interpretation, there are some \ncircumstances where amendment is warranted, especially on split \ndecisions like the 5 to 4 vote in the flag-burning case.\n  Like fighting words in Chaplinsky, libel in Sullivan, incitement of \nimminent lawless action in Brandenburg, and invasion of privacy in \nCantrell, my judgment is that flag burning is not constitutionally \nprotected by the first amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have lamented on a number of occasions \nthe erosion of civility in our public discourse. This is a trend that \nhas had a negative impact on our politics and on the relationship \nbetween the Government and the citizenry. The heightened level of \nrhetoric, the slash-and-burn tactics, and the accusations of bad faith, \nhave made it more difficult for politicians to communicate with each \nother and to communicate with those we represent. It has made it more \ndifficult for reasonable people to reach agreement and far too easy for \nunreasonable voices to dominate the debate.\n  The breakdown in the tone of our discourse is symptomatic of a wider \nproblem which many have described as a deterioration of civil society. \nOur civil society is the collection of public and private institutions, \nand accepted moral principles, that bind us together as a community of \ncitizens. Civil society is what makes us a nation of community, rather \nthan merely a group with common voting rights.\n  There is abundant evidence that our civil society is fraying around \nthe edges. People lack faith in the capacity of government to act in \nthe interest of the people. There is a growing lack of confidence in \nour public schools--one of the great unifying forces in our country. \nAmericans are less engaged in fewer communal activities than we once \nwere. We are much more apt to stay at home to rent a video, communicate \non the faceless Internet, or channel-surf on cable TV, than we are to \nattend a PTA meeting, march in a parade--or even join a bowling league, \nas one Harvard professor's study revealed.\n  It is against this background that today we consider the \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag. The \nargument for protecting the flag is a weighty one: The U.S. flag is a \nunique symbol of our nationhood. When our troops go to battle to fight \nfor our Nation, they march under the banner of the flag; each day when \nour children go to school, they pledge allegiance to the flag; when a \nnational leader or world dignitary dies, the flag is flown at half \nmast; when one of our athletes wins a gold medal at the Olympic Games, \nthe flag of the United States is raised; when a soldier or police \nofficer dies, his or her coffin is draped with the flag; when \nimmigrants are naturalized, they salute to the flag.\n  In this diverse Nation, respect for the flag is a common bond that \nbrings us together as a nation. Our common reverence for the flag is \npart of what makes us citizens of a country, not just individuals that \nhappen to live in the same geographic area.\n  There is also no denying that when the flag is burned, desecrated, \ndespoiled, or trampled upon, the potency of the flag as a symbol is \ndenigrated. When the flag is burned, whether by Iranian fundamentalists \nduring the hostage crisis or by American protestors here at home, we \nare rightly outraged because these acts represent a direct affront to \nour Nation. By tolerating flag desecration, we are condoning actions \nthat undermine the fabric of our national life.\n  Critics of the flag amendment have reminded us that because flags \nowned by the Government are still protected under current law, this \namendment will only restrict what individuals can do with flags that \nthey own personally. But the flag is not a mere piece of property like \na car or television, it is more than the fabric and dye and stitching \nthat make it up. The design of the American flag and the values it \nrepresents belong to all of us; in a sense, it is community property. \n``We the people'' maintain part ownership of that flag and should be \nable to control how our property may be treated.\n  This is not a very radical principle. Federal law already controls \nwhat we can or cannot do with our own money. Anyone that ``mutilates, \ncuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates'' a dollar bill can be fined \nor put in jail for 6 months. Similarly, in O'Brien versus United States \nthe Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a protestor that burned his \ndraft card on the ground that the Government had a substantial interest \nin protecting a document necessary for the efficient functioning of the \nselective service system. Why is our interest in protecting currency or \nGovernment documents any stronger than protecting our greatest national \nsymbol?\n  Opponents of the flag amendment also maintain that it trivializes the \nBill of Rights by carving out an exception to the first amendment. This \nargument is based on the classic libertarian belief that truth can only \nemerge from complete freedom of expression and that the Government \ncannot be trusted to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable \nforms of action or speech.\n  This first amendment absolutism, however, is contrary to our \nconstitutional tradition. The list of types of speech that may be \nregulated or banned by the Government according to our Supreme Court \nprecedents is lengthy: libel, obscenity, fighting \n\n[[Page S18388]]\nwords, child pornography, deceptive advertising, inciteful speech, \nspeech that breaches personal privacy, speech that undermines national \nsecurity, nude dancing, speech by public employees, infringements of \ncopyright, and speech on public property, to name a few.\n  And consider how narrow the flag amendment's restriction of speech \nreally is and how little it limits our ability to protest against the \nGovernment. Even if the amendment is enacted one could still write or \nsay anything about the Government; one could still burn a copy of the \nConstitution or effigies of political leaders; indeed, one could put a \npicture of a flag being burned on the Internet and circulate it to \nmillions of people across the world with the push of a button.\n\n  Recall the words the protestors chanted while Gregory Lee Johnson set \na flag on fire and gave rise to this entire controversy: ``Reagan and \nMondale, which will it be? Either one means World War III. Ronald \nReagan, killer of the hour, perfect example of U.S. power. America, the \nred, white, and blue, we spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will \ngo under.'' So regardless of whether we have a flag amendment, there \nare a multitude of ways to heap contempt on the government, should one \nchoose to do so. The effect of the amendment on free expression would \nbe negligible.\n  I also want to take issue with the contention that our liberal \ntradition prohibits us from ever making substantive value judgments \nabout what is good speech and what is not or that we must always remain \nindifferent or neutral with respect to the ideas and images that \nbombard us over the airwaves or through the media.\n  Senator Dole touched on this in a speech he gave earlier this year \ncriticizing the violent movies being produced in Hollywood these days. \nIt isn't inconsistent with the first amendment to speak out against \nmovies that contain dozens of shootings, or gruesome acts of violence \nthat are then copied in real life only days after the initial \nscreening. It isn't an act of government censorship for politicians to \ncriticize music containing lyrics that denigrate women, glorify cop \nkillers as role models, and promote racial divisiveness.\n  Likewise, it is not government censorship when the people amend the \nConstitution to prohibit one narrow, repulsive form of expression. The \nprocess of amending the Constitution does not consist of a dictatorial \ntyrant exercising power over enslaved subjects; rather it is the act of \nfree people exercising their sovereign power to impose rules upon \nthemselves. By enacting this amendment through the process set forth in \narticle V of the Constitution, ``We the people'' will be determining \nthat the message being expressed by those who burn the flag is not \nworthy of legal protection. The amendment represents a subjective, \nvalue-laden judgment by the people that our interest in preventing the \ndamage that flag desecration inflicts upon our national character \noutweighs the meager contribution that flag burning makes to the \nadvancement of knowledge and understanding of ideas. The Supreme Court \nbalances interests in this manner in almost every constitutional case \nit decides. Why is it that we have no qualms about deferring to the \nvalue-judgments made by unelected jurists but we become squeamish when \nmaking such judgments through our most solemn act of self-government--\namending the Constitution?\n  I do not believe this flag amendment sets a bad precedent by carving \nout an exception to the first amendment or that the people will act \nirresponsibly by amending the Constitution in a frequent or cavalier \nfashion. For one thing, the Constitution, in its wisdom, makes that too \ndifficult to do. Also, I trust the people. They understand the value of \nliberty. They understand that the only way for truth to emerge is \nthrough the exchange of ideas. They understand that it is a slippery \nslope from government-controlled censorship to tyanny. I am confident \nthat it will be the rare occasion that the people make an exception to \nour general tolerance for free expression by targeting a form of \nexpressive activity for special treatment. And I am confident that our \nnational character will be improved, not weakened, by the protection of \nour unique symbol of nationhood.\n  I agree with Justice Stevens' opinion in Texas versus Johnson. He \nsaid:\n\n       The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. Even \n     so, I have no doubt that the interest in preserving that \n     value for the future is both significant and legitimate.\n       Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the \n     public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value, both \n     those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those \n     who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it. That \n     tarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free \n     expression occasioned by requiring an available, alternative \n     mode of expression, including words critical of the flag, be \n     employed.\n\n  So I support this resolution to send the flag protection amendment to \nthe States for ratification. And I urge my colleagues to support it as \nwell.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  How much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I gave a more lengthy speech on this \nsubject last Friday. In fact, I talked for about an hour, I guess, \nbecause I felt strongly about what was going on with this piece of \nlegislation. Rather than repeating those remarks of last Friday, I call \nattention to an article that appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer \nearlier this year by a columnist, Dick Feagler, a friend of ours who I \nhave known for a long time. Dick writes sometimes with a humorous bent \nand a serious twist to it at the same time.\n  I read this into the Record in the time I have remaining here because \nI think it pretty much says it all. The title is, ``Flag Should Stay \nSacred in Our Minds, Not Law.'' His article goes on like this:\n\n       Here they go again. Congressional Republicans, backed by \n     some Democrats, are pushing for a constitutional amendment \n     against burning the flag.\n       That old bandwagon has more miles on it than your grandma's \n     Edsel. But there are always plenty of new passengers eager to \n     hitch a ride. In our area, freshman Congressman Steven C. \n     LaTourette has climbed aboard for a short trip toward the \n     stoplight of reason.\n       Every four years or so, I have to write a column about this \n     issue and it always makes me feel bad. I am a flag guy. I was \n     raised on John Wayne movies. I feel good on the Fourth of \n     July, and humble on Memorial Day. I am the kid who, at age \n     12, slipped a sternly worded note under the door of a \n     merchant who never took his flag down at sunset. There's a \n     grand old flag flying next to my front door 20 feet from \n     where I'm writing this--\n       So every time this comes up, I ask myself, why don't I just \n     go along with it. It would be so much easier. It would make \n     my feel proud and patriotic and as American as a Marysville, \n     Honda. Why not just support changing the Bill of Rights to \n     keep Old Glory safe from the punks and the fanatics?\n       Well, because it's dumb, that's why. That's one reason. \n     There's a deeper reason, but I'll deal with the dumbness \n     first. After all, as some of you keep reminding me, I've got \n     enough dumbness in me now without increasing my inventory.\n       If we make it against the law to destroy a flag, exactly \n     what kind of flag are we talking about? Are we only talking \n     about the official flag, made, I believe, in Taiwan, that you \n     buy at the post office? How about the flag my father still \n     has with 48 stars on it? Is that still THE flag?\n       Suppose I run up a flag on my Singer and leave off a couple \n     of stripes and a handful of stars? If I burn that, will I \n     land in federal court? Who would go to that much trouble, you \n     ask? Pal, you don't know your punks and fanatics.\n       How about if I draw a flag on a piece of paper? Can I bum \n     that? Suppose I draw it in black and white but it is still \n     unmistakably a flag? Does it count? How about those little \n     flags on toothpicks you stick in cocktail weenies? If I singe \n     one of those will the FBI come vaulting over the patio hedge \n     to nail me? Are we going to write a brand new amendment to \n     the Constitution the covers the flag on the seat of a biker's \n     britches? Is a flag decal a flag?\n       Back in the '60s, I covered a dozen rallies where people \n     burned their draft cards. The frequency of draft-card \n     pyromania was so great that nobody bothered to apply for a \n     replacement. When the hippie at the microphone announced it \n     was arson time, the protesters just lit anything they weren't \n     planning to smoke. If I announce I'm burning a flag, does \n     that count, even if I'm not?\n       Who is going to write the constitutional amendment that \n     sorts all this out? It's beyond my poor powers, Yank George \n     M. \n\n[[Page S18389]]\n     Cohan is dead, and even if he was still with us, I doubt he could do \n     better than a C-minus with this assignment.\n       I said there was a deeper reason. And there is.\n       you can't destroy the flag. Nobody ever has.\n       The British tried it twice and gave up forever. The South \n     ripped the flag in two and slipcoverd their half, but we \n     glued it back together with the blood of Gettysburg and \n     Chattanooga. The flag always came through, just like the song \n     about it says.\n       The Kaiser couldn't damage it. Hilter couldn't; Mussolini \n     couldn't; Tojo gave it a really good try, but he couldn't. \n     The flag survived the Chosen Reservoir and the Mekong muck.\n       And after all of that, we think we need a constitutional \n     amendment to protect it from some crazy-eyed young idiot with \n     a Bic to flick and a mouth full of narcissistic anti-\n     government claptrap? We think that one match and a TV camera \n     can do something that 200 years of world-class thugs couldn't \n     do? I hope we have more faith than that.\n       Once in one of my lengthening number of yesteryears, it was \n     my job to remove flags from the caskets of dead soldiers and \n     fold them and present them smartly to mothers and widows. \n     Those were always emotional moments.\n       But I never thought I was handing over THE flag in exchange \n     for a young man's life. Both I and the woman behind the veil \n     knew that the flag worth dying for is the big one you can't \n     see or touch but you know is there. Right up there under God, \n     like it says in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n       The only kind of help that flag needs from Congress is a \n     nation worthy of it.\n\n  That concludes his writing. It was in the Plain Dealer earlier this \nyear. I think that pretty much says it all.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 8 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I could not add a whole lot to that.\n  Let me say this. I do not know how we administer this thing if we do \nhave it put into effect. I always thought we were supposed to be one \nNation--one Nation--not a nation that passes amendments that says we \nare going to break this up and let 50 States make up their own minds \nabout how they want to treat the flag. I think that is our job here, \nand I think we do it for the Nation right here. I think it is a mistake \nto let all this go out to the States.\n  I remember back in 1976 we were celebrating the Bicentennial and we \nhad bikinis, flag bikinis advertised in papers. I remember once \nwatching a rock and roll concert that year, and it was quite a \nspectacle. It was one to make your blood boil, because the lead \nguitarist, who was bared from the waist up, did not have a shirt or \nanything on, but he is going at it and strumming and banging away on \nthis thing. Pretty soon his pants started to slide down, and, lo and \nbehold, you guessed it: He had flag shorts on. The audience went wild.\n  I find that more objectionable than I do some of the things we are \ntalking about, to protect the flag here from burning it. I do not know \nwhether body fluids get spilled on the flag in situations like that, \nwith the bikinis or whatever. But I find that reprehensible. Is that \ncovered under something like this? We are leaving this up to 50 \ndifferent States, yet we quote a Pledge of Allegiance that says ``one \nNation''--one Nation, not a Nation of 50 separate entities, all free to \nmake their own rules about how they want to treat the flag--``under \nGod, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' We do not say \njust for some and not for others, and we do not say the flag should \nhave different treatment in different parts of the country either.\n  So I disagree with this approach that says there is such a big \nproblem out there we somehow need to do something, passing a \nconstitutional amendment to take care of a nonproblem, really. There is \nnot a great, huge rash of flag burnings out there that showed \ndisrespect for the flag. I was told there were none last year. Then I \nwas corrected by some of the veterans who visited me in my office a few \ndays ago last week, and they said, no, they could verify there were \nthree flag burnings this year.\n  We have just under 270 million people in this country. That means one \noffense for every 90 million people. I really do not see that as being \na tremendous problem for our country. We have a solution here out \nlooking for a problem to solve. That does not make much sense to me.\n  The flag symbolizes the freedoms we have. It is not the freedoms \nthemselves. It is not the freedoms themselves, and those are the things \nthat are important. Everyone on both sides of this issue, both sides of \nthe aisle love and defend the flag, and if anyone came in here and \ntried to burn a flag right here there would be enough people to attack \nthat person, I can guarantee you, that we would take care of it \nourselves. That is the way most of these things will be taken care of \nback in our individual States.\n  Without a doubt, the most important of the values are covered in the \nBill of Rights. If we had not had that Bill of Rights put together, you \nknow some of the States were prepared to not approve the Constitution \nof the United States. In that very first amendment we cover some very, \nvery sacred things. We say in that very first amendment, ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech''--which is deemed to mean other examples--``or of the press; or \nthe right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of grievances.'' That is all there is in that \narticle. It covers those things, but how important they are. Without \nthat, we would not have had a Constitution of the United States.\n  My time is up, Mr. President. If anyone wishes to look at my remarks \nin more detail, the Congressional Record of last Friday has it \ncomplete. My time is up and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the July 24, 1995, Washington Post \npublished a letter from Donald D. Irvin of Fairfax, VA. He wrote:\n\n       It is regrettable that a constitutional amendment to \n     protect the flag is necessary as a way to express the will of \n     the people in response to the misconception of the Supreme \n     Court. But this is hardly the first time that this has had to \n     be done.\n       For example, the Dred Scott decision had to be corrected by \n     the 13th and 14th amendments. Neither should have been \n     necessary, but while the Supreme Court is an indispensable \n     branch of government, on occasion the people have to \n     ``explain'' the Constitution to it.\n       Although it is not incorporated within the text of the \n     Constitution itself, Americans cite the pledge of allegiance \n     to the flag ``and to the republic for which it stands.'' The \n     republic is based upon the Constitution, which all \n     naturalized citizens and those serving in military and \n     official positions are sworn to defend. While native-born \n     citizens are not otherwise required formally to make such an \n     oath or to pledge allegiance to the flag--and indeed are free \n     to refuse to do either without legal sanction--neither should \n     they be free physically to desecrate the ultimate symbol of \n     the Nation. . . .\n       There always will be a few demented souls who may desecrate \n     the flag or violate any law. But arcane legal theories aside, \n     too many people have sacrificed their lives for this country \n     so that the rest of us can live free for us not to honor \n     their memory and our allegiance to the republic by expressing \n     through our highest standard of man-made law that Americans \n     will not tolerate the wanton desecration of the one symbol \n     ``for which it stands.''\n\n  I urge my colleagues to heed the commonsense voices of the American \npeople and send this amendment to the States.\n\n\n                              Common Sense\n\n  Mr. President, I know there are lawyers and nonlawyers on both sides \nof the issue before us. But there has been a fair amount of discussion \nof legal principles involved in the flag protection debate. Frankly, \nlawyers sometimes make matters more complicated than they really are. \nThat is one way lawyers drive up their market value. Sometimes a \nhealthy dose of common sense goes much farther than lawyer talk in \nilluminating an issue.\n  In his trenchant dissent in the Texas versus Johnson case in 1989, \nJustice John Paul Stevens put the same thought this way:\n\n       The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible \n     force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. \n     Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln, schoolteachers like Nathan Hale \n     and Booker T. Washington, the Philippine Scouts who fought at \n     Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha Beach. \n     If those ideas are worth fighting for--and our history \n     demonstrates that they are--it cannot be true that the flag \n     that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of \n     protection from unnecessary desecration. [491 U.S. at 439].\n\n  In other words, denying the American people the right to protect \ntheir flag defies common sense.\n  Now, I wish we did not have to do this by constitutional amendment. \nWe should not have to do so to ensure that the people can protect their \nflag. \n\n[[Page S18390]]\n\n  I, like Earl Warren, Abe Fortas, Hugo Black, and Justice Stevens, \nbelieve the Constitution empowers Congress to protect the flag from \nphysical desecration. But the Supreme Court twice has made clear that \nthe statutory protection of the flag--because it is the flag--will be \nstruck down under its interpretation of the Constitution. We have no \nchoice here. Once the Supreme Court, by the narrowest of margins--5 to \n4--orders us otherwise, and slams the door on us--and they did so \ntwice--only the people can reverse that decision. And, in this process \nas prescribed under Article V of the Constitution, it is now up to the \nSenate to give the American people the opportunity to do so, if they so \nchoose.\n  By sending this amendment to the States for ratification, the Senate \nopens the door to no other amendment, or statute, precisely because the \nflag is unique. There is no slippery slope here. The flag protection \namendment is limited to authorizing the Federal Government to prohibit \nphysical desecration of a single object, the American flag. It thus \nwould not serve as a precedent for any legislation or constitutional \namendment on any other subject or mode of conduct, precisely because \nthe flag is unique. Moreover, the difficulty in amending the \nConstitution serves as a powerful check on any effort to reach other \nconduct, let alone speech which the Supreme Court has determined is \nprotected by the first amendment.\n  This amendment does not allow Congress to prohibit any thought or \npoint of view, but rather one narrow method of dramatizing that thought \nor viewpoint--by prohibiting one form of conduct; regulating action, \nnot speech. No speech and no conduct, other than physical desecration \nof the American flag, can be regulated under legislation that would be \nauthorized by the amendment.\n  As former Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper testified:\n\n       . . . if prohibiting flag desecration would place us on [a \n     slippery slope of restrictions on constitutional protection \n     of expression for the thought we hate,] we have been on it \n     for a long time. The sole purpose of the Flag Protection \n     Amendment is to restore the constitutional status quo ante \n     Johnson, a time when 48 states, the Congress, and four \n     Justices of the Supreme Court believed that the legislation \n     prohibiting flag desecration was entirely consistent with the \n     First Amendment. And that widespread constitutional judgment \n     was not of recent origin, it stretched back about 100 years \n     in some states. During that long period before Johnson, when \n     flag desecration was universally criminalized, we did not \n     descend on this purported slippery slope into governmental \n     suppression of unpopular speech. The constitutional calm that \n     preceded the Johnson case would not have been interrupted, I \n     submit, if a single vote in the majority has been cast the \n     other way, and flag desecration statutes had been upheld. Nor \n     will it be interrupted, in my view, if the Flag Protection \n     Amendment is passed and ratified.\n\n  That is the testimony of Charles J. Cooper, who, of course, was \nAssistant Attorney General of the United States, and is one of the \nleading constitutional experts here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue. This issue will \ndetermine whether the United States wants to return to the values of \nprotecting its national symbol the way it should be.\n  Should we pass this amendment today by the requisite 66 votes, there \nbeing only 99 Members of the Senate at present, this amendment would \nthen be submitted to the States. We will leave it up to the people as \nto whether or not they want this amendment. My personal belief is that \nthey will ratify this amendment. Three-quarters of the States, if not \nall of the States, will ratify this amendment so fast our heads will be \nspinning. I think the people want this. The polls show they want it. \nAlthough I do not believe we should do things just because the polls \nshow it, in this case the polls show that the American people \nunderstand that this is a value that they want to maintain and uphold, \nand rightly so. This is a very important value, and, should we pass \nthis amendment today, we will submit it to the States. And those issues \nof values, those issues of right and wrong, will once again be debated \nall over this country. It will be a very, very healthy thing in 1995 \nand 1996 to have these issues debated 207, years after we thought we \nwere establishing values and virtue through the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  In all honesty, that debate needs to take place. It will be a much \nmore effective debate, I think, than we have held here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. I believe it is one that is long overdue, and it could \nlead to a debate on other values in our society--other principles of \ngood versus bad. I think it would be beneficial to the country to start \nreexamining some of these things, some of the permissive things, that \nwe have allowed to occur in this society that have really denigrated \nour society. Whether to restore legal protection for our national \nsymbol, the American flag, is an issue of such great constitutional \nimport, one that will help us to start that debate.\n  I hope that our colleagues will vote for it today. I can accept \nwhatever my colleagues do. But I hope they will vote for it. Should we \npass it, the great debate on values will start. Should we not pass it, \ncome 1997 we will be back with it again, and I think we will pass it at \nthat time. But let us hope we can pass it today. I intend to do \neverything I can to see that it is passed.\n  Might I ask the Chair how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining and the \nopposite side has no time left.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the argument that authorizing the \nprohibition of flag desecration violates the first amendment is of \nrecent vintage. I have remarked before that the Johnson and Eichman \ndecisions owe far more to evolving theories of jurisprudence than to \nthe first amendment itself.\n\n  I think the Members of the First Congress who voted for the first \namendment would be astonished to learn, two centuries later, that they \nhad forbidden Congress from prohibiting flag desecration.\n  It is even more astonishing to believe that those who enacted the \n14th amendment's due process clause, through which the first \namendment's free speech guarantee has been applied to the States, \nbelieved they were forbidding the States from protecting Old Glory.\n  Indeed, during the Civil War, Congress awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor to Union soldiers who saved the American flag from \nfalling into Confederate hands.\n  That Members of Congress who awarded the Medal of Honor for such \nheroics would also strip States of the right to protect the flag from \nthose who would physically desecrate it seems to me to be far-fetched. \nAs I have mentioned earlier, as recently as 1969, even Chief Justice \nEarl Warren, whose very name is an eponym for judicial activism among \nconservatives, wrote: ``I believe that the States and the Federal \nGovernment do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \ndesecration and disgrace * * *'' (Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 605 \n(1969) (Warren, C.J., dissenting)). Liberal Justice Abe Fortas agreed. \nAnd first amendment absolutist Justice Hugo Black was incredulous at \nthe thought that the Constitution barred laws protecting the flag: ``It \npasses my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State \nfrom making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.'' \n(394 U.S. at 610).\n  That five Members of the Supreme Court have now said otherwise does \nnot make their constitutional interpretation in this case wise or \npersuasive, any more than its decisions in the last century that Dred \nScott should be returned to slavery, or that separate-but-equal \ntreatment of the races passes muster under the equal protection clause \nmade sense.\n  The pending amendment overturns the Johnson and Eichman decisions and \nclearly establishes in the text of the Constitution the power for \nCongress to protect the flag from physical desecration that those two \ndecisions erroneously took away. It only addresses the Court's \nmisguided, recent flag jurisprudence. It does nothing else; it does not \ndisturb any other theories the Court has used to construe the \nConstitution. \n\n[[Page S18391]]\n\n\n\nThe American flag deserves legal protection regardless of the number of \n                   flag desecrations in recent years\n\n  The Clinton administration testified that, in light of what it refers \nto as ``* * * only a few isolated instances [of flag burning], the flag \nis amply protected by its unique stature as an embodiment of national \nunity and ideals.'' [Testimony of Mr. Dellinger, June 6, 1995 at p. 1] \nI find that comment simply wrong.\n  First, aside from the number of flag desecrations, our very refusal \nto take action to protect the American flag clearly devalues it. Our \nacquiescence in the Supreme Court's decisions reduces its symbolic \nvalue. As a practical matter, the effect, however unintended, of our \nacquiescence equates the flag with a rag, at least as a matter of law, \nno matter what we feel in our hearts. Anyone in this country can buy a \nrag and the American flag and burn them both to dramatize a viewpoint. \nThe law currently treats the two acts as the same. How one can say that \nthis legal state of affairs does not devalue the flag is beyond me.\n  This concern is shared by others. Justice John Paul Stevens said in \nhis Johnson dissent:\n\n       . . . in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public \n     desecration of the flag will tarnish its value. That tarnish \n     is not justified by the trivial burden on free expression \n     occasioned by requiring that an available alternative mode of \n     expression--including uttering words critical of the flag--be \n     employed. [491 U.S. at 437].\n\n  Prof. Richard Parker of Harvard Law School testified after Mr. \nDellinger, and in my view, effectively rebutted his argument.\n\n       If it is permissible not just to heap verbal contempt on \n     the flag, but to burn it, rip it and smear it with \n     excrement--if such behavior is not only permitted in \n     practice, but protected in law by the Supreme Court--then the \n     flag is already decaying as the symbol of our aspiration to \n     the unity underlying our freedom. The flag we fly in response \n     is no longer the same thing. We are told . . . that someone \n     can desecrate ``a'' flag but not ``the'' flag. To that, I \n     simply say: Untrue. This is precisely the way that general \n     symbols like general values are trashed, particular step by \n     particular step. This is the way, imperceptibly, that \n     commitments and ideals are lost.\n\n  Second, as a simple matter of law and reality, the flag is not \nprotected from those who would burn, deface, trample, defile, or \notherwise physically desecrate it.\n  Third, whether the 45-plus flags whose publicly reported desecrations \nbetween 1990 and 1994 of which we are currently aware, and the ones \nwhich were desecrated so far this year, represent too small a problem \ndoes not turn on the sheer number of these desecrations alone. When a \nflag desecration is reported in local print, radio, and television \nmedia, potentially millions, and if reported in the national media, \ntens upon tens of millions of people, see or read or learn of them. How \ndo my colleagues think, Rose Lee, for example, feels when she sees a \nflag desecration in California reported in the media? The impact is far \ngreater than the number of flag desecrations.\n  Physical desecration of the American flag has occurred every year \nsince the Johnson decision. I do not believe there is some threshold of \nflag desecrations during a specified time period necessary before \ntriggering Congressional action. Certainly, critics of the amendment \ncite no such threshold. If it is right to empower the American people \nto protect the American flag, it is right regardless of the number of \nsuch desecrations in any 1 year. And no one can predict the number of \nsuch desecrations which may be attempted or performed in the future.\n  If murder rarely occurred, would there not be a need for statutes \npunishing it? Espionage prosecutions are not everyday occurrences. \nTreason prosecutions are even more infrequent, but treason is defined \nin the Constitution itself and no one suggests we repeal that provision \nor treason statutes.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Alabama, Senator Heflin, also \nresponds to the criticism that there are too few flag desecrations to \njustify an amendment by noting: ``in my judgment, this is the time, in \na cool, deliberate, calm manner, and in an atmosphere that is not \nemotionally charged to evaluate values. I think that is something that \nmakes it appropriate to do it now. I [believe] that there have to be in \nthis Nation some things that are sacred.'' I think my friend from \nAlabama is absolutely right.\n  Mr. President, I believe our time is about all up, and I would be \nhappy to yield it back unless somebody wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I might inform the Senator he has 2 minutes \nand 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield it back. I understand the other \nside's time is consumed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18373-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question is on \namendment No. 3093 offered by the Senator from Delaware. Under the \nprevious order, there are 2 minutes of remaining debate time equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I normally would want the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware to go first, but let me say this. This amendment \nis doubly flawed. First, it does not offer proper protection to the \nflag. A veteran writing the name of his or her unit on a flag is a \ncriminal if we pass the statute authorized by this amendment.\n  Second, we have never in 206 years written a statute into the \nConstitution. This amendment is a textbook example of blurring the \ndistinction between our fundamental charter, our Constitution, and a \nstatutory code. We cannot do this to our Constitution.\n  The same amendment was rejected 93 to 7 in 1990. And it has not \nimproved with age. There is a better way to protect the flag: vote down \nthe Biden amendment, and then vote for the Hatch-Heflin-Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask that you withhold that request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand we have 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the amendment of my friend from Utah is \nfatally flawed. For the first time ever, it puts the Federal Government \nin the position of the State governments of choosing what types of \nspeech they think are appropriate. My amendment protects the flag, \nplain and simple. It is straightforward. It does not allow the \nGovernment to choose. It defines it. It says the flag cannot be burned, \ntrampled upon. It is very specific.\n  I ask that my colleagues look at it closely and, hopefully, support \nit. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3093 offered by the Senator from Delaware. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

The question is on amendment 3095, offered by \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. May we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me acknowledge a misunderstanding. \nWhen I was asked on Friday about the amendment, because I had been \nstalking my distinguished majority leader, waiting for him to put up a \njoint resolution all year long, I was asked about amendments, and I \ntold him I had two. They said you would have to be able to debate them \non Monday. I said fine. They said there will probably be a time \nlimitation. I said fine.\n  In no wise was any inference or reference made to relevance. As a \nresult, I understand the distinguished minority leader is going to ask \nthat we vote it down because, when the two leaders, majority and \nminority, make an agreement, they have to hold fast to their \nagreements--except, of course, in this case. You cannot take the \nposition of being none whatsoever, because it is not a mistrust of the \nminority leader. It has been a mistake.\n  Similarly, if it has been a mistake with this particular Senator, \nbecause if I had been asked if it had to be relevant, we would not have \na unanimous-consent agreement and would not be voting on the flag.\n  So we are sort of, as they say in the law, in pari delicto. Point 1: \nIt does not necessarily have to be relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield from my leader time, a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Those having \nconversations, please take them to the Cloakroom. Others, take your \nseat. Could I have order in the Senate, please? Will Senators please \ntake their seats or take their conversations to the Cloakroom?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader and Members \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, I will save the Senate time by withdrawing the one on \ncampaign finance. That is the best evidence that I had relative to the \nunderstanding or misunderstanding about relevance.\n  Point 1: The 10 amendments to the Constitution were originally \nsubmitted as 12 amendments, the 11th being the 27th amendment, not \nrelevant, of course, voted on separately. And if a point of order is \nmade, then of course the flag is not relevant to balancing the budget, \nor balancing the budget is not relevant to the flag. I understand that. \nBut the technical point of constitutional amendments, this has been \nsubmitted as a separate article, and on merit I dispute and appeal the \nruling of the Chair.\n  Otherwise, what we have is a glorious opportunity to get No. 1 in the \ncontract performed. They have not been able to get term limitations or \nthe matter of line-item veto or deregulation, and we can go down the \nlist. But you can get, certainly, this No. 1 in the contract by voting \ntoday for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, word for \nword, the Dole amendment----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent just to get 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Word for word, the Dole amendment with the Nunn \namendment to it with respect to the limitation on judicial power. \nOtherwise, the provision that the protection in section 13301 of the \nUnited States Code of laws is not repealed, that protection being for \nSocial Security. Section 7 of the original Dole amendment repealed that \nsection. We voted just 3 weeks ago, by 97 to 2, to instruct the \nconferees that they not use Social Security moneys. So it brings it \ncrystal clear into view now and into a particular vote.\n  If you really want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nthis is a wonderful opportunity, because we had five of us on this side \nof the aisle sign a letter to that effect.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will just use a couple of minutes of my \nleader time to reiterate what the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina has already informed our colleagues. There was a \nmiscommunication last Friday, as the leader and I were negotiating the \ncircumstances under which we would come to closure on the flag \namendment. It was our hope we could avoid votes yesterday, stack votes \ntoday, but that was contingent on relevant amendments being offered, \nwith some understanding as to how the time would be divided.\n  I entered into that agreement recognizing the need for relevancy. As \na result, even though I support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, I will also support the point of order. It is not \nrelevant to this amendment. In spite of its merit, it is not an \namendment I can support under these circumstances and given the \nagreement.\n  So, therefore, I hope our colleagues could support the agreement and \nlook for another day, when we can support as well the Hollings \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nHollings amendment dealing with a balanced budget amendment violates \nthe consent agreement of December 8, which states that all amendments \nmust be relevant to the subject matter of flag desecration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appeal, Mr. President. I appeal the ruling of the \nChair. And, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the Senate? On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

The question is on agreeing to the McConnell \namendment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is 1 minute to explain the \namendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senate will suspend until \nthere is order in the Chamber.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my amendment will permit us to protect \nthe flag and the Constitution. My amendment will make flag desecration \nillegal in three instances:\n\n  First, when an individual desecrates a flag with the intent to incite \npatriotic Americans to imminent violence;\n  Second, when someone steals a flag belonging to the U.S. Government \nand desecrates it; and\n  Third, when someone steals a flag displayed on Federal property and \ndesecrates it.\n  This amendment differs significantly from previous statutes struck \ndown by the Supreme Court and would be upheld by the Supreme Court, \naccording to the CRS, and a number of other constitutional scholars.\n  I revere the flag like every Senator, for the history it represents \nand the values it symbolizes. But let us not constrict freedom in the \nname of protecting the flag. After all, freedom is the American way of \nlife that the flag embodies. Let us not give flag-burners--the misfits \nwho hate America and the freedom we cherish--more attention than they \ndeserve. Do not let those who dishonor the flag cause us to tamper with \nthe freedom that has made America the Nation we love and the envy of \nthe world.\n  I urge a vote for my amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has a minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the McConnell amendment would displace the \nflag amendment. It would kill the flag desecration constitutional \namendment, the only real way the American people can protect their \nflag. The McConnell amendment offers a substitute statute. It offers \nvirtually no protection for the flag. It is so narrowly drawn and \nrelated to flag desecration in such limited circumstances that it would \nnot have changed the decision in the Johnson case. It does not protect \nthe flag in cases that have not involved the breach of the peace or a \nflag stolen from the Government or a stolen flag desecrated on Federal \nproperty.\n  Finally, we have been down this dead end before. The Supreme Court \nwill not buy any statute, and it will not buy this statute any more \nthan it bought the 1989 Biden flag statute.\n  How can we look the American people in the eye if we adopt this \nineffective substitute? So the Supreme Court will strike it down. How \nmany times must we have the Supreme Court tell us that a statute will \nnot work? So I hope everybody will vote ``no'' on the McConnell \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate must now decide: Is this picture \nof the flag being desecrated freedom or an abuse of freedom? The \nAmerican people know the difference. They are counting on the Senate to \nunderstand it too.\n  Do not talk to me about flag bathing suits or T-shirts.\n  This is what we are talking about. This is the unique symbol of our \ncountry.\n  Only Congress will be able to protect the flag. If we do not trust \nourselves to protect the American flag in a responsible way, why should \nthe American people trust us to do anything?\n  The Supreme Court made a mistake. The Framers gave the people and \nthis Senate the right to correct that mistake, through the justifiably \ndifficult amendment process.\n  Let the American people have the right to enact one, uniform law \nwhich protects one symbol of this great country and one symbol only--\nOld Glory.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a couple of minutes of my \nleader time. I know that people have schedules to keep, but I have not \nhad the opportunity to talk on this amendment. I will attempt to be \nvery brief.\n  I think everyone understands the repercussions and all the \nramifications of the vote we are about to take. This is the first time \nin history that we would amend the Bill of Rights; the first time in \n200 years that we would limit the freedom of speech. And the question \nreally is, why? Last year, three people were arrested or called upon to \nexplain themselves for destroying the flag. In 1993, not one incident \nof flag desecration occurred.\n  So, Mr. President, this debate is really about protecting principle \nversus protecting a symbol. Both are important. Both should be \nprotected. But do we really hold the symbol more important than the \nprinciple it represents? Is the flag more important than the freedom it \nstands for? The flag is important, and should be honored. But our basic \nfreedoms, in my view, Mr. President, are clearly more important. For \nexample, if we hold symbols to be more important than the fundamental \nright of freedom of speech, what about protecting a cross? What about \nprotecting the Star of David? What about protecting a copy of the U.S. \nConstitution?\n  The irony here is that we diminish the very freedom the flag \nrepresents by protecting its symbol. Shimon Peres, the acting Prime \nMinister, spoke of this this morning, and he reminded us of how \ncritical it was that we understand what a model this U.S. Constitution \nis for the rest of the world. He said the reason it is such a model is \nbecause it represents tolerance. That was his word, ``tolerance.'' And \nin a democracy, sometimes we must find the strength to tolerate actions \nwe abhor.\n  As I was growing up, whether it was with a teacher, a Cub Scout \nleader, or \n\n[[Page S18394]]\nmy family, we all recognized that perhaps the biggest difference \nbetween this country and so many others is that here we teach, \nelsewhere they compel. It is important that, as we vote on this \namendment, we understand the difference between teaching and \ncompelling. Let us leave here with every bit as much resolve to go out \nand teach the young and teach all in this country the importance of \nprotecting and respecting our flag, but let us not, for the first time \nin 200 years, undermine the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the \nfreedom of speech by compelling people today and abrogating their \nfreedom in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, during the past several days, we have heard \na number of important legal arguments, but there has been very little \ntalk about the history of the flag itself.\n  On June 14, 1777, the Revolutionary Continental Congress decided to \ncreate an official and distinctively American flag, passing a \nresolution declaring that, ``The flag of the United States be 13 \nstripes alternate red and white, and the Union be 13 stars, white in \nthe blue field representing a new constellation.''\n  The colors of the flag were carefully chosen: The red for the \nsacrifices in blood made for the cause of national independence. The \nwhite for the purity of this cause. And the blue for vigilance, \nperseverance, and justice.\n  Our Nation was barely 30 years old when it went to war a second time \nagainst the British Empire in the war of 1812. As the British fleet \nattacked Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, the flag waved undaunted \nthroughout the night until the dawn's early light, inspiring Washington \nlawyer Francis Scott Key to write the words of the our national anthem.\n  The most tragic chapter in our Nation's history began when the \nAmerican flag was lowered at Fort Sumter, after a 33-hour bombardment. \nThe Civil War that ensued gave us Barbara Frietchie, whom the poet John \nGreenleaf Whittier tells us stood face-to-face, eyeball-to-eyeball, \nwith Stonewall Jackson: ``Shoot if you must, this old gray head, but \nspare your country's flag, she said.''\n  Eighty years ago, in 1915, as Europe stood ravaged by World War I, \nPresident Woodrow Wilson established June 14 as National Flag Day. The \npurpose of Flag Day, President Wilson wrote, was to help us ``direct \nour minds with a special desire of renewal to the ideals and principles \nof which we have sought to make our great Government the embodiment.''\n\n  One of our most enduring national images comes from the Second World \nWar--the famous picture of six American brave soldiers raising Old \nGlory at the top of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi. Nearly 6,000 Americans \ngave their lives during their deadly ascent up that hill.\n  And just 25 years after Iwo Jima, the flag made history again, as it \nwas planted on the Moon by America's astronauts, some 239,000 miles \naway.\n  So, the flag itself has a unique and rich history, a history of great \nsacrifice and great triumph, and one that is the birthright of every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, there is another point I want to emphasize today: \nContrary to what some of my colleagues have said, this debate is not \nabout amending the bill of rights or carving out an exception to the \nfirst amendment. It is about correcting a misguided Supreme Court \ndecision that itself amended the bill of rights by overturning 48 State \nstatutes and a Federal law banning the act of flag desecration. Many of \nthese statutes had been on the books for decades, without in any way \ndiminishing our precious first amendment freedoms.\n  And if we learned anything in 1989, when we first began this debate, \nit is that we cannot overrule a Supreme Court decision on a \nconstitutional matter simply by passing a statute. Fixing the Supreme \nCourt's red-white-and-blue blunder requires a constitutional amendment. \nThis is the only serious and honest way to correct the Texas versus \nJohnson decision.\n  I respect the efforts of my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, who has proposed a flag-desecration statute. But as \nI said back in 1989, the statutory quick-fix just will not work. It \nfailed in 1989, and it will fail again today.\n\n  Of course, amending the Constitution should not be taken lightly. \nThis is serious business. That is why the framers intentionally made \nthe amendment process a difficult one, requiring the assent of two-\nthirds of Congress and three-fourths of the State legislatures. But \nonce these legislative hurdles have been cleared, the American people \nhave spoken. In fact, amending the Constitution is as American as the \nConstitution itself.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude today by telling the story of a man \nnamed Stephan Ross, who testified earlier this year before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In 1940, at the age of nine, the Nazis seized Ross from his home in \nKrasnik, Poland. For the next 5 years, he was held in 10 different Nazi \ndeath camps and barely survived.\n  The U.S. Army eventually liberated Ross from Dachau. As Ross traveled \nto Munich for medical care, an American tank commander jumped off his \nvehicle to lend his help to Ross and to the other victims of Nazi \nbrutality. As Ross recounts: ``He gave me his own food. He touched my \nwithered body with is hands and heart. His love instilled in me a will \nto live, and I fell to his feet and shed my first tears in 5 years.''\n  The American soldier then gave Ross what he thought was a \nhandkerchief, but he soon realized it was a small American flag, the \nfirst I had ever seen.\n\n  Stephan Ross still keeps that same cherished flag at his home in \nBoston, where he works as a psychologist. Ross says:\n\n       It became my flag of redemption and freedom. . . . It \n     represents the hope, freedom, and life that the American \n     soldiers returned to me when they found me, nursed me to \n     health, and restored my faith in mankind. . . . Even now, 50 \n     years later, I am overcome with tears and gratitude whenever \n     I see our glorious American Flag, because I know what it \n     represents not only to me, but to millions around the world. \n     . . . Protest if you wish. Speak loudly, even curse our \n     country and our flag, but please, in the name of all those \n     who died for our freedoms, don't physically harm what is so \n     sacred to me and to countless others.\n\n  And, I might add, to those who are now heading for Bosnia.\n  Stephan Ross is right: We must protect that which is sacred to us as \ncitizens of this great country. Our flag is sacred because it stands \nalone as the unique symbol of the principles and ideals that President \nWoodrow Wilson knew bound us together as one nation, one people.\n  Throughout our country's history, thousands of brave Americans have \nfollowed the flag into battle to defend these principles and ideals. \nTwenty thousand Americans will serve under our flag in Bosnia. As a \ntestament to the great sacrifices made by our fighting men and women, \nthe flag--America's national symbol--should receive the constitutional \nprotection it so richly deserves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the joint resolution to \nbe read a third time.\n  The joint resolution was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while they are resolving this difficulty, \nlet me say a few words about the flag amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent I be given a few minutes to say a few words about the flag \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator will suspend until we get the attention of the Senate. I \nask that conversations be removed to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am, of course, disappointed by the \noutcome. But I predicted at the beginning unless we got three more \nDemocrats, we were not going to be able to prevail, and we could not do \nthat.\n  I respect the decision of the Senate. I congratulate those on the \nother side of the issue.\n  In particular, I congratulate the most important leader of the \nopposition. Of course, that is President Clinton. President Clinton won \nthis battle. The American people, in my opinion, lost. The President's \nstrong, uncompromising opposition to any amendment protecting the flag \nwhatsoever, expressed on June 6, in testimony before the Constitutional \nSubcommittee, was too much for the Citizens Flag Alliance and those of \nus here to overcome.\n  Had the President supported this amendment, I have no doubt, we would \nhave prevailed. I do not think there is any question about it. So I \ncongratulate the President on this victory.\n  I assure my colleagues, this amendment is not going to go away. It is \na simple amendment. It is a constitutional amendment. It is written in \ngood constitutional form. Frankly, it is not going to go away. The \nAmerican people are not going to allow it. We will debate it in the \nnext Congress. I hope we have some changes that will enable us to pass \nit at that time.\n\n  I want to particularly thank Senator Heflin and Senator Feinstein for \ntheir efforts.\n  I also thank chief counsel Winston Lett, counsel Jim Whiddon, and a \nformer Heflin staffer who worked very hard on this, Gregg Butrus, now \nat the Notre Dame Law School. I also want to express appreciation to \nSenator Feinstein and her counsel, Jamie Grodsky.\n  On my staff, I want to thank John Yoo, Steven Schlesinger, Jasen \nAdams, and Mark Disler. These people worked long and hard, very \nsincerely, on this amendment.\n  This has been not only an important debate but an interesting debate. \nI think both sides have had a full and fair opportunity to explain \ntheir side. I am sorry we lost. On the other hand, we have done the \nbest we can under the circumstances.\n  Unless there is a change in the U.S. Senate, I do not believe we are \ngoing to be able to pass this amendment with the current Senate, so we \nare hoping in the next Congress we will have enough votes to pass it. \nBe that as it may, it is going to come up again, whether we do or do \nnot, and we are going to keep bringing it up until we pass it and \nprotect the Nation's national symbol.\n  I have to say, anybody who really argues this is a denigration of the \nfirst amendment just plain does not understand constitutional law, does \nnot understand the more than 21 cases where we have limited the first \namendment, and does not understand that this is, full and simple and \nvery plain, to prevent conduct that is offensive to the flag, offensive \nto the country, and offensive to almost every citizen, and, frankly, \nthe way they have spoken, to every Senator in the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to take occasion to pay tribute to \nmy senior colleague, Senator Hatch, for his leadership on this debate \non the flag amendment. My one regret in this whole debate has been that \nsome people in the State of Utah have characterized this as an issue \nthat has divided Senator Hatch and me and tried to force us into \npicking sides.\n  I did, indeed, vote against the amendment. It was a close vote. These \nvotes are always close matters. My reasoning is that the Constitution \nof the United States is our basic law and, as such, should be held \ninviolate from legislative activities.\n  I realize this was enabling legislation, but I have the fear that, if \nwe start the precedent of amending the Constitution every time there is \na Supreme Court decision with which we disagree, we run the risk of \nseeing the Constitution turned into something other than basic law.\n  Coming out of a political science background and a lifetime of \nstudying the Constitution, that is where I came down on this particular \nissue. But I want to make it very clear that I am not backing down from \nmy admiration for and respect for my senior colleague and his \nscholarship and his leadership.\n  I hope the people of Utah will understand that this has been an \nintellectual disagreement between us, and not an emotional disagreement \nbetween us. We spent many hours with each other--each trying to \nunderstand the other's point of view. I am sure Senator Hatch \nunderstands and respects my point of view, as I certainly understand \nand respect his.\n  So I hope the people of Utah will understand that this is not \nsomething that has driven a wedge between their two Senators.\n  While I am on the floor, I would like to read into the Record just \none letter that I have received that I think is illustrative of the way \nthis debate has gone in the State of Utah. The proponents of the \namendment have been mounting an advertising campaign in Utah putting up \ntelevision ads urging the people of our State to contact, write, fax, \nor phone Senator Bennett and urge that he vote in favor of this \namendment. That, of course, is their appropriate constitutional right. \nI received this letter in response to that campaign. I would like to \nread it into the Record. It is addressed to the Office of Senator \nBennett regarding the flag burning amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator Bennett: I read the article in this morning's \n     Salt Lake Tribune indicating that your position on the flag \n     burning amendment differs from that of Senator Hatch. I also \n     saw the commercial obviously put on by supporters of the \n     amendment urging that I write you about this issue. I commend \n     you for your independent and thoughtful position as indicated \n     in the Tribune article.\n       I am a West Point graduate and served with the 3rd Armored \n     Division in Germany and the 5th Special Forces group in \n     Vietnam. I am not in favor of flag burning. But I really \n     don't think we need a constitutional amendment about flag \n     burning. I am strongly convinced that the constitutional \n     provisions \n\n[[Page S18396]]\n     should be reserved for only the most important governmental issues, and \n     flag burning just is not such an issue.\n       I was offended to realize that the television commercial I \n     saw this morning flashed the scene of book burning and a \n     scene of flag burning as if they were the same thing. By my \n     sense of history they are opposite. Book burning denotes the \n     suppression of ideas by government. Flag burning involves the \n     offensive and distasteful expression of protest against \n     government. Nigeria does not tolerate that. But I hope \n     America always will.\n       I commend you for your courage in taking the position which \n     I suppose is probably contrary to what the opinion polls \n     would tell you to do. Sounds like political courage to \n     me. Wish there were more of us in Washington.\n           Very truly yours.\n\n  It is signed by Chris Wangsgard. I did not know Mr. Wangsgard before \nhe responded to the commercial by sending me this letter.\n  I can report that a majority of the calls that I have received in \nresponse to the commercial have been in support of the position that I \nhave taken. I am grateful to Mr. Wangsgard and those who have so \nresponded.\n  But I conclude, again as I began, Mr. President, with a sincere \nstatement of respect and admiration for my senior colleague and an \nassurance to everyone in the State of Utah that, whereas we differ \nintellectually on this issue, I do not know of two Senators who have \nworked together better to represent their home State than Senator Hatch \nand I. I know no senior colleague who has been more supportive or more \nhelpful to his newcomer in the Senate than Senator Hatch has been.\n  I want, now that the issue is over and settled, to take the \nopportunity to make sure the people of Utah understand the high regard \nthat I hold for Senator Hatch and the highest esteem that I hold for \nhis scholarship and his leadership.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will only take a few moments.\n  I want to thank my colleague for his wonderful remarks. They mean a \nlot to me, and I have an equally strong feeling toward him and realize \nthat he did this as a matter of principle and conscience. And I could \nnever find fault with people who do that. I naturally differ with him \non this particular issue, and I am sure we will have some differences \nin the future. But by and large we support each other, support our \nState together in a very, very good way, and I am very proud to serve \nwith him. And I appreciate his service here. He is one of the more \narticulate, intelligent and hard-working people in this body. I \npersonally feel honored to have him as a partner as we work together in \nthe best interest of Utah and this Nation.\n  So I want to thank him for his kind remarks here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18395-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A VOTE CAST TO PROTECT OUR FLAG\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted to protect the \nAmerican flag from desecration. In doing so, I chose a statute rather \nthan a constitutional amendment to achieve this important objective.\n  For me and for most Americans, our Nation's flag is a symbol of the \nprinciples and values which hold this country together. We are appalled \nand deeply offended when someone burns or in some way destroys this \nnational emblem of freedom and justice.\n  Brave men and women have given their lives to protect the flag, to \npreserve as well the freedom and democracy for which it stands. We owe \nit to those soldiers to keep our flag from desecration. And we owe them \nour solemn pledge to protect the Bill of Rights given to us by \nhistory's greatest guardian of American liberty: Thomas Jefferson.\n  But in defending our flag, we should not alter the Bill of Rights, \nand we should not tinker with language of our Constitution, if a \nsimple, direct law can get the job done.\n  I cosponsored and cast my vote for just such a law. It protects our \nflag by punishing those who damage or destroy it. Flag desecration, \nlike shouting fire in a crowded theater, would not be protected by the \nfirst amendment. This law passes every constitutional test, according \nto scholars at the Congressional Research Service.\n  Protecting America's cherished Constitution and Bill of Rights is \nevery bit as important as protecting our beloved flag. We must do both, \nand take care not to jeopardize one while seeking to protect the other.\n  It is a delicate balance, and I believe the bill for which I voted, \nachieves that important and critical balance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18396-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18396-S18397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL DRUG POLICY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would to announce that the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy has just confirmed that Director Brown \nwill make an announcement at 4:15 today regarding his future career \nplans. It has been widely reported that he will take a sociology \nprofessorship at Rice University in Houston. I wish him well. He is a \nvery fine man.\n  He was a good selection for this position. I believe he has given his \nheart and soul to it to the extent that he could. He has done a \ncredible job. But I have to say the administration has barely paid any \nattention to him and his efforts on this issue.\n  Unfortunately, under this administration drug control policy is in \nutter disarray. The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has \nincreased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.2 million in 1994. The category \nof ``recent marijuana use'' increased a staggering 200 percent among \n14- and 15-year-olds over the same period. One in three high school \nseniors now smokes marijuana.\n  I have to say the President has stood up and condemned smoking \ncigarettes but has not condemned smoking marijuana.\n  One in three high school students now smoke marijuana. There has been \na 53-percent drop in our ability to interdict and push back drug \nshipments in the transit zone between 1993 and 1995. Drug purity is way \nup, street prices are down, and the number of drug-related emergency \nroom admissions is at record levels.\n  Federal law enforcement is under a very severe strain, and at the \nvery time that the technical sophistication of the Cali Mafia is \nreaching new heights. Frankly, of those one in three high school \nstudents that are using marijuana, 30 percent of those who do it will \ntry cocaine in the future of their lives. That is just a matter of \nfact. It is a statistic we know. And this has gone up so dramatically \nfast that I am really concerned about it.\n  The Gallup Poll as released today showed that 94 percent of Americans \nview illegal drug use as either a crisis or a very serious problem. \nThese people are right. We simply need to do better.\n  As a start, I urge President Clinton to appoint a replacement \ndirector at the earliest possible date. It is vital to our Nation's \neffectiveness against drugs that we have a coordinated strategy against \ndrug abuse in our executive branch of Government. Almost 3 years into \nthe administration no nominee has been forwarded to the Senate for the \npurpose of ONDCP Deputy Director for Supply Reduction--in 3 years. This \nposition should be filled immediately as well.\n\n  I believe that whoever is appointed ought to use that bully pulpit to \nlet the American people know that we have had it up to here with drug \nabuse in our country, with this cancer that has been eating away at our \nchildren, and which, naturally because of the permissiveness of our \nsociety, is resulting in more and more drug use. We have to do \nsomething about it.\n  I wish Director Brown, Lee Brown, well. I like him personally. I know \nhow frustrating it must have been. The first thing they did when he \ntook over the Office of National Drug Control Policy was to cut his \nstaff almost completely. Frankly, it is hard to do this job without the \nbacking of the President of the United States. I really do not believe \nthis administration has backed him in the way that they should have \nbacked him. Despite that, he has done the best he could.\n  I personally want to acknowledge that on the floor. I want to pay my \nrespects to him. I have admiration for him. I think his heart was \nalways in the right place, and I think he did the best he could under \nthe circumstances.\n  I just hope in these next few years--especially this next year--we do \nsomething about this, that we replace him and get a deputy for the next \nDirector as soon as we can, and that we start fighting this issue with \neverything we have. \n\n[[Page S18397]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There \nwill be limited time tomorrow. The majority leader asked me to announce \nthat. So I hope that we can get to the bulk of the debate on this \nissue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just finish if I could, and I will be glad to \nyield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Right now, the tentative plans are to vote on H.R. 2606, which is the \nuse of funds for troops in Bosnia. Following that, a vote on an \namendment by, I believe, Senator Hutchison and Senator Nickles, and \nmany others--Senator Inhofe, Senator Kyl--on the issue of a resolution \nconcerning Bosnia, and that would be followed, is tentatively scheduled \nto be followed by a vote on the Dole amendment, the language of which \nhas not been completely worked out.\n  That is subject to change. There may be amendments, additional \namendments from the other side of the aisle on this issue. The Democrat \nside has reserved the right to propose additional amendments on that \nside.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The question I had was, is it my understanding there will \nnot be debate time tomorrow before the vote will be taken?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe there will be debate time, but it will be \nextremely limited. We would like to have the debate and discussion \nbetween now and the hour later this evening Members wish to stay in to \ndebate the issue.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the intention is to have \ngeneral debate on Bosnia until 6, but then from then on, if we take up \n2606, continue debate on Bosnia as well as that bill. So I am not sure \nwe need to restrain Members as far as time of speaking is concerned.\n  I wish to emphasize that tomorrow morning there will not be \nsufficient time for every Member to speak on this issue, so again I \nstrongly urge as much as possible to have those statements made this \nafternoon or this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to begin this debate. I spoke on \nthis floor, I think I was the first Member to speak after the President \nspoke to the Nation justifying his decision to commit 20,000 ground \ntroops in Bosnia. I indicated my opposition at that time. I wish to \nreiterate that opposition now and very briefly indicate the reasons why \nand why I would support at least one and possibly two of the \nresolutions that will be before us tomorrow.\n  I was privileged to serve in the House of Representatives during the \ntime that we debated the issue of whether or not to commence the Desert \nStorm operation. I cannot think of a more serious debate that I \nparticipated in while a Member of the House of Representatives. It was \nan elevated debate in terms of the arguments that were raised on both \nsides, and I think that everyone felt at the end of that discussion the \nissue had been thoroughly debated, the good arguments presented on both \nsides, and I think the right result came from that vote.\n\n  This is a similar issue, Mr. President. This is undoubtedly the most \nserious issue which we have had to debate in this year of the 104th \nCongress. In the long-term survivability of our country, I suppose one \ncould talk about the balanced budget and those economic issues, but \nwhen one considers the possibility of sending young men and women in \nthe Armed Forces into harm's way, all of us I think become very serious \nabout the subject.\n  On this particular subject, there is no right or wrong in the sense \nthat reasonable people can have differing views. I would like to focus \nfirst on what we have agreed on, and I would like to say I know that \nalthough my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and I may have some \ndisagreement about the ultimate resolution that should be passed in \nthis body, we agree on what we are for, and I think I would also say \nthat in response to Senator Bennett, who said that no senior Senator \nhad offered more assistance to a junior Senator than Senator Hatch had \nto him, I would suggest that Senator McCain has provided that same kind \nof assistance to me, and I would wish to commend him for all of his \nefforts in trying to come to grips with what these resolutions should \nbe all about and how we influence the administration in conducting a \nsound policy with respect to Bosnia.\n  All of us, undoubtedly I could say all of us, are for peace in \nBosnia, for an end to the slaughter. Many of us believe we have made a \ncommitment to that with the American ships that are steaming in the \nAdriatic, the planes that are flying under the banner of NATO, the \nother kind of assistance which we have provided in terms of transport, \nintelligence, humanitarian assistance, and the monetary assistance that \nwe will be asked to supply in the future.\n  Second, we are all for the support of our troops. There is no one \nhere who would want to pull the rug out from under our troops once they \nhave been deployed somewhere. Of course, many of us believe the way to \nsupport our troops is not to send them in harm's way in the first \ninstance. But once they are there, none of us, obviously, will want to \njerk the rug out from under them.\n  Having said what we are for, peace in Bosnia and support for our \ntroops, I think it is also important for us to say what we oppose. And \nthere are many of us here who oppose what I would characterize as the \nunreflective and offhanded and premature commitment of troops by the \nPresident. Our view is that the President should not have made this \ncommitment, and that is why support for the Hutchison resolution is so \nimportant--to express our opposition to that decision.\n  I would like to discuss why I think this issue arises today. If this \nwere a vital national security interest of the United States, we would \nnot be debating this question. The Senate would have supported it long \nago and the American people would be in support of it. But there is no \nvital national security interest. There is no national security \ninterest of the United States involved. And when there is no national \nsecurity interest, I think there is a higher threshold that must be met \nfor the commitment of troops into combat situations. Here there is at \nbest what could be characterized as a national interest. Any time there \nis a moral imperative to stop slaughter, to stop genocide, I think one \ncould say that there is a national interest in seeing that that is \nstopped.\n  That does not mean in every case that the United States would send \nground troops or we would have ground troops in possibly 20 or 30 or 40 \nplaces on the globe today. We do not. There are many situations that \ncry out for help but we cannot literally be the sheriff of the world. \nSo the mere fact there is a moral imperative in some sense to stop the \nslaughter, to stop the genocide in different parts of the world, does \nnot automatically mean the United States sends ground troops. We often \ndo other things. There was a moral imperative to send humanitarian \nassistance to Somalia, and we did that. And there are moral imperatives \nin other places around the Earth where we have taken action.\n  This is a moral imperative, but we should not be confused and call it \na national security imperative because there is no national security \ninterest of the United States involved here. And because it is only a \nmoral imperative, it seems to me there should have been more debate by \nthe Congress and with the American people about whether or not this is \none of those occasions in \n\n[[Page S18398]]\nwhich we send our people into harm's way. That debate could not occur \nbefore the commitment was made because the President made it, as I \nsaid, in an offhanded and premature way. Once he made the commitment, \nit is very difficult for us to argue about it because of the contention \nthat we therefore are embarrassing the President; that we no longer \nhave a foreign policy behind which we stand united in the world and \ntherefore once the commitment was made it is no longer possible for us \nto debate it.\n\n  That kind of catch-22 could occur in the future. There are other \nsituations in the world where there is a possibility of commitment of \nU.S. troops. I have heard, for example, that if Israel and Syria should \nmake peace, United States troops might be sent to the Golan Heights. I \ndo not know whether that is a good idea or not, Mr. President, but I do \nbelieve that before a commitment is made we ought to debate that and \ncome to a resolution of that question and the administration act with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate in that matter. I suggest that \nprobably the same thing will happen there that happened here. A \ncommitment will be made in private. We will be told about it later. And \nbecause it was already made, we will be told that we cannot really \nargue about it because it would undercut American foreign policy. That \nis not sound decisionmaking and that is really what I object to and why \nI think it is important for us to have a resolution in opposition to \nthe decision the President made.\n  There are three basic responses that have been made. One is the so-\ncalled Hefley amendment. This is the amendment that passed the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly. And it is embodied in a sense-of-the-\nSenate that was incorporated into the Defense appropriations bill as \nwell, but that was a sense-of-the-Senate rather than actual \nlegislation.\n  This basically says that there should not be a commitment of funds \nuntil the Congress has acted affirmatively on the matter, and I think \nthat is wise policy. That is the way it should have been done here. \nThat is, in effect, the way President Bush did it when he sought \nCongress' approval to conduct the Desert Storm operation.\n  The second response to what the President did is the so-called \nHutchison amendment. This is an amendment which I have cosponsored \nwhich says that we oppose what the President did. It also says we \nsupport the troops. But I think we have to express that opposition.\n  The third resolution is the one that Senator McCain referred to, the \nDole resolution, which apparently has not been written yet and \ntherefore obviously I cannot comment on that.\n  But the point is, Mr. President, in all likelihood none of these \nthree responses will become law. So we will have to do what is \nnecessary to support the troops. And we will do that.\n  What we are relegated to doing tomorrow when we have our vote is to \nsend a message, and I think the message we send is very important.\n  First of all, it ought to be a message of unity and support of our \ntroops. Second, it ought to be a message of unity in support of the \npeace process through a variety of mechanisms that the United States \nhas already been participating in and will in the future be \nparticipating in. Third, it ought to be a message that we oppose this \nparticular commitment of troops both in terms of the lack of clarity of \nmission and exit strategy and of the premise for the mission in the \nfirst place; and that is that it is essential for U.S. ground troops to \nbe a part of the so-called peacekeeping effort or else it will fail.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, if this agreement is so fragile that \nthe sine qua non--that without which--for its success is a commitment \nof 20,000 American ground troops, then it is probably a peace too \nfragile to be sustained in any event, and those are the messages I \nthink we should send in the resolutions that we adopt tomorrow.\n  I think that the bottom-line message should be that the President \nshould not get us into these situations in the future, and it is not \nfair to those who we ask to do the fighting for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  And so, Mr. President, we commend those who have negotiated the \npeace. We pray for those who will be doing the fighting. We pray for \nthe recovery of the area in which so much turmoil and difficulty has \noccurred over the last several years. And we certainly hope that while \nthis mission begins in much controversy, that it can end successfully \nand without loss of life or casualty to our United States troops.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly agree with all the \ncomments made by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl]. He and I have \ntalked about this long and hard, and for many, many hours here on the \nfloor of this body, and it is something that has concerned us.\n  We expressed the concern in the past when we both served in the other \nbody and served at that time on the House Armed Services Committee \nabout the problem that we have and are confronted with when the \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States, is able to send \ntroops into areas with a total disregard of Congress, of either House \nof Congress. It is as if we are totally irrelevant.\n  We are the expression of the American people. We are the ones who are \nexpressing the sentiments, I think, very clearly that shows up \ncertainly in Oklahoma, and I suspect all over the country. The problem \nthat we have is very simple, that the President sends the troops over \non these humanitarian missions that do not relate to our Nation's \nsecurity, and then he comes back to us and says he wants an emergency \nsupplemental appropriation to pay for it when in fact we would not have \nincurred that cost if we could have been consulted or been made a part \nof the decision.\n  I do not mean this to sound at all partisan because when the decision \nwas made to go to Somalia, it was made in December 1992, which was \nright after President Bush--he was still in office, but he had been \ndefeated. It was supposed to be for 45 days. In other words, in \nDecember, the troops are going to go over and in January they are going \nto come back. It was to open a roadway for the delivery of humanitarian \ngoods to the people of Somalia who did not want us over there to begin \nwith. I disagreed with President Bush, who was a Republican, like I am, \nat that time.\n  Then, of course, right after that, in January, we reminded President \nClinton that in fact we should bring our troops home because the intent \noriginally was to send them over for 45 days. And so, each month \nthereafter, approximately each month, we sent resolutions to President \nClinton saying, bring our troops home from Somalia. And he did not do \nit and did not do it, and months went by, until finally there was the \nbrutal murder of 18 of our Rangers and their mutilated bodies, corpses \nwere dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. Of course, then it was \ntoo late and then the American people rose up, and this was enough \npressure that we indeed brought our troops back from Somalia.\n\n  We sent troops down to Haiti. We were not part of that decision. \nHaiti was supposed to be considered as the crown jewel of President \nClinton's foreign policy. He said he was going to send the troops down \nthere for 12 months. Then we sent them down in September, and 12 months \nlater--this was this past September--they are still not back. Now 3 \nmore months have gone by and things are getting worse down there, not \nbetter.\n  We realize we made a mistake in Haiti. That was not anything that \nrelated to our Nation's security. Indeed, it was to go down there--at \nleast it was reported by the President that we were going to go down \nand get someone who was duly elected back in office. We have been \nwatching in recent weeks, in recent days of the turmoil that exists \nthere, and we still to this day have troops in Haiti.\n  Just a few weeks ago, we were asked to vote for an emergency \nsupplemental to pay for Somalia and Haiti and some of these \nhumanitarian gestures. I guess Rwanda was in there, too. It was a $1.4 \nbillion appropriation.\n  So this procedure the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, was talking \nabout is what is really wrong because we do not have any voice in it, \nand yet we have to turn around and vote for a supplemental \nappropriations to appropriate money that has already been \n\n[[Page S18399]]\nspent on a mission that we did not agree with.\n  What happens if we do not make that appropriation? The President \nmerely then just goes to the military budget and pulls it out of the \noperating budget which is already cut down to the bone, down to a level \nthat we cannot defend our Nation on two regional fronts, as it is \ntoday. And then we are deleting those very scarce resources and assets, \nmilitary assets, by these humanitarian gestures.\n  So I am rising today during this time really to speak on two of the \nthree votes that will be before us tomorrow. The first one, as I \nunderstand the order, from the leader is going to be H.R. 2606. \nCongressman Joel Hefley from Colorado, who incidentally spent the last \nweekend with me in the State of Oklahoma going around and explaining to \nthe people and participating on nationwide radio talk shows to let \npeople know just what is happening, that the President made a \ncommitment more than 2 years ago to send 25,000 troops in on the ground \nin Bosnia, and we are now almost out of time. I am not sure there is \nanything we can do now to stop the President from doing this. But just \non the possibility, remote possibility, as it is, that the President \nmay, since he made that statement, have realized what he is doing in \nsending our troops over there into that incredibly hostile area, that \nmaybe we can give him an out. So we have two efforts to do that.\n\n  The first effort is H.R. 2606, as was passed by Congressman Hefley in \nthe House of Representatives. I will read just the preamble to this.\n\n       To prohibit the use of funds appropriated to the Department \n     of Defense from being used for the deployment on the ground \n     of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as a part of any peacekeeping operation, or as \n     part of any implementation force, unless funds for such \n     deployment are specifically appropriated by law.\n\n  It is a very simple and straightforward two-page bill. That is all it \nsays. It just says we in Congress are relevant. We in Congress should \nbe heard. After all, we are the ones that appropriate money for our \nmilitary operations. We are the ones who make the fiscal decisions in \nthis country. The President submits his budget, but we are the ones who \nget down to the detail of passing budgets that are consistent with the \ndesires of the American people.\n  And so I strongly support H.R. 2606. I do not think it is going to \npass. But I am going the tell you, it is a defining vote. Come the \nelections in the future, there are going to be people looking back and \nsaying, we had an opportunity, not just intent of Congress. We already \npassed one of those. Senator Gregg put that on as an amendment. It was \nvoice voted. And, of course, Senator Hutchison and myself and some \nothers have a resolution of disapproval that we are going to be trying \nto pass tomorrow. That is important, too.\n  But this particular bill has the meaning of law, has the force of \nlaw. It says that we are not going to appropriate the funds that are \nnecessary for the mass deployment of troops into Bosnia unless it comes \nto Congress or Congress approves it.\n  Now, this does not take away any of the powers of the President. It \nmerely says that the President should not do it unless he has the \nCongress and the American people behind him. I can tell you right now, \nMr. President, he does not have the support of Congress behind him, and \nhe does not have the support of the American people behind him. He does \nnot have the support of the vast majority of the people in this \ncountry; I think they are offended--unless Oklahoma is a lot different \nthan any of the other States.\n  I was all over Oklahoma this past weekend, and I can share the \nfrustration that people all the way from Lawton, to Anadarko, to Tulsa, \nthat they are offended that this has been railroaded through and that \nwe have not had a chance to have the American people be heard.\n  You might ask, is it really that hostile of an area there? The \nSenator from Arizona talked about such things as mission creep. You \nknow, we have already had mission creep in this case. This was going to \nbe peacekeeping. Now it is going to be peace implementation. There is a \nbig difference between peacekeeping and peace implementation, because \npeacekeeping assumes that there is peace today, when there is not peace \ntoday. Peace implementation means we must implement peace. There is a \nbig difference. That has seemingly gone unnoticed. This thing about \nmission creep is that it starts out simple and sounds good to the \nAmerican people, just like, I suppose, Somalia sounded back in December \n1992. It sounded like it was very reasonable. Yet, who could argue at \nthat time against opening up a road in order to send humanitarian goods \nup to the people who were having all kinds of social problems? So we \ndid it. But that kept creeping and creeping until we lost many American \nlives.\n  There are quite a few people in Congress who have been to Sarajevo. \nSarajevo is the area people talk about and think about when they think \nabout Bosnia. But that is not the area where our troops are going to \nbe. Our troops are going to be, according to the map that has been \ndrawn out, to the north of that, from the north of Sarajevo, all the \nway up, almost to Hungary. That is where we are going to have our \ntroops. That is the hostile area.\n  I had occasion to prevail upon a British general, Rupert Smith, who \nwas kind enough to take me up, since none of the Americans had been up \nthere. I found out later that even the two fine generals that were \ntraining the 1st Armored Division in Germany to go up, General Yates \nand General Nash, had not personally been in that area at that time, \nand they are training our troops to go into that area. Then I found out \nsubsequently, the other day--last week, or a week ago today--when we \nhad a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, that neither General \nShalikashvili or Secretary of Defense Perry had been in that area. I \nknow the President has not been in that area. So I have to come to the \nconclusion that those individuals have not been there to see how \nhostile it was.\n\n  Let me just tell you why, how they happened to discover this. \nSecretary Perry was talking about how peaceful it is up in the Tuzla \narea. I said, ``Mr. Secretary, I was up in the Tuzla area. There was \nfirepower going around up there, and it has not ceased since the cease-\nfire took place. When was the last time you were?'' He said he had \nnever been there.\n  General Shalikashvili said, ``We are training them in an area and an \nenvironment that very nearly represents the environment up in Tuzla.''\n  I said, ``I have been to Tuzla and to the training area in Germany, \nand it is not really analogous to the training area. When was the last \ntime you were there?'' He had not been there.\n  So here we have a hostile area, and we are guessing that there are \nmore than 6 million mines in that area. This is not like it was in the \nPersian Gulf where you could go in and deactivate mines, because it is \nnot a desert. This is ground that is frozen, and the only way to find \nout is if you drive an M-l or an armored vehicle on it and activate it. \nThis is the type of hostility that is there.\n  We hear a lot about the peace talks that took place in Dayton, OH. I \nsay that maybe the wrong people were there. Sure, Milosevic was there, \nbut it was my experience in the time I spent in Bosnia that he is not \nthe one calling the shots. It is Karadzic occasionally and, of course, \nmany factions have broken away from him. We are dealing with three \nmajor factions there--the Croats, the Serbs, and the Bosnian Serbs, and \nwe have the Moslems. In addition to that, you have the Arkan Tigers, a \nthrowoff of the Serbs; the Black Swans, which is related and was at one \ntime a group of Moslems; the mujaheddin is still active; the Iranians \nare there. We have identified nine subfactions, or rogue elements, that \nare up in that area where we are talking about having our troops \nwalking around. These elements have been known to fire upon their own \ntroops, murder their own flesh and blood, just to blame it on one of \nthe other elements.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, if you are dealing with that kind of \nmentality, what would preclude them from firing on our troops to blame \nsomebody else? The administration says, no, we have a couple of ways we \ncan get out of Bosnia. One is at the end of 12 months. It was \ninteresting that the President started out presenting this program and \nsaying, ``We are going to send troops into Bosnia for 12 months.'' \n\n[[Page S18400]]\n\n\n  Well, on October 17, during the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhearing, I said to General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, ``I do not understand how you can have an exit \nstrategy that is tied to time.'' I asked him, ``How do you know what is \ngoing to happen 12 months from today? Exit strategies are tied to \nevents and our success in the various efforts there, and whatever we \nare enduring.''\n  He said, ``No, it is going to go 12 months. On the 365th day they are \ncoming back.''\n  That did not sound realistic, and I think a lot of people further \ndown in the bureaucracy were trying to withdraw from that 12-month \ncommitment, until a week ago today when they reaffirmed their \ncommitment. General Shalikashvili said, ``It is inconceivable that we \nwill be there after 12 months.''\n  Well, then the President, over the weekend, reaffirmed that. They are \ntalking about an exit strategy of 12 months. What if we go over there \nand we have something--which I do not think we have--but something that \nrelates to our Nation's security interests, or our vital interests, so \nwe engage in combat. We go over there to do whatever we are supposed to \nbe doing there, to contain the civil war, to protect the integrity of \nNATO, or whatever they say is worth the cost of hundreds of American \nlives, at the end of the 12th month, they are saying, no matter what, \nwe come home anyway. What if we are almost there? No, we are going to \ncome home.\n  I had occasion to talk to people who are very familiar with the \nBosnians, the former Yugoslavia, the various cults and ethnic groups \nand the rogue elements that are up there, and they said one thing \npeople do not understand in the United States is that those people do \nnot think like we do. Their conception of time is not what ours is. \nGeneral Hoagland, who was the general from Norway, up in the Tuzla area \nwhere we are talking about sending our troops--and we are as we speak--\nhe said 12 months is absurd; it is like putting your hand in water and \nleaving it there for 12 months, and when you pull it out, nothing has \nchanged, it is just like it was. And then when I commented to some of \nthe soldiers up there who are familiar with that area, I said, ``What \nabout the 12 months and being out in that time?'' They said, ``Are you \nsure you are not talking about 12 years?''\n  So these are the unknowns that we are dealing with. These are the \nrogue elements. This is the hostility, and these are the chances we are \nwilling to take. If you do not believe what I am saying, Mr. President, \nI suggest that you go back to that meeting of October 17, when we had \nSecretary Christopher, Secretary Perry both there at the meeting. That \nwas shortly after Gen. Michael Rose from Great Britain, who was the \ncommanding general in charge of United States forces in Bosnia, \ncertainly there was no greater authority at that time on the conditions \nin Bosnia than Gen. Michael Rose. He said, if Americans go into Bosnia, \nthey will sustain more loss of lives than they did in the Persian Gulf \nwar. Well, that was 390.\n\n  I specifically asked the question, I said, ``Secretary of Defense \nPerry, let us assume that all these experts are right and we are going \nto lose at least 400 lives over there. Is the mission as you have \ndescribed it, that is to contain a civil war and to protect integrity \nof NATO, is that worth 400 American lives?''\n  He said, ``Yes.''\n  Secretary Christopher said yes. I say no. That is the defining issue \nhere. We will have an opportunity to get people on record. I hope the \nSenators that are preparing to vote on these very significant things \nunderstand the seriousness of it.\n  We have an opportunity to do something to stop it. It is remote. As I \nsaid when I began a few minutes ago, maybe we cannot pull it off. If we \ndo, maybe the President, in the case of H.R. 2606, which I strongly \nsupport, maybe he would veto it or he would let it sit on his desk \nuntil we have the troops over there and then it is too late.\n  As Senator Kyl and others have said, we are in full support of our \ntroops. That is, everyone in this Chamber is in support of our troops. \nThe best way to support our troops is not send them over there in the \nfirst place. Those who are over there, a handful, bring them back.\n  That is essentially what we are attempting to do with H.R. 2606. We \nare saying we will not appropriate the money to send the troops over \nunless you come to Congress, present your case to the American people, \nand sell your case. It is as simple as that.\n  There is a defining vote. People who vote against H.R. 2606 are \nsaying ``No, Mr. President, you go ahead. You don't have to come to \nCongress. We will go ahead and appropriate the money. We are serving \nnotice we will appropriate the emergency supplemental.''\n  The same thing with the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution. That is a \ndefining vote. People are going to have to answer to that in years to \ncome--I am talking about U.S. Senators--as to whether or not they were \nsupporting the troops being sent to Bosnia. We all support the troops.\n  Mr. President, this is probably the most significant vote--these two \nvotes will be the most significant votes we will be voting on. I know a \nlot of people, the families of the thousands of American troops that \nare going to be sent over there. This is the most defining vote.\n  I could not find anyone yesterday in the streets of Anadarko, OK, who \nthought the mission as described to them is worth the loss of one \nAmerican life, let alone 400 or 1,000 or whatever it ends up being. I \nthink the American people are solidly behind our effort to stop the \ndeployment, even though it is almost too late now.\n  The President says this is only going to cost $2 billion. They gave a \nfigure of what Somalia would cost, what Rwanda would cost, what Haiti \nwould cost, and they are off by a few billion and had to come back for \nsupplemental appropriations.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have an opportunity to vote on three \nissues tomorrow. Two are resolutions without the force of law; one has \nthe force of law. I think the toughest vote will be the vote on H.R. \n2606. Those who really feel so strongly that the American people and \nCongress should have to give permission before the President sends the \nmass deployment of troops into Bosnia, this is the opportunity for them \nto cast that vote.\n  I had a phone call last week from Capt. Jim Smith, who I believe is \nfrom New Jersey. He is an American hero. He was a career military \nofficer. He lost his leg in Vietnam. He lost his son in Mogadishu. He \nsaid to me, ``You know, I had two letters from my son. The first one \nwas concerning the rules of engagement that we were using in Somalia. \nThey said we would have robust rules of engagement,'' and he \ncharacterized those the same way that Captain Smith today is \ncharacterizing the rules of engagement that we have.\n  The last letter he got, his son made the statement to his dad in this \nletter right before he was one of the 18 Rangers who lost his life over \nin Somalia and his corpse was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, \nand he said, ``Dad, over here we cannot tell the good guys from the bad \nguys.''\n  I suggest that is exactly the situation in Bosnia. I know people who \nare trying to make that into something that is really relating to our \nNation's security. I do not think we can tell the good guys from the \nbad guys. Take a snapshot in the history of that area in the last 500 \nyears and one is that the Serbs are the bad guys and the next is that \nthe Croats are the bad guys. We saw what happened in the First World \nWar; we saw what happened when Marshal Tito put together a coalition \nbecause he was in the unique position of being a Croat and yet was also \na Communist, so he was able to break away from Hitler's operation where \na lot of the Croats went, and held this very fragile country together \nagainst Hitler's onslaught on a ratio, for a 2-year-period, of 1 to 8. \nWhat I am saying is, this hostile area we went into, he was able to \nhold off the very best Hitler had to send in on a ratio of one soldier \nto eight soldiers. Until you fly over 100 feet off the ground and look \ndown and see the environment and the cliffs and the cave, you cannot \nreally appreciate this.\n  Unfortunately, the five people who are in charge, the architects of \nthis thing, the various Secretaries and the President himself, none of \nthem at the time the decision was made had ever been in that part of \nthe world. It is understandable why they might not understand the \nserious danger that lurks up there for our troops. \n\n[[Page S18401]]\n\n\n  I stopped by the training area a few weeks ago and talked to a lot of \nthe troops. I went into the mess hall. I have not been in a mess hall \nsince I was in the U.S. Army, and I enjoyed visiting with all of them. \nIt was very difficult for me to answer the question when they asked me: \nWhat is the mission? What is so important over there?\n  I try my best because I am in full support of the troops. I said, if \nyou go over there, you will have a mission. We will have the American \npeople behind you. But I could not answer the question about the \nmission.\n  I talked to one James Terry, a young man who would be in the first \ngroup. He may be over there now. He is probably part of the logistics \nteam over there. When I came home, I talked to his mother, Estella \nTerry, in Oklahoma, and I got to thinking that the test that \nCongressmen heavily used over in the other body was, what do you tell--\nI guess it is called the mother's test--what do you tell somebody who \nhas lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a wife? What can you tell \nthem they died for? This is the test that the President has failed to \nmeet.\n  I am hoping that with the two opportunities that we have on voting in \nthe Hutchison-Inhofe resolution of opposition to the deployment of \ntroops and H.R. 2606 to actually stop--this is the litmus test. We will \nstop the appropriations so they cannot be sent there in the first \nplace, this mass deployment, and bring those who are there back.\n  This is very, very significant and probably the most significant vote \nthat we will vote on. There is a third vote, and that is the vote that \nwill come up tomorrow that is trying to be conciliatory to the \nPresident's plan. I have looked at his plan. I think it is so flawed \nthat it cannot be fixed. I do not think we can fix it. I plan to vote \nagainst the resolution that would, for all practical purposes, approve \nwhat the President is doing.\n  Lastly, I will conclude by saying we are behind the troops and the \ntroops are behind us. We are the ones--it says to stand up here and say \nwe support the troops. How can you say we support troops and send them \ninto the environment I just described? I do not think we can do it, and \nI do not think people are supporting the troops when we do that. We \nhave an opportunity, a last-ditch effort, and after that the \nopportunity is behind us, and we will have to start watching what is \ngoing on, giving full support.\n  If there is anyone here, Mr. President, who disagrees that the troops \nare behind what we are trying to do, I suggest you look at the veterans \ngroups. A week ago we had a news conference. Every veterans group I am \naware of in America was present. We had the American Legion, the DAV. \nWe had the veterans of the Korean war. We had the veterans of Vietnam. \nWe had the Jewish veterans. They were all there and they all stood up \nand said, we are for the troops, and the best thing you can do for the \ntroops is keep us out of this fight over there that is not our civil \nwar, because we could very well have some causes that would come up \nwhere we need to send troops.\n\n  We cannot be depleting our resources. Certainly, people like Saddam \nHussein and others around the world are looking at our weakened \ncondition now and the fact we are further weakening our military assets \nby sending them out on the humanitarian gestures.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we will have an opportunity tomorrow to cast \nthree votes. I think the votes, the right votes, are to vote against \nthe resolution of support for the President and vote for the resolution \nand the bill that supports our troops and stops the deployment of \ntroops into Bosnia. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise to speak on the issue that is before the Senate, \nthat has been before the Senate for some time, and our decision with \nrespect to our role in Bosnia.\n  This has been going on, of course, for a very long time, nearly 4 \nyears, so we have had a great deal of opportunity to think about it, \nconsider what our role should be, also what great opportunities and, of \ncourse, to watch what is happening, watch the tragedy that has, indeed, \ntaken place. So we hear a great deal of conversation about our role in \nkeeping peace, our role in helping to provide freedom, our role in \nstopping the fighting. Everyone agrees. So the question is not whether \nyou agree with being active in that effort, but how do you best do it? \nThe question is, how do we deal with the crisis that has been there? \nThe question is, what is our role in this particular incident?\n\n  What is our role, then, as a matter of policy, in other places where \nthere are similar problems? What is our policy with respect to civil \nwars? Our policy with respect to ethnic disturbances? Is it going to be \nour policy to participate in each of these, where we have troops now in \nthe Golan Heights, where we have troops in Algeria, where we have \ntroops around the world, keeping the peace--or, in fact, creating \npeace?\n  Where do we not have a policy of that kind? We asked that question to \nthe administration.\n  ``Well, this is separate. We will make each decision separately.''\n  I do not think that is the way it works.\n  Mr. President, the first concern I have had for some time is with the \nprocess that has taken place here. The process has been one that has, \neither by design or by accident, co-opted the Congress almost entirely. \nIt started 2 years ago. The President said, I think almost offhandedly, \n``We will put 25,000 troops in to help the United Nations pull out if \nneed be.'' There was no particular reason for 25. It could have been \n10. It could have been 40. But 25 it was. So nothing happened, much, \nwith that. And the United Nations continued, through their dual-key \narrangement, not to be particularly effective; not effective at all, as \na matter of fact. So the Congress acted finally. The Congress acted, \nand said we want to raise the arms embargo so we can provide an \nopportunity for the Moslems to defend themselves and create more of an \neven field. So we did that.\n  There was no support from the administration for doing that. However, \nit did cause, I think, the administration to move. So, then they said \nto NATO, let us bring in some aircraft strikes. We did that. It did not \naffect a great deal but it did tend to even the playing field. The \nSerbs had much of an advantage in heavy weapons.\n  So the Moslems and Croats got together, which tended also to make the \nplaying field more even, which is really the basic reason the Serbs \ncame to the table. So we said to the administration, What is our policy \nwith regard to this?\n  ``Well, we cannot talk about it now because we are going to have a \npeace conference and we do not want to get ahead of that.''\n  OK. Did that.\n  Then there was a peace conference and for whatever sticktoitiveness \nthere is, that one came out, initialed peace conference in Dayton.\n\n  We said, after the conference, What is our position? What are we \ncommitted to? What can we do? How do we participate as Congress?\n  You cannot really participate because we have a peace conference and \nwe do not really want to talk about it.\n  Then the President goes off to Europe, agrees to do the things he has \nagreed to do, and of course they welcome it with open arms. Why would \nthey not? We are willing to do the heavy lifting. So, then the next \nthing we know, the troops are there.\n  Now, the big movement of troops has not taken place, but American \ntroops are there now. So we had a hearing, not long ago, in the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, and the Secretary of State was there, the Secretary \nof Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I asked, ``What, in \nyour opinion, is the role of Congress in this matter of foreign policy \nand in this matter of troops to Bosnia?''\n  Frankly, I did not get an answer. Finally, the Secretary of State \nsaid, ``Well, to provide the money.''\n  I think there is a larger role than that. You can debate the \nPresidential power, Commander in Chief, debate the money--but there is \na role in terms of having support for what we are doing and including \nthe Congress; not coming up and telling them what we have already \ndecided to do, but, rather, have a real role.\n  I was in Bosnia about 6 weeks ago, along with several of my \nassociates here. And we spent a day in Stuttgart with the Supreme \nAllied Commander. This was 6 weeks ago. I can tell you, in terms of the \nadministration, that decision was already made. It was already made, \nwhat we were going to do. \n\n[[Page S18402]]\n\n  We asked. ``We are impressed with what you are doing, general, in \nterms of training and preparation, but are there alternatives?''\n  There were no alternatives.\n  I do not believe that. There are, in fact, alternatives.\n  So, that is where we are. I happen to oppose the idea of sending \ntroops on the ground to Bosnia. The real, basic question has never been \nsatisfactorily answered, as far as I am concerned.\n  Let me divert, to say I respect the opinions of everyone who is \ninvolved here as being their basic gut-felt feeling about it. But the \nreal question, what is our national interest, has never really been \nanswered. What is our position? What is our policy? What will we do in \ninstances similar to this? Is this what we are going to do hence?\n\n  So, until that question is answered, really, all the stuff about how \nyou withdraw, how you are in harm's way, how you enter, how you get \nout, how many troops, are not really relevant if you have not \nestablished the idea that it is in our national interest to be there.\n  So, I think that question has never been resolved. There are many \narguments. One is to stop the genocide. Of course we want to do that. \nAs a matter of fact, it was my strong feeling when we were in Sarajevo, \nwhen we were in Croatia, that folks are anxious to stop. They are tired \nof fighting. You can imagine that. You can imagine that. And if there \nis real dedication to the peace agreement, it is hard to imagine that \nwe need 80,000 or 90,000 troops on the ground from other places to \ncause this to happen.\n  Is this the only alternative? I do not think so. They continue to say \nnothing would happen if the U.S. does not take leadership. We were also \nin Brussels, in Belgium, with NATO, and all 16 of the Ambassadors from \nthe NATO countries stood up and said, ``Gosh, we just do not think we \ncan do it without the Americans providing the majority--a third of the \ntroops, the basic payments, the heavy lifting to get there.''\n  Of course they could do it. Of course we can continue to participate \nin NATO. This was not really the mission of NATO originally. NATO is \nsort of looking for a mission and they are excited about the \nopportunity, generally, of doing this.\n  We hear that Bosnia is the heart of Europe and the conflict may \nspread. It could, of course. Four years--4 years, during the height of \nthe fighting, it has not spread. Bosnia is hardly the heart of Europe. \nBosnia is the edge of Europe and, as a matter of fact, the strife that \nhas taken place there has taken place, historically, because someone \nelse has come there.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a tough issue. We are going to have a \nchance, finally, to vote on it, as belated as that may be. And, as my \nfriend from Oklahoma said, there will be a number of alternatives and \nwe will have to make that tough choice. But it is my belief we can \ncontinue to involve ourselves in the diplomacy.\n  I congratulate those who have done that diplomacy. We can continue to \nprovide support. We can continue to provide airlift. We can continue \nthe work in NATO. We do not necessarily have to have 30,000 troops on \nthe ground there. It is a very tough area. This idea that you go in and \nseparate them--this morning I sat in for a little time on the civilian \naspect of it. What do you do when you are there? There are refugees, \nthousands of refugees, who will not be in the sector that they live in. \nAnd their property is gone. How do you return that? How do you get a \nCroatian back into the Moslem area to reclaim his home?\n  They say we are not going to do that. So this morning they are saying \nwe will have to do the policing; we will have to train them on \npolicing; we will have to arm the Moslems. There is really a great deal \nmore to this than separating those two areas and separating the zone, \nand we are obviously going to end up doing it.\n  The price now talked about is $1.5 billion, plus another $600 million \nfor nation building. If you would like to bet, it will be at least \ntwice that. Of course it will. Of course it will. So we ought to really \ntalk about the incremental costs and what that is.\n  But more importantly, Mr. President, and I conclude, what is our \nrole? What is our role in the world? How do we do this in terms of \ntroops on the ground throughout the world? What is the division of \nunderstanding here as to what the role of the Congress is?\n  I think most of us are very close to the people we represent. I can \ntell you that in our response in Wyoming, I think we have had two calls \nout of hundreds that favor the administration's position, which does \nnot make it right or wrong, but it is an indication of how people feel.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we come to the snubbing post, and decide \nwhat our role is. In my view, that role is not 30,000 troops on the \nground.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity, as all \nof my colleagues are doing the rest of the day and tomorrow, to comment \non this very important issue of sending troops to Bosnia and, of \ncourse, on the specific resolution before us.\n  Given the President's obvious intention to move ahead regardless of \nwhatever we decide to do in Congress, I am not sure what the effect, or \neven the need, is for the resolution before us because it seems to me \nthat the train has left the station.\n  Of course, we all have a constitutional responsibility to let our \nviews be known. We have a responsibility to vote on these issues, and \neven though the President is moving forward it gives some of those of \nus who object to his doing that an opportunity to express our views.\n  Of course President Clinton is touting support for his position from \nformer Presidents, including former President Bush. However, the \nPresident does not have support where it counts the most--and that is \nsupport from the American people. Even former President Bush, in his \nqualified support, stated,\n\n       I still have significant misgivings about the mission \n     itself, about exactly what our troops are expected to \n     accomplish, and about when they can get out and come home. In \n     my view, the answers on these points are less than clear.\n\n  President Bush has expressed very well what a lot of Americans are \nthinking who tell us that they have questions about this or that oppose \nit. It really is not clear-cut. For instance, the President's speech to \nthe Nation and several subsequent speeches to different groups trying \nto sell this mission has not won over the broad support that a \nPresident ought to have when American lives are being put in jeopardy.\n  Unlike some of my colleagues, as well as the President, I believe \nCongress does have a leadership role in authorizing a military \ndeployment that involves a large contingency, and a long period of \noperation. This certainly is not a Grenada or Panama-type of operation \nthat lasts a few days or weeks. As a matter of fact, we know this \nBosnia operation will last at least a year, and in reality probably \nmultiple years. Last weekend, the President stated that we would be in \nBosnia ``about a year.'' Of course, this President is not know for his \naccurate statements. This begs the question of what is our exit \nstrategy? Well, the only strategy we have is that we will leave \nwhenever the President decides to leave, which is hardly a strategy at \nall.\n  We also do not know the cost of the mission. I have seen Pentagon \nestimates of around $2 billion. Other estimates double that price. And, \neven this princely sum amounts for only the 1 year we will supposedly \nbe there.\n  Even the troop numbers have been misleading. All we hear the \nadministration talk about is the 20,000 troops on the ground.\n  Obviously, there are going to be many more troops involved even if \nthey are not there right on the ground.\n  Of course this does not include the 14 to 20,000 additional support \ntroops that will be required. So, we are really talking about closer to \n40,000 troops, which is a sizeable number of Americans the \nadministration is putting at risk.\n  And what are some of these risks? Well, beyond the obvious ones \ninvolved with getting stuck in the middle of warring sides that have \nhated each other for centuries, we know that up to 6 million landmines \nare in the area, but we only know where 1 million of them are. Major \nminefields are in or around the area of tuzla, where American troops \nare to be stationed. That is a fact.\n\n[[Page S18403]]\n\n  Also, hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Islamic mercenaries who \nhave been helping the Bosnians, and are bankrolled by Iran and others, \ncould now pose terrorist threats to our troops.\n  Let me say that troops generally who are peacekeepers are in danger \nin a situation like this, but especially I believe American troops are \na special lightning rod that terrorists would love to hit as opposed to \nmaybe troops from other nations.\n  There is supposed to be an agreement from the Bosnians to remove \nthese mercenaries, but will they be removed? But even with the best of \nintentions, that will not happen in less than a month.\n  In addition, there are those that want to train and arm the Bosnians \nbefore we do anything. What kind of a message does this send to the \nother side?\n  Up to now, I have joined most of my colleagues in providing support \nfor the Bosnian Moslems by reducing, or eliminating, the embargo of \narms there. But now we are supposed to be an honest broker, or at least \nan objective mediator, once the peace agreement is officially signed. \nSo I just do not see how we can be an objective referee when we are \narming and training one side of the conflict.\n  Then we hear the disturbing argument that we have to vote for this \nresolution in order to support our troops. Well, of course, this \nargument has absolutely no merit. We all strongly support our troops, \nand regardless of the outcome of this vote, we will do that just as we \nall did after the very crucial debate and vote on going to the Persian \nGulf war even though there was a great deal of disagreement on the \nsending of those troops at that time.\n  I was one of only two Republican Senators to oppose the Persian Gulf \nresolution, and this administration has provided even less of a need to \ndeploy troops in Bosnia, notwithstanding the fact that this is supposed \nto be only a peacekeeping mission.\n  The administration argues that NATO and our leadership of NATO is on \nthe line. This just is not convincing to the American people, because \nnone of our NATO allies--nor is the United States--under any kind of \nnational threat as defined by the NATO treaty of 50 years now. Our \nEuropean allies should be taking a lead in this matter and sharing more \nof the financial burden. And, yes, the United States should--and can \nand will --provide support for their effort, including air and naval \nassistance.\n  Finally, what some are now saying is that the vote on this resolution \nboils down to helping a President keep his commitments. As a Senator, I \nhave my own constitutional responsibilities, and those responsibilities \ndo not include helping a President keep a commitment that many, if not \na majority, of the people do not believe should have been made in the \nfirst place.\n  So, Mr. President, the bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is \nthere are a number of unanswered questions and a lot of questionable \nassertions made by President Clinton that simply do not add up to \ncommon sense. And, therefore, I cannot in good conscience support \nPresident Clinton's decision to deploy troops to Bosnia.\n  I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution. The Hutchison-Inhofe resolution is very simple. It has two \nparts.\n  The first part says Congress opposes President Clinton's decision to \ndeploy United States military ground forces into the Republic of \nBosnia-Herzegovina to implement the general framework agreement for \npeace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to its associated annexes.\n  Section 2 says:\n\n       The Congress strongly supports the United States military \n     personnel who may be ordered by the President to implement \n     the general agreement for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     its associated annexes.\n\n  That is it, Mr. President. It is very simple and very clear. I wish \nto state from the beginning a few parameters around the debate that I \nam getting ready to make. First, I think there is no politics in the \ndebate on this issue. I truly believe that every Senator is making a \nvote of conscience. It is a tough decision. It is not easy for anyone. \nAnd I do not think anyone's integrity can be impugned by saying there \nis some political reason for how that person decides to vote. In fact, \nas you know, anytime you are sponsoring a resolution or an amendment in \nthis body, if you care about it, you ask people for their votes. You \ntry to talk them into voting for your issue, especially if it is \nsomething that affects your State.\n  I have not asked anyone for a vote on this issue. I would not feel \nright asking someone to vote against his or her conscience on something \nthat important. So this is not a matter where you work the floor to try \nto get support for what you are doing. What you do is take a position \nand say this is the way I think we should go, and everyone who agrees \nwith you will be on that resolution. And in fact the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution has 28 cosponsors. I do not know how many votes we will get \nfor the reasons that I have stated. I just have not asked.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say I respect the President. I think \nhe thinks he is doing the right thing. I think he did a good job of \nbringing people to the peace table to talk. I disagree with his \ndecision to deploy American troops on the ground in Bosnia, but I \ncertainly respect the office and I think he believes he is doing what \nis right.\n  I wish to make the point--and it is what I said to the troops I met \nwith last Saturday night at midnight at Killeen, TX, at Fort Hood, as \nthe troops were getting ready to go to the airplanes to take off for \nBosnia. I told them that I believe--and I know it is true, it is a \nfact--that 100 percent of the Senate is going to support the troops.\n  Now, we are going to disagree on the policy, but we are not going to \ndisagree that we support the troops, and they are going to have \neverything they need for their security if they are deployed in this \nmission. They will have the equipment. They will have the weapons. They \nwill have the shelter. They will have the electric socks if they need \nthem. They will have the training. And most important, they will have \nthe spirit. They will have the spirit of knowing that the American \npeople may disagree with the fact that they are going, but they support \nthe troops 100 percent because they are giving their time and they are \nputting their lives on the line for our country. We are the greatest \ncountry in the world, and we appreciate every single one of them.\n\n  I visited with some pregnant wives. I visited with some new wives, \ntwo-day-old wives. I visited with parents who had come in from all over \nthe country to say an early goodbye to their loved ones, men and women \nwho were getting ready to take off. They knew I did not want them to \ngo, but they knew I was going to do everything in my power to bring \nthem home safely.\n  It gives me the greatest feeling in the world to visit with our \ntroops. There is nothing more wonderful than an American in service to \nhis or her country. They have the most wonderful attitude--positive \nthinking. They are well trained. They are professionals. They are ready \nto go when the Commander in Chief gives them the call.\n  So now we must decide if we are going to support what we consider to \nbe a bad decision. I think it is a legitimate question to ask, why \noppose now; the troops are on the way. I am opposing now for three \nreasons. I am opposing because I disagree with this policy, and I wish \nto discourage future such missions. I disagree with this policy, and I \nbelieve it is my constitutional responsibility not to rubberstamp it. I \ndisagree with this policy, and I hope to give the President every \nopportunity to back away from this decision--the basic tenets of the \npeace treaty are not in place--before he does the mass deployment.\n  If the Serbs in Sarajevo continue to burn the American flag, if they \nare not committed in body and mind to this peace agreement, I hope the \nPresident will say, ``No. No, we are not going to deploy American \ntroops if the peace treaty is not intact.''\n  That is why I am putting this resolution in with 27 of my colleagues, \nto make sure that the President has every opportunity to say there is \ndisagreement in Congress on this issue, and I am not going to send the \ntroops into \n\n[[Page S18404]]\nharm's way if a peace agreement is not intact. And if they are burning \nthe American flag, the peace agreement is not intact.\n  So let me take each one of my reasons and flush them out a little \nbit.\n  I disagree with the policy, and I wish to discourage future missions. \nI do not want this to be a precedent for the future. The President has \nsaid NATO will fall if we do not do this. I disagree with that. I think \nNATO has a place in the post-cold-war era. But NATO was put together as \na mutual defense pact when there was a big-time aggressor, the U.S.S.R. \nThere is no big time aggressor, so we must look at our responsibility \nunder the NATO treaty. We must look at the role of NATO in the world we \nlive in today, not the world we lived in in 1945. And we need to say, \nwhat is the role? We need to debate it, if we are going to expand it, \nand we need for Congress to approve it, if we are going to have a new \ntreaty with NATO. And we must do this thinking ahead, not by moving \ncrisis to crisis, not by going to Somalia and saying we are going to \ntry to capture a warlord, and then when we lose 18 rangers walk away, \nnot by going into Haiti without the approval of Congress and $1 billion \nand 1 year later seeing the same problems arising in Haiti that they \nhad before we landed. And now we have Bosnia, a civil war in a non-NATO \ncountry, and we are told NATO is going to fall if we are not there in a \nnon-NATO country, in a civil war.\n\n  Mr. President, that does not pass the commonsense test. We should \nhave a strong NATO. To do that, we must determine what NATO's role is \nin the future, and we must not act crisis to crisis and send our kids \ninto harm's way for a false reason. We could dissipate our strength if \nwe bounce from one civil war to another across the globe because we do \nnot have infinite resources.\n  We have finite resources, Mr. President, and we have spent $1 billion \nin Somalia. We are going to spend $3 to $5 billion in Bosnia. What are \nwe going to do when we are really needed in a crisis that does threaten \nU.S. security?\n  What if North Korea, with nuclear capabilities, erupts? What if \nSaddam Hussein decides to take another march? Are we going to have the \nresources if we have spent $3 to $5 billion in a civil war when we \ncould have spent less helping the people of Bosnia rebuild their \ncountry, which we want to do?\n  Mr. President, we have not thought this through, and one of the \nreasons it has not been thought through is because Congress was not \nconsulted. Which brings me, Mr. President, to my second reason for \ncontinuing to oppose the President's decision, and that is the role of \nCongress in the declaration of war, or sending our troops into \nhostilities, which are the equivalent of war under the Constitution.\n  I do not like to oppose the President on a foreign policy issue, but \nI have a responsibility as a Member of Congress that was given to me in \nthe Constitution of this country. I want to talk about that because \nthat is a disagreement on this floor. It is not partisan. But many \npeople believe that Congress really does not have a role in this, that \nthe President has the right to do what he is doing.\n  The President does indeed have the right to command our forces. He is \nthe Commander in Chief, and he has the right to act in an emergency \nbecause Congress gave him that right in the War Powers Act. We did not \nwant him to be hamstrung. We did not want him not to be able to send \ntroops in if American lives were at stake, and if he did not have time \nto come to Congress.\n  But, Mr. President, sending our troops into Haiti for 1 year without \never asking Congress' permission, or even asking their opinion, is \nwrong. That is a violation of the Constitution. And we are getting \nready to do it again on Bosnia.\n  I have the Federalist Papers right here. The Federalist Papers, of \ncourse, were written by three people who were crucial in the \ndecisionmaking in writing our Constitution. In Federalist Paper No. 69, \nwritten by Alexander Hamilton, he discusses the role of the President \nas Commander in Chief, and he is comparing it to the role of the King \nof England, which, of course, we had just left and tried to make a \nbetter country because many people were dissatisfied with a monarchy. \nSo here is what Alexander Hamilton said about the war powers of the \nPresident.\n\n       The President will have only the occasional command of such \n     part of the militia of the nation as by legislative \n     provision may be called into the actual service of the \n     Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New \n     York at the time have at all times the entire command--\n\n  Not part--\n\n       . . . of all the militia within their several \n     jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the \n     President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or \n     the governor. Second, the President is to be commander-in-\n     chief of the army and navy of the United States. In this \n     respect his authority would be nominally the same with that \n     of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior \n     to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme \n     command and direction of the military and naval forces, as \n     first general and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of \n     the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the \n     raising and regulating of fleets and armies--\n\n  I move to No. 74 by Alexander Hamilton, where he says:\n\n       Of all the cares or concerns of government, the direction \n     of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which \n     distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand.\n\n  Mr. President, he was speaking to us. He was saying, do not have one \nperson able to declare the war and to run the war. And James Madison \nsaid exactly the same thing: Those who were to ``conduct a war'' could \nnot be safe judges on whether to start one.\n  James Wilson, a delegate from Pennsylvania, said the checks-and-\nbalances system ``will not hurry us into war.'' He said, ``It is \ncalculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single \nman, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress.'' He was \nvery clear, as were the others who have spoken on this issue.\n  They did not want the President to be able to send our troops into \ndistressed situations without consulting with Congress. They wanted it \nto be hard. They wanted it to be muddy. That is why they put both \npeople in charge, the President and the Congress, and they wanted them \nto work together so it would be difficult.\n  Louis Fisher, who wrote an article with some of the quotes that I \nhave just given you, is a professor and an author. He has written the \nbook ``Presidential War Power.'' He says:\n\n       It might be argued that ``war power'' is not involved \n     because Mr. Clinton will use American forces for peace, not \n     war. ``America's role will not be about fighting a war,'' he \n     said. He said he refused ``to send American troops to fight a \n     war in Bosnia,'' and ``I believe we must help to secure the \n     Bosnian peace.''\n\n  Mr. Fisher says, ``Mr. Clinton has already authorized air strikes \nagainst the Serbs.'' He now intends to send ground troops. By making an \noverwhelming show of force, he says, ``American troops will lessen the \nneed to use force.'' Note the word lessen. Anyone who takes on our \ntroops, he says, ``will suffer the consequences.''\n  Mr. President, if that is not the equivalent of what would be \nconsidered war when the Constitution was written, what could be more \nclear?\n  Mr. Fisher goes on to say:\n\n       Whenever the President acts unilaterally in using military \n     force against another nation, the constitutional rights of \n     Congress and the people are undermined.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Fisher: We are not upholding our part in the \nConstitution if we let this pass.\n  The third area of disagreement that is very important for why I \ncontinue to oppose this deployment is because I want to narrow the \nmission. I want there to be a time limit. The War Powers Act is \nsupposed to give emergency capabilities to the President to go in when \nhe cannot come to Congress. This President is asking for a year. That \nis not an emergency. We have been looking at this situation for 3 \nyears.\n  We have asked the President to lift the arms embargo. He has refused \nto do it, and now we are put in the position of knowing that if there \nis going to be any kind of cease-fire that will last in that part of \nthe world, it has to be when there is parity among the three warring \nfactions. We wanted to lift the arms embargo so that parity would be \nthere now. The President said no. In effect, the President did lift the \narms embargo, but he made us the ones who used the arms when we started \nbombing the Serbs.\n  So I want to narrow the mission, and I want there to be a time limit \nso that the expectations will not be there any \n\n[[Page S18405]]\nfurther than 1 year. It is the expectations that got us into this mess \nbecause the President, without consulting with Congress, went forward \nand said, oh, yes, we will put troops on the ground, when he had so \nmany other options. And troops on the ground should have been the last. \nInstead, they were the first.\n  So then people come and say, well, the only way you can show your \ncommitment to peace in the Balkans is troops on the ground. When, in \nfact, there are many ways that we could have shown our commitment to \npeace in the Balkans that would have been much more effective than \nAmerican troops on the ground because now the President says we cannot \narm and train the Moslems because we are on the ground precisely. We \nshould have said we would arm and train the Moslems and not put troops \non the ground so we would not be taking sides at the time that we were \ntrying to bring parity into the region. And we must have parity in the \nregion if, when we leave, there is going to be any equity in the \nregion.\n\n  So, Mr. President, many of my colleagues want to speak on this very \nimportant issue. I will just close with the last reason that I am going \nto oppose the President's decision, and that is the Larry Joyce test. \nOne day when I was on the plane going back to Dallas from Washington, \nDC, a man walked up to me and said, ``Hi, Senator. I'm one of your \nconstituents. My name is Larry Joyce.'' And I said, as I normally would \nto someone like that, ``Well, hi, Larry. How are you doing? What were \nyou doing in Washington?'' And he said, ``I was burying my son in \nArlington National Cemetery.'' And I said, ``Did he die in Somalia?'' \nAnd he said, ``Yes, he did.''\n  And as tears streamed down his face, he said, ``Senator, I went to \nVietnam twice. I am a military man. And now my only son, on his very \nfirst mission as a Ranger, is not coming home. Senator, I would just \nlike to know why.''\n\n  I did not feel good about an answer to Larry Joyce because I do not \nthink our troops should have been doing what they were doing in \nSomalia. Now, his son did not die in vain because he was doing what he \nhad signed up to do, and he was doing it with honor, and he was a great \nkid, Casey Joyce, just the kind of young man or the kind of young woman \nthat I see as I visit our bases across the country. But I said that \nnight I would never vote to send our troops into harm's way if I could \nnot give the mother or father a good answer about why.\n  Mr. President, sending our troops into Bosnia under these \ncircumstances is not meeting the test. Mr. President, I am urging the \nPresident of the United States to reconsider his decision, to make sure \nthat he is sure, before he deploys American troops, that it is a U.S. \nsecurity interest--not just an interest, which we certainly have and \nwhich we can fulfill without American lives on the line. I want the \nPresident to reconsider his decision, and I hope that he will.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nMontelongo, a fellow in Senator Hutchison's office, be granted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of the resolution on Bosnia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison motion. \nI want to share with the Senate the concerns that I bring to a \ndeployment of combat troops into Bosnia. Mr. President, I would, first, \nlike to start with some things I think Members will agree on--at least \nI think they are facts that would be acknowledged by both sides in this \ndebate.\n  First, the confrontation that we now enter by sending troops into \nwhat was the old Yugoslavia is a confrontation that is not new. It is a \nconflict that is at least 500 years old and, in some respects, goes \nback 800 years. For those who have talked to the participants, whether \nCroatian, Bosnian, or Serbian, they well know that those people not \nonly are aware of that conflict, but they can recite to you the names \nand dates of the battles, going back hundreds and hundreds of years. In \nmany cases, they remember battles that go back before the founding of \nour own Nation. This is not a new conflict. It is a conflict that \npredates even the discovery of America.\n  Second, Mr. President, I think it should be noted that what we enter \ninto is a civil war. We enter into a conflict between the Croatians, \nthe Serbs, and the Bosnians, and potentially other parties as well. But \nthis is different than an effort by Germany to conquer the world. It is \ndifferent than an effort by the Nazis to impose their will upon the \npeople of the world. It is different than the efforts of the former \nSoviet Union to spread its influence and control over the world. This \nis not an invasion of a country, this is a civil war. I think all \nMembers will agree that that is a fair and accurate summarization of \nthe conflict we enter.\n\n  Third, Mr. President, I think Members would be remiss if they did not \nhonestly note that the members of this conflict, the parties to this \nconflict, have not had a record of honoring peace agreements. For over \n500 years, this conflict has waged, and people have talked about peace, \na truce. For over 500 years, consistently, the peace agreements have \nbeen ignored.\n  When I talked to our troops in Sarajevo over Thanksgiving, one of the \nthings that our troops told me--there was a gathering at the Embassy of \nthe enlisted men of the contingent who have been in Sarajevo for some \ntime. One of them paused and said, ``I think I speak for all the people \nhere, I believe, when we say that while we view the Bosnians in this \nstruggle as the victims--and in many ways they have been--all sides \nhave committed atrocities in this confrontation and, frankly, we expect \nthe Bosnians, as well as the others, to break the peace agreement.''\n  Mr. President, it would be a tragic mistake for Americans to go into \nthis conflict without understanding that this peace agreement is not \ngoing to last.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, we now have an estimate from the \nadministration that the cost of this adventure will be at least $2 \nbillion. Frankly, Mr. President, there no presentation of how you are \ngoing to pay for it. At a time when we are struggling to bring the \ndeficit under control, we now have a proposal to spend $2 billion over \nthe budget. Mr. President, I must tell you, it is my own estimate that \nthe cost of this will be much higher than $2 billion. If there are \nMembers who disagree and would like to place a friendly wager on that, \nI welcome them. If anybody seriously believes that $1.5 to $2 billion \nis all this will cost the American people, I hope they will come \nforward and say it, and I hope they will back their belief with a wager \nas well. My own belief is that this will run much higher and could well \nrun $5 billion or more.\n  The reality is that we are sending combat troops into an area where \nwe do not have barracks, or quarters, or adequate roads to get them \nthere, or adequate equipment, and they do not have water or essential \nutilities. The reality is that the cost of this project will be much \nhigher.\n  Fifth, I think most Members would agree that the terrain where \nAmerican troops will be stationed, around the Tuzla area, is ideal for \nguerrilla warfare. Americans ought to understand guerrilla warfare. \nPerhaps we were one of the earliest ones who started it in our combat \nwith the British. We did not put on uniforms. We tended to stand behind \ntrees and shoot at the British, and it worked pretty well. The reality \nis that we did not fight by the rules the British thought we should \nfight by in the Revolutionary War. Anybody who thinks the Bosnians, \nSerbs, or Croats are going to fight by our rules in Bosnia is dreaming.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize, because I hope all Americans will be \naware of these five factors when they go into it. One, this conflict is \nover 500 years old. Second, we are interfering in a civil war--not an \ninvasion, but a civil war between the parties that have occupied that \ncountry.\n  Three, the parties involved have a history, a continuous history, of \nnot honoring the peace agreements that they enter into. For us to \nassume that the winter period when they traditionally have truces is \ngoing to be a permanent peace is naive, perhaps beyond description.\n  Four, the cost of this to the American people will be at least $2 \nbillion and perhaps more. \n\n[[Page S18406]]\n\n  Five, the terrain is ideal for guerrilla warfare. Mr. President, \nspecifically, what that means is the terrain is very rugged and very \nrough. It means that the area is heavily wooded, forest. In military \nterms, it means our advantages which are in air power and armored \npersonnel carriers and tanks, will be minimized. The roads are \nextremely narrow and there are over 3 million mines stated to be in the \nAmerican sector. Who in the world came up with the idea of deploying \nU.S. troops in that kind of conflict?\n  Mr. President, this is goofy. We are standing here and debating this \nquestion as if it were a real question. This is not a real question. \nThis is a goofy proposal--send American troops to stand in between \nwarring factions that have been at war for 500 years and never honor a \npeace agreement, under circumstances where we do not have the \nadvantages that our technology provides, and stand in between them as \nthey shoot at each other? That is not a realistic proposal. That is \njust plain goofy.\n  Mr. President, I think every American and perhaps every Member of \nthis body has to answer a question before they vote on this issue. The \nquestion is basically this: Under what circumstances do you send \nAmerican soldiers into combat? We have never had a unanimous feeling on \nthat in this country.\n  Perhaps defending our own shores, though, has garnered the strongest \nsupport of any measure. Americans have been willing to shed their blood \nto defend the shores of our country. We have been willing to shed our \nblood to defend freedom around the world, whether it was in World War I \nor World War II or perhaps even Korea.\n  We have never shrunk from defending freedom around the world. First, \nthrough alliances, for we had an obligation; second, for a country \nwhere we did not have a formal alliance but we saw freedom was at stake \nthat could ultimately affect the ability of Americans to obtain their \nfreedom; we have had times where we have been willing to shed blood to \ndeter aggression. We defended our shores in the Revolutionary War. We \ndefended our freedom through alliances in World War II. We defended our \nfreedom overseas in Korea. We defended countries from aggression in the \ngulf war.\n\n  Mr. President, where have we come up with the idea that we would \ninterfere in a civil war? That is without precedence. Deploying \nAmerican Forces overseas to interfere in the middle of a civil war, \nthis takes it to a new height.\n  Mr. President, the mistakes we made in the past, and Americans have \nmade mistakes in the past, have led to some guidelines. The Weinberger \nguidelines came out after Lebanon and after Vietnam. There were a \nnumber of factors but the most significant one was this: Before we \ndeploy American troops overseas, before we put their lives in harm's \nway, before we risk their very lives, we ought to have a clear, \nachievable, military mission that is accomplishable.\n  I hope Members will ask themselves if they really think this is a \nclear, achievable, military mission that can be accomplished? Listen to \nwhat they are saying. The first task is to mark the border, the area of \nconfrontation, and secure people moving back 2 kilometers on either \nside. But that border is not meant to close off traffic across it. How \ndo you ensure people will not get within the 2 kilometers of the border \nwhen you have an established policy that allows people to move through \nthe border all of the time?\n  Mr. President, that is double-talk. If you are going to have a \nborder, and if you are going to have people kept away from it on 2 \nkilometers on either side, and if you are going to have a policy at the \nsame time that says people can go back and forth at will, how in the \nworld do you make that policy stick? You cannot. It is unrealistic and \nundefined right from the start.\n  Who do you stop? Who do you stop? Do you search everybody? It is not \nclear.\n  To call in a clear military mission is to play games with words as \nwell as play games with the lives of our troops.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, I believe it comes down to this: Are you \nwilling to send American troops overseas and risk their lives for an \nill-defined mission that interferes in the middle of a civil war? Are \nyou willing to face their parents, tell them why their son or daughter \ngave their life?\n  Are memories so short that Members have forgotten what happened in \nVietnam? Does no one remember that we sent hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican volunteers to Vietnam, as well as draftees, and asked them to \nput their lives on the line, and our political leaders were not willing \nto take the risk of making a commitment? I do not know of any American \nthat is proud of that fact but it is the truth. Over 50,000 Americans \nlost their lives in Vietnam, and for what?\n\n  Mr. President, I volunteered to serve in Vietnam and I did because I \nbelieved in it. I believed we were there to defend freedom worldwide, \nand whether it was the face of a Vietnamese or the face of a European-\nAmerican, blood could be proudly spilled to save their freedom.\n  Mr. President, our political leaders did not believe that. Our \npolitical leaders asked people to give their blood but were not willing \nto take a chance and make a clear stand. They were not willing to \nestablish a clear military mission.\n  Mr. President, this is not a PR game. The risks are not good press or \nbad press. The risks are American lives. The risk is parents losing \ntheir child. The risk is a spilling of blood and not standing for a \ncause.\n  We made a mistake in Vietnam because our leaders risked American \nlives for a cause they were not willing to commit themselves to win. \nNow, not many of us realized that was the case. If you told the people \nthat served in Vietnam their political leaders were not willing to \nstand up to win the cause they were asked to give their life for, they \nwould not have believed you. Who would have believed you? How could you \nask people to give their lives when their political leaders did not \nbelieve in the cause? That is what this country did.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that the American people when it was \nover vowed that would never happen again. If the cause was important \nenough to ask people to sacrifice their lives, it is important enough \nfor us to try to win. Our mistakes did not end there.\n  President Reagan deployed troops into Lebanon. We were so concerned \nabout PR that the guards at the gate were not even given the bullets \nfor their guns. Let me repeat that because I think most Americans will \nfind it hard to believe. We had a barracks full of Marines, and the \nguards at the gate were not given bullets for their guns because we \nwere afraid of an incident. Instead of suffering bad publicity for an \nincident we were willing to sacrifice the safety of troops.\n  That is what happened. A terrorist truck drove through the gate \nbecause the guards did not have bullets to stop him and killed over 250 \nAmericans, or close to 250 Americans. For what? For what? Tell me what \nthey gave their lives for.\n  We made a political commitment that sounded good but we would not \nstand behind it. It seems to me before we make a political commitment, \nbefore we send U.S. troops, we better have a good reason for doing it, \nand it ought to be important enough for us to stand behind the people \nwho put the uniform of this country on.\n  Does anybody believe that we will not stand behind the troops that we \nsend to Bosnia? Come on, now. Yes, this will generate press. Yes, there \nwill be a lot of attention. Does anybody really believe we will not \nstand behind those young men and women who go over? Does anybody \nbelieve the cause of interfering in a civil war is important enough to \nlose their lives?\n\n  Somalia should come to mind to some. President Bush deployed the \ntroops. President Clinton expanded the mission. And when the commander \nof the troops asked for equipment to do their jobs, to protect the \ntroops, the Secretary of Defense--because the decision went all the way \nup to the Secretary of Defense--turned them down. He refused to allow \nthem to have armored personnel carriers which had been specifically \nrequested. Why? We asked the Armed Services Committee to ask the \nSecretary that question. Before he gave the answer, he left office.\n  But the truth is, the military establishment of this country made a \ndecision to not supply the equipment that was needed to save those \nboys' lives because they were afraid it would send \n\n[[Page S18407]]\nthe wrong public relations signal. That was the word that came out: We \ndid not want to send the wrong signal. Public relations was apparently \nmore important than the lives of the American servicemen that were on \nthe line.\n  In case anyone has forgotten, that helicopter went down and they \ndefended themselves from attack and they called for reinforcements. And \nreinforcements tried to come from the airport compound but they did not \nhave armored personnel carriers. And when people shot at them from both \nsides they pinned down the reinforcements, they could not get through \nto help them. American forces held out as long as they could and, when \ntheir ammunition ran out, when their ammunition ran out the Somalis \ncame and hacked them to pieces. And the armored personnel carriers that \nthey requested and had been turned down by the Secretary of Defense for \nPR reasons, could have saved their lives.\n  We are not playing games. This is not a PR move. These are real \ntroops and real bullets in a real civil war. We are risking American \nlives. For what? Because you are going to end a 500-year-old conflict? \nDo not be silly.\n  Because these people, with American troops' presence, will suddenly \nhonor their peace commitments that they have never honored in 500 \nyears? Somebody would like to sell you some land in Florida, if you \nreally believe that.\n  The truth is, I do not believe we have placed a high enough value on \nthe lives of the Americans who serve our country in uniform. The \nquestion is not whether or not they should ever risk their lives. No \none should go in the military not knowing they do that. Americans are \nwilling to risk their lives and we are willing to shed our blood for \nfreedom around the world, and we have done it more effectively and more \nefficiently than any people in modern history. But the line is drawn \nwhen you ask Americans to give their lives for nothing. I believe that \nis morally wrong. I believe it is morally wrong, to have Americans give \ntheir lives in Somalia when you do not have a clear military mission \nand you will not stand behind them.\n\n  It is not wrong to ask them to give their lives and shed their blood. \nIt is wrong to ask them to do it for nothing, and that is what we did \nin Somalia. It is wrong to ask them to do it for nothing in Lebanon, \nwhich is precisely what happened. It is wrong to ask them to do it for \nnothing in Vietnam, when our very leaders would not stand behind the \nmen and women who risked their lives.\n  I believe it is wrong, it is morally wrong for us to send young \npeople to Bosnia to risk their lives in the middle of a civil war among \npeople who have not honored a peace agreement.\n  Some would say, if we do it, at least they have had their chance. \nTell me how you would feel, looking into the eyes of a parent who had \nlost his or her only child. ``Yes, your son or daughter died, but at \nleast we gave them a chance.'' Would it not be fair and reasonable to \nask, ``Was it a good idea? Did it have reasonable prospects to succeed? \nDid you do everything you could to protect them?''\n  Mr. President, what we are faced with is a decision that degrades the \nvalue of American servicemen and servicewomen. It says that their blood \ncan be shed on a whim; that they are pawns in a chess game; that their \nlives are not important enough for us to take seriously.\n  I believe every person who puts on a uniform has an obligation to \nthis country, and the obligation goes to laying down their very lives. \nBut I think it is wrong for us to think that obligation runs in only \none direction.\n  This country has an obligation to those who serve it as well, and \nthat obligation is to make sure we never put them in harm's way unless \nit is on a clear, achievable, military mission, one that we are \ncommitted to win. Then I think we have the right to ask everything in \nthe world from them, everything they can give, because the existence of \nfreedom in this world depends on them. What we see is an effort to \ncheapen the value of the lives of young Americans who are willing to \nserve this country.

Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \nPresident's decision to deploy ground troops and ground forces in \nBosnia.\n  I first would like to compliment Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Brown, and Senator Thomas as well for outstanding speeches. \nSome of the best speeches that have been made in the Senate have been \nmade this evening. Senator Brown just concluded with a very moving \nspeech detailing his opposition to the President's move. I agree \nwholeheartedly with their comments.\n  I also will make a comment. I have been to Yugoslavia with Senator \nDole. Some people are saying these resolutions are in opposition to \neach other. I would take issue with that fact. One of the resolutions \nwe are going to be voting on that I had something to do with, or was \ninvolved with, said that we state our opposition to the President's \ndecision to deploy ground troops in Bosnia--very clear, very plain, \nvery simple. We think the President is making a mistake, and we want to \nbe on record of it.\n  Mr. President, I will go further. I wish that we would have had a \nsimilar resolution when the President made the decision to deploy our \nArmed Forces into Haiti. I think he made a mistake. I have heard others \nin the administration say that was a success, and maybe that is the way \nthey would define success. But I thought it was a mistake to have the \ninvasion and occupation of Haiti.\n  I wish that we would have had a chance to debate that and that we \nwould have had a sensible debate on it. We did not have that.\n  So I am pleased that we are going to have debate on these two \nresolutions today and tomorrow. Some of my colleagues said, ``Well, we \nwish we could have had more extensive debate.'' I would agree with \nthat. But the President is going to Paris tomorrow evening to sign an \naccord on Thursday, and not only will the Senate be taking this up but \nthe House will be. So it is important for us to take it up today and \ndispose of these two resolutions--maybe three resolutions--by tomorrow.\n  Also, Mr. President, I want to make just a couple of comments on how \nwe got here and why I have decided to oppose the President's decision \nto deploy these troops.\n  In the first place, I mentioned my opposition to the President's \ndecision on sending troops into Haiti. Senator Brown commented on the \nPresident's mistaken mission in Somalia where the mission moved from a \nhumanitarian mission into that of peace enforcing, or peacekeeping, and \na greatly expanded humanitarian role that resulted in the loss of 18 \nAmerican lives. \n\n[[Page S18408]]\n\n  But I want to go back a little bit further. I read in President \nClinton's book in 1992, ``Putting People First''--then candidate Bill \nClinton. He stated his administration would ``support the recent more \nactive role of the United Nations in troubled spots around the world, \nand pursue the establishment of a voluntary U.N. rapid deployment force \nto deter aggression, provide humanitarian relief, and combat terrorism \nand drug trafficking.''\n  That is on page 135.\n  In 1993, the President's proposed PDD-13, an expansion of the U.S. \nrole in U.N. operations, and multinational U.S. forces under a foreign \nmultinational U.N. military command. He proposed creating in the office \nof the Secretary of Defense an Office of Peacekeeping and Democracy at \nthe Pentagon, talking about having this post be used to coordinate \ninternational peacekeeping forces.\n  I think that is a mistake. I have debated that and raised that on the \nfloor of the Senate in the past.\n  Let me talk a little bit about my opposition to the President's use \nand deployment of ground forces in this area. I heard the President's \nspeech to the Nation, and he talked about this is going to be a \n``clearly defined military mission.'' I do not see any way that anyone \ncan call this a clearly defined military mission. Maybe I am thinking \nin more simple terms. But clearly defined military mission would be \nsimilar to the Persian Gulf where you had Iraq invade Kuwait, and we \nsaid that invasion will not stand, and we are going to kick them out of \nKuwait. An army invaded. We are not going to allow that to stand. We \nare going to knock the army out. That is what we did. President Bush \nsaid that is what our objective was. It had a clearly definable \nmilitary objective. We built the forces necessary to make that happen, \nand we executed it. Then our forces came home.\n  That is not the case in Bosnia. This is a map of Bosnia. This is the \ncountry of Bosnia. It is under control partly by the Serbs. It is under \ncontrol partly by the Moslems. It is under control partly by the \nCroatians. Each of these areas have different ethnic groups that have \nbeen fighting for centuries.\n  So now we are going to have military forces serve as a buffer all \naround, all throughout Bosnia. That is going to be a very difficult \ngoal.\n  How is that a clearly definable military objective? We are going to \ninsert our troops between fighting factions. But we are going to allow \npeople to move back and forth. And then there are all kinds of missions \nand roles. We are going to allow refugees to return to their homes. In \nsome areas right now they are not complying with the accord that has \nalready been signed. We are going to enforce the Dayton agreement. This \nwas a U.S.-led agreement, the Dayton accord. And all three Presidents \nsigned it. The leaders of the Serbians, the leaders of Bosnia, and the \nleaders of Croatia signed that agreement. They are not complying with \nit now. But we are going to put U.S. forces in--almost an \nAmericanization of this conflict. And we are going to have U.S. forces \nin charge of carrying out the Dayton accord.\n  Since that accord has been signed, I hope my colleagues are aware of \nsome of the violations that have taken place. Bosnian Croat soldiers \nhave defied the peace plan by looting and setting ablaze a couple of \ntowns. Those towns are to be shifted from Croatian control to Bosnian \nSerb control. They are burning the town. That is not in the Dayton \naccord, but they are doing it. I guess our troops are going to stop \nthat.\n  Last week the Croats released from jail Ivica Rajic, who was indicted \nby the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. Such action is \nin direct violation of the Dayton accord where all sides pledged to \ncooperate with the tribunal. They released him.\n\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has said, well, we are going to put \nour troops in. Originally, some time ago, he said we would put U.S. \ntroops in. Then, earlier this year, he said we would put in troops for \na reconfiguring and strengthening of U.N. forces in Bosnia. The United \nNations has had 30,000 troops there in the Bosnia area. They were not \nbringing about peace. All sides continued to fight, to move the map \naround. He said we would commit U.S. forces. He did not ask Congress. \nHe said we will commit U.S. forces to redeploy and reconfigure. Well, \nthat was a mistake.\n  Mr. President, if you look at this goal, are U.S. forces and the rest \nof NATO forces now going to be in charge of policing? Are we going to \ngo in and arrest people who are guilty of war crimes?\n  It seems to me that is what we were trying to do in Somalia. We tried \nto get General Aideed because he was guilty of some crimes, and the net \nresult was, yes, we had troops going in harm's way and we lost a lot of \nlives, as Senator Brown alluded to. We did not provide the military \nsupport.\n  Now the President said, I understand, we are going to send in \nmilitary support. Is that one of our goals? Are we going to be \npolicemen? Are we going to go and arrest people for crimes against the \nother sides? Are we going to enforce refugee resettlements? Are we \ngoing to tell Serbs in Croat homes they are going to have to get out of \nthose homes, and vice versa, and use force of bayonets?\n  Are we going to use our forces strictly as a buffer zone in dangerous \nareas, targets on both sides, allowing people to move back and forth \nthat may have a violent intent either against the other side that they \nhave been fighting for years or maybe against the United States? Are we \ngoing to use U.S. forces to clear mines?\n  And I know I have some Oklahomans now that are trained in that area, \nso they are going to go in. We are going to use them to clear certain \nareas for mines. And what if somebody runs away that is guilty of \nfiring on our troops and happens to evade them over a mine field and so \nwe risk more lives? And what about this idea--the President said, well, \nthis is a NATO mission, and I have heard people say this is a vital \nrole for NATO because if we do not do it, this is going to show that \nNATO has no valuable purpose.\n  NATO was created as a defensive alliance to deter invasion or \naggression from Russia. And now we are taking NATO troops from the NATO \nallies and saying we are going to put NATO in a peacekeeping force in a \nnon-NATO country. Bosnia was not invaded by Russia. It was not invaded \nby other non-Yugoslavian countries. The Serbs certainly did take their \nfair share of the territory and the Croatians are in there as well, but \nthis is Yugoslavia's civil war. But we are now putting an expansion of \nthe NATO role into moving from a defensive alliance, which we have been \nthe leader and the supporter of, that has proven to be so successful \nfor the last 40 or 50 years, now we are putting it into a peacekeeping \nrole, into a non-NATO country, into an area where the U.N. peacekeepers \nwere not successful and so now we are going to greatly expand NATO's \nrole.\n  I think we need to discuss that and debate it. Is this what NATO's \nmission is going to be in the future? It looks like NATO creep, mission \ncreep, to me. And one that I have serious reservations about, very \nserious reservations about.\n  Some have said, well, this is important; we need to make sure that \nthis war does not expand. There is lots of potential for this war to \nexpand as a result of this effort. Now a lot of the Serbian areas are \ngoing to have Russian troops in them, and a lot of Moslem areas are \ngoing to have Western troops including the United States. What happens \nif some Serbs happen to fire on some Moslems and we try to interject, \nand so we return fire against the Serbs, and maybe the Russians are in \nthat quarter--and so there is the possibility of some conflict between \nUnited States and Russia.\n  I hope that does not happen. I pray it does not happen. But I see a \nlot of potential where there can be some spillover from this so-called \npeacekeeping force.\n  Mr. President, we call this peacekeeping, but really what this is is \npeace enforcing, so it has moved a giant step against peacekeeping. If \nit is really peacekeeping, they would not have to be there. If there \nwas peace, they would not have to be there. As Senator Brown mentioned, \nthey have been fighting for hundreds and hundreds of years. How in the \nworld are we going to go in and solve this problem in 12 months and \nthen go out?\n  And what about the 12-month timetable? Is that to say our military \nobjective is going to be totally complete \n\n[[Page S18409]]\nin 12 months or is that a political timetable: Oh, we better get them \nout before the next election. It sounds a lot more political to me than \nit does a militarily definable, achievable objective. Oh, in 12 months \nwe are going to be gone regardless of what happens.\n  Well, that does not seem to make sense. Is there a militarily \ndefinable objective? I do not think so. I think we are in the process \nof getting bogged down in a lot of nation building.\n  You say, oh, well, how could that be? If you read the Dayton accord, \nit talks about a lot of things. It talks about policing the agreement. \nIt talks about buffer zones. It talks about refugees and resettlements. \nIt also talks about establishing a constitution and a democracy and a \nrevolving presidency, a revolving presidency between the Croatians, the \nMoslems, and the Serbs.\n  That may sound nice and look kind of good on paper in Dayton, OH, but \nI question whether that is going to work. If you go back a little bit \nin history in the former Yugoslavia, where you had several republics, \nthey were supposed to have revolving presidencies. Guess what. The \nSerbs ended up getting control and they revolved or rotated the \npresidency. They still have it. Mr. Milosevic was still running Greater \nSerbia, and he wanted to expand Greater Serbia. That is the reason they \nmoved into Bosnia. So this idea of a revolving presidency certainly is \nnation building, i.e., and that sounds a lot like Somalia. That does \nnot sound like a militarily achievable objective, at least in my \nopinion.\n  And so we look at the resolutions that are before us. The resolution \nthat I am speaking on behalf of as well as Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Inhofe Senator Brown, Senator Kyl, and others says we oppose \nthe President's decision to send ground forces into Bosnia to carry out \nthe Dayton accord. I look at the arguments for it, and I think if you \nlook at this map, it looks like a congressional district in Louisiana. \nAnd you see a lot of areas. Well, while there are Serbs in this area, \nthey have to move back and the Bosnians will have to take control and \nSarajevo Serbs have control in some areas and they say they are not \ngoing to give it up.\n  Does that mean U.S. forces or other forces are going to come in and \nenforce that agreement? And what if they do not give it up without a \nfight? And on and on and on. And this is throughout. What if they say, \nwell, before we leave, we are going to raze it or we are going to burn \nit. And that is what they are doing right now. Or what if there are war \ncriminals and they say, instead of apprehending them, we are going to \nlet them go, as they just did in one case where the Croatians released \na person indicted by the international tribunal.\n  In other words, there are already big, large, gross violations of the \nDayton accord, and now we are going to be putting U.S. forces in. Now, \nU.S. forces, or at least a lot of U.S. forces that I know from \nOklahoma, they will not know the difference between the Serbs and the \nMoslems and Croatians, who are the good guys and bad guys. I tell you, \nthere are lots of bad guys around on all three sides, but yet we are \ngoing to be putting U.S. forces under an American general to be making \ndecisions. So we are almost Americanizing this war. But we say we are \ngoing to be out in 12 months. I do not see it adding up. I do not see \nit working. I do see us risking a lot of U.S. lives and a lot of \nprestige for something I think is clearly not definable.\n  Now, look at Secretary Christopher's words. He testified in April \n1993 before the Appropriations Committee. He said four criteria have to \nbe met before American troops will be deployed.\n  Now, this proves a couple things. One, they were talking about \ndeploying American troops 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Well, now they have been \nsuccessful. But they said the goals must be clear and understandable to \nthe American people. Well, that has not happened. That is a big no. You \nask the American people, what are our goals? Well, we are going to get \nout in 12 months. We want to speak for peace, but if we look at all \nthese guidelines where we are going to be the buffer, no, I do not \nthink so. If you say we want American forces to be clearing mines, \nsomething like 5 or 6 million mines, landmines, hopefully we will not \nlose any American troops to landmines, but I am sure that we will.\n  And Americans are going to start questioning those goals. ``Wait a \nminute. Why are we there? The chances of success must be high.'' I do \nnot think they are high. I hope they are. I hope there is peace.\n  But I think just because we have deployed ground forces, what happens \nwhen we leave? We may be somewhat successful with 60,000 troops. \nPutting them into an area smaller than the State of West Virginia, that \nis a lot of troops for an area that size. Bosnia is a small area, about \n60 percent of the size of South Carolina, a little smaller than West \nVirginia. It has about 4.5 to 5 million people, so it has a lot of \npeople. But we are going to put 60,000 troops in there.\n  We may successful in restoring some degree of peace for a while. What \nhappens when we leave? We said we are going to be gone in 12 months. I \nam afraid the war is going to start again. If so, then I say, hey, that \nhas not been successful. If we leave, like we did after Lebanon or like \nwe did after Somalia, I would say that is not a success. We may have \nalleviated some of the fighting or some of the starvation for a short \nperiod of time, but if they start fighting, as they, I am afraid, will \nin this case, I do not think that we have been successful.\n  Third, this is Secretary Christopher's criterion: The American people \nmust support the effort. The American people do not support this \neffort. I do not believe you should manage foreign policy by polls, but \nI do think, before you commit U.S. ground forces and make a commitment \nwhere we are going to be committing U.S. forces and lives, you should \nhave some support of the American people.\n  The American people are opposing this action by a two-to-one margin. \nThat has not changed since the President has tried the make his case, \nand the administration people have tried to make his case.\n  And then, an exit strategy for getting the troops out must be \nestablished from the beginning. We do not have an exit strategy. We \nhave a timetable that says we are out in 12 months, not that we \naccomplished our objective, because our objective is not that clear, is \nnot that definable. It just says we are going to be out. That is a \ntimetable for exit, but it does not say anything has to be \naccomplished. Again, I think it is a mistake. Under Secretary \nChristopher's own criteria I think it fails on all four categories.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should send U.S. ground forces. I \nthink President Clinton has made a mistake. I think if you look back at \nthe statements that this administration has made, even as a candidate, \nas the policies go back for the last 3 years, they have been talking \nabout putting U.S. ground forces in international peacekeeping efforts. \nI am afraid we are making a mistake, like at the date in the accord, \nthe date in the agreement.\n  I see lots and lots of areas that are nation building. So we are \ngoing to be committing United States ground forces into rebuilding a \ndemocracy or a government in Bosnia, a government that is very \nfractured, a government that is very divided, with ethnic divisions, \none where there is a lot of hatred, a lot of animosity, and putting \nUnited States forces right in the middle. That is not a clearly \ndefinable military objective.\n  Again, I think it is a serious mistake. So I hope that our colleagues \nwill support this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Judge \nAbraham Sofaer that was in the Wall Street Journal, which points out \nmany of the shortcomings of the Dayton accord, be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Clinton Needs Congress on Bosnia\n\n                         (By Abraham D. Sofaer)\n\n       President Clinton has appealed to Congress and the American \n     people to support his policy committing 20,000 ground troops \n     to implement the peace agreement reached between Serbia, \n     Croatia and Bosnia. It is a tribute to the American people \n     that the president is accorded the greatest deference when he \n     calls for the greatest sacrifice. Americans respond, at least \n     initially, to such appeals from their president.\n       But Mr. Clinton is exploiting this quality. He has \n     presented the agreement and the American role in its \n     enforcement as an accomplished fact, though the documents \n     have yet to be signed by the parties, and numerous \n     preconditions to U.S. involvement have \n\n[[Page S18410]]\n     yet to be fulfilled. He is consulting with Congress, but he is already \n     sending troops to the area without any form of legislative \n     approval. Indeed, he claims that, while he would welcome \n     Congress's approval, he plans to go ahead regardless.\n       Presidents often try to get what they want by leading \n     aggressively. Congress nevertheless has a duty to study \n     carefully the proposed operation and then express its view. \n     The essential first step in that debate is to read the \n     documents signed recently in Dayton. The complex agreement, \n     with 12 annexes, calls for Bosnia to remain a single but \n     divided nation, and all the warring factions to withdraw to \n     specific lines. The agreement covers virtually all aspects of \n     future life in Bosnia, including the division of its \n     governments, the contents of its constitution, the selection \n     of its judges, and the manner in which its police force is to \n     be chosen and trained. Of principal interest to Congress, \n     though, are those aspects of the agreement that create \n     obligations and expectations for the U.S. to fulfill.\n\n\n                            our obligations\n\n       These obligations, when carefully examined in context, \n     carry to the ultimate extreme the policy of forcing a \n     settlement on the Bosnians, rather than attempting to create \n     an internal situation that is militarily balanced. Most \n     significantly, the agreement makes the U.S., through the \n     ``implementation force'' (IFOR), the military guarantor of \n     the overall arrangement.\n       The role of U.S. troops cannot be characterized as \n     ``peacekeeping.'' Even ``implementation'' understates our \n     obligation, IFOR will be close to an occupying army, in a \n     conflict that has merely been suspended. We are likely to \n     have as many difficulties acting as occupiers without having \n     won a victory as the U.N.'s war crimes tribunal is having in \n     attempting to apply its decisions in Bosnia without the power \n     to enforce them.\n       IFOR's principal responsibilities are set out in Annex 1(a) \n     of the agreement:\n       The parties agree to cease hostilities and to withdraw all \n     forces to agreed lines in three phases. Detailed rules have \n     been agreed upon, including special provisions regarding \n     Sarajevo and Gorazde. But IFOR is responsible for marking the \n     ceasefire lines and the ``inter-entity boundary line and its \n     zone of separation,'' which in effect will divide the Bosnian \n     Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian Serbs. The parties agree \n     that IFOR may use all necessary force to ensure their \n     compliance with these disengagement rules.\n       The parties agree to ``strictly avoid committing any \n     reprisals, counterattacks, or any unilateral actions in \n     response to violations of this annex by another party.'' The \n     only response allowed to alleged violations is through the \n     procedures provided in Article VIII of the Annex, which \n     establishes a ``joint military commission''--made up of all \n     the parties--to consider military complaints, questions and \n     problems. But the commission is only ``a consultative body \n     for the IFOR commander,'' an American general who is \n     explicitly deemed ``the final authority in theater regarding \n     interpretation of this agreement. . . .'' This enormous \n     power--to prevent even acts of self defense--will carry \n     proportionate responsibility for harm that any party may \n     attribute to IFOR's lack of responsiveness or fairness.\n       IFOR is also given the responsibility to support various \n     nonmilitary tasks, including creating conditions for free and \n     fair elections; assisting humanitarian organizations; \n     observing and preventing ``interference with the movement of \n     civilian populations, refugees, and displaced persons''; \n     clearing the roads of mines; controlling all airspace (even \n     for civilian air travel); and ensuring access to all areas \n     unimpeded by checkpoints, roadblocks or other obstacles. \n     Taken together, these duties essentially give IFOR control of \n     the physical infrastructure of both parts of the Bosnian \n     state. It seems doubtful that the 60,000-man force could meet \n     these expectations.\n       Article IX of the agreement recognizes the ``obligation of \n     all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution \n     of war crimes and other violations of international \n     humanitarian law.'' This is an especially sensitive matter. \n     Yet there is no mechanism in the accord for bringing to \n     justice men who haven't been defeated in battle and who \n     aren't in custody. This means that IFOR is almost certain to \n     come under pressure by victims and human rights advocates to \n     capture and deliver up the principal villains. Will it do \n     better than we did in fulfilling our promise to capture \n     Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia?\n       The agreement makes vague promises about reversing ``ethnic \n     cleansing'' by guaranteeing refugees the right to return to \n     their homes. Since this is in practice impossible, the West \n     will end up paying billions in compensation awards promised \n     in the agreement.\n       The agreement contains numerous provisions regarding the \n     manner in which Bosnia is to be governed, with checks and \n     balances built in that are based on ethnic or geographic \n     terms. But Americans traditionally have not believed in such \n     divisions of political authority. We fought the Civil War to \n     put into place an undivided nation based on the principle \n     that all people are of equal worth, and all must live in \n     accordance with the law. It took a Tito to keep the \n     ethnically divided Yugoslavia together. Will IFOR now assume \n     his role of enforcing a constitution based on principles \n     abhorrent to Western values? Even if the basic structure of \n     the government works, what role will IFOR have to play in \n     resolving disputes over the numerous sensitive areas that the \n     parties have seen fit to write into the accords? If the \n     parties don't resolve some matters successfully, they are \n     likely to blame IFOR for these failures.\n       Finally, the agreement draws a vague distinction between \n     ``military'' and ``civilian'' matters. Ultimate authority \n     over the latter is allocated to a U.N. high representative, \n     who is to act through a ``joint civilian commission'' \n     consisting of senior political representatives of the parties \n     and the IFOR commander or his representative. The high \n     representative is to exchange information and maintain \n     liaison on a regular basis with IFOR, and shall attend or be \n     represented at meetings of the joint military commission and \n     offer advice ``particularly on matters of a political-\n     military nature.'' But it is also made clear that the high \n     representative ``shall have no authority over the IFOR and \n     shall not in any way interfere in the conduct of military \n     operations or the IFOR chain of command.''\n       This may seem a reassuring confirmation of IFOR's power to \n     avoid U.N. restrictions on the use of force. Ultimately, \n     however, IFOR's role could be made untenable if it finds \n     itself in a confrontation with the U.N.'s designated \n     representative and the proper handling of a ``political'' \n     matter. What would happen, for example, if the U.N. high \n     representative determined that U.S. forces had gone too far \n     in defending themselves under President Clinton's policy of \n     effectively responding to attacks ``and then some''?\n\n\n                               either/or\n\n       Congress cannot redo the agreement reached by the parties. \n     But there is no need for lawmakers to accept President \n     Clinton's either/or approach--either support his plan to \n     implement the agreement, or pull out entirely. If the \n     agreement represents a genuine desire for peace among the \n     warring parties, then presumably the accord is not so fragile \n     as to depend on the oral commitment of U.S. troops made by \n     the administration (and which isn't even part of the \n     agreement). Congress can and should consider other options. \n     The U.S., for example, could assist European forces in \n     demarcating the boundary lines, and could enforce peace in \n     the area through the threat of air strikes on important \n     targets. Or the U.S. could offer greater monetary and \n     diplomatic support for the agreement but not any ground \n     troops.\n       Whatever happens with the troop commitment, Congress should \n     insist that the agreement's provisions allowing the training \n     and arming of the Bosnian Muslims be rigorously adhered to. A \n     balance of power among the hostile parties is ultimately the \n     only basis for long-term stability in the region. And if \n     American troops are sent to Bosnia, they will be unable to \n     leave responsibly until such a balance has been developed. \n     That would certainly take longer than the yearlong limit \n     imposed by the administration.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the last \nseveral speakers here on the floor, and I find myself almost at a loss \nas to where to start. If we go through a factual reality check here, on \nhow this situation developed, I do not find it much like what I hear \nbeing discussed here on the floor.\n  One of the speakers this evening talked about our entry into combat \nand equated it with Vietnam, equated it with Lebanon, where President \nReagan--whose name has not been mentioned here although Clinton's has \nthis evening, that is for sure--put 1,600 troops into Lebanon and said, \n``We're going to stabilize Lebanon by making an example there, and that \nwill bring them around.'' That is what got us into the trouble, not \nthinking the thing through, and thinking that a little bitty show of \nforce would bring an end to what had been very lengthy combat in \nLebanon.\n  So I think we need a reality check here. To equate this whole effort \nas just some sort of a PR stunt does a disservice to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and to our Government. It was even questioned as to whether \nwe would stand behind our troops in Bosnia once they are in there. What \na ridiculous statement. I find that abhorrent.\n  Now, statements were made that we were injecting our people into a \ncivil war, we are putting our people into combat. Now, let us get back \nto reality here.\n  I agree completely that there have been long and historical \ndifficulties in the Balkans. We do not need to run through all those \nthis evening except to say some of these problems literally go back to \nthe time of the Caesars. They are that old. The ethnic, political, and \nreligious differences in that area led one of the Caesars to split the \narea that later became Yugoslavia into the East Roman Empire and West \n\n[[Page S18411]]\nRoman Empire. That is how the orthodox influence came up into that part \nof the world.\n  It has been a caldron of problems that contributed to the beginnings \nof two world wars. We have always had an interest in that area. We have \na lot of people in our own country, a lot of people in my home State of \nOhio representing the different ethnic groups in that part of the \nworld.\n  President Clinton said we would send 20,000 people in if--these were \nbig ``if's''--if we could get arrangements for fighting to be stopped, \nso we could move in. We are not going to fight our way in. We did not \nmake a commitment to actually send them in until some other things \nhappened.\n  What were those other things? And these are very, very important. \nWhat happened was that over the past 4 years the war has become so \ndifficult for people in that area, that they wanted peace. They asked \nus to broker the peace. We did not suggest fighting our way in there. \nPresident Clinton has not said we are going to fight our way in there. \nQuite the opposite. They came to us and said they are tired of war.\n  My colleagues have asked how can we believe these people who have \nbeen fighting all these hundreds of years are not just going to keep on \nfighting. Well, the big difference now is that they are tired of war. \nShould we believe them or not?\n  Bosnia-Herzegovina is an area about one-half the size of the State of \nOhio--we are not a huge State; we have about 41,000 square miles of \nterritory in Ohio--Bosnia-Herzegovina is almost 20,000, 19,776 square \nmiles, about half the size of Ohio. In other words, think of Ohio, and \nInterstate 70 goes across the middle.\n  If, in that area down between that Interstate 70 and the Ohio River, \nwe had had 250,000 deaths in the last 4 years and we had two million \nrefugees in the last 4 years, would we be ready for peace? That is what \noccurred over in Bosnia. Even the most ardent warriors over there have \nbecome tired of war, of the slaughter and the dislocation of people.\n  While every individual may not be signed on, 100 percent going to lay \ndown their arms, this is what happened. They came to us. Diplomatic \nchannels said all parties seemed to be ready to have us broker a peace \nif it was possible.\n  I must commend Ambassador Holbrooke. I think he did a masterful job \nover there, stayed at it, stayed at it, stayed at it, back and forth, \none capital to another, one group to another until they had an \nagreement to go to another place and try to negotiate peace. They came \nto Dayton. Wright Patterson was selected because the facilities were \nthere providing security, some place to live, some appropriate \nbarracks, and so forth. So they came to Dayton.\n  Let me give my view. I was very dubious of this whole process at that \npoint. I thought they would come to Dayton and it would be a short-\nlived conference. And what happened? Well, they not only asked to \nnegotiate, but they, the parties involved, came to Dayton. They, the \nnational leaders, the heads of state, did something I would not have \nthought possible: They stayed at Dayton for 21 days, the heads of state \nstayed there for 21 days negotiating. They finally hammered this thing \nout, and they initialed an agreement there, all of them. And they will \nsign it the day after tomorrow in Paris.\n  So it is not our peace, it is their peace, with us making \nsuggestions. But they are the ones who initialed it. They are the ones \nwho asked to negotiate to begin with.\n  What is our part in it? Our part is to help implement what they have \nagreed to.\n  Much was made on the floor a few moments ago about what if they back \nout and the fighting starts again? They back out and what happens? I \nwill say this, if that happens and if they break the peace agreement \nthat they signed, that they wanted, that we brokered, that they agreed \nto, it is their failure, not ours. We are not there, as the President \nhas said, the Vice President has said, the Secretary of Defense has \nsaid, General Shalikashvili has said, General Joulwan in Europe briefed \nus, to enforce a peace by forcing anyone back across a border. If they \nhave decided this peace is no longer for them and they are going to \nstart fighting again, our commitment at that point is we tried, we gave \nyou people your chance at this thing, and we are out of there. We are \nnot there to conduct large-scale combat. If that were the case, we \nwould be going in with far more than 20,000 people, in my view.\n  But let us say they do not back out and peace comes to the Balkans. \nWe will have avoided the possibility of this conflict spreading over \ninto Macedonia, down toward Turkey, with all that might entail. We have \navoided the possibility of it breaking across borders up toward Europe, \nmaybe into Eastern Europe. And we will maybe, possibly, have peace in \nthat area because they asked for it, they wanted it.\n  I had doubts when they came to Dayton and I wanted to see two things \nhappen. I said this publicly at the time and talked to the President \nabout it, talked to the Vice President about it, and talked to the \nSecretary of Defense about it. Two things: First, this agreement could \nnot be wishful thinking. This agreement could not be something where we \nsay, Well, yes, we're going to go in over there, and, yeah, since they \nwant peace we will be able to settle in down there and we'll draw some \nborders once we get there and then we'll provide some peace.\n  No, we could not do it that way. I felt that would be a recipe for \ndisaster. I would have bet a sizable amount against the parties at \nDayton really drawing up an agreement in sufficient detail that, as I \nsaid one night in a meeting at the White House, we have to decide which \npeach orchard is in what entity when you draw these lines. It had to be \nin that kind of detail.\n  A second element was that the firing had to have stopped. That was a \ncommitment agreed to by everybody. The parties had to see that the \nirregulars also will have stopped firing. And then we go in to maintain \nthe peace.\n  What came out of the negotiations, as far as detail? I brought along \na chart. This is a chart they agreed to in Dayton. The detail was to be \n1 to 50,000 scale. This is a brandnew map, just a few days ago. This is \nthe separation zone. This area in here is an area that is an interim \nzone which the troops will move out of and back to these lines, and \nthat is to occur within a stated time period.\n  What is the accuracy of this? An inch on this scale would be \nsomewhere around 4,000 feet, and the center line that is the \ndemarcation line that we will monitor, shown in the center of this \nzone, accurate on this scale map to within 50 meters, close to 160 \nfeet. Now, that is pretty good accuracy.\n  We have the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All of that area has \nthis kind of a map. I could not bring all the maps, because 1 to 50,000 \nwould have an area about half the size of that wall at the end of the \nSenate Chamber. But our section will be up in this area, around Tuzla, \nup in this northeastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, depicted here.\n  This is Tuzla, which will be the American headquarters out of which \nwe will operate. We will be operating to keep these zones clear in \nhere. Why do we need to do that? If they said that they wanted peace, \nthey are tired of war, 250,000 people killed, 2 million refugees in a \nsmall area, why can they not all just sit down and say, Stop fighting, \nand that takes care of that?\n  One very good reason. The previous cease-fires that they have had in \nthat area have been broken, for the most part, by what are called the \nirregulars. We were briefed on that when we were over there a few weeks \nago. At least 20 percent, and some estimates run as high as 50 percent, \nof the combatants in this area are what they call irregulars. They are \nthe farmers who go up and shoot, are up there manning a rifle or \nmachinegun a few days, go back to their farm and somebody relieves \nthem. They are not the people who are used to the usual military \ncommands up and down the military structure.\n  What has happened on most of the past cease-fires, and they have had \nover 30 of them in these 4 years of war and they have always broken \ndown, is that somebody gets up there, triggers off a few rounds, the \nfiring spreads and pretty soon the cease-fire has broken down.\n  So the situation we find ourselves in is we have an agreement. I \nwould not have thought it was possible to reach \n\n[[Page S18412]]\nthe kind of agreement they did in Dayton. It is detailed. The borders \nare established. It has been initialed. It is laid out on the 1 to \n50,000 chart right here. In the local areas, they will have charts to a \nbigger scale, of course. The firing must have stopped, and the cease \nfire held while these negotiations were underway, by and large.\n  When we go in, it will not be to fight our way in. It will be to go \nin and man these zones that keep the combatants apart. One reason that \nis a 4-kilometer wide area is so the small arms fire cannot be used \nacross a zone. There are 2 kilometers on each side of that center mark \ndown the middle of that zone.\n  We will keep the forces separate. They say--they say, not us--they \nsay that they want peace. We have helped them negotiate an agreement, \nand surprisingly, it is in enough detail that you can pick out which \norchard is going to be where and which road intersection is going to be \nwhere. It is in that kind of detail. When we get over there, we will \nnot go into areas where there is any active fighting that may have \npopped up again. We are not going in to squelch someone, we are not \nthere to fight a war on one side or the other. We are there to set up a \nseparation zone and enforce it.\n  The question was asked on the floor here, what is our military task? \nMilitary tasks were agreed to at Dayton. The Secretary of Defense and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State \nhave repeated these things over and over again. All parties have agreed \nthat they will cooperate with us in these things that they asked us to \nenforce.\n  Let me add one thing here. Why us? Why do they want our involvement? \nWhy did they say they would not go along with just the other members of \nNATO unless we were involved? It is rather simple. They trust us and \nthey do not trust the Europeans in NATO, and they have said that. This \nwas stated to us in numerous briefings. They do not trust the others, \nbut they do trust the U.S.\n  Our job will be, first, to go in and supervise the selective marking \nof cease-fire lines, inter-entity boundary lines, and zones of \nseparation, which is what we are talking about here. First zones will \nbe marked, then military forces will begin moving out of the zones back \ninto these permanent areas here.\n\n  Once that has occurred, we will monitor and, if necessary, enforce \nwithdrawal of forces to their respective territories within an agreed \nperiod. We will ensure that they have withdrawn behind the zone of \nseparation within 30 days of transfer of authority. That is a clear \nmilitary task.\n  Then we will ensure redeployment of forces from areas to be \ntransferred from one entity to the other within 45 days of transfer of \nauthority.\n  Further, we will ensure no introduction of forces into transferred \nareas for an additional 45 days, establish and man the 4-kilometer zone \nof separation, outlined here on the chart, 2 kilometers on either side \nof the cease-fire interentity boundary line. We will establish liaison \nwith local military and civilian authorities, and we will create joint \nmilitary commissions to resolve any disputes that there may be between \nthe parties.\n  Now, the statement was made a while ago on the floor that it smacks \nof nation building for our military in there. That is not true. \nNationbuilding tasks are specifically not included as I-For tasks in \nthe Dayton accords.\n  Things that will not be I-For tasks are the humanitarian operations. \nThose will be handled by other international agencies. Nation building, \neconomics, and infrastructure will be handled by others, not by our \nmilitary. Disarming everyone is not an I-For task. Moving refugees is \nnot a job for our military, nor is policing local towns, and so on.\n  So this idea that we do not have clearly defined military tasks is \njust not true.\n  Once again, I am still somewhat amazed that everybody agreed to all \nthese things in Dayton and has said that they will abide by these \ncommitments. If the parties decide that they want out of the \nagreement--we are already agreed, the NATO Ambassadors have said, \nGeneral Joulwan told us during our briefings, and Secretary Christopher \nand Secretary Perry said, we are not there to fight on one side or the \nother. We would say that we successfully did our part. We would define \nour part as being a success if we went in there and manned these zones \nand kept them apart for a period of time, and they will have failed, \nnot us. They will have failed the peace agreement that they asked us to \nnegotiate, that they came to Dayton for, for which they stayed 3 weeks, \n21 days, and they will sign in Paris the day after tomorrow.\n  Now, where does this leave us? Well, it leaves us, I think, with \nreasonable risk. Nothing is without some risk, that is true. Even when \nwe have maneuvers in this country, military maneuvers, sometimes \nsomething happens. Someone slips off a tank and they are hurt. Nothing \nis absolutely safe. It is like an old saying in aviation, ``The only \nway you have absolute, complete flight safety is to leave the airplanes \nin the hangar.'' I guess that is the situation we find ourselves in.\n  Will there be some risk? Yes. Will it be tolerable? I think so. If it \nbecomes intolerable and forces build up, and there is a push, we are \nout of there. I will not see that as being a failure. I will see that \nas, we did our level best. This year period we are talking about is \ntime enough. If they really want peace and they are serious about it, \nthen all these other humanitarian groups and nationbuilding groups--not \nour military--will come in immediately after our presence is felt to \ntry to help those people get their country going again. Within a year, \nthe people of Bosnia are certainly going to see the benefits of peace, \nas opposed to continuing the slaughter, which has been their norm for \nthe last several years.\n  Can 20,000 troops do it? Yes, I think they can. The 20,000 is not a \nforce to come in for a big military operation. We are not going into a \nsituation like the Persian Gulf, where we knew we were going into \ncombat. It is the opposite. We are going in to help the parties and \nthese irregulars to stay apart for a short period of time while we try, \nfor the first time, to get lasting peace in that part of the world.\n  Now, what are some of these groups that will be coming in? Well, \nthose are being worked out right now, as to who will do what. But NATO \nitself will not be responsible--the NATO troops there will not be \nresponsible for all the nationbuilding efforts.\n  I might add that, as far as risk goes, you know, I wondered one day \nhow many people in the Peace Corps we had lost overseas, so we made an \ninquiry. It turns out that through all the years of the Peace Corps, \nwhich obviously includes many thousands of people and many places \naround the world, we have lost 224 people in the Peace Corps that have \ndied overseas in accidents, of disease, or whatever. I think that is \ninteresting. I would not have thought it was that high. So we take some \nsmall risk any time our people move out on any endeavor anywhere in the \nworld. But the risks, to me, are minimal.\n  The benefits that can occur for the future are huge. NATO, for the \nfirst time, will have been moving out of their normal area. So, in that \nrespect, it is an experiment. What has happened is, our military area \nthat we are going to man as part of this force will be up here in this \nnortheastern part. The British will be up in here. The French will be \ndown around Sarajevo and down in this particular area down here.\n  So it is not, as was said on the floor a while ago, that we are \nmixing up our troops all over Bosnia. That is not true. We are \nresponsible for manning a certain area, and that is it.\n  Now, I was afraid of one other thing. In the Balkan area we had the \nSoviet Union that through the years has had a special kinship with \nSerbia. It dates back a long time, a historical connection of heritage \nthere.\n  I was afraid that if we went in there, and NATO went in there, and we \nfound the Russians having an interest in coming down and supporting \npeople over on the Serbian side, we could wind up with us in this area \nhere with Russia supporting the Serbs in here. We would have had a \npossible confrontation there between Russia and our forces. That would \nhave been a confrontation with the potential for very major disaster.\n  Now, what happened? Well, we got the Russians in. The Russians are \ngoing to be part of this. They will be manning some of this zone here \nadjacent to us, and they are cooperating in this effort. I think they, \ntoo, realize that if we do not get peace in that part \n\n[[Page S18413]]\nof the world, it is liable to erupt again sometime in the future, and \nthat would not be good for them, or us, or anyone else.\n  If we cannot begin to see the benefits of peace in a year, then maybe \nit is impossible. I do not know. Maybe those countries go back to \nfighting again. But I think we will have been proud at that time that \nwe at least were willing to take the small risks to let peace try and \ntake root in that area of the world.\n  I would think that some risk now may enhance the long-term leadership \nof the United States toward peace and freedom around the world and, in \nthe long run, actually save lives.\n  We have not been hesitant about taking jobs on around the world, and \npeople trust us when we do this, by and large. We have many examples. \nWe stayed in Korea since the Korean war.\n  With the Marshall plan, the Truman doctrine, back in the post-World \nWar II days, we did not try to take over Europe and make it a 51st, \n52d, 53d, or 54th State over there. We helped them. We had the Truman \nplan, the Marshall plan, all these things to help nations recover from \nwar.\n  In other words, we have had a history of standing for peace and \nfreedom around the world and, really, to take some minor risks to see \nthat we encourage peace and freedom around the world. It does not \nalways go perfectly.\n  Did we lose some people we wish we had not lost in Somalia? Of \ncourse. I think we probably also in the long run saved a million lives \nin Somalia with the effort that we were willing to make.\n  Are we wrong in trying to broker a Mideast peace? We had Prime \nMinister Shimon Peres here not 20 minutes ago on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. He was here and gave a brilliant speech today. We have helped \nIsrael and the Palestinians to bridge some of their differences. We \nhave tried to broker peace in that area.\n  We did not try to take Japan after World War II. We have tried to \nadvance peace and democracy throughout South and Central America. We \nhave a lot of budding democracies in that part of the world, Cuba being \nthe major exception. We went into Haiti. It was criticized here on the \nfloor a little while ago, but I think we are seeing Haiti come around, \nit is up and down, up and down, but generally up. It is a more peaceful \nsituation than we might have thought was possible.\n  Northern Ireland. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty we got permanently \nextended. We have tried to be a force for good around this world to our \neverlasting credit.\n  To those who say we should not even risk going into this area I would \nsay--they wanted the peace, they asked us to broker it, they have \ninitialed it, they are the ones who will sign it in Paris. It is their \npeace, not ours. We are just trying to help them implement it. So to \nbring up all these what ifs and dire consequences--I think it is good \nto think about those things and be prepared for some of these things. \nBut to stay out of that area because some of the things mentioned here \non the floor might possibly remotely happen, I just do not think that \nshould be done.\n  We are, indeed, a nation that wants peace and freedom around the \nworld. We have stood for that and stayed involved around the world. \nThat does not mean at all that we try to take on all the problems of \nthe world. We cannot be the world's policemen. I agree with that. But \nwhere we have an area of such historical conflict and importance to \nEurope, to not seize this opportu- nity--and I do view it as an \nopportunity--to not seize this opportunity to try to help them \nimplement the peace that they say they want, I think would be wrong.\n  I think we are well justified in going in, and I would not have \nthought this was possible 7 or 8 months ago. I would not have thought \nwe would have such a detailed agreement, that I could stand here with a \nchart like this on the floor of the United States Senate and say these \ndetails have been signed onto by all parties in the Balkans. This is \none small part around Tuzla, and the total map on this scale in the \nSenate would be the whole size of the wall; 50 charts cover Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  What we are doing is providing them a structure for implementing the \npeace they said they wanted and they agreed to. If they decide to opt \nout, then we are opting out, too. We will have done our job. I \npersonally declare it a success that we tried. If they are dumb enough \nto break up the peace after all this effort, and all the nation \nbuilding that will be going on in that area, then I must say I do not \nhave much sympathy for them from that point on. We will not fight our \nway in. We only go in if all firing has stopped.\n  Are we do-gooders, trying to do too much around the world? I do not \nthink so myself. We take some risks for potentially huge benefits. The \nrest of the world looks at us as a nation that has no territorial \ndesigns. They trust us. I think we just might be able to implement this \nagreement and see peace break out in that area for an indefinite time \ninto the future. If so, we will have done a great, great service for \nthe rest of the world and particularly for that particular area.\n  I know we will be debating this question tomorrow here, I do not \nthink there is a final agreement yet on exactly how long tomorrow we \nwill be debating these issues. But I think if this works out, then we \nwill avoid the possibility of an encroachment down through Macedonia or \ntoward Turkey. We will not see fighting spread across borders into \neastern Europe.\n  We will maybe have been a real instrument for peace. That is the \nobjective here--not another Vietnam, not another Lebanon, not all the \nthings that were mentioned here on the floor a little while ago. Maybe, \njust maybe, we can be a force for peace in that part of the world. That \nis the objective.\n  I think we stand a very good chance of doing that. I support the \nPresident's move, and I hope that we can send an overwhelming message \nof support, because I do not want to have the people over there \nthinking that we are a divided nation back here. That would be the \nworst situation that we could possibly have.\n  Mr. President, I am optimistic at this point. I think we have come a \nlong way. We went through negotiations we did not think were possible. \nThey have agreed to it. Heads of state stayed in Dayton 21 days, \nsomething we would have thought was absolutely impossible. They will \nsign this in Paris. It is their peace. All we do is help them implement \nit. It is their peace. If it breaks down, it is not our failure; it is \ntheir failure. I look forward to the continued debate tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am one of the cosponsors of the \nHutchison-Inhofe resolution. It is a brief measure. It makes clear the \nviews of this Senator and, I hope, the majority of this body in \nopposition to the actions and the decision by the President concerning \nBosnia.\n  In clear and unambiguous language, our resolution presents absolute \nsupport for the men and women of the Armed Forces who are being \ndeployed under the President's order related to Bosnia. They are and \nwill do their duty, and they have earned and deserve our country's \nunqualified support to meet their needs.\n  We also have to support their families while they are away, and no \nmatter what we do or say regarding Bosnia, it is the duty of this \nCongress to provide for the security and welfare of the families of \nthese men and women in the defense forces.\n  Now, virtually every Member of this body, I think, has spoken at \nleast once on this tragic situation in Bosnia. What the Senate is doing \nnow is to focus on the challenges and the threats involved in this \nDayton plan for the United States and to determine whether we should, \nfor the first time, mire ground forces in this centuries-long conflict \nin the Balkans.\n  I have listened with interest to my friend from Ohio. There is no one \nfor whom I have greater respect and fondness. I find that we have come \naway from the Balkans--we traveled the Balkans together--we have come \naway with diametrically opposed views.\n  I was interested in particular when he mentioned that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is 20,000 square miles. Mr. President, my State is 586,000 \nsquare miles and we are one-fifth the size of the United States. In \nother words, I think we should focus on the size of the area involved \nin this conflict.\n  More than 2 years ago, I spoke to the Senate on the nature of the \nconflict in \n\n[[Page S18414]]\nBosnia, and I paid particular attention at that time to the remarks of \nGeneral MacKenzie, who was a Canadian and the commander of the U.N. \nforces that were then struggling to end the fighting.\n  In an interview about that time, when he was asked what he thought \nabout the calls from some in the Congress to take military \nintervention, or at least send a strong military backup to the Bosnia \narea, this is what he said, quoting Gen. Louis MacKenzie:\n\n       Well, what I have to say is that if you're going to jump \n     from chapter to chapter 7 of the U.N. charter and move from \n     peacekeeping to force, then you better get the peacekeeping \n     force out first.\n       Mind you, Mr. President, you better get the peacekeeping \n     force out of there.\n       Otherwise, you got 1,500 to 1,600 hostages sitting there \n     200 kilometers from the nearest secure border. You can't \n     combine these two.\n       And if you're going to get involved in the Balkans, then we \n     better read a bit of history, because we're talking about an \n     area that gobbled up 30 divisions during the last war. \n     Unsuccessfully, by the way, in keeping the peace in \n     Yugoslavia. Unsuccessful in tracking down Tito and finding \n     him in Macedonia. So you're talking about a very, very major \n     undertaking.\n       Not only that; when they leave, with the amount of hate \n     that's been generated on both sides, it's going to break out \n     and start all over again unless you come to some sort of \n     political constitutional solution for that country.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no constitutional solution in Bosnia. There \nis no peace, really, in Bosnia.\n  It is discouraging that, after the 2 years that this has gone on, and \nthe incalculable suffering by the people of Bosnia, the President has \nfinally acted. And in my view he has made the wrong decision.\n  Two years ago, following a mission in Bosnia with a delegation of \nSenators to the NATO south headquarters and the Bosnia region and \nCroatia, I came to the conclusion that only a military balance in the \nregion would bring a permanent end to the fighting. This administration \nconsistently opposed that strategy, long advocated by the majority \nleader, Senator Dole. Now, administration officials define a military \nbalance as a key component of our exit strategy from Bosnia. How is it \nthat aiding the legal Government of Bosnia to defend itself was wrong \nfor so long, and now defines success for this deployment?\n  American soldiers, air crews, marines, and sailors will now be placed \nin harm's way because this administration failed to do what so many of \nus urged--permit the legal Government of Bosnia--permit the people of \nBosnia--to defend their country, and their lives. The question now is \nwhether we will approve putting the men and women of our Armed Forces \nat risk, to recover from the mistakes and errors of the past 3 years.\n  In October, Senator Inouye and I led a bipartisan delegation to \nreview the NATO peace enforcement plan, and evaluate the situation on \nthe ground in Croatia and Sarajevo. Let me state now that our \ndiscussions with military leaders at the United States European Command \nheadquarters in Stuttgart made clear that our troops have been well-\ntrained and well-prepared for what they may face in Bosnia. While I do \nnot agree with the President's decision, I applaud the leadership \nexercised by General Shalikashvili, Admiral Smith, General Crouch, and \nGeneral Hawley--they have done everything in their power to prepare our \ntroops to protect their own lives.\n  We may face casualties in Bosnia--every military commander we met \naddressed the risks there. But we were assured that those casualties \nwill not be the result of indifference or failures by the Department of \nDefense to do its job to make the force ready. This is a superb force \nthat the President has ordered to Bosnia, will bring credit to the \nmilitary, and to our Nation, regardless of the challenges of the \nBalkans, of that I am sure.\n  But, if the situation in Bosnia was unique, a compelling case for \nUnited States intervention might be made. Sadly, the killing, the \nsuffering, and the devastation in Bosnia represents only one chapter in \nthe growing record of civil strife around the world. Even more \ntroubling is that Bosnia may be only a warning bell for severe \ndisruption and conflict in other former Communist nations, including \nthe former Soviet Union itself. We must not forget the fact that we are \nwatching the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\n  In Africa, Central Asia, and the Far East, we have witnessed, without \ndeploying United States troops, slaughters and tyranny in Ethiopia, \nUganda, Sudan, Mozambique, and Angola. Where we did intervene, in \nRwanda and Somalia, our efforts resulted in only a temporary lull in \nthe killing, or in the end, completely failed, as when we tried to mix \nhumanitarian aid with nation building in Somalia. In Asia, we turned \naway from any responsibility despite the terror in Sri Lanka, in Burma, \nand the decade of killing in Cambodia. In Cambodia, peace was \naccomplished when the parties were tired of fighting, and the United \nNations provided a framework for reconstruction, led by Japan and \nAustralia--key regional powers.\n  The former Soviet Union and associated states present an entirely \nseparate category of potential future conflicts. Already, we have \nwitnessed fighting in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Armenia, and \nChechnya. We in Alaska watch closely developments in Siberia, and I \npredict to the Senate that we will see unrest and perhaps the \nfragmentation of that corner of the former Soviet Empire before the end \nof this decade.\n  Many of these nations are artificial. We should remember that. Within \nthe former Soviet Union, within the former Warsaw Pact, and within the \nformer Yugoslavia, these are not natural nation states. Today in many \nof the states long simmering rivalries, feuds, and clan conflicts that \nwere suppressed by brutal, authoritarian regimes continue to surface. \nPeople did not accept Communist dictatorships, they lived in fear of \nthem. They chafed under that tyranny, under the control of entirely \ndifferent nation, a nation that erased their traditional boundaries. \nAnd now they are acting on desires for self-determination to try to \nrestore the past.\n\n  Bosnia is not the first nor will it be the last of such civil wars in \nformer Communist nations. The precedent set by the President on how the \nUnited States will respond to these conflicts will haunt the United \nStates for years to come.\n  I do not know how this administration reached a value judgment that a \nlife in Bosnia is more significant than a life in Chechnya or Armenia. \nAnd I would ask, are the threats to Turkey from unrest along the Black \nSea of less vital interest than the imagined threats to Greece from the \nunrest in the Balkans?\n  I really do not know how the President's equation works yet, Mr. \nPresident. What future commitments has the President made by this \ndecision to dispatch forces to this region? Based on our discussions \nwith U.S. military leaders in Europe and the hearing before the defense \nappropriations subcommittee, which I chaired, I found no basis for any \nclaim that a broader war in Europe could emerge from this conflict. We \nhave heard that again here today.\n  There is simply no likelihood that troops from this 20,000 square \nmile area will march on Greece, or that Croatia will march on Italy, as \na result of this centuries-long hatred in the Balkans.\n  Any suggestions that this civil conflict will ignite world war III to \nme is farfetched and irresponsible. And I say this with no disrespect \nto Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili. I told them of my \nconclusions following our trips to Bosnia, in private meetings and \npublic hearings.\n  This deployment may be more about fulfilling the President's hasty \ncommitment to NATO leaders. It may be one to assert a new dominating \nrole for the United States in NATO affairs.\n  To me, it is not a deployment to prevent the spread of war to \nSouthern Europe. I find it very interesting that in the past, many on \nthe other side of the aisle scoffed at the domino theory when it was \nraised with regard to Europe, Southeast Asia, or the even the Middle \nEast during the gulf war. It is remarkable now to hear that this civil \nwar in 20,000 square miles of Bosnia may spill over and proliferate \ninto conflict in Greece, Turkey, Hungary, Romania, or Albania. All have \nbeen mentioned here on the floor, Mr. President.\n  Procedurally, there is no basis in the NATO Treaty for this mission. \nThe North Atlantic Treaty defines a defensive relationship between the \nsignatories focused on mutual defense. This action takes NATO in a new \nand uncharted direction. The President does \n\n[[Page S18415]]\nso now under circumstances where the NATO alliance is described as so \nweak that America choosing not to participate in this mission could \ndestroy that alliance. Those are not my words. That is what we were \ntold at the NATO headquarters when we visited Brussels.\n  NATO officials told our delegation that defense spending cutbacks by \nsome NATO members have so reduced their military forces that they \nsimply cannot do more than provide token units to the NATO \nimplementation force. NATO ministers presented us a stark choice in \nBosnia. We were either to provide a military force for Europe or see \nNATO collapse.\n  I do not see why we should provide a military force for Europe \nbecause of the threat that NATO would collapse. I think that is one of \nthe most remarkable statements I have heard.\n  Is it true that our allies that we joined together to defend against \nthe monolithic Soviet Union are incapable of containing a small \nconflict in 20,000 square miles of Europe?\n  We are the world's only remaining superpower. The budget that I \nhelped present to the Senate that the President approved for the \nDepartment of Defense is a good one, but it does not keep pace with \ninflation. And I say to the Senate that the bottom line is this Nation \ncannot provide for Europe's defense and Asia's defense and the Middle \nEast's defense. The American taxpayers should not, cannot, and will not \nshoulder this burden alone. If NATO cannot do this without us, what is \nit that NATO can do now?\n  I have probably attended more NATO meetings than any Member of the \nSenate still here today, and I have been a firm supporter of NATO all \nalong. But I was appalled to be told by leaders of NATO that if we did \nnot participate in this mission, NATO would collapse.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, and I \nam proud to have worked with them and so many of my colleagues to bring \nthis matter before the Senate. I hope to be able to support also the \nleader's resolution. I hope it will come before the Senate because I \nthink we must not only make a clear commitment to our Armed Forces, \nwhich the leader's resolution will do, but I think we must have a \nresolution that will go to the President and that he must sign that \ndefines not only our role vis-a-vis the Bosnian Moslems, but also the \nexit strategy that we should pursue.\n  I do not enjoy finding myself in opposition to any President. Our \nConstitution makes the President the Commander in Chief of our military \nforces, and he has the authority to command. He has the authority to \ndeploy these forces. But the Constitution gives the Congress \nresponsibility also to provide for our common defense.\n  How can we provide for our common defense if Presidents continue to \nsend our forces throughout the world for humanitarian and peacekeeping \nefforts to Haiti, to Somalia, or wherever it might be? I believe we are \nweakening our defense every time we use defense money for peacekeeping \nmeasures, and we will pay the price.\n  I only need to point out the number of ships we are able to build a \nyear. Figure it out someday, Mr. President. We build about six or seven \nnow, and they have about a 20-year average life. How can we possibly \nkeep a 350- or 400-ship Navy with the current rate of procurement for \nNaval forces? Or look at the Air Force; it is coming down so rapidly. \nOr look at our tanks; it will not be long until we will have tanks to \nsend people to war that were built by their grandfathers.\n  The defense budget is not, as the President said, an overloaded \nbudget. It is an underfunded budget from the point of view of \nmodernization, and that is really the problem we have here.\n  I do not believe the American people want our troops in Bosnia. I \nthink they want a very good defense force. They want us to be able to \nkeep our commitments abroad.\n  I do not believe a majority of the Congress should support the \nPresident's decision to send troops to Bosnia, and I regret the \nPresident did not consult the Congress, or consider our views--\nparticularly the views of some of those who were sent to Bosnia to \nbring back a report to him.\n  This decision sets a very disturbing precedent for me, Mr. President. \nI do not think the debate will change the policy the President has \nembarked on. I hope that some of our allies are listening, and I hope \nmore people question our becoming involved to save NATO rather than to \ndefend our national interest. They are not synonymous any longer, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I believe that the debate should cause our allies in Europe to \nrecognize that our commitment to NATO is not without limits and hinges \nupon Europe's willingness to act as a full partner in any military or \npolitical function.\n  My hope is that the debate will caution the President also--will \ncaution him not to commit us further without closer consultation with \nthe Congress and its leaders, and without the support of the American \npeople.\n  It is my fervent hope that the debate will result in policies that \nwill bring these troops home as soon as possible.\n  I can only say as I started, Mr. President, that I regret deeply the \ndecision to send them there in the first place.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison-Inhofe amendment in \nopposition to the President's decision to send troops to Bosnia.\n  I, like the Senator from Alaska, would like to be able to support the \nPresident in regard to this matter. I think the politics should end at \nthe water's edge whenever possible. I regret that I am not able to do \nso. But after extensive hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee and \nothers, and after carefully examining all of the arguments and all of \nthe information that is available, I have concluded that there are \nseveral reasons for being opposed to the President's action.\n  I do not believe that they have made a convincing case that it is in \nour national interest to take this action. I think that policy rewards \nthe aggression that has taken place over the last 4 years in that \ncountry. But I think probably the most definitive problem, as presented \nby the President's action, is that there is no indication--not only \nhave they not carried the burden of proof, in my opinion, but there is \nsimply no indication--that this action will meet with any success. I \nthink the first thing we have to do with regard to that point is define \nsuccess.\n  It was pointed out a little earlier this evening that we would be \nsuccessful even if hostilities broke out before the 12-month period and \nwe left. I respectfully disagree with that assertion. Once you think \nabout it, it is certainly not that simple. If we were there for 2 \nmonths, 3 months, or 4 months and hostilities broke out, and we simply \ntook the position that, well, we tried and the people who we are here \nto help do not want to be helped so we will leave, we would be accused \nof cutting and running as we have been accused of before. That would be \ndisastrous, Mr. President, for the United States of America.\n\n  If, on the other hand, hostilities broke out, we were involved in \nhostilities before the expiration of the 12-month period, and we \nstayed, and we were in the middle of those hostilities and engaged in \nthose hostilities, we would be in danger of being in a quagmire, and \nVietnam would be talked about a whole lot more than it has been here \ntonight. So it is not a simple proposition. If this breaks down before \nthe 12-month period, it is not a simple proposition for us to just turn \naround and leave. It would be a very big black mark as far as the \ncredibility of the United States of America is concerned.\n  I tend to believe that with the forces that we are putting in there \nand with the forces that NATO and other countries are putting in there, \nwe can probably keep the lid on it for 12 months. I think there is a \nmuch greater likelihood that the day we leave hostilities will resume. \nThey say, well, again, we have tried our best. We will come out all \nright if that is the case.\n  I respectfully disagree with that argument. That is not a definition \nof success either. We will have expended lives, Mr. President. They \ntalk about the estimate of 6 million mines being scattered around in \nterrain like most of us have never experienced. Our colleagues come \nback and say you cannot even get a truck, much less a tank, in most of \nthese places. The terrain is vertical. It is not horizontal. We would \nexpend, some people say, upward of $5 \n\n[[Page S18416]]\nto $6 billion, not counting what some people believe will be an \nextensive foreign aid package as we leave.\n  Now, I think we would have spent something that is equally important, \ncertainly more important than the money part, and that is our \ncredibility. It would have been in vain. We would have paid a price. We \nwould have had another failed mission, Mr. President, at a time when \nthe U.S. military does not need another failed mission because of the \nleadership that has been provided to them.\n  So with that definition of success, what is the likelihood of \nsuccess? I think that if you look to the past or you look to the \npresent or you look to the future, there is very little, if any, \nlikelihood of success. These people have been warring with each other \nfor hundreds of years. We have had 34 cease-fires before this one. No \none has made a credible case yet that they are not just taking another \npause in the hostilities to reinforce themselves during the time of a \nbitter winter when they could not do much anyway.\n  Also, apparently, none of the parties engaged in this process believe \nthat the other side wants peace. We can never create a peace, Mr. \nPresident, until the parties themselves want peace, regardless of the \nactions that we take. Historically, they have not wanted peace for a \nlong time. With the mass murders that have taken place just within the \nlast few months, apparently, over there and the continued atrocities \nand ethnic cleansing that continue to go on, those feelings are not \ngoing to subside overnight, regardless of what has been put on a piece \nof paper in Dayton, OH. They are still there. They are going to linger \nthere. Evidently the Croatians and the Bosnians did not think that the \nSerbs wanted peace. They would not even sit down to the table unless \nthe United States was there. Evidently we do not think the Serbs want \npeace because one of the conditions that is being talked about so much \nis that we must equalize the forces. We would not need to be so \nconcerned about that if we did not think the Serbs still had aggressive \ntendencies and would exercise those tendencies the moment that we left.\n  What about present circumstances? Are there any indications of \nsuccess from this policy under present circumstances? You can just look \nand see what has happened since Dayton and come to the conclusion the \nanswer is no to that particular question. We have the leaders over \nhere, some of whom probably are trying desperately to keep from being \nbranded war criminals, making policies and putting things in an \nextensive document that their very people back in Sarajevo and other \nplaces in the area are denouncing and saying they will never live \nunder--certainly not encouraging conditions.\n  We are debating whether or not we are nation building, and everyone \nseems to agree that we certainly do not want to get into nation \nbuilding. I would suggest it is more than that. It is apparently nation \ncreating. Apparently the document calls for the creation of a new \nnation, basically divided in half, populated by three ethnic groups \nwhich have been warring with each other for centuries.\n  What is the likelihood that we can go in there and create that kind \nof new government--or not create it. In all fairness, I must say, it is \nnot our job to create it, but it is our job to monitor and enforce the \nagreement, whatever that means. Monitor and enforce the agreement. As I \nunderstand it, one of the goals is to build down, as they say, the arms \non one side of this conflict and build up the arms on the other; \npresumably those folks who are losing the arms are going to sit back \nand allow that to happen. Apparently we are to monitor and enforce the \nunderstanding with regard to the refugees. As we know, some of these \nareas and some of these very homes have changed hands. We are going to \nhave people in one group being pushed out by people of another group, \ngoing to courts that are being run totally by one group.\n\n  That is not going to be a very satisfactory resolution to the people \nwho are kicked out. And then we are supposed to leave a balance of \npower. If there has ever been an indication where the United States or \nanother country has gone into another area and figured this out from a \npiece of paper, got the top help involved and figured out how to create \nand enforce and leave a balance of power, I would like to know what it \nis.\n  Nobody seems to ask the other question, too: What does a balance of \npower do? Does that cause people to lay down those arms? Does it cause \nthem to say we cannot fight now because we have a balance of power? I \nwould not think so.\n  Some points that really must cause one to think have been made \nbecause we are told that this is significant as far as supporting the \nPresident's concern but also supporting NATO. I think the Senator from \nAlaska makes a very good point when he raises the question whether or \nnot this is something that is in our national interest or is it \nsomething that is in NATO's interest and we have an interest in NATO, \nand therefore it is in our national interest.\n  If that is the logic, it is very questionable. For some time now NATO \nhas acted as if this particular conflict and the resolution of it was \nnot even in the national interest of the countries involved, much less \nNATO. For some time now they have resisted our attempts to lift the \narms embargo, to try to reach some kind of resolution along the lines, \nas I read it, of what the Dayton accord seeks to do with regard to the \narms portion of the agreement.\n  I think it is important that we have a strong NATO. I think it is \nimportant that we cooperate with NATO. But I think it is also important \nthat NATO cooperate with us. And they failed to cooperate with us. The \nSecretary of State went around to the NATO countries hat in hand and \nasked for support and help to get this policy through that the U.S. \nCongress, I believe, was very firmly in support of, the President said \nhe was in support of, and I think the American people were in support \nof. They turned a deaf ear to us.\n  Now they have taken the position where apparently they have not seen \ntheir own national interest and vital interest of these countries very \ndirectly involved and convinced us in one fell swoop that it is in our \nnational interest to send ground troops over there. Not that we do not \nhave any interest at all, but is our national interest sufficient for \nus to send ground troops? I think probably what this conflict did was \ncatch us in mid-redefinition of the role of NATO and our role in NATO. \nWe have built down from over 300,000 troops in the NATO countries to \naround 100,000 or so now. Obviously, we see a different situation now \nthat the cold war is over. We do not have that big threat of aggression \nto the NATO countries from the one superpower. It is a different world \nthat we live in, no less dangerous world but a different world that we \nlive in.\n  And the question here is a new one for us. That is, what happens, \nfirst, when you are engaging in not an aggression situation but a so-\ncalled peacekeeping situation and, second, it does not involve a NATO \ncountry? It does not involve a NATO country.\n  I certainly believe a case can be made that we can become involved \nand we could supply logistics, intelligence, and other areas that we \nobviously have capabilities that some of these other countries do not \nhave, without supplying ground troops.\n  Should we be the one to initially step forward with a commitment to \nsupply ground troops simply because we want to have some involvement or \nsupport in NATO? I do not think so.\n  So it is too late now with regard to this particular venture. But I \nthink we are going to have to step back and redefine our role there \nbecause we cannot afford to let NATO pull us into any kind of conflict \nover there in another part of the world, that if they had done the \nright thing in this particular instance we would probably be in much \nbetter shape than we are in right now.\n  Another argument that has been made, that is pause for concern to \nthose of us who are opposed to the President's policy here, is the \ncharge of isolationism. And the charge is made that those who do not \nsupport the President are isolationists and do not see our country's \ninterests go past our own borders. That is not the case. That is not \nthe case at all.\n  I certainly believe that we must exercise a strong role. One of the \nthings that can be said positively about what the President has done is \nthat he has taken a strong stand. Unfortunately, I think that it is an \nincorrect stand. But I kind of admire the fact that he has taken a \nstrong stand. \n\n[[Page S18417]]\n\n  If we had taken a strong stand somewhat earlier in this country with \nregard to this particular area, and others I might add, we would be in \na whole lot better shape. We would have a whole lot more credibility, \nand so would NATO right now.\n  So I think many of us see that we have to exercise a leadership role. \nWe do live in one world. We say that we do not want CNN running our \nNation's policy, and it should not. But CNN is there. It has arrived. \nWhen we watch atrocities in parts of the world, it affects us. It does \nnot mean that we have to be involved in each and every one, but it \naffects us as a nation. And when we see in an area where we can take \nsome action, such as lifting an arms embargo, for example, and we sit \nback year after year and do nothing, I do not think that helps us. I do \nnot think that helps the United States of America and what we are \nsupposed to stand for and what we are as a people. It does not do us \nany good, I do not think.\n\n  So all of that is true. But I feel like the policy here at hand is \nnot only misguided, but will wind up fueling the very isolationist \ntendencies that the supporters of this policy decry. Because if, in \nfact, it is isolationism that got us here, because we did not have the \nstrong effort by NATO--and we as a country perhaps made some mistakes \nin not having a firmer hand in many different respects with regard to \nthis part of the world some time ago.\n  But now if, as all indications would point toward, this turns out to \nbe a failed policy, if hostilities resume, if we have to leave \nprematurely or hostilities resume after we have left, having spent \nbillions of dollars and many lives of our young people, that is going \nto cause people to be very, very reluctant, much more reluctant than \notherwise to get into the next conflict where we might have some \nnational interest.\n  So we must husband our resources with a certain amount of wisdom, \ndiscretion. And the President should not come to the U.S. Congress and \nsay that this is a fait accompli, and you should not look to the \nunderlying policy. That is what we are faced with here.\n  The role of Congress has been rendered essentially a nullity. As far \nas these resolutions are concerned, I feel like it is important that we \nexpress ourselves. But I think it is even more important for this \nreason. If we express ourselves here and the President knows that we do \nnot take to the idea that we are not entitled to look at the underlying \npolicy, if he knows that underlying policy will be debated--any \nPresident--and will have to see the light of day and the details will \nbe examined and will not be rubberstamped, even if the troops are on \nthe way, then perhaps it will change some Presidential actions in the \nfuture because those things are going to continue to occur throughout \nthe rest of our history, I would assume. It is a much more dangerous \nworld in many respects that we live in today than ever before.\n  So we have been presented somewhat with two bad alternatives. One is \nto support a bad policy; and the other is to do something which the \nadministration would urge might somehow undermine the effort. And none \nof us want to do that. And I do not like that policy. I mean I do not \nlike that choice, that Hobson's choice.\n  But on balance, I think it is much worse to establish a precedent \nthat if a President can quietly enough and rapidly enough make \ncommitments and come to the U.S. Congress and say it is a fait \naccompli, the Congress does not have the right or the obligation to \nlook into the underlying action, that is a bad policy and I do not \nthink we should subscribe to it, and therefore, I will support the \nresolution. I thank the Chair.\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, from the beginning of the present Bosnian \nconflict during the Presidency of George Bush, I have opposed an \nimmediate American participation in it in any fashion that would risk \nthe lives of young American men and women.\n  From the beginning of that conflict, during the Presidency of George \nBush, I have favored the lifting of the arms embargo against the \nBosnian victims of Serbian aggression, on the premise that it was not \nonly unfair, but immoral to treat identically the aggressors and the \nvictims of that aggression.\n  The Bosnians, it seemed to me, as it did to most Members of this \nbody, deserved at least the right to fight for their own freedom--a \nright which they have effectively been denied.\n  Everything in history and logic and our intuitions told us to oppose \nthe kind of action in which the President is engaged in at the present \ntime. Even the peace treaty we are there in part to enforce is an \nunjust treaty which leaves the aggressors in possession of most of the \nareas which they conquered and in which they engaged in some of the \nmost horrible war crimes in recent history.\n  In 1993, some 2 years ago, President Clinton made what appeared to be \na casual remark to our Europe allies. He promised that American Armed \nForces, specifically ground troops, would participate in a Bosnian \npeacekeeping effort as and when such a peace were reached. I am \nconvinced that then, as today, President Clinton did not understand the \nconsequences of that promise, especially as it came as a promise from \nthe leader of the free world.\n  Mr. Clinton's proclivity to tell people whatever they want to hear at \nthe time in which they want to hear it is well documented here in the \nUnited States. But what the American people will perceive simply to be \na flaw in the President's character in the rest of the world could \nprecipitate a catastrophe in our foreign policy.\n  And so, Mr. President, as we meet here this evening, after the \nPresident's commitment, not only in abstract terms in 1993, but in \nconcrete terms just a few weeks ago, the question is no longer whether \nor not we as individual Members of the Senate agreed with that promise \nor supported the President's policies.\n  Charles Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post last Friday:\n\n       It does not matter that we should not have gone into Bosnia \n     in the first place. It now matters only that we succeed.\n\n  Regrettably, I find that to be the absolute and incontrovertible \ntruth. Let us not fool ourselves that this is an easy task. We are \ngoing into Bosnia to create or perhaps to preserve in part a pause in \nfighting between bitter, 600-year-old enemies. Success will not be \neasy. But now that we are there, now that we are the leaders of the \nNATO forces in Bosnia, it is absolutely essential for the future of \nthis country, as well as for the future of NATO, that we succeed. As a \nconsequence, our first task is to define success.\n  Are we going to build a parliamentary democracy in Bosnia?\n  Of course not. Are we going to reconcile six-centuries-old enmities \nafter hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions \ndisplaced in a 1-year period? Of course not.\n  Then, Mr. President, what is the definition of ``success,'' assuming \nthat the President keeps his commitment to withdraw our troops at the \nend of a 1-year period? The only possible definition of success, it \nseems to me, is that when we leave, the Bosnians are able to defend \nthemselves against further aggression; that a peace, not arising out of \nreconciliation, can at least arise out of a balance of power and a \nfeeling that the acts of the last 5 years cannot be repeated.\n  It is exactly at that definition of success that the resolution \nproposed by our distinguished majority leader, Robert Dole, is aimed. \nThe vague and uncertain promises that the Bosnians be equipped in such \na way that they can defend themselves in the agreements in Dayton are \nsharpened and strengthened in this resolution by the insistence that we \nassure that these people, these victims, be able successfully to defend \nthemselves at the end of a 1-year period.\n  If that is the case, Mr. President, and only if that is the case, \nwill we and our NATO allies be able to leave Bosnia without an \nautomatic renewal of the civil war. And only if we are able to leave \nwithout that automatic renewal taking place, can either we or NATO \nclaim to have been successful.\n  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been the centerpiece of \nthe foreign policy of the United States since 1948. It has been and it \nremains vital to the peace not only of Europe but to the rest of the \nworld that NATO continue and that it be credible. As a consequence, \neven though NATO may have, as I believe it has done, made an erroneous \nand unwise commitment, and even though the President of the \n\n[[Page S18418]]\nUnited States may have done and has done, in my view, an unwise thing \nin entering into this commitment, we now must honor it. We must honor \nit in a way that protects, to the best of our ability to do so, the \nsecurity of our troops on the ground during the time that they are \nthere and gives some reasonable degree of assurance that the war will \nnot recommence immediately upon our leaving.\n  Mr. President, every one of us in this body knows that the Congress \nof the United States will not and cannot exercise the only full \nauthority it has, and that is to cut off any funding for this Bosnian \nventure. A Presidential veto on the assumption that there might be a \nmajority in both Houses for cutting off that funding would not be \noverridden. The President has committed our troops to Bosnia. He is \ngoing to carry out that commitment, whatever the oratory on this floor, \nwhatever the resolution that passes this body. We, therefore, if we are \nto be wiser than the President has been, must try to see to it that the \ntroops who are there are there under the best possible circumstances, \nas undesirable as those circumstances may be. We must try to see to it \nthat they are there for the shortest period of time possible, and that \nwhen they leave, the world can say that their intervention has been a \nsuccess.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that the distinguished majority leader and \nthose who have worked with him on his resolution have charted the only \npossible course of action that can meet those goals.\n  We, as Americans, can have only one President at a time. All \nPresidents are fallible and, I must say, I think this President is \nparticularly fallible. As a Member of this Senate, I supported \nPresident Reagan when he ordered air raids on Libya. I supported \nPresident Reagan when he liberated Grenada. And I supported President \nBush when he proposed, ultimately successfully, to liberate Kuwait. I \nmust say that none of those decisions was nearly as difficult as this \none is, because in each case, I believed that the President was doing \nthe right thing. But in a certain measure, even then that support was \ngranted because the President, who was in charge, was our Commander in \nChief and deserved every benefit of the doubt.\n  I do not believe we can appropriately grant that benefit only to a \nPresident of our own party or a President with whom we agree. As a \nconsequence, as reluctant as this assent is, I believe we must assent \nto what the President has done, at least to the extent of strongly \nsupporting our troops who are faced with an extraordinarily difficult \nchallenge, giving them the greatest possible opportunity to carry out \ntheir mission successfully from the perspective of defending their own \nlives and security and successfully from the perspective of defending \ntheir own lines and security and successfully from the perspective of \nleaving Bosnia at least not as terrible a place as they found it. The \nonly way I have discovered at this point to do that, Mr. President, is \nto support the initiative of our distinguished majority leader.\n  Our constituents--all of our constituents--are frustrated by this \nventure. It has not been appropriately defended by the President. His \ncasual promise of 2 years ago should never have been made. But each of \nthese is a bell we cannot unring and, at this point, we must look \nforward and do the best we can for our troops, our country, and our \nalliance. That, I am convinced, we will do by supporting Senator Dole's \nresolution.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison \nresolution in opposition--strong opposition--to sending American forces \ninto Bosnia. I was quite interested in the remarks of my friend from \nthe State of Washington. In listening to his remarks--and I know other \nSenators on the floor, Senator Brown, served with me in Vietnam--I \ncould not help but think of terms like ``Vietnamization.'' I remember \nthe charts, the McNamara charts and the pointers, how, if we would just \nsupply a little help, we could be there a little while and the South \nVietnamese would soon be able to take over the war and fight their own \nbattles; if we could just secure the peace, everything would be all \nright.\n  Mr. President, 58,000-plus lives later, we gave it back to the North \nVietnamese.\n  I remember then, very much so, as a young man of draft age \nvolunteering in the Navy to serve, I remember then Presidents making \ncommitments. And although this is not Vietnam per se, the parallels are \nvery similar because, as the President must know, and as all of us \nparticipating in this debate know, and as the American people know full \nwell, the majority of the American people do not support our \ninvolvement here. The difference is that we can stand here on the floor \nand debate this, and we know that, regardless of what we say here or \nwhat we debate here, the President is going to--indeed has already \nbegun--proceed to send troops to Bosnia. So perhaps we are wasting our \ntime.\n\n  I think it is important that people understand that, yes, we are \ndebating it and, yes, the President made this commitment 2 years ago. \nBut there is somebody's son and there is somebody's daughter that, \nprobably prior to Christmas, is going to be off somewhere in this far-\noff land without the full support of the American people for having \nthem go there. They will have the support of the American people and \nthis Senator's support when they get there, but that does not mean we \nhave to endorse the policy of sending them there.\n  I do not take participation in this debate lightly. There have been \nthree or four major issues that I have been involved in since I have \nbeen in the Senate for some 5 years and in the House 6 years before \nthat. One was the Persian Gulf war. It is not easy when you stand here, \nknowing the vote you make may cost American lives. It troubles me very \nmuch to take the floor of the U.S. Senate in opposition to any \nPresident, including President Clinton.\n  I served in the Vietnam war under President Johnson. I disapproved of \nPresident Johnson's policies. I did not think he conducted the war \nproperly. But I was proud to serve in the military and do my duty. I \nnever had a second thought about that, as most military people do not. \nBut I cannot sit idly by and say nothing and watch our troops being \nsent into harm's way, Mr. President, without a coherent policy and \nwithout a compelling military mission. And there is no coherent policy \nand there is absolutely no compelling military mission.\n  These men and women are not trained to be 911 response teams. Police \ndepartments do that pretty well. These men and women are trained to \nfight for the national security of the United States. That is not why \nthey are going there. So they are going to be put in harm's way, doing \nthings they were not trained to do.\n  Over the past 3 years, many of us in this body have spoken out loudly \nand clearly on lifting the arms embargo, which has denied the Bosnia \nMoslems the ability to defend themselves. They have a right to do that. \nBosnia is their country. Those of us who have advocated lifting the \nembargo believe that because it is their country, the Moslems deserve \nthe opportunity to defend it, to protect their families, their \nproperty, their culture, against a Serbian onslaught. Do you remember \nthe safe havens? They were not very safe, but they were told they were \nsafe. They were herded into them and executed by the Serbs.\n\n  If the President, President Clinton, had accepted this recommendation \nthat many of us made, including the majority leader, here on the floor \nand exerted firm leadership, we would not be having this debate. We \nwould not be sending troops to Bosnia. They would not be giving up \nChristmas with their families to go to this far-off land, to be put in \nharm's way. We would not be doing it. Why? Because the Moslems would \nhave been able to defend themselves if we had just--we did have to arm \nthem. All we had to do was step out of the way and let them be armed. \nBut we did not do it. So I am not swayed emotionally or any other way \nby the fact that this President made some commitment 2 years ago to \nNATO allies. I am not swayed in the slightest, because if things go \nwrong, if it looks bad not to go, how bad is it going to look when we \nleave, after things get rough?\n  Are my colleagues here prepared to come down on the Senate floor if, \nin fact, something goes wrong--and I pray \n\n[[Page S18419]]\nit does not--and when casualties occur? I remember that, too, in \nVietnam, Mr. President, very clearly. I remember when there were 2 or 3 \na week, and I remember when there were 350 a week coming home dead. The \nAmerican people then lost interest in the war because they never \nsupported it in the first place, and brave young men and women died \nbecause of that. That could happen this time, and I cannot believe that \nwe are allowing it to happen again.\n  When will we ever learn from history? A year ago, it was widely \nreported that the President offered up to 25,000 American troops to \nhelp withdraw the U.N. protection forces from Bosnia. I joined many of \nmy colleagues right here on this floor voicing serious reservations \nwith that proposal. It is strangely ironic that 1 year later the \nPresident has committed roughly the same number of troops from the same \nservice elements to enforce a peace agreement that, as of today, has \nnot even been signed. Maybe it will be signed in the next day or so; \nmaybe it will not. But we are already going to send troops, are we not? \nWe already made the commitment. We hear people from all sides saying we \nare not going to support it. So we are going to put our American forces \nthere in harm's way, without a peace treaty that we know will work.\n  Is that our responsibility? Why? Because CNN carries bloody footage \nevery night from the war? There are other places where blood is let \nevery day, and we are not there--Ethiopia, Somalia. We were in Somalia, \nbut we should not have been there either. There is at least the \nappearance that when Congress closed the front door on Bosnia \ndeployment, the President decided to sneak around the back door to get \nthe American troops involved. That is what he did. He made an incorrect \ndecision.\n  The President has stated that our troops will only be deployed to \nBosnia for a year. He has not articulated what the specific mission \nwill be. He has not defined a concise timetable or sequence of \nmilestones for achieving our military objectives. How can he possibly \nsay that American forces will be there for a year? He does not know \nthat. Sure, he can pull them out in a year, regardless. All sides know \nthat. So if I were an adversary in Bosnia, I would do one of two \nthings. One, I would absolutely harass American forces to try to create \nas many casualties as I could and get us out, or I would sit back and \ndo nothing and wait for a year. And, in the meantime, during that year, \nhow many landmines do American forces step on? How many people die in \nsimple motor vehicle accidents, or airplane accidents, or other combat-\nrelated accidents, in the line of duty?\n  This is not a safe venture. When you deploy 20,000 troops anywhere in \none big operation like this, it is a high-risk operation. I am not sure \nthe President of the United States, to be very blunt about it, who \nnever served in the military, and specifically avoided serving in the \nmilitary, understands that, to be candid about it. The only argument I \nhear coming from the White House spin doctors in support of the \nPresident's policy is the assertion that President Clinton has made a \ncommitment to our allies, and if Congress were to reject this \ncommitment, it is going to destroy our credibility and destroy our \nreputation in the international community. That is no consolation, is \nit, to the mothers and fathers, brothers, sisters and kids of the \nAmerican personnel that are being sent to Bosnia? Frankly, I think it \nis a disgrace.\n  I hope the President will think, as I am going to think, before I \nvote tomorrow on this. If I have to make that phone call--and I pray to \nGod nobody ever has to make it--or I have to look a mother, or a \nfather, or a brother, or another loved one in the eye, I have to be \nable to say to that person: Your son, your daughter, your brother, your \nsister, whatever, died for a good reason.\n  There was a good reason for us to be there. Can we really say that? I \nsure cannot. I could not say it. I cannot look that parent or sibling \nin the eye and say, ``Your son or daughter died for a good cause, a \ngood reason, died bravely, yes, died courageously, yes, or was injured \nin the line of duty, courageous, absolutely.''\n  Know why? Some feel sympathy. Some who have never served in the \nmilitary do not understand. They feel sympathy toward those people who \ngo. They do not want your sympathy. They go where they are asked. They \nare the bravest, best, most ready military force in the world, and they \ndo their duty. They do it better than anyone else in the world. That is \nwhy we stopped Nazi Germany in World War II.\n  They do it because it is their duty to do it. It does not mean we \nshould ask them to do it. That is a different story.\n  The American forces, the Armed Forces, again, are not to be \nsubcontracted out all over the world whenever some crisis erupts. They \nare the guardians of our security, our liberty, our national security. \nWe ought not to allow them to be needlessly or recklessly endangered, \neven if the President has boxed himself in a corner.\n  What is the President supposed to say to Mrs. So-and-so when she \nloses her son? ``I got boxed in a corner, Mrs. Jones. I am very sorry. \nI made a commitment. I should not have made it, but I sent your loved \none anyway, to be killed. I am sorry.'' That is not good enough, folks. \nThat is not good enough. That is not good enough.\n  Bosnian peacekeeping is not an appropriate role for the Armed Forces \nof the United States. It is not what they are trained to do. It is not \nwhat they are trained to do.\n  Now, the administration has also suggested that those of us who do \nnot support turning the American military into a Bosnian police force \nare somehow isolationists. I resent that charge very much. The issue \nhere is not whether our Armed Forces should be called upon when \nnecessary to defend our interests abroad; rather, the issue is, when, \nwhere, and under what circumstances is it appropriate to deploy U.S. \nmilitary personnel in and out of area operations? That is what the \nmilitary is all about. It is troubling to me that even after 3 years of \non-the-job training the President still--still--does not understand the \nproper role of our Armed Forces.\n  I just left a meeting 15 or 20 minutes before I came here to the \nfloor. We were talking about the Defense budget. We were talking back \nand forth, back and forth among Members of both sides of the aisle. A \ncouple of comments were made. Well, we do not think the President will \nsign this bill. The President is not going to sign, we are hearing, he \nis not going to sign the Defense authorization bill which provides the \nsupport, increases the pay, by the way, of our military, the people \nthat he is asking to go to Bosnia. He is not going to sign a bill to \ngive them a pay raise. That is what is being threatened, hung over our \nhead every day. But he made a commitment to somebody in NATO without \nthe consent of Congress, without consulting the American people. \nWithout consulting anybody, he made that commitment.\n\n  I think he has a commitment to those he is sending that he ought to \nsupport. If he vetoes a Defense bill, he is not supporting them. \nAnybody that says he did not like everything in it, let me tell you, \nwhat is in it is the funding for those people that he is sending.\n  So when we debated here--I do not want anybody to accuse me or anyone \nelse who takes the other side that we are isolationists. I was not an \nisolationist when I served in Vietnam, and I was not an isolationist \nwhen I supported every Defense budget to support our American troops \nsince I have been in the Congress, and when I supported pay raises when \nhe would not support pay raises for members of the military.\n  We have no military or economic interests--none--in Bosnia. The \nAmerican people overwhelmingly oppose this policy. They oppose the \ncommitment of 20,000 ground troops. Everybody knows that. Look at any \npoll. That is the issue. The White House spin does not cut it. Public \nrelations gimmickry does not cut it. It does not work. Nothing is going \nto change them.\n  Let me briefly, for the benefit of my colleagues, highlight what I \nsee to be the critical unanswered questions associated with the \nPresident's Bosnia policy.\n  First, what is our exact mission in Bosnia? What are we supposed to \ndo? Are we there to make peace? I ask everyone to listen, are we there \nto make peace, keep peace, enforce peace, or monitor peace? Which is \nit? Are we neutral? Are we evenhanded, or are we realigned with the \nBosnian Moslems? Which is it: Keep peace, enforce peace, \n\n[[Page S18420]]\nmonitor peace, make peace? Are we neutral, are we even handed, or \naligning with the Moslems? Does anyone know the answer to that \nquestion? No one knows the answer to that question.\n  What is the difference between making peace, keeping peace, enforcing \npeace, or monitoring peace? No one knows the answer to that question. \nThe President does not know the answer to that question. It has never \nbeen clearly delineated.\n  Second, why are we deploying for 1 year? Where did that come from? \nOne year--we just pick these guys up, 9-1-1 force, send them over there \nfor 1 year. Why not 10 months? How about a year and a half? Fourteen \nyears, 14 days, 2 years, 11 years--where did 1 year come from?\n\n  Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt had said after Pearl Harbor, \n``We will take your boys and send them out for 1 year. If we win the \nwar, we will come back in 1 year. If we lose the war, we will come back \nin 1 year.''\n  This is not Franklin Roosevelt in the White House right now. He does \nnot understand, you cannot make a commitment like that. You do not tell \nyour enemies what you are going to do ahead of time. If we do not know \nexactly what the mission is, how do we know how long it will take to \ncomplete it? What sequence of milestones have we established to \ndetermine our progress?\n  What happens if after this year, this little arbitrary year goes by, \nwhat happens if we have not achieved our objectives--we do not know \nwhat the objectives are, but assume we have not achieved them whatever \nthey might be--what do we do then? Pull the plug? Leave and concede \nthat the whole operation was a waste?\n  How about that phone call? ``Mrs. Jones, we stayed there a year, we \ntook some casualties. Unfortunately, your son was one. We did not get \nit done. Unfortunately, they still want to fight, so we are leaving.'' \nMaybe Mrs. Jones should know that now--not tomorrow, not after her son \nis injured or killed--today. Maybe Private Jones ought to know that \nnow, too.\n  Are the antagonists not likely to wait us out and launch hostilities \nas soon as we leave? Is it all for nothing if we have not achieved our \ngoal in a year? Mr. President, 1,000 years these people have been \nfighting over there, and we will decide it all in a year. We will take \ncare of it all in 1 year. We will come home in 1 year, and that will be \nit. All that fighting will end, all that 1,000 years, century after \ncentury, we will take care of it in a year. Very ambitious.\n  Maybe the President reneges on his 1-year commitment and he decides \nto keep the troops there a little longer. How long is a little longer--\n14 years? How many years were we in Vietnam? The Senator in the chair \nknows we went there in 1961 to help the South Vietnamese get control of \ntheir government against the communist onslaught from the North, and 12 \nyears later we left. And 2 years after that, the North Vietnamese tanks \nrolled back into South Vietnam.\n  We saw it in Somalia. If you do not like the Vietnamese example, you \nthink that is too hard on the President, to look at. It is easy to get \nthe troops in. It is a little tough to get them out, though.\n  The troops are deploying to this treacherous terrain in the middle of \nthe winter, dead winter. There is no infrastructure to support tens of \nthousands of soldiers. Towns that are being vacated by the Serbs under \nthe peace agreement, told they had to vacate, are being burned and \nsacked and ravaged. Shermanesque; burned. What are they going to be \nliving in? Tents? Is there housing over there?\n  If they are not going to live in tents, and many of the houses are \nbeing burned, and we have thousands of refugees that the President says \nare going to come back home, with a shortage of housing, where are we \ngoing to quarter our troops? Did anybody think about that?\n  How are we going to transport the heavy equipment in and around \nBosnia with very few roads that are in shape to be able to pass on? Are \nwe going to have to build those roads and build those bridges? While we \nare building roads and building bridges, who is going to be protecting \nthe folks that are doing the building of the roads and bridges?\n  The Senator from Tennessee a short while ago talked about this. At \nwhat point do we get sucked into the role of nation building? Nation \nbuilding? He even used the term, the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, said ``nation creating.'' Arbitrarily, we take a map in \nDayton, OH, and we say: ``Here is a line here. Here is a line over \nhere. If you are a Serb, you live on this side of the line. If you are \na Moslem, you live over here. If you are a Croat, you live here. If \nthree of you live in the same town, we will split the town up a little \nbit.'' That did not work in Berlin and it is not going to work here. It \nis not going to work here. So we are going to have to nation build. \nWhat happens when we leave?\n  What about the Russian brigade that will be serving alongside \nAmerican forces? There is going to be a Russian brigade of soldiers \nserving alongside American forces. I can hear the President now. \n``That's great. We can work with the Russians.'' Whose side are the \nRussians on? Who have they been sympathetic to all these years? The \nSerbs. What have we been doing to the Serbs for the past few months \nunder this President's policy? Bombing the blazes out of them. Are the \nRussians going to sit back and allow the Moslems the opportunity to \nachieve military parity? Are they going to let that happen with their \nclients, the Serbs? I don't think so.\n  And what happens--I am asking a lot of interrogatories here, but \nthere are a lot of lives at stake, and we ought to ask these \ninterrogatories. If we had asked them in the Vietnam war, we would not \nhave lost 58,000 people.\n  What if the Russians do not view us as being evenhanded, and they \ntake action to enhance, to boost the Serbs? What happens then? What \nhappens when the Russians and the Americans have a flareup over who is \nsupporting whom? What happens then? How do we increase the military \ncapability of the Moslems without involving or jeopardizing the \nsecurity of American ground forces?\n  I remember this debate a couple of years ago. We were talking about \nit during the Bush administration. We were talking about it during the \nClinton administration. The words ``ground forces in Bosnia'' was like \nraking your fingers across a blackboard. It just sickened you to think \nof. You could just feel how much it hurt just to think about it. I \nnever believed that we would get to this point. Yet here we are.\n  Even if the U.S. forces are not actually delivering the weapons, and \neven if they are not training the Moslems, how do we avoid being linked \nto the Moslems? The Serbs know we are linked to the Moslems. They know \nthat. So, ironically, you have a situation where it could be beneficial \nto the Moslems to instigate some attack and blame it on the Serbs. Or \nvice versa. It could happen. What do we do then? Is this Lebanon all \nover again? Do you remember Lebanon?\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Another question. What about the thousands--and I mean \nthousands--of Iranian fundamentalists who are already in the region \nsupporting the Bosnian Moslems? They are not exactly our best friends, \nIranian fundamentalists. How do we defend against terrorism or sabotage \nfrom these professed anti-American forces?\n  Do you see what we have put our American troops into? Is that what \nthey are trained to do? Is that why they went to Ranger school? Is that \nwhy they joined the Marines and became pilots and learned to fight for \nthe security of their country? Is that what they did it for? Is that \nwhat they were trained to do?\n  Since I have had a lot of ``what abouts'' here, what about the \nCroats? How do they fit into this mix, a very fragile mix? How will \nthey view the buildup of Moslem military capabilities? Are they going \nto be supportive? Or are they going to be threatened? Will they be \nemboldened to reignite hostilities against the Serbs, knowing that U.S. \ntroops are in their corner either directly or indirectly? Who knows?\n  Let me go to the final question. What about the cost, not only in \nAmerican lives or the possibility of lost American lives--and one life, \none, is too many; one life. We have already spent billions on military \noperations in and around the Adriatic. Navy steaming \n\n[[Page S18421]]\nhours, rescue operations, no-fly-zone enforcement, offensive military \noperations, and now the preliminary ground deployments have been \nenormously expensive. This has been taxing the military over and over \nagain. Mr. President, 911 in Somalia, 911 in Haiti, 911 in Cuba, 911 \nnow in Bosnia. You think those dollars do not come from somewhere? You \nthink they do not come out of training? Or housing? Or something? Some \nmilitary equipment? Flying hours? You bet they do.\n\n  What does this President want to do? Cut the defense budget. Do not \ngive them the $7 billion; we do not need it. Cut it. Do not sign the \ndefense bill. Threaten us. We have been threatened for the last 3 \nmonths by administration personnel here, and I know because I am on the \nArmed Services Committee and I have been involved in those threats. \n``We are not going to sign it if you do not do this or you do not do \nthat.''\n  The administration estimates the 1-year cost in dollars will be an \nadditional $2 billion. How are we going to pay for this? What other \nprograms will become the bill payer? How is readiness being affected? \nHow will this deployment affect our ability to fight and win two major \nregional contingencies, as called for in the Bottom-Up Review conducted \nby this President? That means two major contingencies. It means, for \nexample, if war broke out in the Persian Gulf and war broke out in \nKorea, just to use an example, that is two different regions of the \nworld. We are supposed to be able to go right out there and take care \nof ourselves and protect our interests in both of those regions, while \nwe are cutting the military, while we are cutting readiness, and \ncutting operation and man-hours. And if the President does not sign the \nauthorization bill, even giving these kids a pay raise to go risk their \nlives in Bosnia--we are not talking about a big raise either. The \nAmerican people need to understand that some of the kids who are going \nto Bosnia are probably on food stamps because they do not make enough \nmoney, so they are eligible for food stamps. It is food for thought, \nMr. President, before you send them over there.\n\n  I just listed a few dozen of the unanswered questions surrounding \nthis debate, and we will not get the answers before we send our troops \nover there because they are already being sent there. We are supposed \nto rubber stamp it. Without substantive answers to these questions, it \nis irresponsible for the Clinton administration to be committing--let \nalone actually acting to deploy--thousands of United States troops in \nBosnia.\n  If you think of the Somalia situation, when we lost a group of Army \nRangers because we did not even have basic equipment because we did not \nhave access to it, we had to ask for it from one of our allies. That \nwas a small operation--a small operation. This is a big operation with \nthousands of American troops in harm's way without having basic \nquestions answered.\n  Do you think that President Roosevelt would have sent troops in World \nWar II or President Truman would have sent troops to Korea without \nhaving these questions answered? Of course not. Of course not. \nPresident Bush in the Persian Gulf had the questions answered before he \nwent. He knew what the mission was. That mission was very simple: drive \nthe Iraqis out of Kuwait. And he was criticized for not going into \nBaghdad and killing Saddam Hussein. That is easy to criticize after the \nfact, but that was not the mission. The mission was to drive them out \nof Kuwait, which is what they did.\n  Can somebody tell me what the mission is here? Again, peacekeeping, \npeacemaking? What is it?\n  I oppose as firmly, as adamantly, as strenuously, and as strongly as \nI can sending American soldiers on the ground into Bosnia. I do not \nbelieve the President has articulated a clearly defined mission. I do \nnot believe he has articulated a rationale. And I believe as deeply in \nmy heart as I can that it is a terrible, terrible mistake to send \nAmerica's finest to police this region, to intercede and to take sides \nin a centuries-old conflict.\n  And if we get out of there and we do not take casualties and we \naccomplish it, God bless us. I hope that happens. But is it worth the \nrisk? And the answer is, no, it is not, and the American people know \nit.\n\n  We are taking sides in this case. We are not going in there as \nstrictly peacekeepers. We have already taken sides, just as we did in \nSomalia, and we paid for it when one of the warlords, Aideed, attacked \nour troops, just as we did in Lebanon when we took casualties. In each \ncase, we paid a terrible price--a terrible price.\n  When are we going to learn from the mistakes of the past? When are we \ngoing to learn from history?\n  I hate to say this, but I like to call it like it is. It is something \nthat just makes it worse for me, and people are going to accuse me of \ntaking a cheap shot. And I am not; I am just stating a fact.\n  This President, when he was called to go to Vietnam, went to Europe \nand protested the war. He now is ordering these people into combat--\npossible combat, possible harm's way--without a mission clearly defined \nand without the support of the American people. There is no small irony \nthere, Mr. President.\n  If we authorize this misguided deployment, and I know we will, or, \neven worse, if we acquiesce in it, and I know we will, we are just as \nculpable for its consequences as the President who sent them there--\njust as culpable.\n  I ask my colleagues to think it over very carefully. Are you prepared \nto accept the responsibility for what may occur there? Are the \npotential costs worth it in dollars, in lives? What do we gain? If we \nare successful--and I think any reasonable person would say we might \nhave a few years of peace, maybe, if we are lucky--we have a lot to \nlose, a whole lot to lose.\n  I have two teenaged sons. I can tell you I have weighed the pros and \ncons. They are not of military age yet, but they are not far away. No \nmatter how I do the math, no matter how I do the math, each time I come \nup with one inescapable conclusion: We should not be sending America's \nfinest to Bosnia. And I have to ask myself, would I want to send them \nthere? If the answer to that question is ``no''--and it is--then I am \nnot going to send anybody else's there with my vote.\n  Bosnia is not our home. It is a terrible tragedy. It is not our \nsecurity in jeopardy. It is not our fight.\n  When I think of the blood that we shed for Europe over the years, \nwhat we did in literally liberating the continent of Europe, half of \nit, how could we be criticized for passing on this one, Mr. President? \nDoes that make us isolationist? Give me a break. We cannot afford, nor \ndo we have the moral authority, to be the world's policeman. The \nworld's leader, yes; the world's policeman, no.\n\n  This is a European conflict. The Europeans themselves ought to \nresolve it, and they can resolve it. It has nothing to do with NATO--\nnothing at all to do with NATO. It is a phony issue. The NATO charter \ndoes not even mention Bosnia. They are not members of NATO. NATO talks \nabout collective security, collective response when one of the nations \nof NATO are attacked. It has nothing to do with NATO.\n  Do not listen to that phony argument. It is not about isolationism. \nIt is not about internationalism. It is about the proper role of the \nArmed Forces in international affairs. That is what it is about: the \nproper role of the Armed Forces in international affairs. It is about \nkeeping faith with the men and women who so selflessly serve our Nation \nin uniform day in and day out, deployed all over the world. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  During this century, we spent hundreds of billions dollars defending \nEurope against communism and against fascism. We sacrificed hundreds of \nthousands of American lives in Europe in World War I and World War II. \nThen, after we finished, we spent billions more under the Marshall Plan \nto rebuild it, and then we fought the cold war. We maintained a robust \nmilitary presence in Europe throughout that cold war, and we equipped \nour NATO allies with sophisticated state-of-the-art aircraft and \nweaponry. And they can use it along with their forces to end this \nconflict, if they think they can end it.\n  We have done our part. We have done it. How can anybody accuse us of \nbeing isolationist because we do not support sending American forces \ninto Bosnia after all we have done for Europe? We have earned the \nright--we have earned it--to sit this one out. \n\n[[Page S18422]]\n\n  There is no reason that our allies cannot begin assuming a more \ndirect role in European security, and certainly no reason they cannot \nhandle the Bosnian peacekeeping mission on their own. It is another \n20,000 of their troops. That is all. And, if not, if this operation \nrequires the full combat power of the United States of America because \nsomehow this threatens the security of Europe, then we are really \ntalking about something much larger than a peacekeeping mission, are we \nnot?\n  My colleagues, please, consider this very carefully. The American \npeople are watching. Lives hang in the balance. Perhaps the moral \nessence of America hangs in the balance, just like it did when we \ndeserted our people in Vietnam while they died and we protested in the \nstreets.\n  They are the ones who will be in harm's way. They are the ones who \nare going to be in the mud and the cold and the slush while we stand on \nthe floor of the Senate debating. They are the ones who will be away \nfrom their families at Christmas, missing their kids--not us. They are \nthe ones who will be vulnerable to millions of landmines all over that \ncountry, put out there by all sides of the conflict. They are going to \nbe vulnerable to anti-American fundamentalists roving the countryside. \nThey are the ones who are going to be subjected to bitter hatred of \ncombatants who have seen their friends and families butchered before \ntheir eyes.\n  Peace and reconciliation in Bosnia is a lofty goal, and I give the \nPresident credit for wanting it, as we all want it. But is it something \nthat American sons and daughters should die for? Is it? Because that is \nthe question. There is no other question that we deal with in this \ndebate that matters except that one when you make that vote.\n  Is it something that those men and women should die for, whether they \ndo or not? And let us pray they do not, but the question is, is it \nsomething they should die for? And I submit with the greatest respect \nto the President, the Commander in Chief, and to my colleagues, the \nanswer to that question is no, it is not.\n  Let me end on one final observation. I vigorously oppose this policy, \nas I have said. But irrespective of the outcome of this debate, I will \ndo everything in my power to ensure the safety and security of our \ntroops. Reasonable people can disagree on policy, as many of us do here \ntoday, but I will tell you one thing, if this President sends them \nthere, which he is going to do, this Senator is not going to be silent \nif he hoists that veto pen and decides to veto the defense bill of the \nUnited States of America.\n  No, this Senator is not going to be silent. This Senator is going to \nspeak up head to head with this President if he pulls that stunt. That \nis not going to happen without the American people being fully aware of \nwhat is going on. As Americans, we must support these men and women, \nwhether we disagree with the policy of the President or not. If he \nsends them there, we have to support them. But we do not have to give \nhim cover by saying he said he was going to send them there; therefore, \nlet us vote and give him the cover. We need to make the President \nunderstand it is a mistake. Maybe he will change his mind. This is the \nchance we have, the only chance we will have. We must support them and \nprovide a unified base of support to ensure their safe and expeditious \nreturn home, not like when I was in Vietnam and read about the \nprotests. They have earned it. They are the best.\n\n  That is the sad, bitter irony of this whole debate. These are the \nbest, the best of America that are going into harm's way. These are not \ncriminals. They are not people who are dregs of society somewhere, \ncastoffs, failures. These are the best. These are the people who go to \nthe military academies, and I nominate them every year, as do all of my \ncolleagues. These are the best that we are sending into harm's way, and \nthey will have my support if they go, but I will be doggone if I am \ngoing to cave in because somebody made a commitment 2 years ago that \nwas wrong, that will put them in harm's way.\n  Mr. President, in closing, just let me say, I pray that God watches \nover our men and women in this policy that I bitterly oppose, and I \nhope that my colleagues will rise to the occasion and send a very \nstrong message, and that message is sent here in this Hutchison \nresolution because it says very clearly that we oppose you going, we \noppose sending troops, Mr. President, but we will support them if you \nsend them.\n  That is a responsible action, and I hope that the President will heed \nthe debate here and change his mind before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  I think it is very important on an issue of this magnitude that \nMembers of the Senate take the time to outline why they have come to \nthe conclusions they have. I serve as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have had a number of hearings dealing with Bosnia. Like \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate who is currently in the chair, I \nhave gone to Bosnia, to Sarajevo, and have seen the area.\n  At one of our recent Armed Services hearings, I referenced a Time \nmagazine where it had on the front cover a photograph of a young \nsoldier. There was a caption on the front of Time magazine, and the \nquestion was, ``Is Bosnia Worth Dying For?''\n  So I referenced that and asked that question to the witnesses who \nwere there who were advocating that they supported this decision. And \nthey told me that we are beyond that question, that that is not the \nquestion today.\n\n  I do not believe that a lot of Americans, nor do I believe that a lot \nof American parents who have sons and daughters in the military, \nbelieve we are beyond that question. But in the discussion that took \nplace at that Armed Services hearing, we were told the two vital \ninterests that do require us to send our American military personnel to \nBosnia are, No. 1, United States leadership, and, No. 2, European \nstability. Those were the two vital interests. It was not the question \nof whether Bosnia is worth dying for.\n  With regard to leadership, approximately 2 years ago, members of the \nArmed Services Committee sat down with counterparts of ours from other \nEuropean parliaments. We met here in Washington, DC, and I remember \nasking specifically the question of our European counterparts, with \nregard to Bosnia, the conflict that is taking place there, is that a \nsituation in which you feel the United States should take a leadership \nrole? Are we supposed to go in there and resolve that? And I am \nparaphrasing, but they said no, that is our problem. That is in our \nEuropean backyard. We, the European countries, must solve this problem, \nnot the United States.\n  Then we saw how the United Nations policy began to be implemented. \nThey placed the European peacekeepers in Bosnia. And as we watched, we \nsaw routinely these peacekeepers being taken hostage. We saw these \npeacekeepers that were being handcuffed to potential target sites that \nbombing efforts might take out. But here were the peacekeepers \nhandcuffed, held hostage. There was no peace that they were able to \nkeep. Also, Mr. President, tragically, many of these peacekeepers \nwatched as atrocities were inflicted upon different groups in Bosnia \nbecause the U.N. rules of engagement did not allow them to do anything \nelse, so they watched these atrocities take place. This policy that was \ndesigned to resolve the problems of Bosnia was an absolute failure, a \nterrible failure.\n\n  Congress has been passing resolutions saying lift the arms embargo \nbecause one thing that Americans believe in is self-defense. \nUnfortunately, the effort of passing in both Houses the measure to lift \nthe arms embargo was rejected by the White House.\n  The allies said, ``Absolutely not. You must not lift the arms embargo \nbecause that could put our European peacekeepers in peril.'' Tell me, \nwhat greater peril could there be than what was happening to those \npeacekeepers? But the allies insisted that that would be a mistake to \nlift the arms embargo.\n  Just some months ago, Senator Dole hosted a gathering of Senators \nwith the Prime Minister of Bosnia. I remember very clearly the Prime \nMinister of Bosnia saying, ``We don't want your boys to fight on our \nsoil. We have boys to fight. What we need are weapons.'' And he said, \n``We can respect the United States taking a neutral position. We can \nrespect that. But it is not neutral \n\n[[Page S18423]]\nto deny us the weapons for our boys so that they can defend themselves \nand their families on our soil.'' But that is what the United States \nwas doing. So much for neutrality. But the allies continued to say, no, \nno to lifting the arms embargo. So they stayed with a failed policy.\n  Here is the incredible leap of logic that I just have a hard time \ngrasping. And that is that with this failed United Nations policy, as \ncarried out by our allies, the same ones who said that it was their \nproblem to solve, we are now told causes a real question of U.S. \nleadership. The failed policy in Bosnia is carried out by the allies, \nbut now we are told it is a U.S. leadership dilemma.\n  Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, in fact, said the \nplacement of our troops into Bosnia is the acid test of U.S. \nleadership. Well, I have to question why we must put 20,000 troops into \nBosnia to meet the acid test of U.S. leadership. If there is any \nquestion about U.S. leadership in the world, let me just discuss a few \nitems that the United States is doing.\n  American forces are enforcing the no-fly zone and economic sanctions \nin the Balkans. American military personnel are enforcing the no-fly \nzone and economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein. The American troops \nare helping to restore democracy in Haiti. And 40,000 American troops \nare preserving peace on the Korean peninsula. Also, 100,000 American \nmilitary personnel are in Europe fulfilling our commitments to NATO. \nAmerica took the lead in negotiating the Bosnian peace agreement. And \nthat is significant.\n  When I was in Bosnia, I saw Ambassador Holbrooke, and I saw his \ntireless efforts to bring about the settlement. We are the world's only \nmilitary superpower. We are the world's largest economy. So how in the \nworld does someone then, from this list, draw the conclusion that our \nplacement of 20,000 troops into a piece of real estate called Bosnia is \nthe acid test of United States leadership? And also how can anybody, \nafter reviewing this type of list, which is simply a partial list, \nstate that somehow we are advocating isolationism? This is not the list \nof isolationists.\n  Mr. President, we are told that the key to success of the mission is \nestablishing military equilibrium. In other words, in order for us to \nultimately complete the mission and return our troops home and the \nallies to go home, the Bosnians must have military equilibrium with \nSerbs and the Croats because even as late as today we are told that is \nthe only way they can defend themselves and, if they are not allowed to \ndefend themselves, then it will not work. That is what the \nadministration said.\n  That is exactly what many of us have been saying for months, that if \nyou do not allow the Bosnians to defend themselves, it will not work. \nThat is why it has not worked. And now we are told that the key to \nsuccess on this mission is that we must have this rebuilding of the \nBosnians. In other words, we need to lift the arms embargo.\n  Previously, our allies said no, you must not lift the arms embargo. \nBut now apparently by paying the price of putting 20,000 American \ntroops on the ground in Bosnia, now everybody says, this is the right \nway to go. Now we can achieve military equilibrium, which again is what \nwe have been advocating for months in this body and in the body across \nthe rotunda.\n  I fail to see why this proposed deployment is the acid test of United \nStates leadership when you consider how we got here. We did not need to \nget to this point. There were other options, options such as lifting \nthe arms embargo as passed by Congress.\n  With regard to the second point, on European stability, the argument \nthere is that, if we were to allow this conflict in Bosnia to continue, \nit would spread, it may spread to Greece, it may spread to Turkey, and \nthen we have vital United States interests, and, therefore, we must \ncontain this conflict, we must not allow the fighting to go on; \ntherefore, we are going to send an overwhelming force into Bosnia so \nthere would be no fighting.\n  But ironically we are told, if fighting does break out again --and \nthere is that possibility--then the United States will immediately \nleave and the NATO allies will immediately leave. So the very reason we \nare going in there is to make sure there is no fighting, but if \nfighting breaks out, we leave. If that is not a paradox.\n\n  I asked the administration if there would not be a great temptation \nin that instance, with an overwhelming force, if they would not feel \ncompelled to snuff the conflict right then, because if that is the \nmission, you do not want this to spread, perhaps you need to snuff it \nright there. But, no, they would not do that.\n  Therefore, I think that shows you the flaw of this strategy. Instead \nof putting the troops in there that says, if there is a fight, we would \nimmediately leave, we should have a containment strategy in the \nsurrounding area so it cannot leave. You lift the arms embargo and you \nallow the Bosnians to defend themselves and, if it spreads, you have \nthe borders and you stop it. We had options, Mr. President.\n  We are told also with regard to an exit strategy--I asked former \nDefense Secretary Schlesinger at a recent hearing in the Armed Services \nCommittee, ``Do you believe that we have an exit strategy?'' And he \nsaid, ``No. We have an exit hope.'' That has been the dilemma of so \nmany of our actions that we have taken. We have not had an effective \nexit strategy.\n  When we talk about this, again, that the military equilibrium is a \nkey to the exit strategy, with all of the different annexes that were \ndeveloped in Dayton that have been initialed, which will soon be signed \nin Paris, volumes of written agreements between these warring factions, \nis it not ironic that that element dealing with the potential buildup \nof Bosnian arms is only verbal? It is not in writing. To me that is \namazing, if that is the key to the mission and that is the only thing \nthat is verbal.\n  Mr. President, I do not feel that on an issue like this there is any \nroom for partisanship. I remember when I arrived here approximately 3 \nyears ago, one of the very first pieces of legislation that I embraced \nand was proud to cosponsor was the legislation by Senator Feingold, a \nmember of the Democratic Party. I am a Republican. It did not bother me \nat all because he was right. And his legislation was to lift the arms \nembargo.\n  I felt passionately about that. I still do, and it was a bipartisan \neffort. It was passed in a bipartisan effort.\n  I believe in this current situation, Congress has been brought in too \nlate. The commitment has been made. But I will just add, this Bosnian \nproblem did not just happen when the new administration came into \npower. It had been there, and we had not dealt effectively with it.\n  I ask myself to cast my votes based upon what I think is the right \nthing for the country, the right thing for the troops and what sort of \nprecedent I am establishing for myself in future votes of this nature.\n  Tonight, we had a meeting at the White House, eight Senators met with \nthe President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of \nDefense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security \nAdviser, and I appreciate that invitation to have that sort of \ndiscussion in that sort of a setting so that we could ask the \nquestions. But I will tell you, Mr. President, after approximately 1 \nhour and 20 minutes in that setting asking the questions, I came out \nconvinced that we are following the wrong policy, we are following the \nwrong strategy. We did not exercise the options that I believe firmly \nwe should have exercised and, in a funny, roundabout way, we are \nbeginning now to try to implement those but we are going to put 20,000 \ntroops in there to accomplish, in essence, the lifting of an arms \nembargo.\n  But with regard to this situation, like Senator Smith stated, there \nwill be no question, there will be no doubt about my support of the \nUnited States troops, the finest military personnel in the world. They \nare the finest, and we will do all that is necessary, in the event that \nthey are sent to Bosnia, to make sure they have the equipment, to make \nsure they have whatever they need. In Somalia, we saw a problem \nbecause, for political reasons, they were not given the equipment they \nneeded. That will not happen. We support our troops wherever. We \nsupport them.\n  I believe that the Dole-McCain amendment will be that perfecting \nresolution that says in the event the troops are sent, then there is \ngoing to be a list of reporting requirements to \n\n[[Page S18424]]\nCongress so that we are not left out of milestones that must be met so \nthat mission creep does not happen. I have not seen the final language \nof that because I believe it is still being worked on, but I believe \nthat will be the intent.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Hutchison amendment because, Mr. President, \nthe terrible dilemma that we are in is that the options that had merit \nwere not exercised with our allies. And I underscore ``with,'' because \nwe must work with our allies. We have been through too much together \nfor us to not work today and in the future with our allies. But we now \nfind ourselves in the situation where a commitment has been made, and I \nrespectfully and strongly disagree with that action.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to share some additional thoughts \nwith Members of the body with regard to the deployment of troops in \nBosnia.\n  Some Members in their busy schedules may have missed articles that \nappeared in the New York Times and Washington Post, but for those who \ncontinue to probe this question and try and analyze whether or not this \nis a wise move, I wanted to share these quotes.\n  The first one is from the New York Times, December 3, 1995. It is a \npage-1 story. The headline is: ``Foreign Islamic Fighters in Bosnia \nPose Potential Threat for GI's.''\n  The second paragraph reads:\n\n       ``The American tanks do not frighten us,'' said a fighter, \n     standing under a black flag covered with white Arabic script. \n     ``We came here to die in the service of Islam. This is our \n     duty. No infidel force will tell us how to live or what to \n     do. This is a Muslim country, which must be defended by \n     Muslims. We are 400 men here, and we all pray that we will \n     one day be martyrs.''\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       They are even suspected in the shooting death last month of \n     an American civilian employee of the United Nations.\n\n  I do not think it was widely covered in the United States, however, \nthe week in which I visited Bosnia, specifically the day before I went \nup to Tuzla, an American had been killed.\n  The article continues:\n\n       The mujaheddin have also vowed to kill five British \n     citizens in retaliation for the October 5 killing, by British \n     United Nations troops, of a mujaheddin fighter who pointed a \n     loaded pistol at them.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed a copy of the \narticle in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 3, 1995]\n\n Foreign Islamic Fighters in Bosnia Pose a Potential Threat for G.I.'s\n\n                           (By Chris Hedges)\n\n       Podbrezje, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 2.--On a bleak, \n     wind-swept hilltop, bearded Arab soldiers, many in the \n     traditional black garb of Afghan fighters, stomped their feet \n     to ward off the bitter chill, shifted their automatic rifles \n     and cursed the impending arrival of American soldiers.\n       ``The American tanks do not frighten us,'' said a fighter, \n     standing under a black flag covered with white Arabic script. \n     ``We came here to die in the service of Islam. This is our \n     duty. No infidel force will tell us how to live or what to \n     do. This is a Muslim country, which must be defended by \n     Muslims. We are 400 men here, and we all pray we will one day \n     be martyrs.''\n       With the crease-fire in Bosnia, these militantly Islamic \n     volunteers known as mujahedeen, who fought alongside Bosnian \n     Government soldiers against Serbs and Croats for much of the \n     war, have turned their attention to what they see as the \n     other, often internal, enemies of the faith.\n       They are even suspected in the shooting death last month of \n     an American civilian employee of the United Nations.\n       Many of these 3,000 to 4,000 men are veterans of the war in \n     Afghanistan and are often wanted in their own countries, \n     linked to violent Islamic groups struggling to overthrow the \n     Governments in Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. In \n     their zeal to enforce a militant form of Islam that most \n     Bosnian Muslims themselves do not espouse, the fighters, \n     distinctive in their flowing black beards, force United \n     Nations vehicles off the road, smash bottles of alcohol in \n     shop windows and warn Christian families at gunpoint to leave \n     Bosnia.\n       The mujahedeen have also vowed to kill five British \n     citizens in retaliation for the Oct. 5 killing, by British \n     United Nations troops, of a mujahedeen fighter who pointed a \n     loaded pistol at them.\n       The killing of the fighter, a Bosnian Muslim named Elvedin \n     Hodzio who had joined the majahedeen, is the kind of event \n     United Nations officials say could easily trigger violent \n     clashes between the Islamic militants and American troops. \n     The British are now locked in a war of nerves with the \n     mujahedeen troops.\n       Five days after the shooting, a rocket-propelled grenade \n     was fired at a United Nations military observer team along a \n     mountain road. The team's armored car was destroyed, but \n     those inside escaped with slight wounds. Two weeks later a \n     British United Nations patrol in the town of Zavidovici was \n     surrounded by about two dozen heavily armed mujahedeen who \n     threatened to kill the soldiers until Bosnian Government \n     troops intervened.\n       On Nov. 18, William Jefferson, a native of Camden, N.J., \n     employed by the United Nations, was found shot twice in the \n     head near Banovici. United Nations officials strongly suspect \n     that he was killed by the mujahedeen, who may have mistaken \n     him for a British citizen.\n       Most British aid workers, whose homes have been attacked \n     and spray-painted with Arabic slogans, have left Zenica. The \n     few who remain ride in unmarked convoys, change their routes \n     and never go out at night. And the British Overseas \n     Development Administration office in Zenica has placed armed \n     guards out front and removed its signs.\n       ``This is worse psychologically than the shelling,'' said \n     Fred Yallop, the administration director.\n       The clash with the British has also pointed out to many aid \n     workers the strength of the mujahedeen and the weakness of \n     the local authorities.\n       ``The problem,'' a senior United Nations official said, \n     ``is that the local authorities have no control over the \n     mujahedeen. The mujahedeen are protected by the Bosnian \n     Government. They operate with total impunity. We do not know \n     who controls them, perhaps no one.''\n       Many mujahedeen fighters carry Bosnian identity cards and \n     passports, although they often do not speak the language. And \n     Western aid workers who report the frequent theft of jeeps \n     and vehicles by mujahedeen troops say the Bosnian police are \n     powerless to enter their camps to retrieve the vehicles.\n       ``We see them drive by in vehicles that were stolen from \n     international organizations and the U.N.,'' said a British \n     aid worker, who insisted on remaining unidentified.\n       The mujahedeen here are based in a four-story yellow \n     building that was once a factory in the village of Podbrezje, \n     three miles north of Zenica, in what would be the American \n     sector of Bosnia, and they are among the Muslim volunteers \n     who came to Bosnia shortly after the war started in 1992. The \n     fighters are revered in the Arab world, and videotapes that \n     extol their bravery and dedication are sold on street corners \n     from Aden to Cairo.\n       The mujahedeen served as shock troops for the Bosnian Army \n     and have suffered severe casualties in frontal assaults on \n     Serbian and Croatian positions. All view the West, despite \n     the scheduled deployment of some 60,000 NATO-led troops, as \n     an enemy of the faith they have vowed to give their lives \n     defending.\n       ``The American soldiers will be just like the U.N. \n     soldiers,'' said a fighter wearing green combat fatigues and \n     speaking in heavily accented Persian Gulf Arabic. ``They will \n     corrupt the Muslims here, bring in drugs and \n     prostitution. They will destroy all the work we have done \n     to bring the Bosnians back to true Islam. The Americans \n     are wrong if they think we will stand by and watch them do \n     this.''\n       The Bosnian-Croat Catholics who live near this mujahedeen \n     camp, one of about 10 in Bosnia, have suffered some of the \n     worst harassment. Many have been beaten by mujahedeen \n     fighters and robbed at gunpoint. More than half of the \n     Catholic families in this village have been driven from their \n     homes. When they flee, their houses are promptly seized by \n     the Islamic militiamen.\n       Jazo Milanovic and his wife, Ivka, sat huddled by their \n     wood stove one recent evening waiting for the police. At the \n     house of their next-door neighbor, mujahedeen fighters were \n     carting out household items. The fighters would finish their \n     looting before the police arrived.\n       ``They walk in and take what they want,'' the 68-year-old \n     farmer said, ``and the one time I protested to them they \n     fired a burst over my head. The bullet holes are still in the \n     wall. We will all be forced out soon.''\n       But it is not just the mujahedeen who have gained a \n     foothold in Bosnia. There are at least 10 Islamic charities \n     in Zenica, including one run by the Iranian Government, that \n     many Western governments view with deep suspicion. The \n     charities have budgets in the tens of millions of dollars and \n     work to build militant grass-roots organizations in Bosnia.\n       Human Relief International, an Egyptian foundation that is \n     outlawed in Egypt, is one such group.\n       The 40 Egyptians who work for the charity in Bosnia are all \n     wanted in Egypt on terrorism charges. Western diplomats and \n     United Nations officials say the charities, along with the \n     mujahedeen, have combined to create a powerful militant \n     Islamic force in Bosnia that could be inimical to American \n     interests here.\n     \n[[Page S18425]]\n\n       ``We are all code red,'' said Airman Elhamalaway, who works \n     for the Egyptian charity. ``If we ever go back to Egypt, \n     which we will not, our names come up bright red on a computer \n     so the police know we should be immediately arrested.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the point of the article, and the reason I \nshare it with Members, is simply to make a clear point. This is not a \nbenign action. This is an area where there are serious problems that \nhave not been resolved by the peace agreement and where there are \nforces that can inflict harm on American troops.\n  I understand and appreciate American troops are willing to face \ndangers, face combat, but it would be foolish for any Member of this \nSenate to think that we are sending people into an area that has been \ncleared of danger because of the peace agreement.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a similar article from the Washington Post dated November 30.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\nForeign Muslims Fighting in Bosnia Considered ``Threat'' to U.S. Troops\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       The Pentagon is seriously concerned about the threat posed \n     to American peacekeeping troops in Bosnia by several hundred \n     Islamic fighters who come from outside the country but are \n     based in the Bosnian region that the U.S. military will \n     control, officials said yesterday.\n       While land mines, bad roads, soupy weather and disgruntled \n     rogue paramilitary groups also are listed as likely hazards \n     for western troops, it is the freelance groups of religious \n     zealots that particularly worry military planners.\n       U.S. officials called the non-Bosnian Muslim fighters \n     ``hard-core terrorists.'' Some U.S. officials said they \n     believe some of those Muslims were the ones who killed an \n     American civilian working for the United Nations on Nov. 19 \n     in the northern city of Tuzla, where the U.S. headquarters is \n     to be based. The investigation is continuing.\n       ``Many [of the Muslims] are very brave fighters,'' one \n     Defense Department analyst said. ``They have taken large \n     casualties. They have taken on some important operations and \n     are willing to take some tough action.''\n       They are, in short, the men willing to drive car bombs and \n     take part in other suicide attacks against western soldiers. \n     Worse, there is no obvious way to make them leave the region.\n       Defense officials estimate that throughout Bosnia, there \n     are ``a couple thousand'' fighters from Islamic countries--\n     including Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Libya, \n     Pakistan and Egypt--who have fought with the army of the \n     Muslim-led Bosnian government against separatist Serbs.\n       Many of the foreign Muslims are based around Tuzla, which \n     is to become the headquarters for ``Sector North'' of the \n     NATO-led operation, the area to be controlled by American \n     troops. Many also operate from three towns to the north of \n     Zenica, which is likely to define the southern border of the \n     U.S. sector.\n       The foreign Muslim groups usually carry small arms and \n     antitank weapons. Some, like the Iranians, are organized into \n     their own brigades. Others have been blended into the regular \n     armed forces and paramilitary groups.\n       Within the last several weeks, non-Bosnian Islamic troops \n     have stepped up attacks on western troops and civilians. They \n     fired a rocket-propelled grenade at one U.N. vehicle and \n     attacked several others with small arms fire.\n       Also recently British soldiers who are part of the U.N. \n     peacekeeping mission killed a member of one Islamic group, \n     who they said pulled a pistol on them. Shortly afterward, the \n     group retaliated by killing American civilian worker William \n     Jefferson, 43 of Camden, N.J., whom they mistook for a Briton \n     because he spoke with an accent, defense analysts said. The \n     Bosnian government told United Nations officials it had \n     captured and killed the three Islamic soldiers involved.\n       Although the Dayton accord calls for all foreign fighters, \n     including mercenaries and trainers, to leave Bosnia, defense \n     officials acknowledge that they have little hope that any of \n     the parties can, or are willing, to persuade the Islamic \n     groups to leave. The Bosnian government has given them tacit \n     approval to operate in its territory because they are good \n     fighters and have helped it win battles.\n       ``There are certain elements of the Bosnian government who \n     don't want to separate themselves from these particular \n     elements,'' said the defense analyst, who spoke on the \n     condition he not be named. ``They will find a way of hiding \n     these elements, to merge them into'' the regular armed \n     forces.\n       A civilian who has worked with the Bosnian government said \n     the United States is trying to ``put some heat'' on Turkey, \n     Saudi Arabia and other countries with some financial \n     influence over the groups, to make them leave. ``These guys \n     are mean,'' he said. ``You've got to control them.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to share with Members a concern that \nI had early on when we began to deploy U.S. forces into Bosnia by the \nway of aircraft. I was concerned about the ground rules and the rules \nof engagement with regard to aircraft. I specifically raised with the \nadministration a series of questions as to what we would do if \nAmericans were attacked while they were performing routine air patrols. \nFrankly, my concern was that we would end up duplicating what happened \nin Vietnam. Because our actions in Vietnam is relevant, let me \nsummarize that briefly.\n  U.S. troops were deployed in Vietnam but not given the rules of \nengagement that allowed them to quickly respond. If a forward air \npatrol spotted enemy troops on the ground no action against those \ntroops could be taken unless you had been fired on. They could be \ncarrying in supplies or ammunition that would be used against our \ntroops. I recall one particular unit was carrying the North Vietnamese \nflag. That was not enough to allow engagement of combat or use of \nairstrikes and naval gunfire in the coastal regions.\n  What was required was for the air patrol plane to fly low enough so \nthe troops were attempting to fire on you. Once the troops fired on \nyou, then you were allowed to call in an airstrike.\n  That airstrike called for approval by a variety of commands before a \nresponse could be made.\n  The quickest I ever had a response that allowed action was 2 hours. \nOne time it was over a day before we got a response. In the north, when \nour fliers went on missions, we had the Pentagon schedule the majority \nof those flights, and they dictated the road of ingress and the path of \negress, and dictated the flight level at which you could come in. If \nyou did not finish a target, you would go back into the cycle for \nretargeting, done in Washington, not in the field. Generally, the \nVietnamese knew how long that cycle took and they knew when you would \nbe coming back, they knew the altitude you would be coming in at, the \naltitude you would be addressing at, the course you would be taking \ninto the target, and the course you would take away from the target. \nMr. President, we set our people up for turkey shoots.\n  So I thought it was a legitimate question to ask specifically what \nthe rules of engagement for our missions into Bosnia would be. As \nMembers will recall, in Vietnam we ruled out of order some of the best \ntargets. I know of Secretary McNamara's book. I read it. He goes to \ngreat length to talk about all the targets he allowed. He left out that \nthe most important targets were ruled off limits. I thought a \nlegitimate question was, if we were attacked by forces from Serbia, \nwould we retaliate against the supply depots, against the bridges, or \nagainst the forces that originated the attacks or supported the attacks \non the American troops? That is what I asked in the report.\n  This was a series of discussions on October 5, 1993, before the U.S. \nplanes were shot down.\n\n       Senator Brown. Can you assure me that if our troops are \n     fired on, they will have the right to return fire?\n       Ambassador Oxman. Yes. The rules of engagement would permit \n     self-defense.\n       Senator Brown. We would be able to bomb supply bases of \n     troops that attacked our troops?\n       Ambassador Oxman. Senator, I think I would not go further \n     than to say there would be rules of engagement which would \n     permit NATO forces to defend themselves and carry out the \n     mission.\n       Senator Brown. Let me be specific. In Vietnam, key bridges \n     were put off limits, bridges that carried troops and vital \n     supplies to the North Vietnamese troops. They used those \n     supplies to attack American troops, and yet these key bridges \n     were put off limits, and our planes were not permitted to \n     attack some of the most valuable targets of the enemy. Can \n     you assure me that that will not be the policy if we send \n     troops to Bosnia?\n\n  I found it difficult to get an answer, other than ``they would have \nthe necessary rules of engagement to defend themselves in order to \ncarry out that agreement.''\n  Mr. President, we have experience in Bosnia already. We detected \nground-to-air missiles, SAM missiles. We detected the radar that was \nfollowing our planes. We knew the locations of Serbian missiles. The \nU.S. intelligence knew that. We publicly have acknowledged that the \nSerbs had missiles that were ground-to-air missiles they could use to \nshoot down our planes. We knew \n\n[[Page S18426]]\nthey were in the locations where our flights were going. We had \ndetected the radar from those units, and we still ordered our planes to \nfly the missions, and one of our planes was shot down. We are all aware \nof that.\n  But perhaps what some Members have forgotten is what we did in \nretaliation. My concern had been, in the October 1993 hearing, that we \nwould not respond, that we would give a message that Americans are a \npunching bag and will not punch back. For those Members who have \nforgotten, let me review what happened.\n  They shot down our plane, even though we knew the missiles were there \nand did not cancel the mission. We did not go after the missiles. We \ndid not go after the installation. After the plane was shot down, we \ndid not go after those locations. We did not bomb the bridges that \nbrought those missiles to the front. We did not bomb the supply depots \nwhere they came from.\n  Mr. President, what we did when they shot down our plane was nothing. \nNow, can you come up with reasons for not doing anything? Of course you \ncan. But what I want to call to mind for the Members is this: What kind \nof message do you think that sends to people who would attack American \nforces? Does it encourage them to attack us, thinking we will not fight \nback? What kind of message does it send to the parents of Americans who \nmight die in combat to know that we do not even care enough about our \ntroops to defend them and retaliate when they are attacked?\n  Mr. President, I think the administration was remiss in, one, not \nmaking sure that we moved against installations that would fire SAM \nmissiles against us and, two, when it happened, not following up and \nretaliating against those who did. What you have, in my belief, is a \ncallous disregard for those who wear the uniform of the United States. \nThey deserve to be defended and protected and stood by. It is a mistake \nfor us to put them into combat unless we are willing to stand with \nthem, and that is part of the problem of this mission. It is not \nspeculation; it is what happened in Bosnia already by this \nadministration--Americans were fired on, and the plane was shot down, \nand we turned our back on those who wear our uniform in terms of \nprotecting or defending them.\n  Mr. President, I want to follow up. First, I want to pay tribute to \nthe Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have made an effort to get all the \ninformation I could about this mission, and they have been, frankly, \nquite helpful in responding. They have taken a great deal of their time \nto not only try and respond to the questions, but to be helpful in \nproviding information. I think that is to their credit. I have great \nrespect for all three of them.\n  I want to share with the Senate, specifically, a question and an \nanswer that I had asked because I think it goes to the very heart of \nthis issue of when we stand by our troops when they are in the field.\n  This was submitted to Secretary of State Warren Christopher on \nOctober 17. I received the answer today.\n  Question:\n\n       If we receive information that attacks in violation of the \n     peace agreement by Bosnian Serbs have received the full \n     support of the Serbian government in Belgrade, will we \n     retaliate against Belgrade?\n\n  I think that is a reasonable question. If we know they have been \ninvolved in attacks against our troops, will we retaliate against \nBelgrade, or put them off limits like they did in Vietnam?\n\n       A. Will strikes into Serbia or Croatia, should they violate \n     the terms of the peace agreement, be considered off-limits if \n     the safety of American troops is jeopardized?\n       B. Will our rules of engagement include the authority to \n     take actions to cut off supply lines from Serbia itself?\n       C. Will strikes into Serbia or Croatia, if necessary to \n     ensure the protection of American troops, be authorized?\n\n  That is pretty specific. If they attack us, will we go after those \nwho attacked us?\n  The response is:\n\n       * * * IFOR will have complete freedom of movement \n     throughout Bosnia.\n\n  That is helpful. It does not respond to the question, but I think it \nis helpful.\n  But let me share the response to the more specific aspects:\n\n       IFOR commanders will operate under procedures and rules of \n     engagement that allow them great flexibility in determining \n     the proper response to a violation of the agreement or a \n     threat to IFOR. This would help ensure that violations are \n     dealt with effectively and further violations deterred.\n\n  It goes on in the concluding paragraph, specifically, with regard to \nmy questions as to whether we will go after them if they attack our \ntroops. This is the Secretary of State:\n\n       I cannot speculate now on what the U.S. would or would not \n     do against Serbia or Croatia if it were determined that \n     violations of peace accord were supported from outside Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina. Such decisions would be made based on the \n     particulars of the situation.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to submit that entire question and response so \nthe record is complete.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Question for the Record Submitted to Secretary of State Warren \n   Christopher by Senator Hank Brown, Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n       Question. 5. If we receive information that attacks in \n     violation of the peace agreement by Bosnian Serbs have \n     received the full support of the Serbian (Yugoslav) \n     government in Belgrade, will we retaliate against Belgrade?\n       a. Will strikes into Serbia or Croatia, should they violate \n     the terms of the peace agreement, be considered off-limits if \n     the safety of American troops is jeopardized?\n       b. Will our Rules of Engagement include the authority to \n     take actions to cut off supply lines from Serbia itself?\n       c. Will strikes into Serbia or Croatia, if necessary to \n     ensure the protection of American troops, be authorized?\n       Answer. As specified very clearly in the Dayton agreement, \n     IFOR's mission is to implement the military aspects of that \n     agreement: enforcing the cessation of hostilities, withdrawal \n     to agreed lines, and creation of a zone of separation; and \n     overseeing the return of troops and weapons to cantonments. \n     The forces, their training, their equipment, and their Rules \n     of Engagement (ROE) are geared to these missions. IFOR will \n     have complete freedom of movement throughout Bosnia. This \n     mission will be even-handed. It is important to keep in mind \n     that the parties themselves bear primary responsibility for \n     achieving the peace in Bosnia which they themselves sought, \n     initialled in Dayton on November 21, and will sign in Paris \n     on December 14.\n       IFOR commanders will operate under procedures and rules of \n     engagement that allow them great flexibility in determining \n     the proper response to a violation of the agreement or a \n     threat to IFOR. This would help ensure that violations are \n     dealt with effectively and further violations deterred. \n     IFOR's ROE authorize the use of force, up to and including \n     deadly force, to ensure its own safety and fulfillment of its \n     mission.\n       Obviously, IFOR's mandate and mission focus on Bosnia and \n     Hercegovina. I cannot speculate now on what the United States \n     would or would not do against Serbia or Croatia if it were \n     determined that violations of the peace accord were supported \n     from outside Bosnia and Hercegovina. Such decisions would be \n     made based on the particulars of the situation.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the reason I quote that is because I am \nconcerned about it. I am concerned that, once again, this country will \nsend troops into harm's way and then turn their back on them. Mr. \nPresident, I submit this response of the Secretary of State as some \nindication of what may happen. It is not just the experience we had \nwith the shot down pilot where we did not respond when they shot him \ndown, and we did not go after the surface-to-air missile emplacement--\neven at the start, they were unwilling to give us a commitment that if \nSerbia attacks our troops we will go after them.\n  Mr. President, I believe part of this depends on what Serbs think we \nwill do. If they think if they attack our troops we will ignore it, \nthey will be tempted to take a different course of action than if they \nknow we will respond if they attack us. I think this invites attacks. I \nthink the vagueness of our commitment invites attacks on our troops.\n  Mr. President, I respect the Secretary of State--and I understand how \nhe does not want to be pinned down--but I respectfully suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that this is the problem, a willingness to commit troops, \nand ask them to make the final commitment, in Abraham Lincoln's words \n``without our willingness to stand beside them.''\n  In my book, if you are going to be true to those troops, if you \ncommit them to combat and somebody goes after them, we have an \nobligation to defend them and to go after whoever attacked them. There \nshould be no \n\n[[Page S18427]]\ndoubt about it. That is part of what is wrong with this mission, an \nunwillingness to stand squarely beside young men and women we put in \nharm's way.\n  There is one last aspect I want to mention before closing. I heard \nsome very conscientious, intelligent Members who I have enormous \nrespect for come to this floor and say,\n\n       We think it is a mistake to send troops to Bosnia but the \n     Commander in Chief has made the decision and it is not our \n     role to prohibit him acting as Commander in Chief in \n     dispatching troops.\n\n  They may have said it in a different way, but in its essence it boils \ndown to that--a deference to the President in this regard. The doubt or \nconcern about the decision the President made but a deferring to the \nPresident in terms of the matter of deploying the troops into Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I most sincerely have a different view of the American \nConstitution and frankly of the logic of the governmental process. I do \nnot know how any scholar can read the proceedings of the Constitutional \nConvention, can understand the struggle for independence that this \nNation went through, can understand the cases that have come down from \nthe Supreme Court, and not come to the conclusion that the essence of \nthe American experience in constitutional government is checks and \nbalances.\n  The Founders believed in and perfected the system of checks and \nbalances as effectively as anyone has in the history of the world, and \nthere have been a lot of attempts. To look at the American experience \nand assume the President has unlimited authority to commit our troops \nto combat situations and Congress' only job is to simply go along is to \nmisunderstand the effect of our Constitution.\n  I believe it is quite clear that Congress has a role to play. \nTomorrow we will play that role as we vote. But none of us should be \nunder the impression that the Constitution allows us to duck our \nresponsibility. The truth is, a declaration of war comes from Congress, \nand the ability to control the purse strings comes from Congress.\n  If we turn our back on our responsibilities under the Constitution we \nwill be just as responsible for this unfolding tragedy as the misguided \nPresident who brought it about.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. I listened with interest to the presentation of the \nSenator from Colorado who is now occupying the chair. He delivered it \nwith great passion. That passion stems from his experience of having \nbeen in the fields of Vietnam and having witnessed the kind of policy \nthat we pursued there--in leaving, in many cases, our troops without \neither the military or moral support that they deserved.\n  He spoke with great eloquence and passion, and I think his words \nshould be given serious consideration by all of our colleagues as we \ndeliberate and debate this issue tonight, tomorrow, and beyond.\n  If you watch the evening newscasts, it is very clear our troops are \nheading into Bosnia as we speak. The anchormen are there cataloging the \nvarious vehicles that are rolling by, the numbers of troops, the \nfeelings and sentiments of the men and women who are being sent, the \nreaction on the part of the citizens that they are being sent to help \ndefend. And various commentaries being offered by military leaders who \nhave served in the past as part of the U.N. force.\n  It is interesting to get their different perspectives in terms of \nboth the mission and how long it might be before we complete that \nmission. So our troops are in Bosnia, and we have to ask the questions: \nHow did they get there? What will they do there? When will they leave? \nHow will we ever measure their success?\n  I think it is fairly clear that the road to Bosnia has been paved \nwith good intentions and poor judgment. The road has been littered with \nmistakes. We can point to those in the past. I say that the early \nrecognition on the part of a united Germany of Croatia was one of those \ninitial mistakes. I think the new united Germany at that time was \nfeeling its power, its diplomatic initiative, and that prodded a number \nof countries to follow suit too quickly in recognizing Bosnia-\nHerzegovina.\n  The West fell in line to applaud its--the Germans--diplomatic \ninitiative.\n  When predictable war broke out, the Europeans, who were steeped in \nBalkan history, said it is a local issue. It is really not our problem. \nIt is a domestic civil war. These tribes as such, these factions, have \nbeen making war for centuries. We are not going in.\n  So the United States was not about to intervene where Europeans \nfeared to tread. If we had any inclination to do so, if the Bush \nadministration had any predisposition to going in to helping solve that \nparticular war, it was discouraged from doing so by domestic politics.\n  After all, President Bush had come off of a major victory in the \nPersian Gulf. He was riding very high in the polls at that time but the \ncharges were he was too interested in foreign affairs, he had neglected \ndomestic issues. The Nation was suffering, and therefore he should turn \nhis gaze away from world affairs and concentrate on domestic issues.\n  So if there were any inclination, and I am not sure there was at the \ntime, but if there were any inclination on President Bush's part to \nintervene in any significant way in that war, he was discouraged from \ndoing so.\n  UNPROFOR, the U.N. peacekeeping force was sent in. I have spoken on \nthis floor on a number of occasions, written articles for the \nWashington Post and other publications, suggesting--no, not suggesting, \nbut declaiming, that it was an inappropriate mission for U.N. forces to \nsend blue helmets into that region. It was inappropriate to send these \nbrave, heroic people wearing blue helmets and flak jackets and carrying \nvery light weapons into a region that was so mired in conflict at that \ntime. It was an inappropriate mission for them to perform. It was a \n``Mission Impossible,'' in many ways, for them to perform. But those \nsoldiers performed that mission as well as they could, given their \ncircumstances. But they were put directly in the midst of an ongoing \nwar and asked to keep the peace.\n\n  They were attacked without retaliation. They were taken hostage. They \nwere humiliated by the warring factions who demanded that they pay \ntribute, that they give up half of their fuel, half of their food, half \nof their weapons, whatever it was, to gain access to the starving \npopulation that they were sent to help feed and clothe. They were tied \nto weapons storage sites to prevent any kind of attack by the United \nStates or Western allies.\n  We had the anomalous situation--and the presiding officer, Senator \nBrown, touched upon this--we had the anomalous situation of the \nmilitary leaders on the ground saying, ``Please send in the cavalry, \nsend in air support, attack the people who are attacking us.'' But, of \ncourse, the planes did not come and the relief did not come because \nthey received some hot air excuses from U.N. diplomats who held the \nkeys to the weapons. It was a so-called dual-key arrangement, which \namounted to dual nonsense to those on the ground.\n  So, we watched the situation unfold with heroic blue helmeted \nsoldiers carrying out their mission as best they could, as atrocity was \npiled on atrocity, until we could no longer stand it.\n  The final blow came when the artillery shell was launched into \nSarajevo, killing 69 innocent people and wounding some 200 others. We \ncontinued to watch the evil of ethnic cleansing, and all the while the \nworld stood by, praying for peace while the innocents were slaughtered.\n  There were some in this Chamber, I point specifically to Senator \nDole, the majority leader, who said we should lift the embargo, \nmultilaterally if possible, unilaterally if necessary, and strike, if \nnecessary, in order to prevent the Serbs, at that particular time, from \ncontinuing their assault upon safe havens, so-called safe havens. Lift \nthe embargo and strike, or simply lift the embargo and let them fight. \nAnd on each occasion he was rejected.\n  The administration said no, you cannot do this and you should not do \nthis. Our allies have said no. The President \n\n[[Page S18428]]\nhas said no. The United Nations has said no, it would endanger the \nUNPROFOR forces who are on the ground. By the way, United States, you \ndo not have any forces on the ground so do not be so quick to lift, or \nto lift and strike. It would endanger the UNPROFOR forces, and it would \nlead to more slaughter. And if we should act unilaterally, then NATO \nwould dissolve, the U.N. forces who were there would leave, the United \nStates would no longer have any credibility, and we would endanger the \nother embargoes that exist on Iraq and other countries who have engaged \nin, certainly, unfriendly behavior.\n  So, under the threat that we would endanger NATO, that NATO would \ndissolve, nothing was done. The slaughter continued and the regions \nwere cleansed of their undesirables.\n  Last spring, President Clinton made a pledge to commit up to 20,000, \nperhaps as many as 25,000 troops to aid the extraction of U.N. forces, \nif it became necessary. That really was a shot across the Senate's bow \nat that time, saying, ``If you are going to insist on lifting the \nembargo over the objection of the President, over the objection of our \nallies, over the objection of the United Nations, then I am making a \ncommitment as Commander in Chief. I will commit 20,000 American troops, \nground forces, to help extricate the U.N. forces from that situation.''\n  That was a pledge he made publicly. I think, perhaps to his surprise, \nPresident Dole--strike that for the moment--Senator Dole said, ``I \nagree. If we have to get U.N. peacekeepers out of there in order to \nallow the Bosnian Moslems to defend themselves, that is a decision we \nwill support.''\n  But that was the marker that was laid down. We are going to commit \nU.S. forces on the ground in order to extricate the peacekeepers in the \nevent the United States unilaterally decided to lift the embargo or our \nallies decided the United States was no longer interested in pursuing a \nmultilateral approach and therefore said, ``We are getting out.'' We \nwould help get them out.\n  So, Congress retreated. We retreated on that issue. We waited. We \ndelayed. We debated. We did nothing, until finally we saw one atrocity \ntoo many. We would strike, and we did strike, but we would not lift. \nAnd we saw an immediate reaction once we decided to apply air power. \nThe President sent off his chief negotiator, Secretary Holbrooke, to \nthen hammer out a truce.\n  Again, we hesitated. All of us in this Chamber and the other Chamber \nas well, we hesitated. ``Don't interfere with the President. He \nconducts foreign policy. Don't cut his legs off with a preemptive vote \nof disapproval. Allow him to conduct this effort.'' And we backed away. \nOnce again, we deferred.\n  We deferred because, No. 1, we assumed, or at least thought, perhaps \nthe negotiations will fail on their own weight. Perhaps the \nnegotiations will be unsuccessful. So why should we take action at this \npoint on a preemptive basis to say, no matter what you arrive at in the \nway of negotiation, we disapprove your sending American troops to help \nkeep that truce? So we did nothing at that time.\n  Also, we should be very candid about it, if we had taken so-called \npreemptive action to assert our constitutional authority, our control \nover the purse strings, saying, ``No funds appropriated under this \naccount may be expended for the deployment of ground forces in \nBosnia,'' and the negotiations then failed, Congress did not want to \naccept the blame for it. So we backed away and we waited.\n  Now, I mention this all by way of a preface to the debate over \nconstitutional power. Who has it? Does the President have the \nundiluted, unilateral power to send troops to Bosnia, or does Congress \nhave the power? That is a debate that cannot be resolved and will not \nbe resolved during the course of this particular discussion.\n  Who has the power depends upon who lays claim to it, who takes \npossession of it, who runs with it. I know the Senator from Colorado is \nan attorney, skilled in tax law and real estate law and may recall from \nlaw school days that possession is 90 percent of ownership. Who takes \npossession of the power and runs with it really determines who has it, \nultimately.\n  The fact is, Congress has yielded its powers to the Executive over \nthe years. ``Don't vote to strike. Don't vote to lift. Don't vote to \ndisapprove before the negotiations. Don't vote to disapprove after the \nnegotiations.'' Much of what we say and do really does not matter at \nall, does it? Because the President has said, ``I really am not too \nconcerned about whether you approve or disapprove, because I am going \nanyway. The troops are going in anyway.'' Even if the House and the \nSenate were to vote overwhelmingly to disapprove the sending of \nAmerican troops to Bosnia, the President has already indicated they are \ngoing in any event. ``It is my prerogative. It is my power. I am going \nto keep the commitment I made to the NATO allies and I don't really''--\n  He cares, of course; I am oversimplifying. He cares, but not enough \nto say that he would abide by the decision.\n  As a matter of fact, during hearings in the Armed Services Committee \nlast week, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Holbrooke, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were there to testify, and they \nwere very candid about it. I specifically asked the question: In the \nevent that Congress should pass a resolution disapproving the sending \nof American forces into Bosnia, the President does not intend to be \nbound by that decision, does he?\n  And the answer was a very clear, ``No.''\n  The next question that follows onto that, of course, is, well, what \nif Congress fashions a resolution that imposes certain conditions, or \nseeks to define the mission with greater clarity to remove some of the \nconfusion and the ambiguities that exist in the documents that were \nsigned and negotiated in Dayton? Would the President in any way feel \nconstrained by those conditions? And, of course, ultimately the answer \nis no. Secretary Perry was very clear, very direct. If he felt that any \nresolution passed by the Congress in any way posed a danger to our \ntroops, he obviously would recommend to the President that he not abide \nby it. We got into something of a semantic dual with the Administration \nwitnesses saying they will not ignore it, but they certainly will not \nabide by it.\n  So this entire debate on what we are going to pass in the way of a \nresolution has no ultimate, no practical, consequence in terms of \npreventing the troops from going there. More will be going shortly this \nweek.\n  So, Mr. President, I raise these issues this evening because it is in \nstark contrast to what took place back during the debate on the Persian \nGulf war. I have a whole sheath of notes. I was going to quote from \nspeeches that were made at that time by my colleagues on the other \nside. That might seem to be a bit unfair, hitting below the \nintellectual belt on the eve of a vote. But I sat this afternoon \nreading through their statements, and I was struck by the passion with \nwhich they were delivered, by the intensity of the charges that were \nmade at the time should President Bush ever neglect to come to Congress \nto get its approval. Some suggested he would be impeached, or should be \nimpeached.\n  In all candor, President Bush was not eager to come to the Congress. \nI recall on at least two, possibly three, occasions going to the White \nHouse with a group of Senators and Congressmen standing up in the East \nRoom, and urging the President to come to Congress to get our approval. \nThe President's advisers at that time said, ``He really does not need \nyour approval. He has approval from the United Nations.'' I do not know \nhow many of us have sworn allegiance to the U.N.\n  But we, over a period of time, were able to persuade him that it was \nimportant. I think from a constitutional point of view he had the \nobligation to come to get our approval. But even from a political point \nof view, it was an imperative that he come and get our approval because \nyou should never send American forces into war, or into the danger of a \nwar zone in which they might be forced into war, without the solid \nsupport of the American people. And, if you put our troops in such a \ndangerous position, if you send them off to war without the broad \nsupport of Congress--after all, we reflect the views of our \nconstituents--without that broad consensus, then you can anticipate \nwhat will happen.\n  When people start to die, when they start to be flown back to Dover \nin their \n\n[[Page S18429]]\nflag-draped coffins, CNN cameras will be there to capture that. And the \nhearts that beat so loudly and enthusiastically to do something to \nintervene in areas where there is not an immediate threat to our vital \ninterests, when those hearts that had beaten so loudly see the coffins, \nthen they switch, and they say: ``What are we doing there? Why are our \nyoung men and women dying in that region?'' And the President at that \ntime needs to have the support of the Congress to say, no, once we \ncommit our troops to a region, we have to stand behind them. And the \nworst thing you can do to American credibility--once you send them into \nbattle and the casualties start to mount--is to leave, to quit and \nleave before the mission is completed. That will do more to undermine \nAmerica's credibility as a world power, as a superpower, as a reliable \nally, than anything we could possibly do.\n  So that is the reason it is important, it is critical, for a \nPresident to build the support for the deployment prior to making the \ndecision--not the inverse, not putting the troops there first and then \ncoming back and getting support. You have to build the support, give \nthe reasons, persuade the American people that it is our solemn duty \nand responsibility to take action. And when people start dying, when \nsons and daughters start dying, we are still going to carry through on \nthe mission. If he does not do that, then he is going to be naked unto \nhis enemies, because the fact of the matter is, unless you have \nCongress on record in support of such action, when the public turns \nCongress will be in full pursuit. And that will not bring credit to \nthis institution. It will not bring credit to the United States.\n  That is why I urged at that time President Bush to come to the \nCongress. He did so, and he was able by a very thin margin to persuade \nthe Senate and the House--a larger margin in the House but a very thin \nmargin here in the Senate--that it was in our national security \ninterest to see to it that Saddam Hussein did not remain in Kuwait, and \nthat he did not stand astride the oil fields of the Middle East and \nthreaten to go all the way to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.\n  We talked about the implications of a tyrant, a dictator of his \nmagnitude, standing astride the oil fields and what it would mean to \ninternational stability. We talked about his having biological weapons, \nchemical weapons, and, yes, even a nuclear capability and the \npossibility of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBM's. \nAnd still we were only able to persuade a few Members on the other side \nthat it was important that he be removed from Kuwait by force.\n  I mention all of that tonight because the mood has changed, and the \nrhetoric has changed. Suddenly we see a support coming forth for the \nPresident of the United States on a bipartisan basis thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Dole, Senator Lieberman, and others--Senator \nMcCain. It was not a bipartisanship that was shared during the Persian \nGulf war even though there was a much greater identifiable national \nsecurity interest there than there is in Bosnia. This is much closer to \na humanitarian interest and a potential national security interest. But \nit is hardly of the magnitude and the immediacy as posed by the Persian \nGulf war.\n  So what do we do at this point? They are over there. More will be \nthere later this week. What we have to do is to lend our support to the \ntroops. We are not going to undercut them at this point as they are \ngoing into a very dangerous mission. We intend to support them but to \ndo so in a way that makes it clear why they are going, what they will \ndo, and when they and we will know that it is time to come home.\n  So we talk about exit strategies--code word, ``exit strategy.'' \nBasically it means defining what the mission is; defining the mission \nso you can measure success, so you can say at the end of their tour of \nduty that the commitment they made was exactly worth the price they are \nbeing asked to pay in order to achieve a certain identifiable goal.\n  There is some confusion about this. And that is why this debate is \nimportant. That is why it is important that we pass a resolution being \nas definitive as we can, even if the President is going to ignore it. \nWhatever we say, it is important that we try to define what we believe \nthe application is, and should be.\n  Secretary Warren Christopher made a statement while in Dayton, and he \nindicated--at least to me the statement indicated--that the mission was \nto ``assure the continuity of the single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nwith effective federal institutions and full respect of its sovereignty \nby its neighbors.'' Mr. President, no such state has ever existed. What \nhe was saying is that we are about to build a nation upon the ashes of \na failed nation. No such nation ever existed for any period of time. \nAlmost simultaneous with its recognition as a separate state, war broke \nout. There has been no single separate state with effective federal \ninstitutions whose sovereignty is respected by all neighbors on all \nsides.\n  So is this going to be our mission? We raise this issue. The answer \nis no. That is not our mission.\n  That is nation building, but nation building is not something we are \nsupposed to be sending our troops to do. So there is to be no nation \nbuilding. That apparently is clear. There will be no resettlement of \nrefugees under the aegis of American Forces. That is not going to be \nour task. There will be no organization or monitoring of elections. \nThat is not our task.\n  In fact, there will be no hunt for war criminals. You may recall that \nPresident Clinton indicated he thought those who have been charged with \ncommitting atrocities should be brought to justice. In fact, he \ndeclared they would be brought to justice--Karadzic, Mladic, to name \ntwo. Are we going to hunt them down? Well, not exactly. If they happen \nto wander into the area of Tuzla or the areas that we will be \npatrolling, if we happen to stumble across them in that region, then \nobviously we can grab and apprehend them and bring them to justice. But \nthat is not going to be our mission. We are not going to hunt down war \ncriminals. And so that also has to be excluded as part of the mission \nof our young men and women.\n  There are side agreements, annexes, which have caused me some concern \nand some need to seek clarification. Apparently a part of our effort, \ncontained in Annex 1-B, has to do with something called build-down. We \nare going to seek an arms build-down in the region.\n  Now, I have taken issue with this publicly because it is a complete \nmisuse of the term ``build-down.'' Build-down was a phrase that was \ncoined back in 1983 referring to a proposal Senator Nunn and I \ndeveloped. Beginning with an article I wrote for The Washington Post \nJanuary, 1983, that talked about how we could force reductions in \nnuclear forces as we modernized them to make them more survivable, more \nmobile. We needed to have a more stable relationship with the Soviet \nUnion, and therefore we wanted to get rid of these fixed, big targets \nthat they had and we had. And one way to do that was to have more \nmobility and fewer numbers, and so we formulated a concept saying, for \nevery one new missile we put into our inventory, we take two old ones \nout. And that is where the phrase ``build-down'' came from.\n  Well, we are not really seeking to put new modern weapons into the \nregion and build them down on a 2-for-1 basis. That is the phrase that \nhas been used. We will use it for convenience sake, but it has no \nrelationship to the actual reality of what we are seeking to do. What \nwe are seeking to do is have the parties in the region reduce their \narms.\n  Now, if you or I, Mr. President, were negotiating an arms control \ntreaty with any of the parties involved that directly affected our \nsecurity, we would never sign this agreement. We would be run out of \noffice on a rail were we to sign such an agreement, because in essence \nit relies not upon verification, not upon independent assessments but \nupon the declarations of the parties. We are going to rely upon the \nSerbs to tell us how many weapons they have and where they are, and the \nCroatians and the Moslems, all to make a good-faith statement of the \nweapons they have in their inventory, and then we will see if we cannot \nhelp to negotiate a relative builddown, arms reduction to equal or \nsemi-equal levels.\n  We have asked people in the business of making these kinds of \njudgments--former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, former \nNational Security Council Adviser Brent Scowcroft, \n\n[[Page S18430]]\nformer Defense Under Secretary Paul Wolfowitz--would you trust any of \nthese individuals to declare their inventory, would you rely upon that? \nBrent Scowcroft said he would not trust any of them. I do not know how \nmany here would trust any of them. The history is not replete with \naccurate assessments and declarations made by any of the individuals \ninvolved, any of the leaders, any of the troops.\n  Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, in fact, is renowned for having \nhundreds, if not thousands, of underground caves and caches where \nthousands of weapons are stored. So now they are going to say, we have \nthem all stored in X, Y and Z and you can go in and take a head count \nfor yourself and we will agree to build down.\n  Very few people believe that is going to be possible. So the next \nquestion is, well, if we cannot really guarantee that there is going to \nbe an arms reduction that will result in some sort of military \nequilibrium, then we have an obligation to see to it that the Bosnian \nMoslems are put in a position that, when we leave, they will be capable \nof defending themselves. Well, that means we are going to arm them in \nthe alternative.\n  What the resolution of Senator Dole, Senator McCain, Senator \nLieberman, and others says is we really have that wrong. If you are \ntalking about an exit strategy, the best we can hope to do is maintain \na truce, a cease-fire for a year--I will talk about the year's \ntimeframe in just a moment. That is the best we can hope to do. And \nduring that time, we have to see to it that the Moslems are going to be \nin a position to defend themselves when we leave, if war should break \nout. Otherwise, we cannot declare that we have been successful in our \nmission.\n  If I had my druthers on this, I would do it in reverse. I would say, \nlet us put the parties in a relative state of equilibrium now, let us \nbuild up the Bosnian forces now and then see if we can get them to \nagree to reduce to roughly equal levels and then leave. At least you \nwould have a real incentive at that particular point for everybody to \nnegotiate in good faith.\n  Right now, we know from listening to the administration and to others \nthat the Bosnian Serbs do not want us to arm the Moslems. The Croatians \ndo not want us to arm the Moslems. Our NATO allies do not want us to \narm the Moslems. Article after article is now being written: Do not arm \nthe Moslems; they have plenty. And, by the way, you do not want to \nupset the stability that has been achieved.\n  That is one of the areas that we have to remove in terms of our \npolicy. Are we going to use fig leaf phrases to hide our naked \nambiguities? Is that what we are about? Saying, well, we have this \ncommitment on the side and a lot of opposition to it, so let us put it \nout there. In the event we do not get the arms reduction, we will see \nto it they are able to defend themselves.\n  Well, how and who? Who is going to provide the weapons? Under what \ncircumstances, under whose aegis? Are we really fooling anyone? I \nquoted from a soul singer recently: Who is zooming who? Who are we \nzooming when we say we are totally neutral on this mission, that we are \nevenhanded and neutral and not favoring one side or the other? We ought \nto be up front about it. I know that causes concern for many, saying if \nwe in fact are going over to help make sure the Bosnian Moslems can \ndefend themselves, when we leave we are putting ourselves in danger.\n  That may be the case. That may be the case. But I would submit to \nyou, Mr. President, and to my colleagues, leaving this in a state of \nsuspended ambiguity also puts our troops in danger. We have to be very \nclear of what we are about. And so the resolution that will be offered \ntomorrow will in fact seek to define that our goal is to make sure that \nat the end of this period of time, be it 12 months or longer or less, \nwhen we leave, the Moslems will be in a position to at least be on a \nrelatively equal playing field.\n  Now, is it going to be 12 months or not? Our colleague, Senator \nWarner, asked a very important question during the hearings last week. \nHe suggested to Secretary Perry that he was troubled by the 12-month \ntimeframe; there seemed to be some political overtones to that.\n  Let me say here, as I said before during the hearings, not for a \nmoment do I think that President Clinton made the decision to send \ntroops into Bosnia for any political purpose. There is absolutely no \npolitical benefit that I can perceive that will come from that \ndecision. There is not much of an up side, as we say in politics, from \nthat kind of decision. A lot of down side to it. And so he is taking a \nvery big risk. He is exercising what he believes to be leadership in \nthe correct direction. We can challenge that or question that, but he \nis exercising leadership coming from the Oval Office.\n  And so I do not for a moment question his motivation. I think he is \ndoing it because he thinks it is the right thing to do, which is not to \nsay there will not be political implications and overtones come next \nSeptember and October. It is an election year.\n  Hopefully--and we are going to pray on this and hope on this and be \nprepared for this--but hopefully we will never have a major \nconfrontation between any of the major parties and U.S. troops. It \nwould be an act of folly on their part in terms of the firepower we can \nbear.\n  But that is not the kind of conflict we can anticipate. If there are \ngoing to be any attacks launched against the NATO forces, U.S. troops \nin particular--and we assume there will be efforts to try to see how \nthin or wide our patience is going to be--they will come in the form of \nterrorist attacks, they will come in the form of landmines, they will \ncome in the form of car bombs like we saw in Beirut, they will come in \nthe form of a sniper's bullet. Those are the kinds of things that we \ncan anticipate will take place.\n  Should we start to suffer significant casualties between now and next \nSeptember or October, then obviously the President will be under \npressure to pull the troops out. So I raised the issue with Secretary \nPerry. And to his credit, he was absolutely direct. He did not try to \ncircumvent and he did not try to hedge and he did not fudge or try to \nengage in any kind of obfuscation. He simply responded to my question.\n  I said: Is it unreasonable for me to assume that come next October a \ntranche of 2,500 troops will be coming home? He said: Not at all. In \nfact, they intend to start bringing the troops home next October, \nNovember, and December.\n  So, really, it is not a truly 12-month mission, it is going to be, at \nleast partially, a 9-month mission. I raised the 9 months because \nSecretary Perry said in response to Senator Warner: ``Nine or ten \nmonths would have been a time one could have been quite suspicious \nabout. But let me assure you that the question never came to me, it was \nnever raised to me by the President, of lowering this time from 12 down \nto 9 or 10 months.''\n  So, now at least we understand the troops will be coming home in \nSeptember or October or certainly by November or December. I say that. \nIt is a reality. It does not question the President's motivation in \nsending them in. But it raises the issue, if we are really planning on \nthat kind of a strategy of getting them out starting in September or \nOctober, then that really does accelerate the timeframe in terms of \nwhat we have to do in order to complete the mission.\n  So we have to be very clear on what we are seeking to do. If you ask \nany other U.N. commander who has been in that region and say we will be \nout of there in 12 months, not to mention 9 months, they will shake \ntheir head and say, ``No, no.'' The President of France said that we \nwill be there for 20 years. A Canadian commander who has been there as \npart of the UNPROFOR forces has said that our grandchildren will be \nthere, if we really are serious about carrying out a mission to help \nbuild a nation.\n  But, of course, that is not what we are going to do. We are simply \ngoing to maintain a cease-fire to keep the warring parties apart for a \nperiod of 9 months-plus.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not take any longer this evening to discuss \nthis issue. It is getting late. It is not much of an audience that is \ngoing to be influenced by whatever I say this evening. But I do think \nit is important to try to spell out what we believe to be the goal of \nour forces there, that we make it as clear to the American people as we \ncan, so that if things go awry, if things do not work out as the \nadministration hopes and we pray they work out, that \n\n[[Page S18431]]\nwe will at least have defined what we believe the mission to have been \nand, hopefully, shape the administration's thought process on this so \nit does not get expanded.\n  We are worried about mission creep, that once we get there, once an \nincident starts to take place, once bullets start flying, once there is \nan action and reaction, once someone is attacked and we respond, that \nwe do not start engaging in mission creep and start to indulge \nourselves with the added burdens that will come about under that kind \nof pressure.\n  The Chinese leader Mao said, ``Power comes out of the end of a gun \nbarrel.'' Power in this country does not come at the end of a gun \nbarrel; it comes at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill. \nPower, as I suggested before, belongs to whomever claims it and \nexercises it.\n  Congress has chosen not to claim the power of deciding when to deploy \nAmerican forces when our Nation is not under attack and when our vital \nnational interests are not immediately at stake. So, we are where we \nare because we were not willing to risk the consequences of action. We \nhave deferred, we have debated, we have waited, we have talked, and we \nhave let the President take us to where we are today.\n  So our duty, as I see it, is now to define the role that our men and \nwomen must now play.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18407-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROHIBITION ON FUNDS FOR BOSNIA DEPLOYMENT\n\n  Mr. COHEN.

RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. \nRichard C. Halverson, our friend and our Chaplain who served the Senate \nwith distinction for 14 years. Dr. Halverson was a shining example for \nus all--he embodied all that we seek to be in the eyes of our families, \nour friends, the Americans we serve, and of course, God.\n  George Bernard Shaw once wrote: ``There is only one religion, though \nthere are a hundred versions of it.'' Mr. President, I would say this \nis a fitting description of the community Dr. Halverson so gracefully \nministered. There are as many different opinions in this Senate as \nthere are Senators. Yet Dr. Halverson, in his kind and gentle manner, \nwas always able to provide the individual counsel and insight that \nhelped us reach decisions on issues both monumental and mundane. Amid \nthe busy hustle and bustle of events here in the Senate, it is not \ndifficult to lose grounding, and it becomes ever more important to \nremember our place in the universe. Dr. Halverson, through his daily \nprayers, helped us to keep our perspective.\n  Of course, Dr. Halverson served all the Senate employees, and those \nwho knew him loved him just as much as he loved them. He was always \navailable to help and guide people in need, people in pain, or people \nwho just needed to talk.\n  But Dr. Halverson's work extended far beyond the United States Senate \nand the Capitol dome. He was minister to the Fourth Presbyterian Church \nin Bethesda, leader of the prayer breakfast movement and World Vision, \nand deeply involved in several other evangelical organizations. Dr. \nHalverson reached out to many, and he will be sorely missed.\n  I want to extend to his family my condolences, and during this \ndifficult time wish for them the hope and strength that Dr. Halverson \ninspired in all who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18431-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DR. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, tomorrow there will be a memorial \nservice for the late Reverend Dr. Richard Halverson. I want to take \nthis opportunity to express my sorrow and sadness over the passing of \nthis man who served not only as Chaplain of the Senate for 14 years, \nbut also as model of the Christian life.\n  Dr. Halverson came to the Senate after serving churches in Missouri, \nCalifornia, and Maryland. His leadership of World Vision, the Campus \nCrusade for Christ, Christian College Consortium, and the prayer \nbreakfast movement, established him as a world-renowned figure.\n  But I always think of him as the Senate family Chaplain. He did not \nmerely try to give guidance and wisdom to Senators. He served all in \nthe Senate, including the family members of staffers at all levels of \nthe Senate.\n  In moments of great stress, I know many Senators turned to Dr. \nHalverson for guidance and counsel. And every day, when Dr. Halverson \nopened proceedings with the prayer, he gave us strength and perspective \nin understanding the responsibilities we hold as Senators.\n  I am proud to have known Dr. Halverson and can truly say that I will \nmiss him. I know that his family can be comforted in knowing that today \nhe is with God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18431-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before discussing today's bad news about \nthe Federal debt, how about ``another go'', as the British put it, with \nour pop quiz. Remember--one question, one answer.\n  The question: How many millions of dollars in a trillion? While you \nare thinking about it, bear in mind that it was the U.S. Congress that \nran up the enormous Federal debt that is now about $12 billion shy of \n$5 trillion.\n  To be exact, as of the close of business yesterday, December 11, the \ntotal Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $4,988,568,481,765.63. \nAnother depressing figure means that on a per capita basis, every man, \nwoman and child in America owes $18,936.69.\n  Mr. President, back to our quiz (how many million in a trillion?): \nThere are a million million in a trillion, which means that the Federal \nGovernment will shortly owe five million million dollars.\n  Now who's in favor of balancing the Federal budget?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18431-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18431-S18433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ERNIE BOYER--A GIANT IN EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the death of Ernie Boyer last week has \ndeprived the Nation of one of its greatest leaders in education. \nThroughout his long and distinguished career, Ernie was unsurpassed as \na champion of education, and I am saddened by the loss of a good friend \nand great colleague.\n  In the history of modern American education, Ernie Boyer was a \nconstant leader, working to expand and improve \n\n[[Page S18432]]\neducational opportunities for all Americans. His breadth and depth of \nknowledge and experience in all areas of education was unsurpassed.\n  As Commissioner of Education under President Carter, he helped to \nfocus the attention of the entire Nation on these critical issues. He \nwrote numerous books in support of improvements in elementary, \nsecondary, and higher education. He was a key member of many national \ncommissions, and was a constant source of wisdom and counsel to all of \nus in Congress concerned about these issues.\n  Ernie once said he wished he could live to be 200, because he had so \nmany projects to complete. He accomplished more for the Nation's \nstudents, parents, and teachers in his 67 years than anyone else could \nhave done in 200 years. They may not know his name, but millions of \npeople--young and old--have better lives today because of Ernie Boyer. \nEducation has lost its best friend.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article about Ernie \nBoyer from the New York Times and excerpts from the Current Biography \nYearbook 1988 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 9, 1995]\n\n       Ernest L. Boyer, who helped to shape American education as \n     Chancellor of the State University of New York, as United \n     States Commissioner of Education and as President of the \n     Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, died \n     yesterday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 67.\n       Dr. Boyer had been treated for lymphoma for nearly three \n     years, his assistant, Bob Hochstein, said.\n       Dr. Boyer also was the author of a number of reports for \n     the Carnegie Foundation, a nonprofit policy study center in \n     Princeton that has often set the nation's education agenda.\n       In 1987, when he detected that one of the major ills of \n     higher education was that research was elbowing aside \n     teaching, he wrote, ``College: The Undergraduate Experience \n     in America'' (Harper & Row), in which he argued that ``at \n     every research university, teaching should be valued as \n     highly as research.'' The book stimulated the present college \n     movement that holds that much research is pointless and even \n     harmful insofar as it distracts teachers from students.\n       In 1990, Dr. Boyer developed this theme in another book, \n     ``Scholarship Reconsidered'' (Carnegie Foundation), in which \n     he maintained that teaching, service and the integration of \n     knowledge across disciplines should be recognized as the \n     equal of research.\n       Another of his reports, ``High School: A Report on \n     Secondary Education'' (Harper & Row, 1983), had an impact \n     even before it was published. When officials at the United \n     States Department of Education learned that Dr. Boyer, a \n     former Federal Commissioner of Education, was working on a \n     report describing the inadequacies of secondary public \n     education and proposing a series of changes, they decided to \n     start their own study, which came to be called ``A Nation at \n     Risk.''\n       Published a few months ahead of Dr. Boyer's report, ``A \n     Nation at Risk'' was frequently described as a national wake-\n     up call, spelling out the failure of the public high schools \n     to provide students with basic knowledge and skills.\n       Dr. Boyer's report helped focus the ensuing discussion on \n     specific plans like raising requirements for high school \n     graduation, improving teacher certification and lengthening \n     the school day.\n       Because the Carnegie study had been underwritten by a \n     sizeable grant from the Atlantic Richfield Foundation, Dr. \n     Boyer was able to back up his ideas with financial rewards \n     and incentives. In 1983, he dispersed $600,000 to 200 schools \n     that were seen to be striving for ``excellence'' and two \n     years later, he awarded grants of $25,000 to $50,000 to 25 \n     high schools that were perceived to have improved their \n     curriculums, teacher training and community ties.\n       Dr. Boyer believed the nation's most urgent education \n     problem was high schools. Pointing to the high dropout rate \n     among minorities, he expressed fear that ``the current move \n     to add more course requirements will lead to more failure \n     among inner-city students unless we also have smaller \n     classes, better counseling and more creative teaching.''\n       He also felt that education improvements were bypassing too \n     many impoverished children, with consequences for the future \n     of the country. He advocated programs in nutrition, prenatal \n     care for teen-age mothers, and more day care with summer \n     classes and preschool education.\n       Among his other books, whose titles reflected his concerns, \n     were ``Campus Life'' (1990), ``Ready to Learn'' (1991) and \n     ``The Basic School'' (1995), all published by the Carnegie \n     Foundation.\n       Dr. Boyer had been working on a book, ``Scholarship \n     Assessed,'' in which he was attempting to establish a means \n     of measuring successful teaching and service so that they \n     could be better rewarded.\n       In a statement released yesterday, President Clinton said: \n     ``The nation has lost of its most dedicated and influential \n     education reformers. Ernest Boyer was a distinguished scholar \n     and educator whose work will help students well into the next \n     century.''\n       A compelling orator who never tired of his role as an \n     evangelist of education, Dr. Boyer was a sought-after \n     lecturer on such issues as the need for adult education away \n     from a campus, overbearing academic management (\"Bureaucratic \n     mandates from above can, in the end, produce more confusion \n     than programs\"), and the decline of teaching civics and \n     government in schools (\"Civics illiteracy is spreading, and \n     unless we educate ourselves as citizens, we run the risk of \n     drifting unwittingly into a new Dark Age\").\n       He was also a busy consultant, in recent years having \n     advised governments like the People's Republic of China on \n     educational policy.\n       Ernest LeRoy Boyer was born in Dayton, Ohio, on Sept. 13, \n     1928, one of the three sons of Clarence and Ethel Boyer. His \n     father managed a wholesale book store and ran a mail-order \n     greeting-card and office-supply business from the basement of \n     the family home. Dr. Boyer once said that the most \n     influential figure in his early life was his paternal \n     grandfather, William Boyer, who was head of the Dayton \n     Mission of the Brethren in Christ Church and who directed him \n     toward ``a people-centered life.''\n       Dr. Boyer attended Greenville College, a small liberal arts \n     school in Illinois, and went on to study at Ohio State \n     University. He received his master's and doctoral degrees \n     from the University of Southern California. He was a post-\n     doctoral fellow in medical audiology at the University of \n     Iowa Hospital.\n       He then taught and served in administrative posts at Loyola \n     University in Los Angeles, Upland College and the University \n     of California at Santa Barbara. At Upland College, he \n     introduced a widely emulated program in which the mid-year \n     term, the month of January, became a period in which students \n     did not attend classes but pursued individual projects. It \n     was at Upland that he decided to devote his career to \n     educational administration.\n       In 1965, he moved east to join the vast SUNY system as its \n     first executive dean. Five years later, he became Chancellor \n     of the institution and its 64 campuses, 350,000 students and \n     15,000 faculty members.\n       His 7-year term was a period of innovation. He founded the \n     Empire State College at Saratoga Springs and four other \n     locations as noncampus SUNY schools at which adults could \n     study for degrees without attending classes. He also set up \n     an experimental three-year Bachelor of Arts program; \n     established a new rank, Distinguished Teaching Professor, to \n     reward faculty members of educational distinction as well as \n     research, and established one of the first student-exchange \n     programs with the Soviet Union.\n       Dr. Boyer served on commissions to advise President Richard \n     M. Nixon and President Gerald R. Ford. In 1977, he left SUNY \n     after President Jimmy Carter appointed him to lead the United \n     State Commission on Education, thus becoming the agency's \n     last Commissioner before Congress elevated the position to \n     cabinet rank.\n       Toward the end of the Carter Administration, disappointed \n     that Congress had failed to elevate the Commission on \n     Education to a cabinet-level department, Dr. Boyer accepted \n     an invitation to succeed Alan Pifer as president of the \n     Carnegie Foundation. He expanded the scope of his position to \n     go beyond the study of higher education and to study \n     education at every level, bringing the resources of the \n     foundation to bear on the earliest years of a child's \n     education.\n       Even when confined to a hospital bed last month, Dr. Boyer \n     continued to keep up on developments in education, reacting \n     to an announcement by the University of Rochester that it was \n     downsizing both its student body and faculty in order to \n     improve quality and attract better students.\n       ``I think we're headed into a totally new era,'' he said. \n     ``After World War II, we built a nation of institutions of \n     higher learning based on expansion. Research was everything, \n     and undergraduates were marginalized. Now, time is running \n     out on that.''\n       Later in November, responding to the appointment of William \n     M. Bulger, the longtime president of the Massachusetts State \n     Senate, as President of the University of Massachusetts, Dr. \n     Boyer deplored the trend of naming prominent politicians to \n     lead colleges and universities.\n       ``It is disturbing to see university leaders chosen on the \n     basis of their political strengths,'' Dr. Boyer said. ``A \n     university president with strong academic credentials is a \n     symbolic figure who can speak out on the great issues in a \n     way that a political leader cannot.''\n       ``If you appoint political figures to these offices,'' he \n     continued, ``you have more political voices being heard, but \n     they're being heard already. You need the other voices. \n     Without the voices with strong academic credentials behind \n     them, you can even imagine a time in the future when a \n     politicized university administration and a politicized board \n     of trustees would be hugely impatient with academic \n     freedom.''\n       Dr. Boyer held more than 130 honorary degrees, including \n     the Charles Frankel Prize in the Humanities, a Presidential \n     citation.\n       He is survived by his wife Kathryn, and four children, \n     Ernest Jr., of Brookline, \n\n[[Page S18433]]\n     Mass., Beverly Coyle of Princeton, N.J., Craig of Belize and Paul, of \n     Chestertown, MD.\n\n                 [From Current Biography Yearbook 1988]\n\n                            Boyer, Ernest L.\n\n       Sept. 13, 1928- Educator. Address: b. Carnegie Foundation \n     for the Advancement of Teaching, 5 Ivy Lane, Princeton, N.J. \n     08540; h. 222 Cherry Valley Rd., Princeton, N.J. 08540.\n       One of the most influential and respected members of the \n     American educational establishment is Ernest Boyer, who since \n     1970 has served successively as chancellor of the vast State \n     University of New York (SUNNY), as United States commissioner \n     of education, and as president of the prestigious Carnegie \n     Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Along the way, he \n     has managed to accumulate more than sixty awards, \n     trusteeships, and honorary degrees. Since 1983 he has been \n     Senior Fellow of the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton \n     University. As the head of the Carnegie Foundation, he \n     automatically assures that any topic he may choose to address \n     will achieve a prominent place on the national educational \n     agenda.\n       Boyer's concerns range beyond the confines of the classroom \n     to such urgent issues as the need for child care in the \n     workplace and for adult education away from the campus. Under \n     his leadership, the Carnegie Foundation has issued two major \n     critical studies, both written by him, on American high \n     schools and colleges. Boyer is now training his sights on the \n     earliest years of a child's education, including \n     prekindergarten, as the target of the next important project \n     of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. * \n     * *\n       While a graduate student Boyer worked as a teaching \n     assistant at the University of Southern California and as an \n     instructor at Upland College, where he became chairman of the \n     speech department. After a year spent at Loyola University \n     (Los Angeles), where he was director of forensics, he became \n     professor of speech pathology and audiology and academic dean \n     at Upland in 1956. His postgraduate research in medical \n     audiology confirmed the effectiveness of a new surgical \n     technique for treating otosclerosis, a disease of the middle \n     ear.\n       In 1960, reaching what he later recalled as one of the \n     ``crucial crossroads'' in his life, Boyer switched from \n     teaching and research to administration when he accepted a \n     position with the Western College Association. The California \n     Board of Education had ordered all public schoolteachers to \n     obtain a degree in an academic discipline--a decision that \n     proved to be unpalatable to teachers' colleges--and Boyer was \n     appointed director of the commission that was charged with \n     carrying out the directive. Two years later, he became \n     director of the Center for Coordinated Education at the \n     University of California at Santa Barbara, administering \n     projects to improve the quality of education from \n     kindergarten to college.\n       In 1965 Boyer moved east to Albany, New York, joining the \n     State University of New York as its first executive dean for \n     university-wide activities--a title created especially for \n     him. In that position he developed an impressive range of \n     intercampus programs, including one providing for scholars-\n     in-residence and another that established the SUNY \n     chancellor's student cabinet. He became vice-chancellor of \n     SUNY in 1968, a post in which he presided over large staff \n     meetings, moderated discussions, and summarized them for \n     Chancellor Samuel Gould, to whom he also made \n     recommendations. Boyer's colleagues praised him for his \n     organizational ability, and one university official \n     described him as ``an unassuming man with a firm streak. \n     He's nobody's patsy. But he is a good listener.''\n       On July 30, 1970, Boyer was appointed to succeed the \n     retiring Samuel Gould as the administrative head of a complex \n     system of sixty-four campuses, hundreds of thousands of \n     students, and about 15,000 faculty members. In his inaugural \n     address' which he delivered on April 6, 1971, Boyer proposed \n     that as many as 10 percent of the freshman class of 1972 be \n     allowed to take an experimental three-year program leading to \n     a degree. That initiative was adopted at several SUNY \n     institutions within the year. He also called for the creation \n     of the new rank of university teacher. His proposal was acted \n     upon in 1973 with the introduction of the new rank of \n     distinguished teaching professor in order to reward \n     educational distinction as well as research.\n       Also quickly put into effect was the establishment of \n     Empire State College, in response to a directive from the \n     SUNY board of trustees to Boyer to investigate new methods of \n     education that would enable mature students to pursue a \n     degree program without having to spend their full time on \n     campus. Such a program, as Boyer noted, would have the \n     advantage of avoiding heavy construction and maintenance \n     costs. Empire State College was established in 1971 with a \n     small faculty core at Saratoga Springs, and with leased \n     faculty at four other locations. Under the general guidance \n     of a faculty member, students were able to work for a degree \n     without attending classes, by means of reading, listening to \n     tapes, watching television, following previously prepared \n     lesson plans, traveling, or doing field work. * * *\n       Just before the inauguration of Jimmy Carter as president \n     of the United States, Boyer was named federal commissioner of \n     education, responsible for administering education programs \n     involving billions of dollars. The appointment appeared to be \n     ideal for Boyer, even though it meant taking a pay cut from \n     $67,000 to $47,500 a year, since Carter had been the first \n     presidential candidate ever endorsed by the National \n     Education Association and was on record as favoring a \n     cabinet-level department of education. The new department was \n     not established until 1980, however, and in the meantime \n     Boyer found himself under a boss--Secretary of Health, \n     Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr.--who did not \n     welcome independence from his subordinates and opposed the \n     creation of a department that would diminish how own agency. \n     * * *\n       In October 1978 unnamed sources confirmed that Boyer had \n     accepted the position of president of the Carnegie Foundation \n     for the Advance of Teaching, beginning in 1980. * * *\n       At the Carnegie Foundation, Boyer took the helm of an \n     organization that, in 1985, held income-producing assets \n     worth more than $35 million. ``My top priority at Carnegie,'' \n     he told George Neill in an interview for Phi Delta Kappan \n     (October 1979), ``will be efforts to reshape the American \n     high school and its relationship with higher education. . . . \n     I'm convinced that the high school is the nation's most \n     urgent education problem.''\n       On September 15, 1983, Boyer released the results of a $1 \n     million, fifteen-month study of the nation's high schools \n     that was conducted by twenty-eight prominent educators, each \n     of whom visited high schools in several cities. The report \n     estimated that although 15 percent of American high school \n     students were getting ``the finest education in the world,'' \n     about twice that number merely mark time or drop out and that \n     the remainder were attending schools ``where pockets of \n     excellence can be found but where there is little \n     intellectual challenge.'' Among the study's recommendations \n     were adoption of a ``core curriculum'' for all students, \n     designation of mastery of the English language, including \n     writing, as the central curriculum objective for all \n     students, requiring mastery of a foreign language for all \n     students, a gradual increase in teachers' pay of 25 percent, \n     after making up for inflation, and mandatory community \n     service for students as a requirement for graduation.\n       The report was issued in book form as High School: A Report \n     on Secondary Education in America (Harper & Row, 1983), with \n     Boyer and the Carnegie Foundation listed as its authors. The \n     academic book-reviewing publication Choice (January 1984) \n     called it ``an important contribution to the coming \n     educational policy debate of the 1980's,'' and, in \n     Commonwealth (April 20, 1984), the reviewer John Ratte wrote, \n     ``It is not damning with faint praise to say that Ernest \n     Boyer's book is remarkably clear and well written for a \n     commission study report.'' Andrew Hacker, writing in the New \n     York Review of Books (April 12, 1984), assessed the report as \n     ``less a research project than Boyer's own book'' and \n     credited him with trying ``to define how education can \n     contribute to a more interesting and thoughtful life--and not \n     just a more competitive one.''\n       In his follow-up interviews and speeches, Boyer stressed \n     the urgent need for better teaching in American high schools. \n     He told Susan Reid of People magazine (March 17, 1986) that \n     ``by 1990, 30 percent of all children in the public schools \n     will be minorities,'' noted the high dropout rate among \n     minorities, and expressed the fear that ``the current move to \n     add more course requirements will lead to more failure among \n     inner-city students, unless we also have smaller classes, \n     better counseling, and more creative teaching. . . . To my \n     mind, teaching is the nub of the whole problem. . . . All \n     other issues are secondary.'' * * *\n       In December 1987 Boyer and Owen B. Butler, vice-chairman of \n     the Committee for Economic Development, addressed the \n     University/Urban Schools National Task Force, organized by \n     the City University of New York. The two leaders noted that \n     the movement for educational change was bypassing many \n     impoverished children, with consequences that could threaten \n     the future of the United States. To alleviate the situation, \n     Boyer proposed, among other things, improvements in \n     nutrition, prenatal care for teenage mothers more effective \n     day care, including summer programs, and preschool education.\n       The success of Ernest Boyer's career owes much to a work \n     week that customarily extends to eighty or ninety hours. \n     Although he is a quick study who is adept at drawing out \n     other people and grasping their ideas, he rarely advances \n     into the firing line, preferring to stay a half step behind \n     some of his peers. ``He has an unusual ability to bring \n     people together,'' a former colleague told a reporter for the \n     New York Times [March 16, 1977]. ``It's a gift for finding \n     consensus among a diverse group of people where none appeared \n     to exit.'' * * *\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18431-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18433-S18437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REARRANGING FLOWERS ON THE COFFIN\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we are now in the final days of the 1st \nsession of the 104th Congress. In a short while we will have worked out \nsome accommodations on the budget. We must do this, for we will now be \nengaged in the establishment of some measure of peace and lawful \nconduct in the Balkans. It would be unforgivable if we put our military \nin harm's way abroad without first getting our affairs in some minimal \norder here at home. \n\n[[Page S18434]]\n\n  I am fearful, however, that as we close out this session we will also \nclose down the provision for aid to dependent children that dates back \n60 years to the Social Security Act of 1935.\n  If this should happen, and it very likely will, the first and \nforemost reason will be the monstrous political deception embodied in \nthe term Welfare reform.\n  In my lifetime there has been no such Orwellian inversion of truth in \nthe course of a domestic debate. ``Welfare reform'' in fact means \nwelfare repeal. The repeal, that is, of title IV-A of the Social \nSecurity Act. Everyone is to blame for this duplicity, everyone is an \naccomplice.\n  For practical purposes, we can begin with the celebrated Contract \nWith America, which pledged that within 100 days, a Republican House \nwould vote on 10 bills, including:\n\n       3. Welfare reform. The government should encourage people \n     to work, not to have children out of wedlock.\n\n  This in itself was unexceptional, especially the second clause. By \n1994, the nation had become alarmed by an unprecedented rise in \nillegitimacy, to ratios altogether ahistorical--from practically nil to \nalmost one-third in the course of a half-century. Since illegitimate \nchildren commonly end up supported by Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren (AFDC), a causal connection was inferred. Not proven. We know \ndesperately little about this great transformation, save that it is \nhappening in all the industrial nations of the North Atlantic.\n  Undeterred, the new House majority promptly passed a bill which \nrepealed AFDC. Such an act would have been unthinkable a year earlier, \njust as repealing Old Age pensions or Unemployment Compensation, other \ntitles of the Social Security Act, would be today. At minimum, it would \nhave seemed cruel to children. But the new Republicans succeeded in \nentirely reversing the terms of the debate. Instead of aiding children, \nAFDC was said to harm them. Last month, a Republican Member of the \nHouse remarked on the importance of child care:\n\n       . . . because our welfare reform package is going to remove \n     people from welfare and get them to work. We understand that \n     child care is a critical step to ending the cruelty of \n     welfare dependency.\n\n  What once was seen as charity, or even social insurance is redefined \nas cruelty.\n  This happens. Social problems are continuously redefined. Malcolm \nGladwell of The Washington Post has noted that, ``In the 19th century, \nthe assumption had almost always been that a man without a job was \neither lazy or immoral. But following the depression of the 1890's, the \nProgressives `discovered' unemployment.'' Which is to say, a personal \nfailing became a societal failing instead. This redefinition has \nwrought what would once have seemed miracles in the stabilization of \nour economy. Mass unemployment is now history. On the other hand, such \ncannot be said for the attempt to dissociate welfare dependency from \npersonal attributes, including moral conduct. As we would say in the \nold Navy, I am something of a plank owner in this regard. It is just 30 \nyears since I and associates on the policy planning staff of the \nDepartment of Labor picked up the onset of family instability in the \nnation, in this case among African Americans. Interestingly, this \nfollowed our having failed to establish that macroeconomic problems \nwere the source of the trouble. In the event, I was promptly accused of \nBlaming the Victim. For the 30 years that followed there was an awful \ntyranny of guilt mongering and accusation that all but strangled \nliberal debate. One consequence was that when a political force \nappeared that wished to change the terms of debate altogether, \nestablished opinion was effortlessly silenced and displaced. Again, \nGladwell:\n\n       But if anything is obvious from the current budget fight \n     and Capitol Hill's commitment to scaling back welfare and \n     Medicaid while lavishing extra billions on the Pentagon, it \n     is that this once formidable confidence has now almost \n     entirely slipped away. This is what has given Washington's \n     current re-examination of the size and shape of government \n     its strange ambivalence. In most revolutions the defenders of \n     the status quo have to be dragged from power, kicking and \n     screaming. In this revolution, the defenders of the old \n     activism toward the poor surrendered willingly, with the \n     shrugs and indifference of those who no longer believed in \n     what they stood for either.\n\n  This was painfully evident in the Senate. On August 3, 1995, the \nRepublican majority introduced a Welfare reform bill which abolished \nAFDC. That same day, the Democratic minority introduced a competing \nWelfare reform bill--which also abolished AFDC. On the minority side an \nenormous fuss is now being made over adding a little extra child care, \nsome odd bits of child nutrition aid, perhaps a little foster care. \nLiterally arranging flowers on the coffin of the provision for children \nin the Social Security Act. Coming from devious persons this would have \nbeen a conscious strategy--distracting attention from what was really \ngoing on. But these were not, are not, devious persons. Sixty years of \nprogram liberalism--a bill for you, a bill for me--had made this \nlegislative behavior seem normal. The enormity of the event was \naltogether missed.\n\n  I hope this is not mere innocence on my part. The Washington Post \neditorial page has been unblinking on this subject. An editorial of \nSeptember 14 described the bill on the Senate floor as ``reckless,'' \nadding with a measure of disdain: ``Some new money for child care may . \n. . be sprinkled onto this confection.'' Those seeking to define \nwelfare repeal as welfare reform by improving the Republican measure \nshould have known better, but I truly think they did not. In recent \nyears, child care has been something of a mantra among liberal \nadvocates for the poor. For all its merits, it has awesome defects, \nwhich are the defects of American social policy. The most important is \nthat it creates two classes of working mothers: one that gets free \ngovernment provided child care; another that does not.\n  The Clinton administration arrived in Washington sparking with such \nenthusiasms. At this time, I was chairman of the Committee on Finance, \ncharged with producing $500 billion in deficit reduction, half through \ntax increases, half through program cuts. I thought deficit reduction a \nmatter of the first priority, as did my fabled counterpart in the \nHouse, Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of Ways and Means. In the end, we got \nthe votes. Barely. Fifty, plus the Vice President in the Senate. But \nall the while we were taking on this large--and as we can now say \nhugely successful--effort, we were constantly besieged by \nadministration officials wanting us to add money for this social \nprogram or that social program. Immunization was a favorite. Rosty and \nI were baffled. Our cities had had free immunization for the better \npart of a century. All children are vaccinated by the time they enter \nschool. If they aren't vaccinated at earlier ages, it is surely the \nnegligence or ignorance of the parents that has most explanatory value. \nBut nothing would do: had to add whatever billion dollars for yet a new \nGovernment service.\n  My favorite in this miscellany was something called family \npreservation, yet another categorical aid program-- \nthere were a dozen in place already--which amounted to a dollop of \nsocial services and a press release for some subcommittee chairman. The \nprogram was to cost $930 million over 5 years, starting at $60 million \nin fiscal year 1994. For three decades I had been watching families \ncome apart in our society; now I was being told by seemingly everyone \non the new team that one more program would do the trick. The New \nFamily Preservation Program was included in the President's first \nbudget, but welfare reform was not. In fact, the administration \npresented no welfare plan until June of 1994, a year and a half after \nthe President took office. At the risk of indiscretion, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record at this point a letter I wrote to \nDr. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, then the distinguished Chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisors.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1993.\n     Dr. Laura D'Andrea Tyson,\n     Council of Economic Advisers, The Old Executive Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Tyson: You will recall that last Thursday when you \n     so kindly joined us at a meeting of the Democratic Policy \n     Committee you and I discussed the President's family \n     preservation proposal. You indicated how much he supports the \n     measure. I assured you I, too, support it, but went on to ask \n     what evidence was there that it would have any effect. You \n     assured me there was such data. Just for fun, I asked for two \n     citations. \n     \n[[Page S18435]]\n\n       The next day we received a fax from Sharon Glied of your \n     staff with a number of citations and a paper, ``Evaluating \n     the Results'', that appears to have been written by Frank \n     Farrow of the Center for the Study of Social Policy here in \n     Washington and Harold Richman at the Chapin Hall Center at \n     the University of Chicago. The paper is quite direct: ``. . . \n     . solid proof that family preservation services can effect a \n     state's overall placement rates is still lacking.''Just \n     yesterday, the same Chapin Hall Center released an \n     ``Evaluation of the Illinois Family First Placement \n     Prevention Program: Final Report''. This was a large-scale \n     study of the Illinois Family First initiative authorized by \n     the Illinois Family Preservation Act of 1987. It was \n     ``designed to test effects of this program on out-of-home \n     placement of children and other outcomes, such as subsequent \n     child maltreatment.'' Data on case and service \n     characteristics were provided by Family First caseworkers on \n     approximately 4,500 cases; approximately 1,600 families \n     participated in the randomized experiment. The findings are \n     clear enough.\n       ``Overall, the Family First placement prevention program \n     results in a slight increase in placement rates (when data \n     from all experimental sites are combined). This effect \n     disappears once case and site variations are taken into \n     account.''\n       In other words, there are either negative effects or no \n     effects.\n       This is nothing new. Here is Peter Rossi's conclusion in \n     his 1992 paper, ``Assessing Family Preservation Programs''. \n     Evaluations conducted to date ``do not form a sufficient \n     basis upon which to firmly decide whether family preservation \n     programs are either effective or not''.\n       May I say to you that there is nothing the least surprising \n     in either of these findings? From the mid-'60s on this has \n     been the repeated, I almost want to say consistent pattern of \n     evaluation studies. Either few effects or negative effects. \n     Thus, the negative income tax experiments of the 1970s \n     appeared to produce an increase in family break-up.\n       This pattern of ``counterintuitive'' findings first \n     appeared in the '60s. Greeley and Rossi, some of my work, \n     Coleman's. To this day I can't decide whether we are dealing \n     here with an artifact of methodology or a much larger and \n     more intractable fact of social programs. In any event, by \n     1978 we had Rossi's Iron Law. To wit:\n       ``If there is any empirical law that is emerging from the \n     past decade of widespread evaluation research activities, it \n     is that the expected value for any measured effect of a \n     social program is zero.''\n       I write you at such length for what I believe to be an \n     important purpose. In the last six months, I have been \n     repeatedly impressed by the number of members of the Clinton \n     Administration who have assured me with great vigor that \n     something or other is known in an area of social policy \n     which, to the best of my understanding, is not known at all. \n     This seems to me perilous. It is quite possible to live with \n     uncertainty; with the possibility, even the likelihood that \n     once is wrong. But beware of certainty where none exists. \n     Ideological certainty easily degenerates into an insistence \n     upon ignorance.\n       The great strength of political conservatives at this time \n     (and for a generation) is that they are open to the thought \n     that matters are complex. Liberals have got into a reflexive \n     pattern of denying this. I had hoped twelve years in the \n     wilderness might have changed this; it may be it has only \n     reinforced it. If this is so, current revival of liberalism \n     will be brief and inconsequential.\n           Respectfully,\n                                          Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Note that concluding paragraph: If we don't get as good \nat asking questions as conservatives have become, ``the current revival \nof liberalism will be brief and inconsequential.'' In the course of the \nrecent debate on ``Welfare reform,'' specifically on September 14, I \ntook occasion to note that almost the only serious critique of the \nRepublican proposal, and its Democratic variant, was coming from \nconservative social analysts and social scientists. Let me cite three \nsuch criticisms which in sum, or so I would argue, make a devastating \ncase against what Congress and the administration seem bent on doing.\n  First George Will, who in the high tradition of conservative thought, \nasks us to consider the unanticipated consequences of what we are about \nto do to children in the course of disciplining their parents. He wrote \nin September:\n\n       As the welfare reform debate begins to boil, the place to \n     begin is with an elemental fact: No child in America asked to \n     be here. * * * No child is going to be spiritually improved \n     by being collateral damage in a bombardment of severities \n     targeted at adults who may or may not deserve more severe \n     treatment from the welfare system.\n\n  Let me attach numbers to this statement. In 1968, as part of the \nsocial science undertakings associated with the Economic Opportunity \nAct of 1965, the Federal government helped establish the Panel Study of \nIncome Dynamics at the Survey Research Center of the University of \nMichigan. The thought was to follow cohorts of real, named individuals \nover the years to see how income rose and fell over time. Earlier this \nyear, using this data, Greg J. Duncan and Wei-Jun J. Yeung calculated \nthat of children born between 1973 and 1975, some 24 percent received \nAFDC at some point before turning 18. Among African-Americans this \nproportion was 66 percent, while for whites it was 19 percent. All told \nsome 39 percent of this cohort received AFDC, Food Stamps, or \nSupplementary Security Income. (Duncan, Greg J. and Yeung, Wei-Jun J. \n``Extent and Consequences of Welfare Dependence Among America's \nChildren.'' Children and Youth Services Review. Vol. 17, Nos. 1-2, pp. \n157-182, 1995.)\n  And so we know what we are talking about. A quarter of our children.\n  A year ago November, James Q. Wilson gave the Walter Wriston lecture \nat the Manhattan Institute, entitled ``Welfare Reform and Character \nDevelopment.'' He began by insisting on how little we know:\n\n       Let me confess at the outset that I do not know what ought \n     to be done and assert that I do not think anyone else knows \n     either. But I think that we can find out, at least to the \n     degree that feeble human reason is capable of understanding \n     some of the most profound features of the human condition. \n     What we may find out, of course, is that we have created a \n     society that can no longer sustain a strong family life no \n     matter what steps we take. I am not convinced of that, for \n     the very people who express the deepest pessimism are \n     themselves leading, in most cases, decent lives amid strong \n     human attachments and competent and caring families.\n       What we worry about is the underclass. There has always \n     been an underclass and always will be one. But of late its \n     ranks have grown, and its members have acquired greater power \n     to destroy their own children and inflict harm beyond their \n     own ranks. The means for doing so--guns, drugs, and \n     automobiles--were supplied to them by our inventive and \n     prosperous economy. We must either control more rigorously \n     those means or alter more powerfully the lives of those who \n     possess them. I wish to discuss the latter, because the \n     public is rightly dubious about how great a gain in public \n     safety can be achieved by the legal methods at our disposal \n     and is properly indignant about the harm to innocent children \n     that will result from neglecting the processes by which the \n     underclass reproduces itself.\n       The great debate is whether, how, and at what cost we can \n     change lives--if not the lives of this generation then those \n     of the next.\n\n  He then set forth three precepts. Note that the first is precisely \nwhere Will began:\n\n       First precept: Our overriding goal ought to be to save the \n     children. Other goals--reducing the cost of welfare, \n     discouraging illegitimacy, and preventing long-term welfare \n     dependency--are all worthy. But they should be secondary to \n     the goal of improving the life prospects of the next \n     generation.\n       Second precept: Nobody knows how to achieve this goal on a \n     large scale. The debate that has begun about welfare reform \n     is largely based on untested assumptions, ideological \n     posturing, and perverse priorities. We are told that worker \n     training and job placement will reduce the welfare rolls, but \n     we know that worker training and job placement have so far \n     had at best very modest effects on welfare rolls. And few \n     advocates of worker training tell us what happens to children \n     whose mothers are induced or compelled to work, other than to \n     assure us that somebody will supply day care. We are told by \n     others that a mandatory work requirement, whether or not it \n     leads to more mothers working, will end the cycle of \n     dependency. We don't know that it will. Moreover, it is \n     fathers whose behavior we most want to change, and nobody has \n     explained how cutting off welfare to mothers will make \n     biological fathers act like real fathers. We are told that \n     ending AFDC will reduce illegitimacy, but that is, at best, \n     an informed guess. Some people produced many illegitimate \n     children long before welfare existed, and others in similar \n     circumstances now produce none, even though welfare has \n     become quite generous. I have pointed out that group homes \n     and boarding schools once provided decent lives for the \n     children of stable, working-class parents who faced \n     unexpected adversity, but I do not know whether such \n     institutions will work for the children of underclass parents \n     enmeshed in a cycle of dependency and despair.\n       Third precept: The federal government cannot have a \n     meaningful family policy for the nation, and it ought not to \n     try. Not only does it not know and cannot learn from \n     ``experts'' what to do; whatever it thinks it ought to do, it \n     will try to do in the worst possible way: uniformly, \n     systematically, politically, and ignorantly. Today official \n     Washington rarely bothers even to give lip service to the \n     tattered principle of states' rights. Even when it allows the \n     states some freedom, it does so only at its own pleasure, \n     reserving the right to set terms, issue waivers, and attach \n     conditions. Welfare politics in Washington is driven by \n     national advocacy groups that often derive their energy from \n     the ideological message on which they rely to attract money \n     and supporters. And Washington will find ways either to deny \n\n[[Page S18436]]\n     public money to churches (even though they are more deeply engaged in \n     human redemption than any state department of social welfare) \n     or to enshroud those churches that do get public money with \n     constraints that vitiate the essential mission of a church.\n\n  Finally, to Wilson's point that any welfare program significantly \nfunded from Washington will be run ``uniformly, systematically, \npolitically, and ignorantly.'' I don't disagree. The Family Support Act \nof 1988 had two basic premises. The first was that welfare could not be \na way of life; that it had to be an interlude in which mothers learn \nself-sufficiency and fathers learn child support, and also that this \ngoal was to be pursued in as many different ways as State and local \ngovernments could contrive. I would like to think that I am not the \nonly person still in Washington who recalls that in debate we would \ncontinually refer to the experiments being carried out by a liberal \nDemocratic Governor in Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis, and a \nconservative Republican Governor of California, George Deukmejian. Our \nexpectations, very much under control I should say, were based on the \ncareful research of such programs by the Manpower Demonstration \nResearch Corporation based in New York.\n  On December 3rd, Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise \nInstitute, the third of the conservative analysts I will cite, wrote in \nsupport of the welfare measure now in conference, stating that the \nexperience of the JOBS program under the Family Support Act showed just \nhow innovative and responsible States can be. He said:\n\n       Since 1992, the federal government has allowed states \n     almost total freedom to reshape their welfare systems through \n     the waiver process. According to the Center for Law and \n     Social Policy (CLASP), as of last week, 42 states had \n     requested waivers and well over half had already been \n     granted.\n\n  As some will know, earlier this year I introduced the Family Support \nAct of 1995, seeking to update the earlier legislation, given seven \nyears experience. In the current issue of The National Journal, in \nwhich I am referred to as the ``champion'' of ``left-of-center advocacy \ngroups,'' this measure, which got 41 votes on the Senate floor, is \nsimply dismissed: ``. . . Moynihan's bill is principally a vehicle for \ndefending the status quo . . .'' Dreadful charge, but not unwarranted. \nThe status quo is meant to be one of experiment and change. And it is. \nI so state: the idea of changing welfare has even taken hold in New \nYork City.\n  Now to what I think of as a constitutional question, the source of my \ngreatest concern.\n  I have several times now, here on the floor, related an event which \ntook place in the course of a ``retreat'' which the Finance Committee \nheld last March 18 at the Wye Plantation in Maryland's Eastern shore. \nOur chairman, Senator Packwood, asked me to lead a discussion of \nwelfare legislation, the House bill, H.R. 4, having by then come over \nto the Senate where it was referred to our committee.\n  I went through the House bill, and called particular attention to the \nprovision denying AFDC benefits to families headed by an unwed female \nunder 18 years of age. I said that these were precisely the families we \nhad been most concerned about in the Family Support Act. The welfare \npopulation is roughly bi-modal. About half the families are headed by \nmature women who for one reason or another find themselves alone with \nchildren and without income. AFDC is income insurance, just as \nunemployment compensation is income insurance. Or, if you like, social \ninsurance, which is why we call it Social Security. These persons are \ntypically in and out of the system within 2 years. The other AFDC \nfamilies, rather more than half, begin as AFDC families. Young women \nwith children typically born out of wedlock. These are the families the \nFamily Support Act was concerned with. There are millions of families \nin just this circumstance.\n  A few days later, a colleague on the Finance Committee came up to say \nthat he had checked on this matter at home. In his state there were \nfour such families; two had just moved in from out of state. I can \nimagine the state welfare commissioner asking if the Senator wanted to \nknow their names.\n  Here is the point as I see it. Welfare dependency is huge, but it is \nalso concentrated. That portion of the caseload that is on welfare for \ntwo years or less is more or less evenly distributed across the land. \nBut three-quarters of children who are on AFDC at a point in time will \nbe on for more than five years. They are concentrated in cities. In \nAtlanta, 59 percent of all children received AFDC benefits in the \ncourse of the year 1993; in Cleveland, 66 percent; in Miami, 55 \npercent; in Oakland, 51 percent; in Newark, 66 percent; in \nPhiladelphia, 57 percent.\n  By contrast there are many States that do not have large cities and \ndo not have such concentrations. The Department of Health and Human \nServices has estimated the number of children who would be denied \nbenefits under the 5-year time limit contained in both the House and \nSenate welfare bills, now in conference. For California, 849,300. For \nneighboring Nevada, 8,134. For New York, 300,527. For neighboring \nVermont, 6,563.\n  If welfare were a smallish problem--if this were 1955, or even 1965--\nan argument could be made for turning the matter back to State \nGovernment. But it is now so large a problem that governments of the \nstates in which it is most concentrated simply will not be able to \nhandle it. On December 3rd, Lawrence Mead had an excellent article in \nthe Washington Post in which he described the recent innovations in \nwelfare policy, all provided under the Family Support Act, in \nWisconsin. His article is entitled: ``Growing a Smaller Welfare State: \nWisconsin's Reforms Show That To Cut the Rolls, You Need More \nBureaucrats''\n  It begins:\n\n       The Politicians debating welfare reform would have us \n     believe that their efforts will greatly streamline the \n     current system, help balance the nation's books and reverse \n     the growing tide of unwed pregnancy among the poor. What they \n     aren't telling us is that, at the state and local level, the \n     federal cuts in the offing are apt to increase--not shrink--\n     the size of the welfare bureaucracy.\n\n  Mead's point is one we understood perfectly at the time we enacted \nthe Family Support Act. The cheapest thing to do with chronic welfare \ndependent families is simply to leave them as they are. Changing them \nin ways that Wilson speaks of is labor intensive, costly and \nproblematic. A nice quality of the Wisconsin experiments is that job \nsearch begins the day an adult applies for welfare. But this takes \nsupervision. Mead notes that high performing areas of the \nstate ``feature relentless followup of clients to see that they stay on \ntrack.'' The term client is important; it is a term of professional \nsocial work. This sort of thing is not for amateurs. Most importantly, \nhe concludes:\n\n       Even with Wisconsin's successes so far, important questions \n     remain unanswered: What happens to the people who were \n     formerly on the welfare rolls? Are they better or worse off \n     than before? Can they sustain themselves long term? Anecdotes \n     don't suggest great hardship, but nobody knows for sure. And \n     what evidence is there that this approach can flourish in \n     inner cities where the social problems are far more serious? \n     In Milwaukee, which has half the state's welfare caseload, \n     the success has been far more modest than in the rest of the \n     state.\n       These questions need answers before a case can be made that \n     Wisconsin is the model on which other states should base \n     their reforms. But this much is clear: Wisconsin's fusion of \n     generosity and stringency does represent what the voters say \n     they're looking for.\n\n  In Milwaukee, 53 percent of children are on AFDC in the course of a \nyear.\n  I have been taken to task for suggesting that the time limits in the \nHouse and Senate bills will produce a surge in the number of homeless \nchildren such that the current problem of the homeless will seem \ninconsequential. So be it; that is my view. I believe our present \nsocial welfare system is all but overwhelmed. Witness the death of \nElisa Izquierdo in Brooklyn. If 39 percent of all children in New York \nCity were on AFDC at some point in 1993, I would estimate that the \nproportion for Brooklyn would have been at least 50 percent, probably \nhigher. Hundreds of thousands--I said hundreds of thousands--of these \nchildren live in households that are held together primarily by the \nfact of welfare assistance. Take that away and the children are blown \nto the winds. A December 6 administration analysis concludes that the \nwelfare conference agreement will force 1.5 million children into \npoverty. To say what I have said before here in the Senate: The young \nmales can be horrid to themselves, horrid to one another, horrid to the \nrest of us.\n  By way of example, or analogue, or what you will, I have frequently \nreferred to the Federal legislation that \n\n[[Page S18437]]\ncommenced the deinstitutionalization of mental patients. I was present \nat the creation of this movement. Early in 1955, our former esteemed \nHouse colleague, Jonathan B. Bingham, at that time secretary to \nGovernor Averell Harriman of New York brought Dr. Paul Hoch, the new \ncommissioner of mental health, in to meet the Governor. I was present, \nalong with Paul H. Appleby, the new budget director. Dr. Hoch, a \nwonderful, humane man of science, told of a new chemical treatment for \nmental illness which had been developed by Dr. Nathan Kline at Rockland \nState Hospital in the lower Hudson Valley. It had been tested \nclinically. Hoch proposed that it be given to all patients, throughout \nthe New York mental hospital system, which then held some 94,000 \npatients. Today there are 8,000. Harriman asked what the program would \ncost. Hoch mentioned a sum in the neighborhood, as I recall, of $4 \nmillion. Harriman asked Appleby if he could find the money. Appleby, I \ncannot doubt having been cued by Bingham, replied that he could find \nit. Done. said Harriman, I am an investment banker and believe in \ninvestment. And so reserpine medication commenced.\n  Eight years later, on October 22, 1963, in his last public bill-\nsigning ceremony at the White House, President John F. Kennedy signed \nthe Community Health Center Construction Act of 1963. I was present, \nsince I had worked on the legislation, and the President gave me a pen \nwhich I have in my hand here. We were going to empty out our great \nmental hospitals and treat patients in local community centers. We \nwould build 2,000 by the year 1980, and thereafter one for each \nadditional 100,000 persons in the population. Alas, we built some 400 \ncenters, and then just forgot about our earlier plans. But we emptied \nout the hospitals. A decade or so later, the problem of the homeless \nappeared, to our general bafflement. I have commented that in New York, \nwith our singular ability for getting problems wrong, homelessness has \nbeen defined as a problem of lack of affordable housing. We will very \nlikely think up some equally misleading explanation for the growing \nnumbers of homeless children when they appear, and so I would like to \nput this on the record now.\n  On December 3, a newspaper of considerable circulation did just this, \nhowever inadvertently. A long article on ``welfare reform'' was \naccompanied by a photograph of an overstuffed chair on which a broken, \nor battered doll had been placed. The caption read: ``Republicans blame \nfailed welfare policies for today's problems. Above, an easy chair at a \nPhiladelphia homeless encampment.'' A photograph, I dread to say, of \nthings to come.\n  Republicans must look to their own consciences. I would appeal to \nthat of my own party. Last week, our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Bob Dole, stated that he hoped to bring welfare reform to the \nfloor this week.\n\n       It is very likely next week there will also be a conference \n     report on welfare reform. I think we have about concluded the \n     conference. [T]he original bill passed in the Senate by a \n     vote of 87 to 12. We believe we have retained most of the \n     Senate provisions in the conference, and I ask my colleagues \n     on both sides--this bill had strong bipartisan support--to \n     take a close look.\n       Eighty-eight percent of the American people want welfare \n     reform. We will have it on the floor, we hope, next week. We \n     hope the President of the United States will sign it. In my \n     view, it is a good resolution of differences between the \n     House and the Senate. We still have one or two minor--well \n     not minor--issues in disagreement we hope to resolve \n     tomorrow, and then we hope to bring it up by midweek next \n     week.\n\n  What is one to say? The Senate bill did indeed have ``strong \nbipartisan support.'' If we do get a conference committee report, it \nwill pass and will, I am confident, be vetoed. What I fear is that the \nrepeal of the Social Security Act provision will return as part of a \ngeneral budget reconciliation, and that bill will be signed into law. \nShould it do so, the Democratic Party will be to blame, and blamed it \nwill be. It will never again be able to speak with any credibility to \nthe central social issue of our age.\n  We will have fashioned our own coffin. There will be no flowers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18433-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18437-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer  laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18437-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n       At 4:20 pm., a message from the House of Representatives, \n     delivered by Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced \n     that the House has passed the following bills, in which it \n     requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 325.

A bill to extend and improve the price support and \nproduction adjustment program for peanuts, to establish standards for \nthe inspection, handling, storage, and labeling of all peanuts and \npeanut products sold in the United States, and for other purposes, to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             the heflin-rose peanut improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Heflin-Rose Peanut \nProgram Improvement Act of 1995.\n  Auburn University recently released a study based on the same \neconomic impact model employed by the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission to determine the effects of various proposals that were \nbeing considered before the Lugar-Armey peanut program compromise was \nreached and made part of the Roberts farm bill, which is part of the \nbudget reconciliation bill. Using the figures and calculations of the \nAuburn report, the Lugar-Armey compromise would result in an industry-\nwide, negative economic impact totalling $375 million and will cause \nthe loss of 5,400 jobs throughout the peanut industry.\n  While the Lugar-Armey compromise is touted as an effort to achieve a \nno-net-cost program, in reality it will cost taxpayers $60 million over \n7 years. As a matter of fact, the Lugar-Armey compromise actually kills \nthe program over 7 years, encourages peanut imports, and cuts peanut \nfarmer income by nearly 30 percent.\n  Congressman Charlie Rose and I have worked on a peanut program which \nwe feel is a much better bill. This proposal guarantees a no-net-cost \nprogram saves some $43 million above what the Lugar-Armey compromise \nsaved. Our cost savings come from making foreign importers of peanuts \npay the same assessments that U.S. peanut farmers have to pay and uses \nthis money to offset the cost of the peanut program. In addition, to \nimposing assessments on importers, our proposal directs that the NAFTA \nand \n\n[[Page S18443]]\nGATT revenue derived from imported peanuts go toward paying for the \npeanut program rather than reducing farmer income.\n  The Heflin-Rose peanut program refrains from reducing farmer income \nby cutting the loan rate, and therefore, maintains the current law loan \nrate for quota and additional peanuts. Unlike the Lugar-Armey peanut \nprogram, which would allow unlimited cross-country transfers, the \nHeflin-Rose bill also measure infrastructure stability by permitting \nonly limited transfers across county lines.\n  Furthermore, our legislation addresses health and food safety \nconcerns due to the increased level of imports resulting from GATT and \nNAFTA. The American peanut farmer is held to the highest safety and \ninspection levels of any domestically-produced commodity. To not \nrequire at least an equivalent level of protection from foreign-grown \npeanuts jeopardizes American consumers.\n  For example, the Heflin-Rose bill requires that foreign-grown peanuts \nbe inspected to determine whether or not they were produced with \npesticides and other chemicals banned for use in this country. This \nlegislation applies the same standards for quality, freedom from \naflatoxin and procedures for the inspection and entry of imported \npeanuts that currently apply to domestically-produced peanuts under \nMarketing Agreement No. 146.\n  Peanut farmers strongly support achieving a no-net-cost peanut \nprogram. However, this goal can be achieved without slashing farmer \nincome and with consideration to the economic costs on the communities \nthat work and depend on the production of peanuts. If the Republicans \nare serious about deficit reduction, then this is a plan that saves a \nsignificant amount above their proposal, ensures a no-net-cost peanut \nprogram, and preserves farmer income while safeguarding American \nconsumers with food safety provisions for imported peanuts and peanut \nproducts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Dole)\n  S. 1470. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increases in the amounts of allowable earnings under the \nsocial security earnings limit for individuals who have attained \nretirement age, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the senior citizens freedom to work act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, with Senator McCain, I am \nintroducing the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This bill raises \nthe Social Security earnings limit for workers age 65 to 69 to $30,000 \nby the year 2002. I am happy to say that this increase in the earnings \nlimit is fully paid for over the 7-year period. In addition, this bill \nwill protect the Social Security trust fund from disinvestment or \nunderinvestment by the Secretary of the Treasury or any other Federal \nofficials.\n  Under current law, seniors in this age group, who earn more than \n$11,280 this year, are penalized by forfeiting $1 for every $3 they \nearn over that limit. When coupled with other Federal taxes, these \nworkers who earn above this $11,280 mark face a 56-percent marginal tax \nrate.\n  As I have often said, this is not fair. The earnings penalty sends a \nmessage to senior citizens that we no longer value their experience and \nexpertise in the work force. I am happy to introduce this legislation \nthat will provide equity to these hard-working seniors.\n  I must note that a large part of the credit for this legislation in \nthe Senate is due to the efforts of the senior Senator from Arizona, \nSenator John McCain, who has tirelessly championed this cause. I thank \nhim for his work on this issue.\n       By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n\n  S. 1471. A bill to make permanent the program of malpractice coverage \nfor health centers under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT MALPRACTICE COVERAGE FOR HEALTH CENTERS \n                         EXTENSION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today Senator Kennedy and I are pleased to \nintroduce S. 1471, the Federal Tort Claims Act Malpractice Coverage for \nHealth Centers Extension Act of 1995. Our bill will make permanent an \nexemption in current law that provides medical malpractice coverage \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA] to federally funded community \nhealth center personnel.\n  The current law is due to expire on December 31, necessitating speedy \nconsideration of this legislation in the Congress.\n  I am pleased to announce that the House passed this afternoon a \nsimilar bill, H.R. 1747, authored by my good friend from Connecticut, \nRepresentative Nancy Johnson and I am hopeful the Senate can take up \nthe Johnson bill forthwith.\n  A brief recitation of the legislative history on this issue may be \nuseful to my colleagues at this point.\n  In 1992, Senator Kennedy and I worked with our colleagues in the \nHouse to treat community health center [CHC] physicians, nurses, and \nother personnel as Federal employees under the FTCA for the purpose of \ndefending against malpractice claims.\n  Substituting the FTCA remedy for private lawsuits relieves CHC's from \ndevoting their limited program funds to purchase costly private \nmalpractice insurance. Purchase of such insurance had proven an \nextremely costly burden to the centers, which, I believe, have been \ndoing a marvelous job in providing excellent care in underserved areas \non what amounts to a shoestring budget.\n  The Federal Tort Claims Act, which falls under the jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee, stipulates strict procedural requirements for \nthe consideration of claims. For example, it does not provide for jury \ntrials or the award of punitive damages. These streamlined procedures \nact to reduce the number of, and costs associated with, tort claims.\n  By reducing insurance costs, the more than 500 community and migrant \nhealth centers can provide more direct medical services to the 5 \nmillion Americans who rely on these centers for their primary health \ncare needs.\n  In the initial 3 years of our experience under the FTCA, it is \nencouraging to find that all experience suggests that health centers \nhave a lower incidence of malpractice claims than comparable private \ninsurance providers.\n  Through fiscal year 1995, it has been estimated that only 15 claims \nhave been filed nationwide against the 119 participating health \ncenters. Thus far, no funds have been required to be paid out under the \nstatute to satisfy claims. In fact, the Department of Health and Human \nServices estimates that the 1992 law has saved over $14.3 million to \ndate. This is consistent with the 1992 House Judiciary Committee report \non this topic which noted that the savings from the law would far \nexceed the costs of coverage.\n  I want to take a moment to discuss the history of this legislation in \nthe 104th Congress.\n  As I noted earlier, the House passed a similar bill today under \nsuspension of the rules.\n  The version reported from the House Commerce Committee on September \n27 was very similar to the approach that Senator Kennedy and I were \ndeveloping. However, that bill recommended a 3-year extension whereas \nwe believed a permanent extension was warranted.\n  Ultimately, through discussions with our House colleagues, we were \nable to reach an agreement and the bill that passed the House today \nmakes the FTCA coverage for CHC's permanent.\n  The bill that passed the House today also differs from our approach \nin two other areas.\n  First, I understand that the House bill makes explicit that centers \nare not required to operate under the FTCA aegis. In other words, \ncenters are free to purchase insurance on their own if they so desire. \nI believe this is appropriate, and have no objection to this provision. \nIt clearly was our intent in drafting S. 1471.\n  Second, in order to address concerns that our claims experience may \nbe too limited in the first 3 years of operation to predict the \nadequacy of future reserves, we have provided for a General Accounting \nOffice study of the medical liability risk exposure of centers. If--as \nseems unlikely based on the past experience and future expectations--\nunforeseen problems develop in this program, this issue can be \nrevisited.\n  The House bill contains a GAO study provision which is much more \ndetailed \n\n[[Page S18444]]\nthan that embodied in the bill we introduce today. Again, I have no \nobjection to the House alternative.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I note that the administration is \nsupportive of this legislation and of making the program permanent. \nAccording to a recent administration report in support of extending \nFTCA coverage: ``Our experience to date * * * is sufficiently positive \nthat we believe that it is advisable to adopt FTCA coverage without a \ntime limitation, rather than to continue to insert sunset provisions.''\n  The legislation that Senator Kennedy and I are introducing today will \nresult in the delivery of more public health services to underserved \nareas throughout the country, whether these areas are urban or rural. \nIt is no secret to my colleagues that I am a tremendous fan of the work \nthat CHC's are doing, especially in Utah, and I think it behooves the \nCongress to give them this added tool to help improve health care \nservices in areas in which access has traditionally suffered.\n  At the bottom line, the 1992 legislation achieved more public health \nbang-for-the-buck and should be made permanent.\n  It is important that a bill be acted upon in the near future to \nextend coverage so that centers will know whether or not they have to \npurchase private coverage for 1996. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a permanent extension of the legislation authorizing Federal \nTort Claims Act coverage of community health centers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18442-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pryor, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] was added as a cosponsor of S. 881, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify provisions relating to church \npension benefit plans, to modify certain provisions relating to \nparticipants in such plans, to reduce the complexity of and to bring \nworkable consistency to the applicable rules, to promote retirement \nsavings and benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bennett, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Domenici] was added as a cosponsor of S. 901, a bill to \namend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 \nto authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the \ndesign, planning, and construction of certain water reclamation and re-\nuse projects and desalination research and development projects, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1166, a bill to amend the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, to improve the \nregistration of pesticides, to provide minor use crop protection, to \nimprove pesticide tolerances to safeguard infants and children, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1289\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1289, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to clarify the use of private \ncontracts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1360\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1360, a bill to \nensure personal privacy with respect to medical records and health \ncare-related information, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1392, a bill to impose \ntemporarily a 25-percent duty on imports of certain Canadian wood and \nlumber products, to require the administering authority to initiate an \ninvestigation under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to \nsuch products, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1414\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Mr. Cohen] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1414, a bill to ensure that \npayments during fiscal year 1996 of compensation for veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities, of dependency and indemnity \ncompensation for survivors of such veterans, and of other veterans \nbenefits are made regardless of Government financial shortfalls.\n\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1429, a bill to provide \nclarification in the reimbursement to States for federally funded \nemployees carrying out Federal programs during the lapse in \nappropriations between November 14, 1995, through November 19, 1995.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 43\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the names of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Feingold], the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. Moynihan], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] \nwere added as cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 43, a joint \nresolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding Wei Jingsheng;

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today \nto pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian and a record-breaking \nquarterback. Tim Couch ended his high school football career on a high \nnote with a 1-yard touchdown pass during the state quarterfinals. Some \nmay wonder what is so special about this play. Well, that pass will go \ndown in the record books as the one that put the Leslie County High \nSchool quarterback over the top as the national all-time leader in \ntouchdown passes. In 4 years, he has thrown an amazing 12,092 yards--an \naccomplishment that helped earn Tim honors as National High School \nPlayer of the Year.\n  Leslie County is located in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. The \nlast time the national spotlight shone on the small town of Hyden was \nin 1978, when President Nixon made his first public appearance since \nhis resignation. He was there to attend a dedication of a gym named in \nhis honor. According to local newspapers, residents said it was an \nexciting day, because everyone in the nation knew about Hyden. And now \nhistory has repeated itself, but this time the spotlight is shining \nthere because of the youth who's become known as ``the pride of Hyden'' \n--Tim Couch.\n  His final game as Leslie County High School quarterback was a \nmemorable one in many ways. Besides breaking the passing record, Tim \nfaced a consistent seven-man rush, he injured his right ankle trying to \nblock an extra point, and he was sacked five times. But check out his \nnumbers: he completed 17 of 34 passes for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns. \nAfter the record-breaking pass, the game came to a halt. Fans and the \nmedia stormed the field to ask Tim for autographs and interviews. \nFireworks lit up the night sky, and sirens and horns filled the air. \nAnd before the game resumed, Tim was handed the game ball. What a \nnight!\n  Every time Tim took to the gridiron, the entire town of Hyden flocked \nto Eagle Field to watch the ``Air Commander'' throw another pass on his \nway to the record books. Sports Illustrated recently did a profile of \nthe star quaterback. In the article, Tim said of his 374 fellow Hyden \nresidents, ``everybody around here is just so happy. They all want to \nsee me go to the NFL and become a big star. It gives me a lot of pride, \nthe way such a small place has rallied around one person.''\n  If you think football is his only game, think again! Not only is Tim \nan award-winning quarterback, he is also one of the best high school \nbasketball players in Kentucky. He led the state in scoring last \nseason, with 36 points a game, and he is one of the front runners in \nthe race for Kentucky's Mr. Basketball. No wonder he's being recruited \nby the top colleges in the Nation. However, it is my hope that this \nsuperstar decides to stay in the Bluegrass State and make one of \nKentucky's fine universities his new home.\n  Mr. President and my fellow Members of Congress, please join me in \ncongratulating the ``Pride of Hyden.'' Tim Couch has an exciting career \nahead of him, and I wish him good luck in the future. Mr. President, I \nalso ask that an article from a recent edition of Sports Illustrated be \nprinted the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                             Pride of Hyden\n\n                           (By Steve Rushin)\n\n       Elbert Couch parks his white Ford Bronco next to another \n     emblem of American infamy: the Richard M. Nixon Recreation \n     Center in Hyden, Ky. ``There's two kinds around here,'' Couch \n     says. ``There's Republicans, and there's Damn Democrats. I'm \n     a Damn Democrat, but we're outnumbered four to one in this \n     county.''\n       This is Leslie County, in the mountains of eastern \n     Kentucky's Cumberland Plateau. It was here, in 1978, that \n     Nixon made his first postexile public appearance, for the \n     dedication of a grand gymnasium that honors his presidency. \n     ``Everybody knew us because of Nixon,'' says Leslie County \n     High School basketball coach Ron Stidham, standing on his \n     home court inside the Tricky Dick. ``But that notoriety \n     aside, Tim Couch has made Hyden--well, if not a household \n     name exactly, at least people know where we are again.''\n       Tim Couch, Elbert's son, is the best high school basketball \n     player in Kentucky. He led the state in scoring last season, \n     with 36 points a game as a Leslie County High junior. He is \n     expected to be named Mr. Basketball of the Bluegrass after \n     this season, which is why most Division I basketball coaches \n     want to upholster Couch in their school colors come 1996.\n       Trouble is, Tim is also the most highly sought after \n     football recruit in the nation, one who almost certainly will \n     break the national record for career passing yardage this \n     Friday night in the state quarterfinals. He is 50 yards away \n     from breaking the mark of 11,700 set two years ago by Josh \n     Booty of Evangel Christian High in Shreveport, La., and Couch \n     needs only five touchdown passes to break that national \n     record as well. ``Couch is the best quarterback prospect I've \n     seen in 17 years,'' drools Tom Lemming, who publishes a \n     national recruiting newsletter. ``Better than Jeff George, \n     Ron Powlus and Peyton Manning. He reminds recruiters of John \n     Elway.'' ESPN draft nitwit Mel Kiper Jr. agrees and considers \n     Tim, who is 6'5'' and 215 pounds, one of the best pro \n     quarterback prospects in the nation. And to think that Tim is \n     just 18.\n       ``Everybody around here is just so happy,'' Tim says of \n     Hyden (pop. 375). ``They all want to see me go to the NFL and \n     become a big star. It gives me a lot of pride, the way such a \n     small place has rallied around one person.''\n       Through it all Tim has remained unfailingly polite, \n     genuinely humble and undeniably charismatic. Everywhere one \n     goes in Kentucky, people talk about the closely-cropped \n     Couch. He's like Gump, with a pump fake. And there's another \n     important difference: ``He's an A-B student,'' says Leslie \n     County High principal Omus Shepherd. ``In fact, to see him in \n     school, you wouldn't know he's an athlete, you wouldn't know \n     him from any other student. I don't know of any problem we've \n     ever had out of the boy.''\n       The boy was excused from class one afternoon early in the \n     football season when Governor Brereton Jones came to Hyden to \n     make Tim an honorary Kentucky Colonel, one of the youngest \n     recipients of the state's equivalent of knighthood. The \n     next evening the colonel threw for three touchdowns and \n     ran for two more in a 34-27 win a Woodford County High, \n     after which several opponents wanted a piece of him. ``I \n     saw them coming at me and thought we were in a fight,'' \n     says Tim. Instead, they wanted his autograph.\n       The next day Tim drove 124 miles to Lexington to watch the \n     Kentucky-Louisville football game with his folks. En route, \n     they stopped at a diner. Recently retired Los Angeles Laker \n     center and former Kentucky star Sam Bowie approached Tim's \n     table to say how much he has enjoyed following Tim's career. \n     Emboldened, Adolph Rupp's grandson Chip, who also happened to \n     be in the diner, did the same. After the game the Couches \n     repaired to the Lexington home of Miami Heat guard and ex-\n     Wildcat star Rex Chapman, who simply wanted to meet Tim.\n       ``I told him he was my hero growing up,'' Tim says of \n     Chapman. ``I told him how I dreamed in the backyard about \n     filling his shoes some day at Kentucky.''\n       ``Tim used to shoot baskets outside for hours in the \n     winter, until his fingers were \n\n[[Page S18446]]\n     bleeding,'' says Tim's mother, Janice. ``I always had to make him come \n     in before he got frostbite.''\n       Come summer, he would throw footballs all afternoon with \n     his older--by four years--brother, Greg. Tim always pretended \n     to be Joe Montana or Dan Marino. Now, Marino aspires to play \n     with Couch. ``I hope I'm still in the league when you get \n     here,'' the Miami Dolphin quarterback told Couch when the two \n     met in Cincinnati, where the Dolphins played the Bengals on \n     Oct. 1.\n       Tim never played baseball. ``He told me in ninth grade, \n     `Dad, I don't want to stand there and let them throw a ball \n     60 miles an hour at my head,''' recalls Elbert, who is \n     director of transportation for the county school system. When \n     Greg became the quarterback at Leslie County High, Tim \n     attended practices. ``In fifth and sixth grade he was \n     throwing the ball like a rocket,'' says Eagle football coach \n     Joe Beder, an assistant at the time. ``You knew then he would \n     be the quarterback here.''\n       Couch made the high school team as a seventh-grader, backed \n     up his brother as an eighth-grader and became the starting \n     quarterback as a freshman, when Greg went to play football at \n     Eastern Kentucky (where, after redshirtings one season, he's \n     now a junior reserve). Tim points to the utility pole in the \n     front yard of his family's comfortable two-story home. ``When \n     Greg went to college, I used to throw at that light pole,'' \n     he says. ``I'd take a five-steps drop and try to hit it as if \n     it was a receiver on the run, 30 feet out.'' Then he would \n     place two garbage cans next to each other and throw ``little \n     fade passes'' over the first defending can and into the \n     second. ``There's not much else to do in Hyden,'' says Todd \n     Crawford, a physician's assistant who works with the Leslie \n     County team.\n       So the Hydenites watch Couch. County judge-executive Onzie \n     Sizemore was a star high school quarterback in Hyden in the \n     early 1970s. ``Time is the best athlete I've ever seen in \n     Kentucky,'' says the judge, deliberating on Tim down at the \n     county court and jailhouse. ``He's the best thing that ever \n     happened to Hyden. I just hope he doesn't run for county \n     judge-executive, because then I'm out of a job.''\n       They come from all over Kentucky to see Tim play. On Friday \n     nights cars back up for a mile at the toll booth that guards \n     the Hyden exit of the Daniel Boone Parkway. And when the \n     Eagles play an away game, says Rick Hensley, whose son Ricky \n     is Tim's favorite target, ``last one outta town turns out the \n     lights.''\n       There is a sign outside of town that reads Hyden: Home of \n     Osborne Bros. Stars of the Grand Ole Opry, the Osbornes wrote \n     ``Rocky Top,'' which is the football anthem at Tennessee, \n     whose Volunteers are unanimously reviled in Kentucky. When \n     Tim engineered a season-opening 44-42 upset of Fort Thomas \n     Highlands High in Lexington, he came home to find \n     that benevolent vandals had altered the sign so it read \n     Hyden: Home of Tim Couch.\n       This season Couch has thrown for nearly 3,500 yards and 37 \n     touchdowns in 12 games. Clearly, his numbers are \n     preposterous. Last year he completed 75.1% of his passes, a \n     national record. Against Clark County High in the 1994 season \n     opener, he completed 25 of 27 passes. Against Shelby Valley \n     High this fall, he threw for 533 yards and seven scores and \n     was pulled four minutes into the second half. Likewise, in \n     October he played only one half against one of Kentucky's \n     top-ranked teams, Hopkinsville, when the badly outmanned \n     Eagles were bused seven hours each way and lost 61-0.\n       Even that defeat didn't cool the ardor of the Couch \n     potatoes, as Hyden's residents have come to call themselves. \n     As he drives home from football practice in his Mercury \n     Cougar on an autumn Thursday, Couch waves like a parade \n     marshal to every passing pedestrian, then enters his house \n     and is handed the telephone. ``Tennessee,'' says Janice, and \n     Tim chats cordially with Volunteer football coach Phillip \n     Fulmer. Bobby Bowden, Terry Bowden, Lou Holtz and Joe Paterno \n     check in weekly as well.\n       There is enormous pressure on him to play football at \n     Kentucky, and the Cats are on Couch like cats on a couch. \n     Here is a front-page Lexington Herald-Leader headline: Couch \n     To Watch UK Scrimmage. Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino \n     met with Tim and promised him a spot on the basketball team \n     if he sign to play football for the Wildcats. And Kentucky \n     football coach Bill Curry, although forbidden by the NCAA to \n     talk about recruits, called him ``the best high school \n     prospect I've ever seen.'' Every Omus, Onzie and Elbert in \n     Kentucky expects Tim to make the Cats an instant football \n     power. ``I may be crazy, but I believe Tim Couch is good \n     enough to get this program back to the Sugar Bowl,'' writes \n     columnist Dave Barker in The Cats' Pause, a Kentucky sports \n     weekly. ``Yes, that's right. From 1-10 to 10-1.''\n       ``Lord God, if Tim goes to UK they'll be namin' babies for \n     him before he plays his first game,'' says Elbert's friend \n     Vic DeSimone. ``Every kid in Kentucky will wear a number 2 \n     jersey.'' DeSimone--a candy manufacturer's rep who has \n     dropped by Leslie County High to chat--furrows his brow \n     before giving voice to every Kentuckian's darkest fear. ``You \n     wouldn't let him go to Tennessee, would you?'' he asks \n     Elbert. ``I mean, the boy can go to Liberty Baptist and still \n     become a pro.''\n       ``Have to take the Fifth Amendment on that one,'' says \n     Elbert, who later concedes: ``If Tim does go out of state, \n     we'll have to move out of state.''\n       Wherever Couch goes, if he plays basketball at all in \n     college, it will be as an afterthought to football, and a \n     great many disappointed people will be left in his wake. \n     ``It's hard for an 18-year-old kid to tell a coach whom he's \n     grown up adoring that he isn't going to play for him,'' says \n     Tim, who is still considering Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, \n     Notre Dame, Ohio State and (sigh) Tennessee. ``I'm thinking \n     about it all the time,'' he says of his impending decision. \n     ``Even if I'm just lying in bed, it never leaves my mind.''\n       He has made certain of that. Taped above the light switch \n     in his bedroom is a two-sentence note from a football \n     assistant at Northwestern. ``Your talent is God's gift to \n     you,'' it reads. ``What you do with your talent is your gift \n     back to God.''\n       It is the last thing that Tim sees each night when he turns \n     out the lights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18445-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            A TRIBUTE TO FRANK SINATRA ON HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nNew Jersey's favorite sons, and one of America's great personalities \nwho will be celebrating his 80th birthday today: Frank Sinatra. Mr. \nSinatra hails from Hoboken, New Jersey and we are proud to call him one \nof our own.\n  Mr. President, Frank Sinatra is one of the most recognized and \nrevered artists in the world, admired not only for his unique style, \nbut for his ability to reach people on a distinctly personal level. As \na musician and actor, Mr. Sinatra has distinguished himself as one of \nthe most notable figures in the history of entertainment.\n  For more than five decades, Frank Sinatra has charmed people all over \nthe world with his exceptional, distinctive voice. He began his \nimpressive career in New Jersey, when he won an amateur singing \nconcert. A few years later, he was the featured vocalist with the bands \nof Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. It was not long before Mr. Sinatra \nbegan to embark on a solo career.\n  The sounds of Frank Sinatra played throughout the country while the \nSecond World War was being fought abroad. Although he was unable to \njoin the Armed Services, he was able to help the servicemen by \nentertaining them with his voice, known as the ``Voice That Thrilled \nMillions.''\n  Frank Sinatra made his acting debut in 1943, and he then went on to \nappear in more than 50 motion pictures, among them, ``The Manchurian \nCandidate,'' a classic thriller reflecting his versatility as an actor, \n``The House I Live In,'' a sensitive documentary for which he received \na special Oscar, and ``From Here to Eternity,'' the 1953 motion picture \nwhich brought him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n  Today, Frank Sinatra maintains that same high visibility by singing \nand performing throughout the United States and the world. Over the \nyears, he has received countless awards that attest to the greatness of \nhis multifaceted career, including seven Grammies, a Peabody, an Emmy \nand an Oscar.\n  Aside from his performing brilliance, Mr. President, Frank Sinatra \nshould be recognized for his many selfless contributions. He played a \nkey role in raising money for an AIDS program and a center for abused \nchildren during a special program taped last month in honor of his \nEightieth Birthday Celebration. He also has earned awards for his \nhumanitarian and social justice efforts, including; the Life \nAchievement Award from the NAACP, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts \nand Sciences' Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, and the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom.\n  Mr. President, we are fortunate that Frank Sinatra's music will live \non forever, for he is truly one of a kind. His voice penetrated the \nhearts of many, and changed the face of popular music in 20th Century \nAmerica. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring Frank Sinatra \non this monumentous occasion and wish him continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18446-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18446-S18447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FRANK SINATRA'S 80th BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \nAmerican who celebrates his 80th birthday on this day. The chairman of \nthe board, Francis Albert Sinatra, legendary performer and American \ntreasure, was born on this day, December 12, in Hoboken, NJ, in 1915.\n\n[[Page S18447]]\n\n  Frank Sinatra rose from humble, blue-collar roots to superstardom by \nvirtue of a God-given gift: his voice. Through hard work and \ndetermination he perfected his talent and sang his way to the top of \nthe entertainment industry. His music dominated the charts from the \n1930's through the 1960's. By the 1970's he was an American \ninstitution, surviving Elvis, the Beatles, and the rock and roll \nrevolution. Frank Sinatra has performed for audiences around the world. \nHe has influenced virtually everyone who is, or ever wanted to be, a \nsinger. As Harry Connick, Jr., once said, ``Frank taught everybody how \nto sing.'' A universal entertainer from the old school, he could sing \nwith the likes of Bing Crosby, dance with the likes of Gene Kelly, and \nact with the likes of Burt Lancaster. From 1941 to 1984 he appeared in \n59 motion pictures. In 1953, he won an Oscar for his performance in \n``From Here To Eternity.''\n  But Frank Sinatra has given more to America than his records and \nmovies. In 1945, he won a special award from the Academy of Motion \nPicture Arts and Sciences for a short film called ``The House I Live \nIn,'' in which he stressed religious tolerance and racial equality. He \nhad much to do with the desegregation of the entertainment industry by \npromoting African-American artists, most notably his friend, the late \nSammy Davis, Jr.\n  During World War II he could not serve because of a punctured ear \ndrum, but he performed for troops overseas and assisted the war effort \nby selling war bonds. As a young man, he involved himself in politics \nby supporting President Roosevelt in 1932. He campaigned for Democrats \nthroughout the 1950's. In 1960, President Kennedy asked him to direct \nhis inaugural gala. In the 1970's he supported Republicans and again \nhosted inaugural galas for Preident Reagan in 1980 and 1984. In sum, \nFrank Sinatra should enjoy bipartisan support from this body.\n  Frank Sinatra also deserves to be recognized for his work on behalf \nof charitable causes. He has given millions of dollars to charities and \nhumanitarian causes publicly and anonymously. His donations have built \nchildren's hospitals, orphanages, and facilities for the mentally \nhandicapped. In 1985 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nthe highest civilian honor our Nation bestows. In making the \npresentation, President Reagan praised him for his generosity toward \nthe less fortunate.\n  Frank Sinatra is an American institution who has had an undeniable \nimpact on the 20th century. He is part of American culture, one of the \ngreat voices of our time. There is probably a Sinatra fan on every \nblock in every town in America, including this one on my block. Sinatra \nsongs have provided the backdrop of our lives for the past 50 years. \nFor most of us, a Sinatra song has the ability to conjure up memories \nof certain moments of our lives. So many of us can recall where we were \nwhen we first heard our favorite Sinatra song.\n  Now as he reaches the age of 80, the voice has become the elder \nstatesman of entertainment, a comforting presence, and a source of \ninspiration for younger performers. He is a remarkable and \ndistinguished American, and his art will be with us for decades to \ncome. He did it his way, and we loved it that way. I am as great a fan \nof his work as anyone, and I am sure I speak for many people in \nConnecticut, across the country, and around the world when I wish Old \nBlue Eyes a very happy 80th birthday and hope there will be many more \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18446-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JOHN TURNER, CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LIFE INSURANCE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on Tuesday, November 14, 1995, Mr. \nJohn Turner, chairman and CEO of ReliaStar Financial Corp., a financial \nservices holding company in Minneapolis, MN, became the new chairman of \nthe board of directors of the American Council of Life Insurance \n[ACLI].\n  The ACLI represents over 600 companies that write 92 percent of the \nlife insurance and 95 percent of the pension business in the United \nStates. As chairman, Mr. Turner will guide the ACLI as it works with \nFederal and State legislators, regulators and agencies to ensure the \nlaws and regulations we enact serve the best interest of our Nation's \nbusiness and individual policyholders and consumers, as well as \ninsurance companies.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate John on this high \nhonor and also to recognize the many years of community service he and \nhis wife Leslie have played in the Twin Cities. From Leslie's \ninvolvement with the Girl Scouts of America and her service on the city \ncouncil of Edina, MN to John's work on issues dealing with youth and \neducation, they have made a positive difference in Minnesota.\n  Professionally, Mr. Turner has been an active member of the ACLI's \nboard of directors for 3 years, and in that capacity, he has given \ntremendous service to an industry that, in turn, serves this Nation so \nwell.\n  Life insurance companies provide a necessary service by helping to \ndeliver financial security and peace of mind to millions of American \nfamilies and individuals. Insurance industry products allow people to \nkeep their homes and businesses, enable children to continue their \neducation, and help support aging parents. The industry's retirement \nproducts provide the means by which this Nation's present and future \nretirees can achieve their financial independence and help fulfill \ntheir financial dreams.\n  Mr. President, this Congress is in the process of returning power and \nresponsibility to States, localities and, most importantly, to \nindividuals. This unprecedented shift in power from Washington to the \nrest of America was summed up by John Turner in his inaugural speech as \nChairman of the ACLI when he said: ``Neither Washington nor corporate \nAmerica will much longer assume the financial burden of underwriting \npeople's retirement security; that responsibility is being transferred \nto individuals.''\n  As this process continues, a broad range of issues from financial \nservices modernization to tax reform to retirement income security will \ntake center stage. From my seat on the Senate Banking Committee, I look \nforward to working closely with John on these and many other important \nissues.\n  As it provides for fully one-third of this Nation's long-term \nsavings, the life insurance industry is the foundation of financial \nsecurity for millions of Americans and for our country. I am pleased to \nsee that John Turner will be leading this effort from his new position \nas chairman of the ACLI.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate John Turner and \nthe ACLI. I am confident that he will bring to his new post the same \ndedication, honesty, and integrity he has demonstrated to ReliaStar \nFinancial Corp. and the people of Minnesota. I wish John all the best \nand look forward to working with him the year ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18447-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18447-S18448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING DAN MORTEN- SEN ON WINNING THE WORLD TITLE IN SADDLE \n                              BRONC RIDING\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a young man \nfrom my State of Montana. This young man, just last week, won his third \nconsecutive world title in saddle bronc riding at the National Finals \nRodeo in Las Vegas, NV. Dan Mortensen, I tip my Stetson to you and your \ndedication.\n  Dan Mortensen will be 27 years old in 3 days and has accomplished a \nrare feat in his speciality event saddle bronc riding. He is a classic \nbronc rider, as is apparent by his three consecutive world titles. \nSaddle bronc riding is considered the classic event in the sport of \nrodeo. If you have never had the opportunity, I would suggest that you \nall take the time to see this event. A good saddle bronc ride is like \nwatching a ballet to a cowboy, as it is a fluid movement between man \nand beast. In this event, the contestant must stay on a bucking horse \nfor 8 seconds using only the timing of their movement and a bronc rein \nto keep them in the saddle. The classic style of Dan shows the grace \nand beauty involved in the sport of rodeo.\n  The honors that Dan has to his credit are numerous and speak volumes \nabout his dedication to the true American sport of rodeo. Dan won the \nregular season title for the Montana High School Rodeo Association in \nsaddle bronc riding. In 1990 Dan was awarded the title of Saddle Bronc \nRookie of the Year. Four years later, Dan won his first world title in \nhis speciality event. \n\n[[Page S18448]]\nIt was during the finals that year that Dan won not only the average in \nthe saddle bronc event, but set a record in the average. The average, \nis the total score of 10 rounds of riding wild and wooly bucking \nhorses. Truly a world champion accomplishment.\n  Dan and his wife, Kay, live in the beautiful Gallatin Valley in \nManhattan, MT. Residing in this area does take its toll, since it is \nnot the easiest place to make flight arrangements out to the numerous \nrodeos necessary to win a championship. However, Dan continues to call \nthis home.\n   Mr. President, I join with the citizens of the State of Montana, and \nwith all that hold our tradition of rodeo dear, in saluting this young \nman. I congratulate him for his dedication to the great Western \ntradition and sport of rodeo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/12/senate-section/article/S18447-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN.
