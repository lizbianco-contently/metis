Under the order of the Senate of January \n24, 1901, as modified on February 16, 1995, the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] is recognized to read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. THOMAS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government, the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the career of \nmy political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep \nacknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I \n[[Page S2908]] owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has \nconferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which \nit has supported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of \nmanifesting my inviolable attachment, by services faithful and \npersevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have \nresulted to our country from these services, let it always be \nremembered to your praise, and as an instructive example in our annals, \nthat under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every \ndirection, were liable to mislead amidst appearances sometimes dubious, \nvicissitudes of fortune often discouraging--in situations in which not \nunfrequently, want of success has countenanced the spirit of \ncriticism,--the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the \nefforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. \nProfoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my \ngrave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may \ncontinue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence--that your union \nand brotherly affection may be perpetual--that the free constitution, \nwhich is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained--that its \nadministration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and \nvirtue--that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these states, \nunder the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a \npreservation, and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire to \nthem the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection and \nadoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, \nto offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your \nfrequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much \nreflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me \nall important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These \nwill be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in \nthem the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly \nhave no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an \nencouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a \nformer and not dissimilar occasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence; the support of your tranquility at home: your \npeace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of \ninfinite movement, that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a \ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, \nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest.--Here, every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nunion of the whole.\n  The north, in an unrestrained intercourse with the south, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.--The \nsouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nnorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the north, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The east, in a like \nintercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water, will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad, or manufactures at home. The west derives from the east \nsupplies requisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of \nstill greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure \nenjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions, to the \nweight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \nside of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as \none nation. Any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential \nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength; or from an \napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be \nintrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater \nresource proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value, they must derive from union, an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government; which \ntheir own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate \nand embitter.--Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor to \nweaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical \n[[Page S2909]] discriminations,--northern and southern--Atlantic and \nwestern; whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that \nthere is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the \nexpedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts, \nis to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot \nshield yourself too much against the jealousies and heart burnings \nwhich spring from these misrepresentations: they tend to render alien \nto each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal \naffection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately had a \nuseful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the negotiation by the \nexecutive, and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the \ntreaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at the event \nthroughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the \nsuspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general government \nand in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in regard to \nthe Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two \ntreaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure to \nthem everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign relations, \ntowards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to \nrely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which \nthey were procured? will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, \nif such they are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect \nthem with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate union, and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.--They serve to organize \nfaction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of party, often \na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, \naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the \npublic administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous \nprojects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome \nplans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual interests.\n  However combinations or associations of the above description may now \nand then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time \nand things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and \nunprincipled men, will be enable to subvert the power of the people, \nand to usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \nafterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system; and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments, as of other human institutions:--that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country:--that facility in changes, upon \nthe credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. \nLiberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little \nelse than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular references to the founding them on geographical \ndiscrimination. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother; forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of \npublic opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit \n[[Page S2910]] demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into \na flame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those intrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominate in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern: some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for through \nthis, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \ncustomary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent \nmust always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or \ntransient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, \nfor life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which \nare the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? and let us \nwith caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper object (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime debate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others, should be excluded; and that, in \nplace of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be \ncultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual \nhatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \nslave to its animosity, or to its affection, either of which is \nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy \nin one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer \ninsult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be \nhaughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of \ndispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and \nbloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \nsometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \ncalculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the \nnational propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would \nreject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation's \nsubservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, \nand other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes \nperhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or \njustifications. It leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation, \nor privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the \nnation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought \nto have been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who \ndevote themselves to the favorite nation, facility to betray or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity; gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils!--Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to \nbelieve me fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. \n[[Page S2911]] Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and \nexcessive dislike for another, cause those whom they actuate to see \ndanger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of \ninfluence on the other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of \nthe favorite, are liable to become suspected and odious; while its \ntools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to \nsurrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, \nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith:--Here let \nus stop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her \nfriendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be \nscrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the \nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard \nthe giving us provocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our \ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n  Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our \nown to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. \nI repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their \ngenuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments, on a \nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended \nby policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy \nshould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them, conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another; that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations, but if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided \nby the principles which have been delineated, the public records and \nother evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice, and by that of your representatives in both houses of \ncongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound, in duty \nand interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it \nis not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any \nthing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without \ninterruption, to that degree of strength, and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that in which I \npromise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking, in the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO. WASHINGTON.\n  United States,\n      17th September, 1796.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2907-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2907-S2911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                READING OF WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order of the Senate of January \n24, 1901, as modified on February 16, 1995, the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] is recognized to read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. THOMAS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government, the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the career of \nmy political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep \nacknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I \n[[Page S2908]] owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has \nconferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which \nit has supported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of \nmanifesting my inviolable attachment, by services faithful and \npersevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have \nresulted to our country from these services, let it always be \nremembered to your praise, and as an instructive example in our annals, \nthat under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every \ndirection, were liable to mislead amidst appearances sometimes dubious, \nvicissitudes of fortune often discouraging--in situations in which not \nunfrequently, want of success has countenanced the spirit of \ncriticism,--the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the \nefforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. \nProfoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my \ngrave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may \ncontinue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence--that your union \nand brotherly affection may be perpetual--that the free constitution, \nwhich is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained--that its \nadministration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and \nvirtue--that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these states, \nunder the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a \npreservation, and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire to \nthem the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection and \nadoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, \nto offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your \nfrequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much \nreflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me \nall important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These \nwill be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in \nthem the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly \nhave no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an \nencouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a \nformer and not dissimilar occasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence; the support of your tranquility at home: your \npeace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of \ninfinite movement, that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a \ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, \nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest.--Here, every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nunion of the whole.\n  The north, in an unrestrained intercourse with the south, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.--The \nsouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nnorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the north, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The east, in a like \nintercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water, will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad, or manufactures at home. The west derives from the east \nsupplies requisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of \nstill greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure \nenjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions, to the \nweight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \nside of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as \none nation. Any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential \nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength; or from an \napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be \nintrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater \nresource proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value, they must derive from union, an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government; which \ntheir own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate \nand embitter.--Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor to \nweaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical \n[[Page S2909]] discriminations,--northern and southern--Atlantic and \nwestern; whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that \nthere is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the \nexpedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts, \nis to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot \nshield yourself too much against the jealousies and heart burnings \nwhich spring from these misrepresentations: they tend to render alien \nto each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal \naffection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately had a \nuseful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the negotiation by the \nexecutive, and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the \ntreaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at the event \nthroughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the \nsuspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general government \nand in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in regard to \nthe Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two \ntreaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure to \nthem everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign relations, \ntowards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to \nrely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which \nthey were procured? will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, \nif such they are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect \nthem with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate union, and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.--They serve to organize \nfaction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of party, often \na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, \naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the \npublic administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous \nprojects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome \nplans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual interests.\n  However combinations or associations of the above description may now \nand then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time \nand things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and \nunprincipled men, will be enable to subvert the power of the people, \nand to usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \nafterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system; and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments, as of other human institutions:--that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country:--that facility in changes, upon \nthe credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. \nLiberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little \nelse than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular references to the founding them on geographical \ndiscrimination. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother; forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of \npublic opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit \n[[Page S2910]] demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into \na flame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those intrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominate in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern: some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for through \nthis, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \ncustomary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent \nmust always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or \ntransient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, \nfor life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which \nare the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? and let us \nwith caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper object (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime debate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others, should be excluded; and that, in \nplace of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be \ncultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual \nhatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \nslave to its animosity, or to its affection, either of which is \nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy \nin one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer \ninsult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be \nhaughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of \ndispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and \nbloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \nsometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \ncalculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the \nnational propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would \nreject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation's \nsubservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, \nand other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes \nperhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or \njustifications. It leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation, \nor privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the \nnation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought \nto have been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who \ndevote themselves to the favorite nation, facility to betray or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity; gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils!--Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to \nbelieve me fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. \n[[Page S2911]] Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and \nexcessive dislike for another, cause those whom they actuate to see \ndanger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of \ninfluence on the other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of \nthe favorite, are liable to become suspected and odious; while its \ntools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to \nsurrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, \nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith:--Here let \nus stop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her \nfriendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be \nscrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the \nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard \nthe giving us provocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our \ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n  Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our \nown to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. \nI repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their \ngenuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments, on a \nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended \nby policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy \nshould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them, conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another; that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations, but if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided \nby the principles which have been delineated, the public records and \nother evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice, and by that of your representatives in both houses of \ncongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound, in duty \nand interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it \nis not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any \nthing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without \ninterruption, to that degree of strength, and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that in which I \npromise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking, in the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO. WASHINGTON.\n  United States,\n      17th September, 1796.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2907-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2911-S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senate will now resume \nconsideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n   [[Page S2912]] Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are continuing the balanced budget \namendment debate, and I am happy that we will have a final vote next \nTuesday, the 28th--at some time probably later in the day that day, \nbecause we will be stacking votes following the 2:15 return from our \nweekly meeting breaks.\n  Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment will help us to \nend this dangerous deficit habit in a way that past efforts have not. \nIt will do this by correcting a bias in the present political process \nwhich favors ever-increasing levels of Federal Government spending.\n  In seeking to reduce the spending bias in our present system--the \nunlimited availability of deficit spending--the major purpose of House \nJoint Resolution 1 is to ensure that, under normal circumstances, votes \nby Congress for increased spending will be accompanied either by votes \nto reduce other spending programs, or to increase taxes to pay for such \nprograms. For the first time since the abandonment of our historical \nnorm of balanced budgets, Congress will be required to cast a \npolitically difficult vote as a precondition to a politically \nattractive vote to increase spending.\n  Section 1 of the proposed amendment would address the spending bias--\nunlimited access by Members of Congress to deficit spending--by \nrequiring a three-fifths vote of each House of Congress before the \nFederal Government could engage in such spending.\n  Such a procedure would not prohibit deficit spending, but would \nsimply reestablish, as a norm, a budget in balance rather than one in \ndeficit. A consensus greater than a normal majority would be required \nto violate this norm.\n  Unless such a consensus exists, Congress would be bound in its \nspending by its available revenues and would be forced to account for \nnew spending in one program or budget area by either reduced spending \nin another area or by increased taxes. The political advantages \nresulting from support for new spending then would be matched, at least \nto some degree, by countervailing political disadvantages.\n  Section 4 of the proposed amendment would reinforce section 1 and \nfurther link tax spending and tax raising by requiring both Houses of \nCongress to approve any bill to increase revenues by a constitutional \nmajority. While section 1 would ensure, as a norm, that Federal \nspending is matched by Federal revenues, section 4 would ensure that \nsuch revenues are not raised without political accountability for \nMembers of Congress. It would also make it less likely that the budget \nwould be regularly balanced by increasingly high levels of taxation. \nThis balanced budget amendment, then, is a spending limit/tax limit \nresolution.\n  As a result, House Joint Resolution 1 effects a subtle, but \nimportant, change in the psychology of the budget process. Under the \npresent system, each spending interest, in effect, competes with the \ntaxpayers to raise the total ante in the Federal treasury.\n  Under a system, however, in which some form of spending ceiling is in \neffect, these same interests suddenly will be competing with one \nanother in order to ensure themselves a certain portion of a fixed ante \nin the Federal treasury. Not only will spending interests have to \nconvince Congress that their favored programs merit funding at a \ncertain level, but they will, in addition, have to establish the \npriority of their programs.\n  A spending ceiling comprised of something beyond mere congressional \nself-restraint will force Members of Congress to view spending requests \nin terms of relative desirability, not simply in terms of whether or \nnot a program is desirable at all, which is currently our rule. It is \nsafe to conclude, I believe, that every program authorized by Congress \nis considered important and desirable, or it would not have passed into \nlaw in the first place. Presumably, we do not pass bills that no one \nwants at all.\n  The balanced budget amendment, however, will introduce an element of \ncompetition among the spending interests into the budget process. \nCongress will be forced to look at the whole spending pie, not just a \npiece of it.\n  In summary, the purpose of House Joint Resolution 1 is to eliminate a \npolitical process that allows Members to avoid having to vote for \nhigher taxes in order to pay for higher spending and to establish a \nmore genuinely neutral environment within which the budget competition \noccurs. The proposed amendment does not define what constitutes or what \ndoes not constitute a responsible budget, but only defines the \ninstitutional framework within which such budgets could be put \ntogether.\n  It is a necessary and appropriate step toward putting our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n                             accountability\n\n  While it is true that much of the enormous growth in Federal \nGovernment spending over the past two decades may be a response to \nevolving notions of the role of the public sector on the part of the \nAmerican citizenry--that is, a genuine shift in the will and desire of \nthe people--it is my contention that a substantial part of this growth \nstems from far less benign factors.\n  In short, the American political process is defective insofar as it \nis skewed toward artificially high levels of spending, that is, levels \nof spending that do not result from a genuine will and desire on the \npart of the people. It is skewed in part because the people often do \nnot have complete information about the cost of programs or about the \npotential for cost growth of many programs. It is skewed in this \ndirection because of the characteristics of the fiscal order that have \ndeveloped in this country in recent decades. It is a fiscal order in \nwhich Members of Congress have every political incentive to spend money \nand almost no incentive to forego such spending. It is a fiscal order \nin which spending decisions have become increasingly divorced from the \navailability of revenues.\n  The balanced budget amendment seeks to restore Government \naccountability for spending and taxing decisions by forcing Congress to \nprioritize spending projects within the available resources and by \nrequiring tax increases to be done on the record. In this way, Congress \nwill be accountable to the people who pay for the programs and the \nAmerican people--including the future generations who must pay for our \ndebts--will be represented in a way they are not now. Congress will be \nforced to justify its spending and taxing decisions as the Framers \nintended, but as Congress no longer does. No longer can Congress just \nsay yes to every special interest group and shove the costs onto our \nchildren or pretend that there are no costs. Every spending decision \nwill be forced to compete with others and subjected to rigorous cost/\nbenefit analysis.\n  Mr. President, this is the essence of responsible fiscal \ndecisionmaking, and is the essence of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have just heard the address of our first President \nof the United States, which we have read to us on an annual basis \nduring the time we celebrate Washington's birthday.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, that that first President, as well as \nmost all subsequent Presidents, would not believe what is going on \ntoday with regard to our taxing and spending policies. They would not \nbelieve that for 26 straight years, we have failed to balance the \nbudget. They would not believe that we have put our country into almost \n$5 trillion of debt, and they would not believe that a current \nPresident would have submitted a budget that has approximately a $200 \nbillion deficit for each of the next 12 years. They would not believe \nthat we are spending and taxing the American people the way we are.\n  They expected that perhaps, during times of war or during times of \nsevere recession or depression, that there might be some deficits run. \nBut they never expected, at the Founding, that we would run deficits \nevery year for 26 straight years, and for most of the last 60 years. I \nthink some of them must be rolling over in their graves.\n  This is a chance for us--because the House of Representatives for the \nfirst time in history has passed a balanced budget amendment, \nessentially the same one that we called up in 1982 and 1986 and last \nyear--to follow suit and for the first time in history submit a \nbalanced budget amendment to the States for their ratification. It is \nworth \n[[Page S2913]] the effort. It is worth the pain. It is something we \nsimply must do.\n  Eighty percent of the American people realize it. We just need 67 \npercent of the U.S. Senate to realize it and vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to support \nthis constitutional amendment to help us to restore sound government to \nthe American people. I think it is the only way we are going to get \nthere and it is the only way we can protect the future or even have a \nfuture of any great value for our children and grandchildren. We owe it \nto them.\n  This is an important vote. It is probably the single most important \nvote of this century. All we need are 67 of those who sit in this \nhallowed body to stand up and say, ``We've had it. We've had enough. \nWe're going to do something about it.'' It is a bipartisan resolution. \nIt is a Democrat and Republican resolution. It has been hammered out \nbetween both sides. It is the first time in history we can do it, and \nwe are going to do something about it. So I urge my colleagues to join \nwith us in passing this balanced budget amendment on to the people in \nthe States to ratify it as part of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have some good news and good news for \nthe Senate.\n  I can report--and I know that my distinguished friend, our President \npro tempore in time and my very dear friend, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, will want to know--that I have just returned from \nPhoenix, AZ, where I had the honor to deliver the Goldwater Lecture at \nArizona State University. I can report that Senator Goldwater is in \ngreat spirits, thriving, active, and irreverent, as usual.\n  I do not want to get any politics into this matter, but just now it \nis the Republicans in Arizona who are mad at him. But, no doubt, those \nreversals will come and go, as they have always done in his wonderful \nlong and still very creative life.\n  The other thing to say is that I gave the lecture on the subject of \nthe matter before us, a balanced budget amendment, and trying to \nrelate, as I have done on the floor earlier, the extraordinary \nachievement which we have had in this country and to a considerable \ndegree the members of the OECD, the Western industrial nations, Japan, \nand others, in modulating to a degree that they have almost \ndisappeared, those huge swings in the economy that seem to be \ndestabilizing the industrial world.\n  Industrialism brought with it a business cycle which was baffling. \nPeople could not understand how one day everybody is at work and a year \nlater everybody is out of work. And unlike the farm--where you are \nalways working whether you are making much or you are starving or not--\nthe unemployed were standing on street corners. The banks were closed, \nindustries padlocked their gates, all sorts of symbolisms of trouble, \ndisorder, instability, which indeed gave rise to hugely radical \nassertions about the need to change the very structure of property, of \nmanagement, of the social order.\n  In a chart which I displayed for the Senate on Monday a week ago, I \nshowed the real growth, the change of GDP that had taken place between \n1890 and 1990. This data, Mr. President, is provided by the Department \nof Commerce, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the chart was \nprepared by the Joint Economic Committee.\n  It is striking the way in which economic growth goes up, crashes \ndown; up, down; up, crashes down; swoops up, down.\n  In the period between 1890 and 1938, which we will call a half \ncentury, the real GDP dropped almost 5 percent on three occasions: in \n1893, in 1914, and in 1938. The exact numbers: 1893, 4.89 percent; \n1914, 4.4 percent; and 1938, 5.1 percent; the 1938 date being well \nremembered as the occasion in which President Roosevelt, the New Deal \nseeming to have revived the economy somewhat, crashed down again \nregardless.\n  Then on two occasions the GDP dropped almost 10 percent. In 1908 it \ndropped 8.2 percent; in 1921 it dropped 8.7 percent. Then in 1932, as \nwe know, it crashed 14.8 percent and we went into the Great Depression, \na period which put at issue the question of whether a liberal, \ncapitalist economy could continue to exist. It was said that obviously \nit cannot. It cannot provide stability in the economy and cannot \nprovide for its people.\n  I mention these occasions--three times we dropped 5 percent or near \nto, twice 10 percent, once 15 percent in a half century. We do not drop \nfrom a zero level; we go down from heights. So, for example, in 1893, \nwe were growing at about 12 percent a year in GDP, and in an instant \nreal growth has dropped below zero to 4.8 percent, a \n15-, 16-, 17-percent plunge. It was known as the panic of 1893. People \nwere thrown into the streets.\n  Then in 1908, for no reason that any person understood and nothing \nthe Government could do--our Government was too small to make much \ndifference in the affairs of the economy at large. We had no national \nbanking system. The Reserve had not yet been created by Carter Glass in \nthis Chamber. Of the great issue of the 19th century, of all the great \nissues we struggled with, the only one we never resolved in the 19th \ncentury was the issue of the banking system. So there was no Federal \nReserve and no monetary policy. It took a long time to get monetary \npolicy, but we could not think about it until we had an instrument to \ndo it.\n  There was also a big drop in GDP in 1946, but that was merely \nassociated with the conversion from a wartime economy. We stopped \nbuilding battleships, which are part of GDP, and down went the economy, \nand in no time you are building Chevrolets and up went the economy.\n  Now, the depression of the 1930's was the great trauma of American \ncapitalism, of free enterprise, and all over the world political \nmovements came to power that said it could not work; fascism in \nGermany; Leninism, Marxism, and similar movements pervaded every \ncountry, not least our own. Their common refrain: this system--\ncapitalism--does not work.\n  If we could look at these swings, we could say there is a case to be \nmade; human beings had never experienced this. But, if we could go back \nto millennia, we would see a rise and fall in the economic production \nassociated with how good the crops were, did it rain, was it a wet \nspring. If the Mongols invaded, there was not much in the way of \neconomic growth in Hungary that year. If the Black Death came along, it \nwould have some effect, but not much. There was not much growth to \nbegin with. Only with industrialism came great ups and downs, and \npeople started saying that this will not work.\n  Then in the middle of the 1930's, the work which we associate with \nJohn Maynard Keynes was done which hit upon the key explanation of what \nwas taking place. Classical economics held that ``all markets clear.'' \nThat, Mr. President, is a technical term. It means that whatever is \noffered for sale will be bought--at a price, not necessarily what the \nseller would wish. But, Mr. President, wages will drop, prices will \ndrop, and markets will clear and there will be full employment and full \nutilization of resources.\n  Economists were able to show that not necessarily. We could reach an \nequilibrium in which a large public of men were out of work, a large \nnumber of plants closed, a large number of mines were not operating. \nWhat classical economics could not account for, suddenly, was \nexplicable. We began, finally, to break the code of the business cycle. \nAnd it is a nice piece of information, if I may say.\n  The first use of this economics, which was associated with the idea \nof underconsumption, you had to stimulate consumption, first use was \nmade in World War II when the problem was overconsumption. And price \nlevels came down in World War II. In 1944, the inflation rate was 2.2 \npercent. Not bad. But Government controlled, to be sure. And then they \nbroke up in 1945.\n  In 1946, with this information at hand beginning to be understood, \nbeginning to be numerate, we started to be able to get numbers for \nthese things. We did not know what the unemployment rate \n[[Page S2914]] was in the Great Depression. We took the unemployment \nrate in the census, decennial census. We took it in the spring of 1930, \nnot much unemployment. In the spring of 1940, rearmament had begun, and \nin the official statistics there was no depression. But people knew \notherwise.\n  The Employment Act of 1946 stated as the goal of the U.S. Government \nthe full utilization of resources, fullest possible--meaning men and \nwomen entering the work force, meaning capital, meaning plant and \nequipment which was capital, and so forth.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers was established. In the early years \nthe economic report of the President was a pretty thin volume, but they \nwere getting the hang of it. By 1946 we had an unemployment rate which \nwas published. We will have the economic report shortly now and we will \nsee that the series as statistics begins in 1946.\n  May I interject here to offer the congratulations of the Senate, if I \nmay so presume, to Dr. Tyson, who the President has announced will \nleave the position of Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and \nbecome head of economic policy within the White House, a position Mr. \nRubin had until he became Secretary of the Treasury.\n  They began to work on this notion of countercyclical behavior by the \nFederal Government. They began to realize--as John Kenneth Galbraith \nhas shown this in his work--when the 1929 stock market crash took \nplace, the Federal Reserve had acted in a way to deepen the decline \nrather than to counter it, the idea of countercyclical spending.\n  I have said before on the floor, Mr. President, that in the early \nyears, the problem that the economists faced, or thought they faced, \nand Presidents agreed and Congress pretty much agreed, was that the \nFederal revenues were too large in the early stages of the business \ncycle; that as the economy began growing, revenues grew. In those days, \nbefore we had indexed the Internal Revenue Code and the tax rates, why, \nthey would grow very fast. Congress did not spend them quickly enough. \nAnd, indeed, there emerged a problem. The Kennedy administration was \nthe first to deal directly with this question--or more correctly, \nproblem--called fiscal drag. Because in 1958, there had been a \nrecession which took growth just a tiny tick below, into a negative \nposition, not 1 percent, but one-half of 1 percent. And then the \nrecovery had begun.\n  But in 2 years, it stalled so that another tick--not the big crashes, \nsmashes, panics but not quite what we wanted. President Kennedy's \neconomic advisers said, ``What do we do?'' They concluded that we had \nto put in place some countercyclical spending. Then I was to be an \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Policy and Planning Research. It is a \nmoment we all remember in our lives, if it comes to us. On my first \nvisit to the Oval Office, I accompanied Secretary Arthur Goldberg, and \nwe had a proposal to raise the pay of Federal employees. The President \nsaid, ``Good idea, we need that.'' And he also decided everybody should \nget at least $100 a year. And we went on like that. It was very early \non. We moved the date of the dividend of the Veterans Administration \nlife insurance forward. Then we gave a double dividend.\n  Then Joseph Pechman at the Brookings Institution, in conjunction with \nWalter Heller, Chairman of the Council, proposed revenue sharing with \nthe States. We proposed a tax cut and, Mr. President, it worked. We \nwent right through. When Arthur Okun gave the last report of the \nCouncil under President Johnson, he said, ``Look, 6 years of unbroken \neconomic growth.''\n  They should have tamped down the economy, given the inflationary \neffects of the Vietnam war spending. And, indeed, when President Nixon \ncame into office, although I believe he had a balanced budget, he also \nhad a recession. But that came out of that.\n  And George Shultz, his first Director of the Budget, in his fiscal \n1973 budget said, ``I am sending a full employment budget which will \nhave a deficit, but the deficit will be the difference between what \nwill be revenue at full employment and less than full employment.'' We \nwere still stimulating.\n  So it went. We had one more tick in the seventies. Then in 1982, we \nhad the only real decline in economic growth in the postwar period. \nEconomic growth, GDP, gross domestic product, dropped 2.2 percent, one \ntime in half a century. There was another slight tick in 1991. But \nagain, just a tick. That had never happened before in the history of \nindustrial societies. It is an immense achievement. It is not a \nDemocratic achievement. It is not a Republican achievement. It is an \nachievement of applied analysis.\n  That is what is threatened. That achievement is what is threatened by \nthis amendment to the Constitution. If it were a statute, I would not \nbe spending my days on the floor. Statutes come and statutes go. This \nis the Constitution; the basic law of the land.\n  Mr. President, when I spoke last Monday, I recounted how in 1979, \nwhen there was a movement among the States to petition Congress to call \na constitutional convention for this purpose, I had asked the then \nChairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Charles Schultze, a \ndistinguished economist from the Brookings Institution, if he would run \nthe numbers from the 1975 recession--a fairly serious recession, which \nPresident Ford had to live with--with a balanced budget amendment. He \nwrote me back to say the computer blew up; we had no countercyclical \nforces we could use, and so the hypothetical economy spiraled down to \nthat equilibrium when there is a high rate of unemployment and a low \nrate of utilization of capital.\n  I mentioned also that we had simulated on our own on a back-of-the-\nenvelope sort of thing. Dr. David Podoff, sometime chief economist on \nthe Finance Committee, more recently minority chief economist, using \nArthur Okun's principles developed in the early sixties, estimated that \nif we had a 3-percent increase in unemployment, some exogenous event--\nMexico goes to ruin, oil prices spiral, whatever--we could end up with \na drop of GDP of 18 percent. That is a depression figure. That was last \nMonday.\n  I see the distinguished sometime once and future President pro \ntempore on the floor. I would like to report to him that in yesterday's \nNew York Times, there is a report of a simulation made in the Treasury \nDepartment. I take the liberty of saying this on the Senate floor. I \nknow where it was made. I know it came about in response to some of our \narguments. And, Mr. President, the story, by Mr. Louis Uchitelle, an \nable reporter, is headed ``The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget. \n``Dismantling a Decades' Old System for Softening Recessions.''\n  Here is the interesting event. I just say that they have simulated \nthe 1991 decline and say, with a balanced budget amendment, \nunemployment would have reached 9 percent. A laid-off worker who \ncollected $12,000 in unemployment pay might have received only $7,000, \nand so forth.\n  Now, sir, I said earlier that the new economics, the learning we went \nthrough, was not a Democratic thing or a Republican thing. It was \napplied social science learning, a collective learning.\n  And so the fascinating thing is that Mr. William Hoagland, the \nRepublican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee, and a very \nable public servant, is quoted as saying--he is in fact, the first \nperson quoted:\n\n       There are risks associated with a balanced budget, and I \n     don't think anyone should deny that. Nevertheless, the debate \n     on the floor has been dominated by what we must do to get the \n     budget in balance, not what the risks of a balanced budget \n     amendment might be.\n\n  Mr. Hoagland expressed surprise that the biggest risk--deeper, more \npainful recessions--had not figured significantly in the debate--\nalthough the Senator from New York and my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland have called attention to this risk in several floor speeches.\n  This is Mr. Hoagland making the statement.\n  They go on to quote a whole series of economists, a sequence of \neconomists saying, ``Does not Congress know what it is doing?''\n  ``Does it not realize what we have achieved?''\n  And now, Mr. President, as I have been talking here long enough, and \nI know others wish to speak, particularly the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, I said I came back from Arizona last evening with \ngood news and good news.\n  First, the good news is that I gave the Barry Goldwater lecture at \nArizona \n[[Page S2915]] State University. Senator Goldwater is in great spirits, \ngood health, active, and being as much a torment to his fellow \nRepublicans as to his fellow Democrats.\n  But the second event was on the way to deliver the lecture, the very \nable president of the university, Dr. Coor, picked me up at the hotel. \nWe had about a 20-minute drive to the university, and I told him what I \nwas going to say. He said, ``Well, now, we all know that, don't we?'' \nThat we went through this great achievement of learning to break out; \nthat capitalism did not disappear; it is the same; and it is not even \nquestioned in the world by this new economics. He said, ``Everyone \nknows that, surely. What's the problem with the Congress?''\n  Now, perhaps I do not want to put those words in his mouth per se. \nBut he said, ``What is the problem?'' I had an idea, and I put it to \nhim at the time. And I will say again, if I get one idea a week at this \npoint, I feel that is a pretty good week. The idea is a very simple \none: There are not enough people around old enough to remember what it \nused to be like. Sir, if you are under 60, you do not know anything \nabout the economic world before we understood countercyclical financing \nby the Federal Government, before the Federal Government got the tools: \nIt has to have a sizable budget. You have to have unemployment \ninsurance, Medicaid, things like that, which automatically happen, a \nFederal Reserve that can take action. I said it has been in place so \nlong that we forgot the pain with which it had to be put in place, the \nhard intellectual work, the accusations. To be a Keynesian was to be a \nRed, somehow. John Maynard Keynes was a liberal, sir. He was not a \nmember of the Tory Party, nor a member of the Labor Party; he believed \ncompletely in the free market, private enterprise. He just wanted the \nfree market to produce lots more goods and keep doing it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question at that point?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator accept the fact, however, that there are \nsome Members in this body under 60 who at least understand the concept, \nif they have not felt the pain directly?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Because they are learned Senators who have read their \nhistory.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield further? And I am delighted to hear \nhe was with my friend, Dr. Coor----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Who served previously as president of the University of \nVermont, and also with our mutual friend, of course, Senator Barry \nGoldwater, with whom we both had the opportunity to serve here in this \nbody.\n  But I tell my learned friend and neighbor from New York something I \njust said to my dear friend from West Virginia, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia. A poll was taken very recently, in the last few days, in \nmy State of Vermont, where a majority of Vermonters said, ``Yes, pass \nthe balanced budget amendment.'' But then a very significant proportion \nsaid, ``But we don't expect it to do anything.''\n  I might say to my learned friend, because I listened to his \ndiscussions and I heard him lay out very much for the President of the \nUnited States at a small gathering a week ago that we should have a \nsense of history, probably the biggest sense of history we ought to \nhave is that this country has amended the Constitution only 17 times \nsince the Bill of Rights. We have done it very carefully. Now we have \n60 or 70 proposals made in the last few weeks to amend the \nConstitution, all of which would fit nicely on a bumper sticker, none \nof which, I would add, would do anything to improve the greatest \ndemocracy in the world and many of which I feel would damage greatly \nthis wonderful country.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I want to say, Mr. President, that the Senator has made \na very important statement. When the painful process, the creative \nprocess of the economic system was taking place in the thirties, \ndemocracy was under assault the world over, and there were more than a \nfew who had given up on it in this United States, and capitalism was \nthought to have been discredited forever; free enterprise was thought \nto be a selfish doctrine put forward by a privileged few, and full \nemployment a nostrum of dreamers, idealists, and probably subversives.\n  Oh, what a time we had, and it was a close-run thing. I joined the \nNavy 50 years ago last July 1. I joined in the middle of a world war in \nwhich the forces we were contending against and with were as opposed to \nour system as any that ever existed in the world, and it was a close \nthing.\n  We have been going on about the Enola Gay. May I say to the Presiding \nOfficer that the real issue was, was Hitler going to get that bomb \nfirst, because the people working on it here knew the people working on \nit there. And we knew what we could think up, they could think up. And \nthe British destroying the heavy water plant in Norway may have made \nthe real difference.\n  It was that close. Do you want to go back to that world? We could do \nit on this floor next Tuesday.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has risen.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield, Mr. President. I yield, whatever.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from New York is making a very \nimportant statement. He discusses the countercyclical forces that come \ninto play automatically in a time of recession. The distinguished \nSenator from Vermont has stated that there are many people who say that \nwe ought to vote for this amendment, but who privately tell him that it \nwill not work.\n  It is a sad commentary--and there are those of our colleagues who say \nthat we need this in the Constitution in order to give us discipline, \nin order to enforce discipline upon us--that statement is a sad \ncommentary on the character of the elected officials of our country----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. To say that we need a new constitutional amendment to \nenforce discipline upon us, so we will balance the budget.\n  This constitutional amendment will have been before the Senate 30 \ndays come next Tuesday. That is the final day of decision. The \namendment was passed in the House, I think, in 2 days.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe so.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Two days.\n  Mr. BYRD. Two days! And there have been some complaints about the \ntime that we have taken in the Senate to debate it.\n  My good friend from Utah, the other day--if the Senator may yield, \nMr. President, without losing his right to the floor, to me?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Our good friend, the Senator from Utah, stated that, \nessentially, there appeared to be some indications that there was a \ndeliberate attempt to delay the vote. Well, there has been a deliberate \nattempt to delay the vote, in order that we can take time to explore \nthis amendment and dissect it, probe into it carefully. But then there \nwas some expression that it was obvious that this was now becoming a \nfilibuster. Of course, anybody who knows anything about filibusters \nknows that this is not a filibuster. There are people in this town who \nwould not know what a filibuster is if they met it on the street. But \nthere is kind of a mental--there is a mindset here in this town, that \nif you discuss a bill 4 or 5 days, or a week or 2 weeks, then there is \na filibuster. I thank God for the United States Senate! I thank God for \nthe United States Senate!\n  If the Senator will be patient--because I do not want him to \ndiscontinue his statement in this very important subject area, which \nwill be vitally affected if we were, God avert, to lose our senses to \nthe point that we would adopt this constitutional amendment. When Rome, \nthe western seat of the Roman Empire, fell in 476 A.D. and the German, \nOdoacer, deposed the impotent, unfortunate, diminutive emperor, whose \nname was Romulus Augustus, the center of authority moved to the eastern \nseat of empire, namely, Constantinople. In Constantinople, there was no \nindependent Senate. There was no independent Senate to challenge the \nemperor's claim of authority over even the church and theology. When \nJustinian, in 532 A.D., ordered his top general, Belisarius, to \nmassacre citizens of Constantinople during the Nika rebellion, \nJustinian----\n  [[Page S2916]] Mr. MOYNIHAN. In the stadium, I believe.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Justinian had 30,000 of the citizens of Constantinople \nmurdered. There was no independent Senate to challenge his authority to \ndo so. With an autocrat like Justinian ruling in the Golden Horn, one \nneed not wonder that the people of Russia, when they formed the Russian \nstate some centuries later, had no Senate to teach them the lessons \nregarding checks and balances and separation of powers, and human \nrights, and limited monarchy.\n  When Ivan the Terrible, Ivan IV, in the year 1570 A.D. massacred \nhundreds--hundreds of citizens in the city of Novgorod, there was no \nindependent Senate to challenge his right to exact such a revenge on \nthose people. Muscovy had no Senate.\n  When Peter the Great built the city of St. Petersburg on the marshes \nand swamps near the Neva River, he brought in tens of thousands of \nslave laborers who met their deaths in the building of that city. Each \nworker was paid 1 ruble per month. But there was no independent Senate \nwith control over the purse and with the power to challenge Peter the \nGreat; no independent Senate to debate at length and to challenge the \nauthority of Peter the Great.\n  When Stalin, in our own time--you do not have to go very far back in \nhistory to remember Stalin and Lenin--when they created the monstrous \ntyranny that spread its tentacles into Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, \nEast Germany, and the Baltic States, there was no independent Senate \nwith power over the purse and the right of unlimited debate to \nchallenge Lenin and Stalin. How many millions of people died under \nStalin? More than 20 million--more than 20 million.\n  So here in America we have a Senate that takes all of 30 days, all of \n30 days, mind you, in discussing an amendment which will forever--\nforever destroy the constitutional system of separation of powers and \nchecks and balances, and the power over the purse, lodged in the \nlegislative branch, as we know that system.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for taking the floor \ntoday. I wish I could have had the privilege of sitting in his classes. \nPerhaps I would know a little something about economics. But I am very \nthankful that I have the opportunity here to listen to him. And I \nlistened carefully.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the distinguished Senator will yield to me for \njust a moment on this point?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I associate myself, first with the remarks \njust made by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, but \nalso with the remarks made earlier by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York.\n  At the risk of dealing with two of the foremost historians of the \nSenate, I would make a slight addition to what was said by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and what was concurred in by \nthe distinguished Senator from New York. The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia said, ``Thank God for the U.S. Senate.'' I would add to \nthat: Thank God for some individuals in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senate gives us the right, under our rules and according to our \nhistory, to speak on these matters. But only if individual Senators do \nit. I applaud the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, for they, as Senators, utilized \nthe opportunity. The Senate, while a great institution, is still made \nup of 100 individuals.\n  I have said, as my friends know, time and time again on this floor \nthat the U.S. Senate should be, and can be, the conscience of the \nNation, but only if individual Members exercise that conscience. I have \nsaid many times on this floor--and I will speak many more times on this \nconstitutional amendment, as I will on some others coming up--let us \nlook back on our 200 years of history. We are the greatest, most \npowerful democracy history has ever known. But we have become so \nbecause we followed our Constitution. We have amended it only 17 times \nsince the Bill of Rights.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I have not seen anything that has occurred in \nthe 54 years of my lifetime that is so important and in such a need of \nchange in our country that we must have this pell-mell rush to amend \nthe Constitution--in just 2 days in the other body. Mr. President, that \nis a shame; that is a disgrace; that is not something to be proud of--\nto say to the American people that in 2 days we took this precious \nConstitution, this great cornerstone foundation of our democracy and we \namended it.\n  Are we not doing a wonderful thing? No. To that I say, for shame. I \nhave no idea how the vote will come out on this. But at least let us as \nSenators stand up and say to the American people that you heard a full \ndiscussion of it, not that it was rushed through because somebody wants \nto make a check mark.\n  I applaud my good friend from West Virginia with whom I have had the \npleasure of serving my 20 years and my friend from New York with whom I \nhave served 18 years, for standing up and reminding people of history. \nThe history lesson does not fit on a bumper sticker or in a 12-second \nspot on the evening news or in a headline. And, unfortunately, I must \nsay it does not fit often enough in the classrooms of the schools of \nthis country. It should, and maybe the U.S. Senate will help bring it \nback.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to express my great appreciation \nto the Senator from Vermont and my revered colleague, the Senator from \nWest Virginia. If he was not in my classrooms, I have been in his \nclassroom for 18 years. I hope it shows, at least to some extent.\n  I mean to propose to act in the manner that the Senator from West \nVirginia spoke of earlier Senate's having done because the emperor. We \nhave a Chief Executive and we owe him our counsel, whether he welcomes \nit or not.\n  Sir, I have to tell you that the Treasury Department analysis of the \ncalamitous potential of this measure, in terms of deepening recessions \nand leaving us with prolonged periods of unemployment, under \nutilization, bringing on crises between groups, between regions--the \nTreasury Department has prepared an analysis of this and that analysis \nis now in the White House waiting to be cleared or released. I say \nagain, that analysis is now in the White House waiting to be cleared.\n  There is a simple fact hereabouts in this city--it is almost a secret \nbut everybody knows it--which is that there are those who would like to \nsee this issue go away. Pass the amendment, see what happens in 5 \nyear's time or 3 year's time, not in 2 year's time. That would be the \nmost profoundly irresponsible act I can imagine. I say, sir, that we \nare not asking for anything. Whether it is associated with executive \nprivilege, this is simply the economic analysis that the profession \nwill produce at this time. But we have not heard from the White House. \nThere was one op ed article by Dr. Tyson that was not bad. But we have \nnot heard from the White House what every President since John F. \nKennedy has known and understood, that this would strip the Federal \nGovernment and particularly the executive branch of those automatic \nstabilizers which have kept us from plunging and trashing and dropping \ninto ruin in the century that preceded the Employment Act of 1946.\n  Mr. President, I hope I am heard. I will know better by the end of \nthe day. If I have not been heard, I will be on the floor first thing \nin the morning. I will stay here until it is clear that our request has \nbeen refused or what I hope is that it be granted so that we can help \nthe President and avoid a calamity, which may be decided by one or two \nvotes.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nNew York Times article, ``The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget, \nDismantling a Decades-Old System for Softening Recessions,'' be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 1995]\n\nThe Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget--Dismantling a Decades-Old System for \n                          Softening Recessions\n\n                          (By Louis Uchitelle)\n\n       The unemployment rate, which peaked at 7.7 percent after \n     the last recession, could have reached 9 percent if a \n     balanced budget had been required, Government and private \n     [[Page S2917]] economists estimate. And a laid-off worker who \n     collected $12,000 in unemployment pay might have received \n     only $7,000 or so.\n       Such estimates of the potential economic impact are not \n     emphasized very much, however, in the debate over the \n     balanced budget amendment. So far, the battle has focused on \n     its value as a tool to shrink government or to discipline \n     spending. But if the amendment is enacted, the side effect \n     would be huge: a system that has softened recessions since \n     the 1930's would be dismantled.\n       ``There are risks associated with a balanced budget, and I \n     don't think anyone should deny them,'' said William Hoagland, \n     the Republican staff director for the Senate Budget \n     Committee. ``Nevertheless, the debate on the floor has been \n     dominated by what we must do to get the budget in balance, \n     not what the risks of a balanced budget amendment might be.''\n       Mr. Hoagland expressed surprise that the biggest risk--\n     deeper, more painful recessions--had not figured \n     significantly in the debate, although Senator Daniel P. \n     Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, \n     Democrat of Maryland, had called attention to this risk in \n     several floor speeches. ``The reason must be that the \n     advocates of a balanced budget see the benefits to the \n     economy as far outweighing the negatives associated with \n     cyclical downturns,'' Mr. Hoagland said.\n       ``That must be what is going on.''\n       No benefit seems to hold more sway than the view that the \n     amendment would shrink the Federal Government by restricting \n     its power to tax and to spend. A dollar not collected and \n     spent by the Government is a dollar left in the hands of the \n     private sector. And the private sector invariably invests \n     money more efficiently than the Government, this view holds.\n       ``The people have spoken clearly that government is too big \n     and we need to do something about it,'' said Robert Hall, a \n     Stanford University\n      economist who favors smaller government. ``The problem is \n     that the balanced budget amendment is a heavy-handed \n     solution and risky.''\n       The biggest risk is to the nation's ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' which have made recessions less severe than \n     they were in the century before World War II. The \n     stabilizers, an outgrowth of Keynesian economics, work this \n     way: When the economy weakens, outlays automatically rise for \n     unemployment pay, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid. \n     Simultaneously, as incomes fall, so do corporate and \n     individual income tax payments. Both elements make more money \n     available for spending, thus helping to pull the economy out \n     of its slump.\n       The problem, of course, is that the stabilizers make the \n     deficit shoot up--by roughly $65 billion as a result of the \n     1990-1991 recession, according to the Treasury Department. \n     Under the balanced budget amendment, Congress and the \n     Administration would be required to get the budget quickly \n     back into balance, through spending cuts, higher tax rates, \n     or a combination of the two--perhaps even in the midst of a \n     recession.\n       ``The Government would become, almost inevitably, a \n     destabilizer of the economy rather than a stabilizer,'' said \n     Joseph Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of \n     Economic Advisers. Many economists share that view.\n       Absent the stabilizers, every 73-cent drop in national \n     income in the last recession would have become a $1 drop, \n     said Bradford DeLong, deputy assistant Secretary of the \n     Treasury, who as a Harvard economist studied this dynamic and \n     recently updated his research. Of the 27 cents in cushioning, \n     20 cents came from falling tax revenue and 7 cents from the \n     higher spending.\n       Economists outside the Government offer similar estimates. \n     Ray Fair of Yale University, for example, said for every $10 \n     billion decline in national income during a recession, the \n     deficit rises by $2 billion, as the stabilizers kick in with \n     their higher spending and lower tax revenue.\n       ``We ought not to give up the stabilizers,'' Professor Fair \n     said. ``That would be very Draconian.''\n       Nearly every economist agrees that the American economy \n     requires, if not stabilizers, some substitute method for \n     offsetting recessions in an era of balanced budgets. And \n     those who favor the amendment are no exception.\n       ``It would be a disaster to lose the stabilizers,'' said C. \n     Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International \n     Economics, who endorses the amendment as a necessary step if \n     the nation is to afford the high cost of Social Security and \n     Medicare for the baby boom generation, which reaches \n     retirement age early in the next century.\n       Mr. Bergsten notes that the amendment, as now worded, would \n     permit Congress to bring back the stabilizers by a three-\n     fifths vote in both houses. The vote would permit the \n     necessary deficit spending to finance the stabilizers.\n       While a three-fifths vote is a big hurdle, Mr. Bergsten and \n     others argue that Congress would get used to authorizing the \n     necessary deficits during recessions. Nevertheless, he would \n     prefer a different solution. Once through the painful process \n     of balancing the budget by 2002, as required by the \n     amendment, then the Government should run budget surpluses in \n     years of strong economic growth and full employment, Mr. \n     Bergsten said.\n       The surpluses would cover the rising costs of the \n     stabilizers during recessions. ``You could go down to a \n     balanced budget in the hard years, and still give the economy \n     a little stimulus,'' he said.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the \n     surplus needed to pay for the stabilizers during a recession \n     as severe as that of 1981-1982, the worst since World War II, \n     would be 1 percent of the national income during robust \n     periods of full employment, and perhaps as much as 1.5 \n     percent.\n       That would mean an annual surplus in today's dollars of $70 \n     billion to $100 billion, rather than the nearly $200 billion \n     or so in annual deficits expected under current policy. Most \n     of the $200 billion is to help pay for programs like highway \n     construction and new weaponry that have fixed costs and do \n     not fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economy, as \n     unemployment pay, food stamps, tax revenues and the other \n     stabilizers do.\n       Some economists--including Milton\n        Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics who is with the \n     Hoover Institute--hold that the stabilizers, despite the \n     ballyhoo, are no longer so important. The Federal Reserve, \n     through monetary policy, can more than offset their \n     disappearance by lowering interest rates an extra notch or \n     two to give the economy an additional stimulus in hard \n     times.\n       ``I have looked at many episodes in the world in which \n     monetary policy went one way and fiscal policy the other, and \n     I have never found a case in which monetary policy did not \n     dominate,'' Mr. Friedman said. He favors a balanced budget \n     amendment that would shrink the Federal Government by putting \n     a ceiling on the tax increases that could be enacted to \n     balance the budget.\n       But the Clinton Administration and even Federal Reserve \n     officials question whether monetary policy could alone handle \n     the task of reviving an economy in recession. The \n     stabilizers, they note, kick in automatically--before the \n     Federal Reserve and most economists often realize that the \n     economy is falling toward recession.\n       A recession might be well along and getting deeper before \n     the Fed recognized the problem and began to drop rates. The \n     lower rates, in turn, would not be felt in the economy for a \n     year to 18 months, the traditional lag. And even if the Fed \n     acted quickly enough, the economy would behave in new and \n     different ways without the stabilizers.\n       ``My guess is that we would get it wrong the first time we \n     went into recession, making that recession much deeper than \n     it should be,'' said a Federal Reserve official, who spoke on \n     condition that he not be identified. ``But we would learn \n     from that experience and do a better job thereafter.''\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am, as I have said, going to speak again \non the question of the balanced budget. I think that the speeches made \nby the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York are such that I hope a lot \nof people will listen to them.\n  Obviously, I myself am in great agreement. As I have stated, the \nSenate owes a thanks to both of them. But more than that, the United \nStates owes thanks. This is a matter that should be debated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont and the distinguished Senator from New York for their comments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2911-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2917-S2920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A CHANCE FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an historic day in the Republic of \nIreland and Northern Ireland. I want Senators and the American people \nto be aware of the significance of what the people of that island have \ndone today.\n  For the past quarter of a century, Unionists who favor continued \nBritish control over Northern Ireland, and Catholics who favor \nunification of Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, have been \nlocked in a cruel war over the status of the North. Over 3,200 people \nhave died, many of them innocent civilians caught in the crossfire \nbetween the IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups.\n  Mr. President, as an American of Irish descent, the violence in \nNorthern Ireland has had a profound affect on me. I have always \nunequivocally opposed the use of violence by both sides in Northern \nIreland. Irish-Americans who care about the land of our ancestors \ncondemn violence without reservation and support a peaceful settlement.\n  My father felt he would never live to see real peace in Northern \nIreland, and \n[[Page S2918]] he did not. But I believe that my father's son will see \nit, both as an American and as a U.S. Senator.\n  In December 1993, our hopes were raised for an end to the bloodshed, \nwhen former Irish Prime Minister Reynolds, and British Prime Minister \nMajor, declared that the future status of Northern Ireland should be \ndecided by agreement of the people there. That declaration began a \npeace process that led to the IRA cease-fire last August. Two months \nlater Protestant paramilitary groups stopped shooting, and the cease-\nfire has held.\n  Since then, the British Government has taken several steps to reduce \ntensions in the North, including ending daytime military patrols in \nBelfast. In the Irish Republic, a Peace and Reconciliation Forum has \nbrought Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into informal talks \nwith representatives of the Government and other parties.\n  Today in Belfast, in what I believe offers the best hope for peace in \nthe 25-year history of the conflict, Irish Prime Minister Bruton and \nPrime Minister Major announced the publication of a long-awaited \nFramework Document which provides a basic for future negotiations on a \npeace settlement.\n  Mr. President, late yesterday afternoon, I returned from Dublin, \nBelfast, and London, where I met with leaders and individuals \nrepresenting all points of view on the future of Northern Ireland. I \nwent there over the weekend because I knew the peace process was at a \ndecisive point.\n  I wanted to give encouragement. I also wanted to pay tribute to the \npeople of both Northern Ireland and the Republic, Catholic and \nProtestant, who are courageously trying to find a way to a better \nfuture.\n  The Framework Document, which sets out a joint vision for the future \nof both Irish and British Governments, is a tremendous step forward. It \nreaffirms the principles of self-determination, of the consent of the \ngoverned, of democratic and peaceful means, and of full respect and \nprotection for the rights and identities of both traditions.\n  From the conversations I had, both in the Republic of Ireland and \nNorthern Ireland, with people of all political and religious \ntraditions, I realized the importance of the document and of bringing \npeople together who so fervently want to be brought together. Members \nof my staff, Tim Rieser and Kevin McDonald, who accompanied me, heard \nthe same thing.\n  Since the framework's aim is to encourage all parties to come to the \nnegotiating table, nobody is going to be content with all of it. If it \nwere written in such a way that any one group found it totally \nacceptable, it would guarantee that the rest would find it totally \nunacceptable. The Unionists with whom I met condemned the Framework \nDocument long before its release. I suggested they recognize it for \nwhat it is--a basis for discussion, not a final blueprint. I urged them \nto come to the negotiating table with their own ideas, not to condemn \nthe process before even giving it a chance.\n  Mr. President, in Belfast I got a sense of the fear Unionists feel. \nFor centuries they have thought of themselves as British, and today \nthey fear that the British Government is abandoning them. Some longed \nfor a past that never was, dreamed of a future that never would be, and \nthey fear a present they do not understand.\n  It made a profound impression on me. Change in Northern Ireland is \ninevitable, but the Framework Document should threaten no one. It would \ngive a majority of the people of Northern Ireland the right to decide \ntheir future. It is equally important to recognize that any lasting \npiece, any healthy society, muse be rooted in equal justice. The \nfundamental civil rights of both Catholics and Protestants must be \nprotected in Northern Ireland.\n  Everywhere I went, I heard praise for the role President Clinton has \nplayed in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. I was told \nthat not since the days of President John F. Kennedy has an American \nPresident been so interested in what is happening. It is clear that \nwithout his personal involvement we would not have seen this day.\n  I want to praise our Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith, who has taken up \nthe cause for peace and encouraged the parties to move forward. And I \nwant to praise especially those parties, many of whom have been enemies \nfor decades, perhaps for centuries, who are willing to come together.\n  In Dublin and Belfast I told Unionists and Nationalists the same \nthing, that the U.S. Government will support this effort fully, and \nwith even-handedness.\n  But the real work of peace will be done by them. Both have legitimate \naspirations, and both traditions must find a way to accommodate one \nanother. We cannot, nor can any other country dictate what that outcome \nwill be. The parties must find it for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I am under no illusion that a peaceful future in \nNorthern Ireland is assured. Immense difficulties lie ahead. To put the \npast behind, to build peace out of bloodshed, to find common ground \nwhere there has been so much hatred and distrust. But from all that I \nheard during my brief visit there, there is a new spirit emerging; a \nwide recognition that violence has failed; a new determination to find \nanother way.\n  When mothers in Belfast sat with me and told me they did not want \ntheir children to face the kind of horror and violence that they have, \nit is not a feeling of Protestants or Catholics, it is a feeling of \nmothers throughout Northern Ireland. It is a feeling that should be \nlistened to by the leaders, because the people do not want to go back \nto the violent days of the past.\n  Those mothers spoke of their children, who are going to live most of \ntheir lives in the next century. The leaders must decide what kind of a \nlife they will have. The children cannot, but it is they who will be \nmost affected. And if you have hatred and violence, prejudice and bias \ndirected toward a child, does it make any difference whether that child \nis Protestant or Catholic? Those children have a right to expect their \nleaders to show courage and a sense of responsibility for the future \nand to give them a chance to live in peace.\n  Lasting peace means urgently dealing with the terrible problem of \nunemployment in the north. People need to have confidence in their \ngovernment, but they also need jobs; they need economic security as \nwell as physical security.\n  In Belfast, I saw some of the accomplishments of the International \nFund for Ireland which the United States and European countries have \nsupported since 1983. I can attest to the important work the Fund is \ndoing to provide jobs in areas where unemployment among Catholics runs \nas high as 60 percent. The Fund's efforts have also brought together \nCatholics and Protestants in common endeavors where in the past there \nwas virtually no contact between them.\n  And in speaking to members of the Orange Order in Comber near \nBelfast, I encouraged Unionists there to apply to the Fund and work \ntogether to bring jobs and a sense of security and a sense of hope in \nthe future for their people.\n  President Clinton, in recognition of the Fund's accomplishments and \nthe critical stage the peace process has reached, has proposed \nincreases in our contributions in 1996 and 1997.\n  The Fund is a transitional program until real investment can take \nroot in the north. A trade and investment conference is planned for May \nin Washington, and it is eagerly awaited by people in both Northern \nIreland and the Republic. President Clinton's selection of Senator \nGeorge Mitchell as his Special Adviser on Economic Initiatives in \nIreland is not only indicative of the President's commitment to support \npeace there, it also ensures the success of the conference.\n  Again, in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, and in the \nUnited Kingdom, I heard person after person praise the choice of George \nMitchell, knowing the respect that is felt for him by both Republicans \nand Democrats in our country and by the President of the United States.\n  I am reminded of what Senator Mitchell, quoting Franklin Roosevelt, \nsaid to an audience in Dublin: In the dark days of our Great \nDepression, President Roosevelt said ``the only thing we have to fear \nis fear itself.'' He also said, ``the best social program is a job.'' \nThat will be Senator Mitchell's work as the Presidents Special Adviser, \nand the work of all the people there.\n   [[Page S2919]] Mr. President, the island of my ancestors is at an \nhistoric turning point. Today's publication of the Framework Document \noffers a real chance for an end to a conflict that has horrified so \nmany for decades.\n  I want to commend the Irish and British Governments and all the \nparties who are seeking a better future for the people of Northern \nIreland.\n  Mr. President, for the first time I have a sense of hope that peace \nis at hand in Northern Ireland, which my late father so desperately \nwanted. I have a belief that his son and his grandchildren will see it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements of Prime \nMinisters Bruton and Major and a summary of the Framework Document be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                 Summary--A New Framework for Agreement\n\n       These proposals:\n       Reaffirm the guiding principles of self-determination, the \n     consent of the governed, exclusively democratic and peaceful \n     means, and full respect and protection for the rights and \n     identities of both traditions;\n       Provide for an agreed new approach to traditional \n     consitutional doctrines on both sides:\n       The British Government will propose changes to its \n     constitutional legislation, so as to incorporate a commitment \n     to continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of \n     the people living in Northern Ireland, and a commitment to \n     exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous impartiality on \n     behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland, in a way which \n     does not prejudice their freedom to determine Northern \n     Ireland's constitutional status, whether in remaining a part \n     of the United Kingdom or in forming part of a united Ireland;\n       The Irish Government will introduce and support proposals \n     for changes in the Irish Constitution, so that no territorial \n     claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary \n     to the will of a majority of its people is asserted, and so \n     that the Irish Government recognise the legitimacy of \n     whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the \n     people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional \n     status;\n       Commend direct dialogue with the relevant political parties \n     in Northern Ireland in developing new internal structures;\n       Propose a North/South body, comprising elected \n     representatives from, and accountable to, a Northern Ireland \n     Assembly and the Irish Parliament, to deal with matters \n     designated by the two Governments in the first instance in \n     agreement with the parties;\n       Describe ways in which such a body could work with \n     executive harmonising or consultative functions, by way of \n     authority delegated to its members by the Assembly;\n       Envisage that all decisions within the North/South body \n     would be by agreement between the two sides;\n       Set out criteria for the designation of functions, and \n     suggest a range of functions that might be designated from \n     the outset, for agreement with the parties;\n       Envisage the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish \n     Parliament being able, by agreement, to designate further \n     functions or to move functions already designated between the \n     three categories;\n       Envisage that the body will have an important role in \n     consultation with the two Governments in developing an agreed \n     approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges \n     and opportunities of the European Union;\n       Envisage a Parliamentary forum, with representatives from \n     new Northern Ireland institutions and the Irish Parliament to \n     consider matters of mutual interest;\n       Envisage a new and more broadly based Agreement between the \n     British and Irish Governments to develop and extend co-\n     operation;\n       Envisage a standing Intergovernmental Conference which \n     would consider matters of mutual interest, but not those \n     transferred to new political institutions in Northern \n     Ireland;\n       Envisage that representatives of agreed political \n     institutions in Northern Ireland may be formally associated \n     with the work of the Conference;\n       Provide for a complementary undertaking by both Governments \n     to ensure protection for specified civil, political, social \n     and cultural rights.\n       These proposals do not provide for joint authority by the \n     British and Irish Governments over Northern Ireland. They do \n     not predetermine any outcome to the Talks process. Agreement \n     by the parties, and then by the people, is the key.\n                                                                    ____\n\nIntroductory Remarks by the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), Mr. John \nBruton, TD, at Belfast Launching of Joint Framework Document, February \n                                22, 1995\n\n       Today's new framework for agreement is a landmark event in \n     the affairs on this island.\n       The two Governments are presenting to the political parties \n     in Northern Ireland, and to the Irish and British peoples, a \n     document which is the most detailed expression to date of our \n     views on the subject of Northern Ireland.\n       The Prime Minister and I hope that the Framework Document \n     will receive calm and measured consideration over the days \n     and weeks ahead.\n       It is an important and serious text, offered as an aid to \n     discussion and negotiation. It presents our best judgment of \n     what might be an agreed outcome future talks involving the \n     two Governments and the political parties.\n       We commend it to the parties for their careful \n     consideration and we look forward to discussing it in detail \n     with them at the earliest opportunity.\n       May I at this point pay a special tribute to my colleague \n     the Tanaiste and his officials and to the Northern Ireland \n     Secretary of State Patrick Mayhew and his team. Their \n     determined efforts over many months have brought us to \n     today's new framework for agreement.\n       The proposals which it contains are, we believe, balanced \n     and fair and threaten nobody. No party need fear this \n     document.\n       To the nationalist and republican people, the document:\n       Reaffirms that the British Government have no selfish, \n     strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and that \n     they will uphold the democratic with of a greater number of \n     the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they \n     prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland;\n       Says that the British Government will enshrine in its \n     constitutional legislation the principles embodied in this \n     new framework for agreement by the amendment of the \n     Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by \n     appropriate new legislation;\n       It will also be important to nationalists that both \n     Governments consider that new institutions should be created \n     to cater for present and future political, social and \n     economic inter-connections within the island of Ireland. \n     These institutions will enable representatives of the main \n     traditions, North and South, to enter agreed relationships. \n     This is the purpose of the North/South body proposed in this \n     document.\n       To the unionist and loyalist people, I would point out that \n     the document commits the Irish Government to ask the \n     electorate to change the Irish Constitution. The change \n     proposed will address Articles 2 and 3 in the following ways:\n       It would remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of \n     legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary \n     to the will of its people;\n       It would provide that the creation of a sovereign united \n     Ireland could therefore only occur in circumstances where a \n     majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally chose to \n     be part of a united Ireland.\n       It is also important to unionists that the document also \n     contains a recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy \n     of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the \n     people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional \n     status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union \n     or a sovereign united Ireland.\n       The proposals will challenge the two traditions on this \n     island but it will do so in an even-handed way. Neither \n     tradition need fear its contents. As I have emphasized at \n     every appropriate opportunity, it is a framework for \n     discussion and not a blueprint to be imposed over the heads \n     of anyone. Its purpose is to facilitate, not pre-empt, \n     dialogue. At the end of the day, the people of both North and \n     South respectively will have the final say.\n       The document is our carefully considered response to many \n     suggestions, from the parties and others, that it would be \n     helpful to have the view of the two Governments as to what \n     might be an agreed outcome from future talks.\n       We are asking the parties to come and talk to us, openly \n     and candidly, about these proposals. We believe that, taken \n     in the round, they offer a basis for structured discussions \n     leading to a new agreement.\n       We believe that they do. It is our hope that the political \n     parties, having given them the attention they deserve, will \n     take a similar view.\n       There can be no doubt about the enormous desire on the part \n     of the ordinary public--here, in the rest of Ireland and in \n     Britian--for the earliest possible resumption of political \n     dialogue.\n       The ending of all campaigns of paramilitary violence last \n     autumn has created an unrivalled opportunity for such \n     dialogue to take place with a reasonable prospect of a \n     successful conclusion.\n       I join the Prime Minister in appealing to all the parties \n     concerned to grasp this opportunity.\n       The Framework Document is our judgement of how things can \n     best be taken forward. We have, in our view, the best \n     opportunity in a generation for a lasting political \n     settlement. We owe it to the peoples of both of these islands \n     to put that opportunity to the test.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Opening Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. John Major, MP, \n  at a Joint Press Conference With the Taoiseach, John Bruton, TD, To \n  Launch the Joint Framework Document, Belfast, Wednesday 22 February \n                                  1995\n\n       There is one reason, above all, why the Taoiseach and I \n     have come to Belfast today.\n       We wish to offer our proposals here in Northern Ireland--to \n     Northern Ireland's people and their representatives.\n        [[Page S2920]] We seek to help peace, but only the people \n     of Northern Ireland can deliver it.\n       So let me say to them:\n       These are our ideas, but the future is up to you;\n       You have an opportunity now which has not been there for \n     many years;\n       An opportunity to work together to build a better future \n     and a lasting peace.\n       Our proposals stem from the talks process launched four \n     years ago, in March 1991.\n       It was agreed then by the two Governments and the four \n     participating parties that the process would have three \n     strands. It would seek a new beginning for:\n       Relationships within Northern Ireland;\n       Relations between the North and South of the island of \n     Ireland;\n       And relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic.\n       We agreed that it was only by addressing all these \n     relationships together than agreement would be found across \n     the community in Northern Ireland.\n       At this press conference, the Taoiseach and I are \n     publishing the document ``A New Framework for Agreement'' \n     which deals with the second and third of these strands. A \n     little later this morning I shall put forward a separate \n     document proposing new arrangements within Northern Ireland--\n     which is of course a matter for the British Government and \n     the Northern Ireland parties alone.\n       Our proposals are based on several principles: self-\n     determination, consent, democratic and peaceful methods, and \n     respect for the identities of both traditions.\n       Consent is and will remain paramount in our policy.\n       It is the democratic right and the safeguard of the people \n     of Northern Ireland.\n       No proposals for the future would be workable, let alone \n     successful, without the consent and active support of all \n     Northern Ireland's people. For they are the people who would \n     carry them out and whose lives would be affected.\n       That is why any eventual settlement must be agreed by the \n     parties; supported by the people of Northern Ireland in a \n     referendum; and approved by Parliament--a triple consent \n     procedure.\n       Our constitutional matters, each Government has offered \n     crucial new commitments in this Framework Document:\n       As part of a balanced agreement the British Government \n     would enshrine its willingness to accept the will of a \n     majority of the people of Northern Ireland in British \n     Constitutional legislation. We shall embody the commitments \n     we made in the Downing Street Declaration;\n       The Irish Government would introduce and support proposals \n     to change its Constitution, so that ``no territorial claim of \n     right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the \n     will of a majority of its people is asserted''. This is a \n     very important proposal that I welcome unreservedly;\n       These changes would offer Northern Ireland a constitutional \n     stability which it has not hitherto enjoyed. Its future \n     status, by agreement between the two Governments, would be \n     irrevocably vested in the wishes of a majority of its people\n       In line with the three-stranded approach, we propose new \n     institutions for North/South cooperation.\n       The North/South body which we outline would comprise \n     elected representatives chosen from a new Northern Ireland \n     Assembly and from the Irish Parliament. It would draw its \n     authority from these two bodies. It would operate by \n     agreement, and only by agreement.\n       On the UK side, the North/South body would initially be set \n     up by legislation at Westminster, as part of a balanced \n     agreement. It would come into operation following the \n     establishment of the new Assembly. Thereafter, it would be \n     for the Assembly and the Irish Parliament both to operate the \n     body and to decide whether its functions should be extended.\n       Like all of our proposals, the new North/South institutions \n     will be a matter for negotiation. But the way should now be \n     open for beneficial cooperation between North and South \n     without the constitutional tensions which have been such \n     impediments in the past. We have made suggestions about areas \n     which might be covered in this cooperation, to the advantage \n     of both sides. Like all aspects of the document, they will be \n     for discussion and agreement between all concerned.\n       The European Union already operates cross-border programmes \n     between Northern Ireland and the Republic, as it does \n     elsewhere. We propose that North and South could usefully \n     work together in specific areas, to take advantage of what \n     the EU has to offer. But the making of United Kingdom policy \n     and the responsibility for representing Northern Ireland in \n     the European Union will remain solely in the hands of the UK \n     Government.\n       In the third of our Strands, we outline a new broader-based \n     agreement to take the place of the 1985 Anglo-Irish \n     Agreement.\n       The 1985 Agreement was criticised because the Northern \n     Ireland parties had not contributed to it. Our new proposals \n     are offered for discussion in the talks process. We want to \n     hear the views of the parties; and we envisage that their \n     representatives would be formally associated with the future \n     work of the Intergovernmental Conference.\n       The Intergovernmental Conference would allow concerns to be \n     expressed about any problems or breaches of the Agreement. \n     But there would be no mechanism for the two Governments \n     jointly to supervise or override either the Northern Ireland \n     Assembly or the North/South body. It would be for each \n     Government to deal on its own with any problems within its \n     own jurisdiction. This would not be a question for joint \n     decision, still less joint action. It is important to be \n     clear about this, as there have been concerns on this score.\n       Our two Governments have worked with patient determination \n     to agree on this Framework, and I am grateful to the \n     Taoiseach, his predecessor, and the Tanaiste for their \n     efforts and their spirit of accommodation.\n       Our proposals seek to stimulate constructive and open \n     discussion and give a fresh impetus to the political \n     negotiations. The outcome of those negotiations will depend, \n     not on us, but on the consent of the parties, people, and \n     Parliament.\n       It is not for us to impose. But what we propose is an end \n     to the uncertainty, instability and internal divisions which \n     have bedeviled Northern Ireland.\n       For over four years as Prime Minister, I have listened \n     intently to the people of Northern Ireland. I have visited \n     them, consulted them, travelled more widely than any \n     predecessor throughout the Province, and held meetings with \n     political leaders, church leaders, council leaders, community \n     leaders, and people from all walks of life.\n       It is my duty as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to \n     maintain the Union for as long as that is the will of the \n     people. It is a duty in which I strongly believe, and one \n     which these proposals protect. Just as people cannot be held \n     within the Union against their will, so equally they will \n     never be asked to leave it in defiance of the will of the \n     majority.\n       Consent and free negotiation are fundamental to me, and \n     they are the foundation stones of this Joint Document.\n       In the four years of the Talks process, we have travelled a \n     long way, but not yet far enough.\n       I know that many people will be worried, perhaps even \n     pessimistic, about the future.\n       But, as we look at the hurdles ahead, let us also consider \n     where we have come from.\n       The dialogue of the deaf has ended.\n       For four years, we have been engaged in talks.\n       The three-stranded approach is becoming a reality.\n       The Joint Declaration has been accepted.\n       The British Government is engaged in talks with \n     paramilitaries on both sides.\n       We have had nearly six months of peace.\n       Prosperity and a normal life are returning to Northern \n     Ireland.\n       The principle of consent, once accepted only by Unionists \n     and the British Government, is today accepted almost \n     everywhere.\n       These are some of the gains for everyone in Northern \n     Ireland.\n       More gains can lie ahead if we have the courage to conduct \n     ourselves with patience, with foresight and with \n     consideration.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for 7 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from West \nVirginia, and I appreciate his courtesy at all times.\n  This has been a very interesting and energetic debate. We used up \nalmost all the time. There have been very few \n[[Page S2921]] quorum calls. I want to compliment people on both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of the issue. It has been a hard-fought \ndebate. But it has been fought fairly. I believe that those on the \nother side of this issue feel very deeply just like those of us who \nwant this balanced budget amendment feel very deeply ourselves. So I \nappreciate it.\n  We have had an extensive debate. I think it has been fair. It has \nbeen many, many days. We are now in our 15th day of actual debating, 3 \nsolid weeks of time on the floor, and actually more if you talk about \nthe normal running of the Senate. We have debated a whole raft of \nissues. In the next few days, the final days of this debate leading up \nto next Tuesday when we finally vote on this matter, we will have a \nnumber of amendments and give every Senator an opportunity to speak \nagain or to bring up his or her amendments.\n  There has not been--I just want to remind everybody in this country \ntoday--that there has not been one balanced budget since 1969; not one \nin 26 years. There have been only seven balanced budgets in the last 60 \nyears. Only seven. The national debt is now over $4.8 trillion. That is \nmore than $18,500 for each man, woman, and child in America. Every one \nof us is in debt better than $18,500 and going up every day.\n  The national debt has increased $3.6 trillion since the Senate last \npassed this balanced budget amendment back in 1982 when I, as chairman \nof the Constitution Subcommittee, along with Senator Thurmond and \nothers, brought it to the floor for the first time in history. We \npassed it through the Senate by the requisite two-thirds vote plus two. \nBut the House killed the amendment, and since that date in 1982, the \nnational debt has gone up $3.6 trillion.\n  In 1994, last year, gross interest against the national debt exceeded \n$296 billion. Just to put that in perspective, that interest that we \npaid last year was more than the total Federal budget or total Federal \noutlays in 1974. Just think about it. We spent more just paying \ninterest against the national debt--that is money down the drain--than \nall of the outlays of the Federal budget, all of the spending of the \nFederal budget, in 1974. And that $296 billion interest payment last \nyear is more than the total revenues of our Government were in 1975.\n  In 1994, gross interest consumed about one-half of all personal \nincome taxes.\n One-half of all personal income taxes paid just went to pay interest \nagainst the national debt in fiscal year 1994. We spent an average of \n$811.7 million each day just on gross interest. That is $33.8 million \neach hour and $564,000 each minute that we were spending on gross \ninterest alone.\n\n  Net interest payments in 1994 were 5\\1/2\\ times as much as outlays \nfor all education, job training, and employment programs combined. Just \nthink about that. Net interest payments--that is net interest \npayments--in 1994 were 5\\1/2\\ times as much as all we spent for \neducation, job training, and employment programs in this country in the \nFederal Government.\n  In the 24 days since we first began this debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, the amendment that we have debated for years, the \nnational debt has increased--I guess I better put that up here--has \nincreased $19,906,560,000.\n  I have to put these indicators up because we have not done so. This \nis the 19th day. Here is the 20th day since we started the debate. That \nis $16.5 billion. Here is the 21st day since we started the debate. \nThat is $17.5 billion, almost. The next one is the 22d day since we \nstarted this debate. That is $18,247,680,000, and last but not least is \nthe--excuse me, this is the 23d day, $19 billion--$19,077,000,000--and \nfinally, on the 24th day, just since we started the debate on this \nmatter, we are now up to $19,906,560,000 in national debt that \nincreased over those 24 days. Now, that is about $75 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the United States of America.\n  I hope they have enjoyed this debate. It is not as good as ``Les \nMiserables,'' but it is about as expensive. Now, can you imagine what \nwe are doing on an annual basis? We are going up by leaps and bounds--\nalmost $1 billion a day in national debt. So this is really important. \nThis is important stuff.\n  I do not find any fault with those who feel otherwise except that I \nthink they are wrong. Something has to be done. We can no longer fiddle \nwhile Washington burns. We have to change the old way of doing things \naround here. We have to start doing things in a better way.\n  This amendment, as imperfect as it may be, is still the most perfect \nwe have ever brought to either House of Congress, and it is a \nbipartisan consensus amendment. This amendment is something that would \nget us to make priority choices among competing programs and force us \ntoward trying to live within our means. And it does it in a reasonable \nand worthwhile way.\n  So I hope our colleagues will realize this because we have 52 of 53 \nRepublicans who are going to vote for this. All we need are 15 \nDemocrats out of the 47. We are hopeful we will find 15 of them, and if \nwe do, we will be on our way to solving some of these terrible problems \nthat are besetting our country, and we will be on our way to helping \nthe future of all of our children and grandchildren.\n  I thank my dear friend from West Virginia. I look forward to his \namendment, and I thank him for allowing me this time just to set the \ntone for the debate beginning this afternoon.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah \nfor his many courtesies and also for the work that he has done on this \namendment.\n  I do not expect everybody to agree with me by any means on this or \nanything else, but I sometimes find it hard to understand why others \ndisagree with me especially on this subject. But every person has a \nmind of his own, and I do not set myself up as a paradigm of thought or \naction. I do think, however, that when the distinguished Senator from \nUtah makes reference to the need for a constitutional amendment in \norder to force us to exercise the discipline to balance the budget, it \nseems to me that that is a very sad commentary on the character of \nelected public officials; to say that we have to have a constitutional \namendment to give us the discipline. I remember the words of H.L. \nMencken, who was a great American writer and author and editor, who \nsaid that ``There is always an easy solution to every human problem--\nneat, plausible, and wrong.''\n  This constitutional amendment, in my estimation, falls into that \ncategory of being an easy solution to a very serious problem; it is \nneat, sounds plausible, but it is wrong.\n\n       The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he \n     crossed himself by 't: and I cannot think but in the end the \n     villanies of man will set him clear.\n\n  Mr. President, this constitutional amendment unequivocally states \nthat:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year--\n\n  That means every year.\n\n     unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of \n     Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of \n     outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.\n\n  The two must balance, ``unless three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House of Congress shall provide by law,'' meaning passed by both \nHouses and signed by the President, ``for a specific excess of outlays \nover receipts by a rollcall vote.''\n  It cannot even be done by unanimous consent.\n  Of course, there is nothing in the present Constitution which says \nthat we have to have a rollcall vote on everything that passes either \nbody. The Constitution does require a rollcall vote if one-fifth of \nthose present in either House request a rollcall vote. I have no \nproblem with requiring a rollcall vote. I do not mind that. And I do \nnot think other Senators mind it. I have not missed a rollcall vote now \nin over 10 years. I have cast around 13,500 rollcall votes since I have \nbeen in the Senate, not counting the rollcall votes that I answered \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives. The waiver has to be by a \nrollcall vote.\n  And what of the economic effects of this mandate for yearly budget \nbalance?\n In fact, larger spending cuts or tax increases would be required in \nslow growth periods than in periods of robust growth, exactly the \nopposite of what is needed to stabilize a weak economy and prevent \nrecessions--exactly the opposite.\n\n  The amendment, therefore, not only risks making recessions of greater \nfrequency, depth, and duration, but mandating a balanced budget by \nfiscal year \n[[Page S2922]] 2002--a year for which a deficit of $322 billion is \nprojected by CBO--or within 2 years following ratification, whichever \nis later--would also impose constraints on the economy far in excess of \nthose entailed in the 1993 budget law--a double whammy--a double \nwhammy--that can stifle economic growth and cause unemployment to soar. \nThe three-fifths waiver provision would prove ineffective as most \nrecessions are already underway before they are recognized as such.\n  So, any recession may already be upon us. It may have been several \nmonths in duration already before it is recognized as such. Recessions \noften are not recognized as recessions until a month, 2 months, several \nsubsequent months are passed. How are we, then, going to waive, by a \nthree-fifths vote, this requirement, so as to pass a resolution for a \nspecific excess of outlays over receipts? How are we going to do it?\n  Suppose we have already passed the close of the fiscal year before we \nrealize that we are in a recession? The end of the fiscal year, \nSeptember 30, has gone. How are we, then, going to waive by a three-\nfifths vote this requirement so as to provide a law for a specific \nexcess of outlays over receipts for that fiscal year which has just \npassed. How are we going to do that?\n  We hear it said that the American people have to balance their \npersonal budgets. That is one of the shibboleths that we have heard so \noften: The American people balance their budgets. Every family has to \nbalance its budget, we hear. States have to balance their budgets--that \nis another shibboleth. States have to balance their budgets, why can \nthe Federal Government not balance its budget? Let us take a closer \nlook at these popular notions. First, I do not think anyone would argue \nthat businesses should not be able to borrow. We all know that \nbusinesses borrow to finance the purchase of high technology and \nequipment. Businesses borrow to modernize plants and equipment.\n  They would go under if they could not borrow. They have to keep their \nequipment modernized in order to compete with the other businesses in \nthe community or nearby. They have to borrow in order to finance the \npurchase of high technology and other equipment. Businesses borrow to \nmodernize plants and equipment. States borrow. My State of West \nVirginia borrows. Other States borrow to pay for roads and schools and \nother capital projects.\n  The chart to my left sets forth the total State government debt, \nfiscal years 1960 through 1992. And the source of the data on which the \nchart is based is the Bureau of The Census. Viewing the chart to my \nleft, the viewers will note that in 1960, the total of State government \ndebt for 1960 is $18.5 billion, of which the amount shown in the red \ncoloring, $9.2 billion, was nonguaranteed debt. The portion that is \nshown in the yellow color is that portion of the debt which is backed \nup by the full faith and credit of the State.\n  Now, notice how the State debt has grown, both the nonguaranteed debt \nand the full faith and credit portion of the debt. In 1992, the total \nState government debt was $371.9 billion, of which $272.3 billion was \nnot backed up by the full faith and credit of the State but was \nnonguaranteed debt. That nonguaranteed debt costs the State taxpayers \nmore than the guaranteed debt, in terms of interest. That portion that \nis colored yellow on the chart, that portion of the total State debt \nwas backed up by the full faith and credit of the State.\n  Therefore, one will see that in the course of 32 years, 1960 to 1992, \nState debt in this country increased from $18.5 billion to $371.9 \nbillion. In other words, roughly, as I calculate in my cranium, the \ntotal State debt had increased about 20 times--20 times. State debt in \n1992 was 20 times greater than it was in 1960.\n  Who says that States balance their budgets? The States do not balance \ntheir budgets. They are in debt. They are heavily in debt. They borrow \nto invest, in most cases; but they borrow to pay for roads and schools \nand other capital projects. Many of the Governors will say, ``My State \nbalances its budget, why can the Federal Government not balance its \nbudget?'' Those Governors know better than that. They know that the \nStates operate on two budgets, a capital budget and an operating \nbudget. So why attempt to mislead the people into thinking that oranges \nare apples or that apples are oranges or that black is white or that \nwhite is black, when the case is plainly not such?\n  The Federal Government operates on a unified budget. It does not have \ntwo budgets, a capital budget and a operating budget. So the States are \ndifferent. But do not let anybody ever tell you that the States are not \nin debt. They are heavily in debt and they are going more into debt all \nthe time, as we can see from this chart to my left.\n  Then there are those who say that the American families balance their \nbudgets--a lot of people believe that. But when they stop to think \nseriously about the matter, they will come to the conclusion that most \nAmerican families really do not balance their budgets. They borrow. \nThey borrow to buy what? To buy an automobile. What else? To buy a \nhome. I know, because I have had to borrow in my lifetime to buy a \nhome. My wife and I have worked hard to pay off the mortgage on the \nhome. We were in debt. We did not balance our budget.\n  We balanced our operating budget, but we did not balance our total \nbudget. We had to borrow. We borrowed the money. We did not balance our \nbudget, did we, in the sense that we are talking about here when we say \nthat the Federal Government ought to balance its budget? No. We \nborrowed the money, and we paid back, over a period of years, the \nprincipal and the interest on that borrowed money.\n  We hear much these days about a so-called Contract With America. The \nso-called Contract With America. That is a big joke. In pursuance of \nthat so-called Contract With America, the other body adopted this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget in 2 days--2 days! There \nis not a town council in this country anywhere that would not spend 2 \ndays--at least 2 days--in determining whether or not to issue a permit \nto build a golf course. Two days! Our Founding Fathers spent 116 days, \nfrom May 25, 1787, to September 17, both inclusive--116 days, behind \nclosed doors. They stationed sentries at the door, and the windows were \nkept shut to prevent eavesdropping on what was being said on the \ninside. George Washington instructed the delegates to not leave any \npapers lying on the desks and to not discuss the proceedings with \nanyone on the outside. We cannot even have a caucus without someone \nhaving to come out of the caucus and spill his guts to the press.\n  At that Constitutional Convention, on one occasion, someone \ncarelessly left his convention notes on the desk overnight. George \nWashington, the next day, called attention to the fact that someone had \nleft his notes, and Washington was upset. He threw the notes onto a \ntable and said: ``Let him who owns it take it.'' Nobody claimed the \nnotes. Washington walked out of the room. It was serious. The Framers \nmet for 116 days; yet here, in 2 days time--2 days--the other body \nadopts this constitutional amendment.\n  Thank God for the U.S. Senate! The Founding Fathers certainly knew \nwhat they were doing when they created the Senate, a place where we can \nhave unlimited debate. It can only be limited by a cloture motion or by \nthe willful entering into a unanimous-consent agreement on the part of \nall of the Members.\n  This constitutional amendment is part of the so-called Contract With \nAmerica. I read about it every day. The newspapers keep a running \nmarker on the so-called contract--how many days have gone by, and what \nhas passed the House, and all that.\n  Well, I once signed a contract myself. But not the so-called Contract \nWith America. I signed a contract once upon a time and I have a replica \nof it here on this chart. This was entered into on May 25, 1937, almost \n58 years ago. Let us see what this contract says. Mind you, now, one of \nthe shibboleths in this debate is that the American families balance \ntheir budgets. I consider myself as being an average American. I once \nhad to work in a gas station, which was my first job after graduating \nfrom high school in 1934. Then I became a produce salesman. I sold \ncabbage, turnips, rutabagas, watermelons, peaches, pears, apples, \nradishes--all those nice things. I used to spread them on my produce \ncounter. Then I \n[[Page S2923]] became a meat cutter. I worked as a meat cutter for a \nnumber of years.\n  While I was working in this meat shop for Koppers Stores, I entered \ninto this contract. It is not the so-called Contract With America, you \nunderstand. This contract cost me $189.50. What did I get out of this \ncontract? No Contract With America is as bona fide as this contract \nwas. If I had broken this contract, I would never have come to the U.S. \nSenate. Here is what it said:\n  ``Store number 30.'' You see, Koppers Stores was an organization that \nhad a number of stores in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and some other \nStates. The customer, who was he? Robert Byrd. Date, May 25, 1937. That \nwas 4 days before I got married. I am still married to my first wife. \nOn May 25, 1937, I entered into that contract. What does it say?\n\n       This conditional sales agreement between Koppers Stores, \n     Division of Koppers Coal Company, a Delaware Corporation, \n     hereinafter called Vendor--\n\n  I probably did not know what ``vendor'' meant at that time. I had \njust graduated from high school three years before. I was out of high \nschool 16 years before I started to college.\n\n     and Robert Byrd, residing at Stotesbury, House No. 207 . . . \n     in the County of Raleigh, State of West Virginia . . .--\n\n  Here is what was in the contract: A five-piece bedroom suite \nconsisting of one vanity, one bed, one chest, one night table, and one \nbench, valued at $189.50. Here is what the contract said.\n\n     . . . which articles Purchaser agrees to use and keep in like \n     good order and for which Purchaser agrees to pay in cash or \n     scrip of the above-named company as follows: $5 on delivery \n     of this agreement, the receipt of which is hereby \n     acknowledged, and the sum of $7.50, twice each month, payable \n     on the two Saturdays which are nearest to the tenth and \n     twenty-fifth days of each month at the offices of the above \n     named company, for 13 months . . .\n       . . . or until the total amount of $189.50 shall have been \n     paid, and Purchaser hereby assigns to Vendor out of any wages \n     due to Purchaser from Purchaser's employer, semimonthly, the \n     said sums so payable semimonthly to Vendor under the terms \n     hereof until said total amount shall have been paid, and \n     hereby authorizes and directs his employer to deduct said \n     sums on the days aforementioned from wages due him on such \n     days, and to pay the same to Vendor, after which total \n     payment the title to the above listed property shall pass to \n     Purchaser without encumbrance.\n\n  See, not until I have paid that $189.50 did the title pass to this \npoor old butcher boy.\n\n       It is understood, however, that pending such total payment, \n     title to said property is reserved and remains in Vendor. And \n     it is agreed that Purchaser shall not, without the consent of \n     Vendor, remove said articles from Raleigh County, nor sell, \n     mortgage, or otherwise dispose of Purchaser's interest in \n     them.\n       And it is agreed that if Purchaser should be in default--\n\n  Get this.\n\n     in the payment of any of the installments of purchase money \n     due hereunder, without the written consent of Vendor, or if \n     Purchaser should sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of \n     purchaser's interest in any of the above listed property, or \n     remove any of said property from Raleigh County, then the \n     Vendor, its successors and assigns, shall have the right to \n     retake possession of said articles and deal with them in \n     accordance with the statutes for such cases made and provided \n     and in so doing, enter and, if necessary, break into any \n     house, place or premises where said articles may be, provided \n     the same may be done without breach of the peace; or the said \n     company may, at its option, rescind this sale.\n       Witness the following signatures and the seal of Purchaser \n     this 25th day of May, 1937.\n\n  And here is yours truly, ``sign here,'' it says, ``Robert Byrd.'' \nThis is it! That was my contract--$189.50.\n  Now, that is about what every family in America has to experience \nfrom time to time in buying a house, buying a car, buying a bedroom \nsuite, buying a refrigerator, buying a farm.\n  My foster father bought a farm in the mid-1920's. Did he pay for it \nin cash? No. He had to go in debt for it. I remember that we lived in \nMercer County at that time. He had a gentleman sign his note. The man's \nname was Eads--a Mr. Eads. I forget the first name, but he lived at \nCamp Creek in Mercer County, West Virginia. He signed the note for \n$1,800. It was a 26-acre farm. It was not a great farm; just two \nhillsides that came together down in the hollow where a creek meandered \nits way down the valley. Sometimes it became a swirling treacherous \nstream when the rains came.\n  But he went into debt for that farm, $1,800, along about 1925-1926. I \nwas in about the fifth grade. My dad had to go in debt.\n  So that is the story as to how American families ``balance'' their \nbudgets.\n  So don't let it be said that the Federal Government should balance \nits budget like ``every family in America balances its budget.'' Only a \nfew fortunate families, relatively speaking, are able to balance their \nbudgets. Families borrow to buy a farm, or farm equipment, or to \nfinance a college education. Many parents borrow money to finance the \ncollege education of their sons and daughters. In fact, the American \npeople have borrowed billions of dollars, as shown on the chart to my \nleft, for myriad reasons.\n  This chart to my left indicates the consumer debt from installment \nloans in billions of dollars. This excludes real estate, which amounts \nto over $3.5 trillion.\n  In 1980, the consumer debt in this country was $292 billion. It has \ngone up every year, has increased, with the exception of 2 years. In \n1991 and 1992 there was a slight drop. In 1992, it dropped to $731 \nbillion. But in 1994, September, the consumer debt in this country from \ninstallment loans was $880 billion. That does not count real estate \ndebt. Real estate debt that the American people owe is over $3.5 \ntrillion--over $3.5 trillion--for their homes and farms. But other than \nreal estate, consumer debt itself from installment loans went from $292 \nbillion in 1980 to $880 billion in 1994. In other words, in 14 or 15 \nyears, it increased from close to $300 billion to almost $900 billion, \nalmost three times as much.\n  Those peoples are borrowing to make an investment, for the most part. \nThey are investing in a roof over their heads when they borrow money \nfor their homes. They are investing in a brighter future for their \nchildren when they borrow money for college loans. These are \ninvestments that families make in the future. Surely no one would \nadvocate passing a law that would prohibit that type of borrowing. \nSurely no Senator would stand on this floor and offer a bill that \nmandated that a family or a business or a State of this Union would be \ndenied all loans unless those loans could be paid in full within 12 \nmonths.\n  Yet, under this amendment, unless three-fifths of the whole number of \nboth Houses vote to allow Federal borrowing on an annual basis, the \nFederal government will be denied the methods that most businesses, \nState and local governments, and families use to finance investments \ncritical to their proper functioning, economic prosperity, stability, \nand well-being. We would be making it nearly impossible for the Federal \ngovernment to ever again make a substantial investment in its people, \nand in their future unless it could be totally paid for each and every \nyear. Never mind the merit of the investment. Never mind the wisdom or \nthe need of the investment. There is only one standard which must be \nmet and that is the standard of ability to completely offset any costs \nyearly.\n  I know there is the out, there is the escape hatch, of three-fifths \nof the Members may vote to waive this mandate.\n  What about the argument that 49 States have some type of statutory or \nconstitutional balanced budget requirement, so why should we not have a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Federal Constitution? This argument is \nsimplistic, perhaps interesting, but really not relevant. The States, \nunlike the Federal government, are not required to raise and support \narmies, not required to provide and maintain a navy, not required to \nprovide for the common defense and general welfare of the United \nStates. Nor do they carry the responsibility for the conduct of \ninternational relations or for the fiscal and economic policy of the \nNation. Moreover, there are fundamental differences in Federal and \nState fiscal and budgeting structures. Balanced budget requirements for \nStates generally affect operating budgets but not capital budgets, \nwhereas the Federal government operates on a unified budget. Operating \nand capital budgets are not separate and distinct in the Federal budget \nas they are in State budgets. This proposed balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution would require the total Federal budget to be \nbalanced, including capital investment, \n[[Page S2924]] pension funds, and operating expenditures, and it would \nrequire such a budget each and every year.\n  Furthermore, balanced budget requirements and practices at the State \nlevels leave much room for evasion, so that not everything meets the \nnaked eye. Revenues and expenditures are often shifted from one fiscal \nyear to the next, off-budget agencies are often used, program and \nfunding responsibilities are shifted to county and local governments, \nshort-term borrowing and borrowing from pension funds are common at the \nState level.\n  Much State borrowing is made through off-budget, non-guaranteed debt \ninstruments which require higher interest payments. The States are in \ndebt. We better believe it. The Governors say, ``We balance our \nbudgets.'' Mr. Reagan used to say, ``Well, we balanced our budget in \nCalifornia, the States have to balance their budgets.'' ``The States \nhave it, why not let me have it?'' Mr. Bush would say the same thing. \n``They balance their budgets, why not the Federal Government?'' But in \nfact, they do not. The States are in debt, but they hide it.\n  On another front, Mr. President, the three-fifths requirement to \nwaive the requirements of section 1 would have the real effect of \ndiluting the power of the small States of this country. I hope that the \nrural States and smaller States will take a long, hard look at this \nprovision. If this amendment is ratified, we are going to have to \nbalance this budget, come--I will not say the word ``hell,'' I will use \nthe word Abaddon or Sheol, but as some would say--hell or high water, \nin any and every fiscal year--recession, depression or not, unless \n``three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \nprovide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \nrollcall vote.'' Now, that dilutes the voting strength of the small- \nand medium-sized States in this country. It puts into the hands of the \nlarge States vast bargaining power.\n  Let me illustrate my point. I will take only six States. How many \nvotes would be required to defeat any waiver? It only takes two-fifths \nplus one vote of either House. The Senate might unanimously support a \nwaiver of section 1 in a given year. In the Senate, all the States are \nequal. This is the only forum in this Government in which all the \nStates--large States, small States, middle-sized States--are equal. \nLittle West Virginia is equal to the mighty State of California. West \nVirginia has three votes in the other body. Three votes. California has \n52. Two-fifths plus one of the other body, can thwart the waiver. That \nis where the voting strength of the small States would be diluted. \nThere are 435 Members of the other body. One-fifth is 87. Two-fifths is \n174. All that is needed in the House to block the waiver of section 1 \nwould be 175 votes. Now, on the chart to my left. Viewers will \nrecognize six States that have a total of 177 votes; California, with \n52; New York, with 31; Texas, with 30; Florida, with 23; Pennsylvania, \nwith 21; and Illinois, with 20. That adds up to 177 votes. Two votes to \nspare. It only takes 175 votes in the other House to thwart a waiver of \nthis requirement in this new constitutional amendment. We could \nsubstitute Ohio for Illinois, substitute 19 for 20, and if we do that \nwe have 176 votes. So we still have one vote to spare.\n  Remember that 175 votes will block the waiver of section 1, or the \nwaiver of section 2. If we substitute Ohio for Pennsylvania, Ohio with \n19, Pennsylvania with 21, and put Ohio in with 19 votes, we hit it \nright on the nose--right on the nose, 175 votes.\n  Therefore, under this scenario, 6 States have by virtue of the \nprovision in the proposed constitutional amendment outvoted the other \n44 States.\n  How do small States feel about that? The big States can have the \nability to band together and bargain. If those six States stood solidly \nin the House, they could say to the whole Senate, they could say to the \nrest of the Members of the House ``We will not budge unless you give to \nus this or that.'' The voting power of the other 44 States will be \nrendered nugatory. Small States had better take a good, hard look at \nthe fine print with this constitutional amendment. And Senators who \nrepresent small States had better take a hard look because in the other \nbody, small States will not wield nearly the power as would the large \nStates. The people of the small States and the newspapers in the small \nStates had better take notice. Small States are going to be left out in \nthe cold. It will be a perpetual winter of discontent. Perhaps it would \nonly be in an extreme situation, and it would be, that six States would \nline up as they are lined up on the charts, but it is possible. Small \nStates would be penalized under this amendment.\n  It might not be 6 States, it might be 8, might be 10, it might be 15. \nMake no bones about it, small States will be penalized under the \namendment. Make no bones about it.\n  Now let us take a look at the sections of the amendment involving \nlimit on the debt. Under House Joint Resolution 1, the debt limit \ncannot be increased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each \nHouse votes to do so by rollcall.\n  I will read it:\n\n       Section 2, the limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \n     an increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Increases in the debt limit often muster only a bare majority, and \nthen, with some difficulty. In fact, the debt limit has been raised 29 \ntimes over the period February 1981 through August of 1993 and in only \ntwo of those instances did three-fifths of the whole number of both \nHouses vote to increase the debt limit. But, on only two of those \noccasions did three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses vote to \nincrease the debt limit over the period of February 1981 through August \nof 1993. This means that on only two occasions did the Congress meet \nthe supermajority requirements of this balanced budget amendment. To \nfurther illustrate the difficulties of requiring a supermajority vote \nto raise the debt limit I quote from a letter which I received from the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, Dr. Alice Rivlin. She \nwrites in part ``* * * the amendment's debt limit provisions would lead \nto financial brinkmanship. It would permit a minority, in the House or \nthe Senate, to hold the Federal Treasury hostage whenever the nation's \nfinances require the issuance of additional debt.'' This is an \nexceedingly irresponsible requirement. It is a ``doomsday'' device. \nUsing the debt ceiling to force Congress and the President to come \ntogether on spending cuts or revenue increases in order to avoid a \npresumed deficit, while holding the American people hostage is fraught \nwith problems. So what happens if Congress fails to extend the debt \nlimit? The Treasury would cease to issue new debt. Writing checks for \nany purpose would be severely curtailed. There could be no assurance \nthat social security checks could be issued.\n There could be no assurance that payments could be made to our \nmilitary men and women, or our judges, the President, Congress, or \nanyone else. Even interest payments on our current debt obligations \ncould not be assured. Payments for unemployment benefits, farm price \nsupports, Medicare bills, and child nutrition programs would be, at \nbest, intermittent, if made at all--if made at all. Even basic \ngovernment services could not be assured. The Federal government would \nbe in chaos.\n\n  A vote for this constitutional amendment is a vote for delay, at \nleast until the year 2002. It is as phony as a $3 bill. I have never \nseen a $3 bill, just as I will never see a balanced budget through this \namendment. It is a cop out. It will straitjacket the Government in \nrecession, and it will force us to overload services and programs on \nthe States, and, in the end, it will open the way to litigation, and \nthe invitation to the courts of this country to become the super-\nOffices of Management and Budget and involve themselves in the \nlegislative control over the purse.\n  This could be rightly named the ``lawyer's amendment'' or the \nconstitutional amendment for the benefit of lawyers. ``The first thing \nwe do, let's kill all the lawyers,'' Shakespeare said in the second \npart of Henry VI. ``The first thing we do, let's kill all the \nlawyers.'' The lawyers are going to have a field day on this amendment, \nbecause it is going to open up the way to litigation, and it will be an \nopen invitation to the courts of this country to become the super-\nOffices of Management and Budget and involve themselves in the \nlegislative control over the purse. It \n[[Page S2925]] would enthrone the judges of this country with the power \nto tell the people where the money will be spent and how revenues will \nbe raised. These judges will become unelected representatives of the \npeople appointed for life. The end result would be taxation without \nrepresentation, and we fought one war over that principle a little over \n200 years ago.\n  The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in \nwhich the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an \nimminent and serious military threat to national security and is so \ndeclared by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House, which becomes law. This is section 5.\n  I am going to read section 5 of the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget:\n\n       The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for \n     any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. \n     The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint \n     resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House, which becomes law.\n\n  Mr. President, if the Nation found itself in a situation so serious \nthat the Congress passed a declaration of war, then certainly the \nCongress would exercise this waiver, I should think. No doubt about it.\n  Declarations of war have been known to be in effect for many years \nfollowing the termination of the actual fighting war--which might \ncreate a problem here.\n  However, as a practical matter, the United States has been involved \nin three wars and numerous other military engagements over the past 50 \nyears and none of them has been conducted under a declaration of war.\n  The Korean war under the auspices of the United Nations; the war in \nVietnam; the Persian Gulf war, and numerous other military engagements \nin the past 50 years were conducted without a declaration of war.\n  Section 5 goes on to provide for a waiver of the balanced budget \nrequirement if the Congress passes a joint resolution, by a majority of \nthe whole number of each House, declaring that the United States is \nengaged in a conflict that poses imminent and serious military threat \nto the national security. This would appear to provide the flexibility \nrequired, but it is easy to envision scenarios where this scheme would \nbreak down.\n  If a military emergency develops late in a fiscal year and the \nPresident, as Commander in Chief, takes immediate steps to address the \ncrisis, such as happened in Operation Desert Shield, then how would the \nfunding be affected? Even if the Congress passed a resolution \nsupporting the President's initial action, the situation might not \nclearly meet the test of ``imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security.'' The Congress might be deeply divided on the \npolicy, with no majority of the whole number of either House supporting \nthe President's action. Let us remember that the resolution authorizing \nthe use of force in the Persian Gulf passed the Senate by a vote of 52 \nto 47. If such a situation did not meet the test of section 5 and \nthree-fifths of the Congress would not vote to waive this amendment as \nprovided in section 1, then the Nation could find itself with a \nCommander in Chief forced to operate in violation of this \nconstitutional requirement. Unfortunately it is a very possible \noutcome. Moreover, America's ability to respond to national emergencies \neven if a waiver were granted could be seriously impaired because, for \nthe first time in the history of our nation, we will be shackling our \ndefense preparedness to other unrelated factors.\n  America's defense preparedness could, if this amendment becomes law, \nbe determined by shifts in the overall economy or cost growth in \nentitlement programs. This would inject great uncertainty and very \nlikely chaos into our defense planning when what is needed, especially \nin the area of defense, is long-term dependability, predictability, and \nstability. Budgeting for defense under the balanced budget amendment is \nespecially unwieldy because of the long-lead time needed for our \nimportant weapons systems. Many years of research and development are \nneeded to ensure that our forces can respond to emergencies and are \nnever outgunned. Programs cannot be started and stopped at the whim of \nan out-of-balance budget, caused by a rise in interest rates or \nunforeseen growth in entitlement programs. We cannot recruit and train \nmilitary professionals\n adequately in a climate of constant budget uncertainty. Defense \npreparedness and effectiveness cannot result when the funds for a \nstrong defense are uncertain or in peril from year to year.\n\n  Mr. President, this balanced budget amendment is plagued with \nproblems. They are problems which cannot be rectified because they \nimpose fiscal rigidity upon the nation's economic and fiscal policies. \nThe amendment promotes a paralysis of the nation's ability to act to \nprotect itself in a crisis. It amounts to a lockjaw, a tetanus economic \npolicy both now and forevermore. It is a bad idea whose time never was, \nand it deserves to be soundly defeated.\n  It seems to me that some of the most disturbing flaws in this most \ndisturbing Constitutional amendment are to be found in section 5 \nbecause section 5 sets up an obstacle course--deliberately constructs \nhurdles and traps--which must be conquered before we can deal with a \nthreat to our national security. Additionally, when section 5 is \ncoupled with section 1 and section 3, the President and the Congress \ncan both be put in a perfectly ludicrous situation with regard to the \nprotection of our fighting men and women and the national security \ninterest.\n  Section 1 states that three-fifths, ``* * * of the whole number of \neach House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of \noutlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.'' Suppose we are involved in \na military conflict which crosses from one fiscal year to another. But, \nthen let us also suppose that the conflict appears to be winding down, \nand for a time it appears that there is not ``an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security,'' and so the Congress does not \nwaive the provisions of the article.\n  Then let us further suppose that the conflict flares up toward the \nend of the fiscal year and our fighting men and women are at risk and \nthe battle is raging. The President of the United States is forced \nunder this amendment and under section 3 to submit a balanced budget \nevery year. He is forced to try to guess at what the costs of the \nconflict might be and, if they are going to be large, to savage some \nother part of the budget in order to try to pay for the conflict. Or he \ncan just ignore the situation and trust that the Congress will bail him \nout and either muster the three-fifths vote to pay for the costs of the \nconflict at the end of the fiscal year or pass a joint resolution \nwaiving the appropriate provisions of the amendment.\n  I would not want to be a President charged with protecting American \nlives under those circumstances. I would not want to be a President \ncharged with protecting the national security under those \ncircumstances. I would not want to be a general in the field under \nthose circumstances. I would not want to be the father of a son or a \ndaughter or grandfather of a grandson or granddaughter fighting in that \nconflict. I would not want to be an ally of a nation with that kind of \nconvoluted uncertainty lurking behind its ability to make good on its \ncommitments.\n  I think we have a right to believe that other nations likewise would \nhave some qualms about being our ally under those conditions. Nations \nthat are our allies would certainly not feel that they could count on \nthis Nation in a moment of criticality.\n  A dedicated minority could so hamstring a President that he is unable \nto continue his commitment to our fighting men and women and to our \nallies in a conflict. A devious enemy could use the hurdles and traps \nwhich we are constructing with this ill-conceived proposal to affect \nthis Nation's ability to wage a war.\n  Why in the world would any nation want to set up such a vicious snare \nfor its own national security interests?\n  Why would any other nation want to line up with us, knowing that it, \nthe other nation, could not depend upon us to deliver the three-fifths \nrequirement or to deliver the majority of the total membership of both \nHouses in a critical situation?\n  I wonder if the authors of this amendment really sat down and thought \nabout the impact of this ill- \n[[Page S2926]] conceived idea upon our nations security interests? We \nhave heard all of this talk about protecting the defense budget from \ncuts under the amendment, but have the proponents really played out the \nconsequences of sections 1, 3, and 5 in the event that we are engaged \nin lengthy military operations?\n  I believe that the proponents have become so obsessed with the idea \nof ramming through a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nthat they have put all other concerns on the back burner. They are \nwearing huge and heavy blinders. While blinders may be useful to help a \nnervous horse run a race, they serve human beings, who must keep their \neyes on many priorities, very poorly indeed.\n  This amendment so rewrites the constitution, so shifts the balance of \npower among the three branches, and so thoroughly rearranges the checks \nand balances that it is in effect anticonstitutional.\n  Now, obviously, it will not be unconstitutional if the Congress \nadopts it and it is ratified by three-fourths of the States. It will \nnot be unconstitutional because it will then be part of the \nConstitution. But it will be anticonstitutional in the sense that our \nframers had in mind when they created a system of mixed powers, checks \nand balances, with the power of the purse, power to tax, power to \nappropriate funds lodged in the legislative branch.\n  I believe that the adoption of this amendment will have the impact of \nshredding the constitution as we have traditionally known it. Such \nconfusion will abound, such litigation will occur, such unintended \nsnares and bottlenecks will arise that we will most assuredly suffer a \nconstitutional crisis of large proportions if it is adopted.\n  Now, those are the nightmares if this constitutional amendment is \nenforced. Of course, if it is not enforced, then it creates a different \nnightmare, that being the nightmare of the amendment's being nothing \nmore than an empty promise written into the Constitution of the United \nStates, an empty promise, in which event the confidence of the American \npeople in the Constitution will be shattered and their confidence in \ntheir Government will suffer further.\n  To mandate such an unrealistic criterion for a great nation is in \neffect to chain its most vital function--its ability to protect its \ncitizens and its national interests--to the fluctuations of a giant \neconomy, to the unpredictability of the whims of public opinion and to \na green eyeshade view of national priorities.\n  Balancing the budget is a laudable goal. I share that goal. We all \nshare that goal. But absolute budget balance, each and every year, is \nneither laudable nor, in every case, wise.\n  Surely, we do not want to go down this dark and murky road. It is \nmore than apparent that the wisdom of the Framers is not manifest in \nthis latest proposed addition to the Constitution.\n  If we have not the ``wisdom'' in the crafting of the proposal, let us \nat least have the wisdom to reject it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 256\n\n  (Purpose: To permit waiver of the article when the United States is \n             engaged in military conflict by majority vote)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe I have an amendment at the desk, \nNo. 256. I call up that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 256,\n\n       On page 2, lines 24 and 25, strike ``, adopted by a \n     majority of the whole number of each House''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment is as follows. \nIt would strike from section 5 the words, ``adopted by a majority of \nthe whole number of each House.''\n  It would leave standing all of the foregoing words, namely:\n\n       Section 5, the Congress may waive the provision of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, which becomes law.\n\n  So it eliminates the requirement that such a joint resolution be \nadopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, which becomes \nlaw.\n  I call attention to the fact that to require a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House would preclude the Vice President of the United \nStates from casting a deciding vote on a given motion to waive this \nsection. If the votes were tied--tied at 40-40, he might as well not \nvote because his vote would not count. If they were tied at 50-50, as \nwe have seen occur in the case of the 1993 reconciliation bill--the \n1993 reconciliation bill, that was to reduce the budget deficits over \nthe period of the following 5 years by something like $482 billion--the \nvotes were tied: 50 votes for and 50 votes against. Not a single \nRepublican Senator voted for that package. They all voted against it \nbecause they said taxes were increased in it. But they all voted \nagainst it. The vote was 50-50. The Vice President cast the deciding \nvote in that instance.\n  In this situation, if we find that our country is faced with an \nimminent and serious military threat to its security, Congress can \nwaive the requirements of the amendment, namely that the outlays in a \ngiven year not exceed the receipts. But Congress can waive that \nrequirement only if a joint resolution is passed, which is adopted by a \nmajority of the whole number of each House. There is no such \nrequirement now in the law or in the Constitution. But, with past \nexperience vividly in view, it is not untoward to conceive that there \ncould be a future time when the vote in the Senate is a tie--when there \nare 50 for and 50 against a joint resolution to lift the waiver imposed \nby this constitutional amendment at a time when our country's very \nsecurity is in serious jeopardy, and the lives of our fighting men and \nwomen are on the line. The vote is tied, 50-50.\n  Normally, under the Constitution as it now exists, the Vice President \ncould cast a vote to break that tie. What about this situation? He may \nstill cast a vote, but the resolution on that occasion has to be \nadopted by a majority of the whole number of each body. The ``whole \nnumber'' in the Senate is presently 100 Senators. A majority of the \nwhole number is 51. Consequently, if this amendment is riveted into the \nConstitution, a resolution waiving the strictures of this \nconstitutional amendment in a time of serious peril to our Nation \ncannot pass on a tie vote. It cannot be adopted by this Senate by a \nmajority of 50 to 49 or 50 to 40 or 50 to 30 or 50 to 20 or 50 to 10 or \n50 to 1. There must be 51 votes cast to adopt the resolution waiving \nthe requirements that are imposed by this constitutional amendment. \nThere must be 51, no less. And the 51 votes have to be cast by Members \nof the body.\n  The Vice President is not a Member of this body. If the vote is 50-\n50, as it was in the case of the deficit reduction package, the \nreconciliation bill in 1993, the Vice President cast the deciding vote \nthere, but in this situation his vote would not count because he is not \na ``Member'' of the Senate. There must be 51 Senators, and in the House \nthere must be a majority of the whole number of the House. The whole \nnumber there being presently 435, there would have to be 218 votes in \nthe House by a rollcall vote. If that is not straitjacketing the Nation \nwhen the Nation's security is at stake, I do not know what a \nstraitjacket is.\n  It seems to me what would happen in an event like that--aside from \nwhat may happen to our national security and what may happen to the men \nand women whose lives are at stake out there--what would happen would \nbe a constitutional crisis. Do not think that the court would not enter \ninto that political thicket. If the Constitution is amended by this \nmonstrosity--the original portion of the Constitution says that the \nVice President may cast the deciding vote. The courts are going to \nintervene, because you have the original Constitution saying on the one \nhand, that the Vice President, in the case of a tie, may cast the \ndeciding vote. On the other hand we have this balanced budget amendment \nwhich says that a joint resolution, to be adopted, must be adopted by a \nmajority of the ``whole number'' of each House before that resolution \ncan become law. The Vice President is not a Member of either House.\n   [[Page S2927]] So the Vice President's vote cannot count in the \nSenate in that situation. Hence, if you have a 50-50 vote, the Vice \nPresident's vote cannot count, because the joint resolution must be \nsupported by 51 Members of the Senate in any occasion involving the \nlanguage of this amendment, section 5 thereof--it has to have the \nsupport of at least 51 Senators; 49 votes are not good enough; 50 votes \nare not good enough. It must be 51. All Senators opposed to the joint \nresolution can just stay home. Their votes do not count anyhow in a \nsense, because it takes at least 51 votes of Senators. What is the \ncourt going to say? What is the court going to say? The court will not \nsay that that is a political question. The courts are going to say, \n``That is a constitutional question, and we are going to decide it.'' \nThe court will go into that thicket, because two provisions of the \nConstitution will now be in direct conflict.\n  The same thing would be true in the case of raising revenues. Section \n4 says, ``No bill to increase revenues shall become law unless approved \nby a majority of the whole number of each House by rollcall vote.'' \nAgain, the Vice President is not a Member of the Senate and, if the \nvote results in a tie, the Vice President may cast a vote if he wishes \nto do so, but his vote will not count. He is not a Member of the \nSenate, and the supporting votes of at least 51 Senators will be \nrequired. A vote of a simple majority of the Senators present and \nvoting--as is now the case under the Constitution and the rules--will \nno longer prevail.\n  Section 4 of the balanced budget amendment reads:\n\n       No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless \n     approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a \n     rollcall vote.\n\n  I would like for somebody to come and explain this. Where is that \n``Republican response team,'' that noble, noble response team? Come \nover and explain to this Senator from the hill country how we shall \ninterpret that section. The Vice President--the Vice President's vote \nagain will not count. He is not a Member of this body.\n  I believe I am limited to 1 hour under my control on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not want to utilize my time further in, waiting on the \nvaliant and noble members of the ``response team'' of nine Senators to \nrespond to this poor little old Senator from West Virginia. I suppose \nit is legal for them--and constitutional--for them to gang up on me \nlike that, but I am not going to use up my hour waiting on them.\n  So, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I have called \nup the amendment. It has been read.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask \nthe time not be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that following the disposition of the pending Byrd \namendment, Senator Rockefeller be recognized to call up his amendment \nNo. 306, and that time prior to a motion to table be divided as \nfollows: 60 minutes under the control of Senator Rockefeller; 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Hatch or his designee; and that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the majority leader \nor his designee be recognized to make a motion to table amendment No. \n306.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 256\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am always interested in the arguments of \nour distinguished colleague from West Virginia who has raised issues \nconcerning section 5 that he feels are prominent and important. But \nsection 5 of this amendment, which in part provides for a waiver of the \namendment's requirements for any fiscal year in which the United States \nis involved in a military conflict that presents a serious threat to \nnational security by a constitutional majority of both Houses of \nCongress, does not in any way, shape or form hinder the ability of this \nNation to protect itself, as Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and certain opponents of the balanced budget \namendment contend.\n  Does anyone really suggest that Members of Congress would vote \nagainst a waiver for an ongoing military engagement which presented a \nthreat to national security? I really do not think that argument can be \nmade with a straight face.\n  This is not a situation analogous to the situation before the Haiti \ninvasion, where there was no imminent threat to the United States and \nwhere congressional and public opinion was in fact split. This is more \nlike the situation in the Persian Gulf and in Kuwait back in 1991.\n  Thus, after the gulf war began, H.R. 1282, the Operation Desert \nShield/Desert Storm Supplemental Act passed the House by a vote of 380 \nto 19, on March 7, 1991. It passed the Senate 98 to 1, on March 19, \n1991, and was signed into law by President Bush on April 10 of the same \nyear. This amply demonstrates that Congress will overwhelmingly take \nmeasures to protect our troops and to protect our country, where \nnational security interests really are involved.\n  Moreover, even before hostilities are commenced and where our Nation \nfaces a real and imminent military or national security threat, I am \nconfident that the U.S. Congress would raise revenue by the requisite \nconstitutional majority of section 4, or find the three-fifths majority \nneeded to waive the debt ceiling under section 2 of the amendment, or a \ncombination of both, to provide the needed funding for our young men \nand women in the military. I have no doubt about that and I do not \nthink anybody else does either.\n  We are not going to allow our young people to be placed in harm's way \nwithout the backing of the Constitution of the United States. So this \nis kind of a red herring.\n  The constitutional majority requirement of section 5, on the other \nhand, is necessary for two reasons. It retards Congress from labeling \nmere spending programs as national security or emergency measures.\n Witness President Clinton's so-called 1993 stimulus program, most of \nwhich was defeated and which contained things like $1 billion for \nsummer youth employment--nothing to do with the national security, just \nanother spending program--$1.3 billion for infrastructure improvements, \nwhich again has nothing to do with national security; $735 billion for \ncompensatory education.\n\n  The Clinton package was labeled the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act of 1993. No matter what one's view as to the \nimportance of these programs, they cannot be considered emergencies \nthat needed immediate funding. In fact, if you take the summer youth \nprogram, we would have all kinds of summer youth programs and have them \nthen. We have over 150 job training programs, a number of which are \nused for unemployed youth, including Job Corps, which I have helped to \nsave, an expensive but working program that really does save us \nmillions of dollars over the long run with regard to each person that \nthey place in work life positions. As far as compensatory education \nprograms, we have all kinds of those as well. They were clearly not \nemergency programs.\n  So, No. 1, Congress has to be retarded from labeling regular spending \nprograms as emergency programs, or Congress will call everything an \nemergency measure, just as this administration tried to do so in its \nemergency stimulus program.\n  The second reason is, the constitutional majority requirement does \nforce a rollcall vote. That is something we do not always do around \nhere. We have what is known as a voice vote situation that saves \nMembers of Congress, and especially Members of the Senate, from making \nthe tough economic votes around here. This provision requires a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be pleased to yield.\n   [[Page S2928]] Mr. BYRD. I do not want to interrupt him in the \nmiddle of a sentence. But why do we have to write in the Constitution a \nprovision to require a rollcall vote? The Constitution that we now have \nsays that on the request of one-fifth of the Members present, we will \nhave a rollcall vote. Why do we have to write a new constitutional \namendment to get a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, in this particular case, to answer my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia, we have had countless illustrations of \nvoice votes on matters as important as real emergency matters. And what \nthis does, it just says, ``Look, you are going to have to have a \nrollcall vote if you want to call something an emergency, and you are \ngoing to have to have a constitutional majority in order to succeed on \nthat rollcall vote.''\n  If it is an emergency, I do not see any problem getting a \nconstitutional majority which, after all, just means one thing, and \nthat is that before this measure can pass, Congress is going to have to \nstand up and vote, at least 51 Senators in the Senate, 218 Members of \nthe House, in order to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that would not be any blue ribbon \naccomplishment that is worth going through the throes of getting a new \nconstitutional amendment written into the present Constitution, to say \nthat Members will have to stand up and vote.\n  Who minds that? I have not missed a vote in over 10 years. I am sure \nother Senators have not missed many votes. I daresay, may I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, that practically every Senator in this \nbody, I would say, without having looked at the record recently, has \nbetter than a 90 percent voting record.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is right. When they are called upon to vote, \nSenators generally vote. And in these instances, they will have to \nvote. Where, as the distinguished Senator knows, we have many very \ntough votes that are cast by a voice vote where the rollcall is not \nrecorded, because there is no rollcall.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why? Because no Senator requests the yeas and nays in those \ncases.\n  Mr. HATCH. And there is reason for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. If a Senator requests the yeas and nays, he is going to get \na sufficient show of seconds, or he will put in a quorum call until he \ndoes get a sufficient number to require a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true. The Senator makes a good point. I think the \nSenator from West Virginia has been one of those who is willing to vote \non everything. He has always had the courage to stand up and vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator has not answered the main point \nof my reasoning; that being, that the requirement that a joint \nresolution, in section 5, be adopted by a majority of the whole number \nof each House. That provision calls into serious question the vote of \nthe Vice President in the case of a tie vote. How do we get around \nthat?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I think I have answered the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia. The reason we are putting that in there is because \nwe want to make it difficult for the Congress to hide any spending \nprogram under the ``emergency'' designation.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not an answer to my question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, it is an answer to your question.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, it is not. What does the Senator have to say to my \nquestion, which goes right to the point of allowing the Vice President \nof the United States to cast a deciding vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me get to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, what we are trying to do is to make it \ndifficult to hide behind the word ``emergency'' in passing whatever \nthey want to by a simple rollcall vote.\n  Second, there are other supermajority votes already in the \nConstitution where the Vice President's vote is not essential in the \nSenate. Veto overrides are certainly illustrations where the Vice \nPresident's vote is not going to count for anything.\n  What we are doing here is providing a means whereby you have to have \na constitutional majority of the whole number of each House in order to \npass legislation pursuant to section 5, among others. The purpose of \nthe constitutional majority, or 51 within the Senate, makes it clear \nthat there is not going to be any tie. If you are going to have an \nemergency, you want to vote on it, you are going to have to have 51 \nSenators vote for it at least, and at least 218 Members of the House.\n  In other words, it has been contemplated by the Founding Fathers, who \nput in majorities in some instances into the constitution, the veto \noverride being just one illustration of something in the Constitution \nthat says you do not have simple democratic majoritarian rule in all \nmatters in the Constitution. In this particular case, so that we do not \nhave a continuous hiding behind the word ``emergency,'' we are saying \nthat you must have a constitutional majority of the whole number of \neach House in order to waive the provisions of article V.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there are supermajorities in the \nConstitution. We have discussed those on previous occasions.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. But nowhere, nowhere, do we find a supermajority required \nin connection with the great substantive powers granted to the Congress \nin article I, section 9, or article I, section 8. None of those great \nsubstantive powers turns on a supermajority vote. We have gone over \nthose--I see the ``response team'' gathering.\n  But the question is, where we have a 50-50 vote, you cannot squeeze \nanother drop of blood out of that turnip, because there are only 100 \nSenators. You have a 50-50 tie. If the Vice President casts a vote, you \ndo not have the 51 Members, you do not have a majority of the whole \nnumber of the Senate. Now, I am still waiting for the Senator's answer \non that.\n  Let me read from Federalist No. 68, by Hamilton, in reference to the \nVice President.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask my colleague from West Virginia if he will do so \non his own time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will read this on my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not that I mind yielding my time, because I am happy to do \nit. This is a good debate. This is a good interchange. But it would \nallow me to save some time.\n  Mr. BYRD. This, it seems to me, is one of the critical points that is \nraised by section 5 of this amendment. I hope to have more than an \nhour, and that we could take a little more time if needed.\n  Hamilton said in Federalist No. 68, with reference to the Vice \nPresident:\n\n       The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-\n     President, has been objected to as superfluous, if not \n     mischievous * * *. But two considerations seem to justify the \n     ideas of the convention in this respect. One is that to \n     secure at all times the possibility of a definitive \n     resolution of the body, it is necessary that the President \n     should have only a casting vote.\n\n  Meaning the President of the Senate.\n  Now, how can the requirements of the original Constitution be lived \nup to? How can the principles as expressed by Hamilton in the \nFederalist No. 68 be obeyed if we deprive the President of this body, \nthe Vice President of the United States, the opportunity of casting a \ndeciding vote?\n  I will read that again: One consideration ``is that to secure at all \ntimes''--all times, not just part of the times, not just on certain \noccasions--``secure at all times the possibility of a definitive \nresolution of the body, it is necessary that the President should have \nonly a casting vote.'' He can only cast that vote to break a tie so as \nto bring about a definitive resolution of a given matter.\n  Now, otherwise in this amendment here, if we have a tie vote, may I \nsay, it seems to me that we are not going to have a ``definitive \nresolution'' by this body.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I may answer, the Founding Fathers not \nonly provided for the Vice President to break a tie vote when we have a \nsimple majority vote--which would continue to be the law, it would \ncontinue to be constitutional law--but they provided means in article V \nwhere we could \n[[Page S2929]] amend the Constitution of the United States. They \nexpected there would be amendments, and they made it very difficult for \nMembers to amend. That is why we have only had 27 amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  This amendment, if it passes by the requisite two-thirds majority, if \nwe are able to keep other amendments off and pass it by the requisite \ntwo-thirds majority and it is ratified by three quarters of the States, \nwould become the 28th amendment to the Constitution, assuming there are \nno other intervening amendments that go through the same process.\n  That means that what we are doing here is saying that we are amending \nthe Constitution because of the extraordinary danger of the continually \nrising national debt and deficits.\n  To be honest, they contemplated that we might want to do that from \ntime to time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator still has not answered my question.\n  Of course, the framers provided for the amending of the organic law. \nThey did that in article V. But that is no answer to my question.\n  Say we adopt this amendment, the States ratify it by the necessary \nthree-fourths, it becomes a part of the Constitution. We will then have \ntwo different provisions of the Constitution in direct conflict with \neach other.\n  One says that the Vice President shall cast a deciding vote, and the \nreason for that is ``to secure at all times the possibility of a \ndefinitive resolution of the body;'' but on the other hand, we have an \namendment now that is about to go into the Constitution which says, in \nthe case of section 5, when the Nation's security is in danger, we have \nto have 51 votes of Senators. In essence, that is what it says. We have \nto have 51 votes in the Senate to adopt that joint resolution, and they \nhave to be cast by Senators. We cannot count the Vice President's vote, \ncast to break a tie.\n  So what do we do in that situation?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may suggest to my friend from West \nVirginia, and he is my friend for whom I have a very high regard, this \nis no more in conflict with the other provision in the Constitution \nthan the requirement that we have a two-thirds vote for a treaty.\n  That does not permit the Vice President to cast that deciding vote. \nOr a two-thirds vote for impeachment. So we put the entire Constitution \ntogether. This particular provision was added by our colleague, Senator \nHeflin, for a national emergency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not know what Constitution the Senator \nfrom Alabama was reading. Or what Constitution the Senator from \nIllinois is reading.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, he is clearly amending this Constitution.\n  Let me just say that the idea of a supermajority vote--in this case, \nI would not call it supermajority, just a constitutional majority \nvote--is not new in the Constitution.\n  Let me mention a few. Article I, section 3, says that the Senate may \nconvict on an impeachment with a two-thirds vote. The Vice President \nhas no role in that.\n  Article I, section 5, says that each House may expel a Member with a \ntwo-thirds vote, a supermajority vote. The Vice President has no say in \nthat matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may just finish this line of statement, I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  Article I, section 7, involves the Presidential veto. It can only be \noverridden by a two-thirds vote of each House. The Vice President has \nno say in the Senate.\n  Article 2, section 2, the Senate advises and consents to treaties \nwith a two-thirds vote. Article V, the constitutional amendment \nrequirement requires two-thirds of each House or a constitutional \nconvention can be called by two-thirds of the State legislatures, and \nif three-quarters ratify, then it becomes an amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  In other words, article V itself acknowledges that we have to have a \ntwo-thirds vote to amend.\n  So we are amending the Constitution. And, yes, I personally believe \nthat the Vice President's vote will not count in this situation because \nwe will have to have 51 Senators of the whole number of 100 actually \nvote.\n  Mr. BYRD. So then what happens? The joint resolution falls.\n  Mr. HATCH. It falls unless we have----\n  Mr. BYRD. And we have men in peril. We have the Nation's security in \nperil.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think so. I pointed out in that resolution last \nyear, there were a number of features that were certainly not emergency \nfeatures. They might have had to have been taken out.\n  Also, I might mention that I think under those circumstances, that \nhighlights and augments and I think makes even more important the \nconsideration by Members of the Senate.\n  Let me just finish this. Article VII of the Constitution, required \nratification by 9 of the 13 States. This is not a new concept. The 12th \namendment requires a quorum, two-thirds of the States in the House, to \nchoose a President. And a majority of States is required to elect a \nPresident.\n  The same requirement exists for the Senate choosing the Vice \nPresident. The 25th amendment dealing with the President's competency \nand removal requires that if Congress is not in session, within 21 days \nafter Congress is required to assemble, it must determine by a two-\nthirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge \nthe duties of his office.\n  Now, there is an excellent letter which was printed from one of our \ncolleagues, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Spencer \nAbraham, which was written in Washington, February 15, 1995, but \npublished in the New York Times under the editorial letter section on \nMonday, February 20, 1995, which I think directly addresses what the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is saying.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record \nat this particular point, because I think it would be very \nenlightening.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 Founders Provided for Budget Amendment\n\n                            (Spence Abraham)\n\n       To the Editor: In ``Would Federalists Like Their Fans?'' \n     (Week in Review, Feb 12), David Lawsky maintains that James \n     Madison and Alexander Hamilton would not be amused by the \n     proposed balanced-budget amendment Well and good. As a \n     founder of The Federalist Society, I am well aware that \n     amending the Constitution is serious business. But Madison \n     and Hamilton would be amused by Mr. Lawsky's use of their \n     words.\n       To claim that ``The Federalist'' and the Constitution rest \n     on the conviction that all Congressional actions should be \n     approved by a simple majority of members present is \n     ridiculous. Amending the Constitution requires approval of \n     the two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then of three-\n     fourths of the states.\n       Federalist 41 makes clear that amendments will at times be \n     necessary. The Founders' genius was to find an amending \n     process that ``guards equally against that extreme facility, \n     which would render the Constitution too malleable; and that \n     extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered \n     faults.''\n       The Founders felt that acts that should be taken only with \n     great deliberation and after establishing broad consensus \n     should require more than a simple majority for approval. Thus \n     the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to expel a member \n     of the legislature, a two-thirds vote of senators present to \n     convict a President of wrongdoing after impeachment by the \n     House and a two-thirds vote of both houses to override a \n     Presidential veto.\n       The Founders certainly feared, as Mr. Lawsky suggests, an \n     ``anarchy'' from the rule of minority factions. But this is \n     what we have today. Special interest groups get government \n     money because there is no longer any spending discipline in \n     Congress. The result is an anarchic growth of Federal \n     government and spending.\n       The balanced-budget amendment will go a long way toward \n     restoring order. It will require that three-fifths of all \n     members of Congress approve deficit spending and that a \n     majority of members voting approve new taxes. We in Congress \n     would have to exercise self-discipline in budgeting because \n     we could run deficits or raise taxes only if a substantial \n     majority thinks them necessary.\n       As to Mr. Lawsky's claim that the balanced-budget amendment \n     ``offers no course of action'' if Congress disobeys it and \n     racks up more deficits, November's election results show how \n     false the view is.\n       [[Page S2930]] As stated in Federalist 51, ``A dependence \n     on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the \n     government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity \n     of auxiliary precautions.''\n       Auxiliary precautions like the balanced-budget amendment \n     and term limits will make Congress more responsive to the \n     people's will. Term limits will insure that Senators and \n     Representatives do not serve so long that they lose touch \n     with the people and begin treating their offices like private \n     fiefdoms. The balanced-budget amendment will teach Congress \n     that it must be honest with the American people, making clear \n     not only what programs it likes but also the cost and whether \n     and how we can pay for them.\n  Mr. BYRD. How does that letter address the point?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it does not address the point directly of \nthe Vice President, but it does address that the founders did expect \nMembers to audibly come up with additional amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course, I have voted for five constitutional amendments \nduring my time in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. What we are doing here is we are doing a new amendment \nthat does change the regular parliamentary majority vote with regard to \nsection 5 and requires a vote of the whole number of both Houses, which \nis different from--as all of these provisions--from the one provision \nthat would still exist with regard to other votes, that if a Senate is \nequally divided, the Vice President can break the tie.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, who I think on \nthis point had a statement.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Let me just go back to 1787 again for a moment. They spent a great \ndeal of time on the fact that Congress had to declare war because they \ndid not want Members to get arbitrarily, at the whim of a President, \ninto a war.\n  We are living in a very different world today. We have not formally \ndeclared war since World War II. We did not declare war in the Korean \nwar; we did not declare war in the Vietnamese war. In Desert Storm, we \nhad a resolution. We had, in Vietnam, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.\n  To say that a simple majority of those in the House and the Senate \nwould have to approve our getting involved in some conflict is \ncertainly in line with what they talked about in 1787 when they drafted \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, they did not say this.\n  Mr. SIMON. They did not say that.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Framers did not say ``has to be adopted by a majority \nof the whole number of each House.''\n  Mr. SIMON. But they contemplated a world in which we can sit around \nand debate for 2 or 3 weeks whether or not to declare war. The \nPresident is going to have to make some fast decisions. And I think \nordinarily we could get 60 votes for any kind of an emergency. But this \ncontemplates doing less than that or the President living within the \nbudget constraints.\n  I think the amendment Senator Heflin drafted is sound, and I am going \nto support the amendment rather than the motion to defeat.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, why would the proponents of the amendment \nwant to make it difficult for this Nation to respond to a national \nsecurity threat? Why set up this additional hurdle? There has to be a \nmajority of the whole number. Why do they not just say a simple \nmajority? But they are saying it has to be 51; in essence that is what \nthey are saying. The Senator can talk all he wishes about the framers \nof 1787 and how we are living in a different world, but John Marshall \nsaid, this ``Constitution was intended to endure for ages to come, and \nconsequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'' \nHere we are treating that Constitution almost like a scrap of paper. \nThat is a marvelous document. It is a document to be revered, and we \ntalk as though Marshall's words mean nothing.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could take back my time, nobody reveres it more than \nI. As you know, we provide Congress can simply waive the provisions if \nthere is a declaration of war. Number one, declared wars are going to \nrequire just a simple majority. But the reason we have done this is the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama wanted to take care of any \n``emergencies,'' but he recognized that we should not just do a simple \nmajority because that word ``emergency'' would be used for everything. \nSo that is why we went to a constitutional majority which requires the \nwhole number of each House.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BYRD. But what do we do with the Vice President's vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Vice President would not vote in that instance. It is \nmy opinion that the Vice President is not a Member of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. We agree on that, he is not a Member of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. If he is not a Member of the Senate, it is going to take \n51 Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. You cannot get it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we will on a real emergency.\n  Mr. BYRD. You think we will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no doubt we will. If not, it will not be a real \nemergency.\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator will yield, with all due respect to my \nfriend from West Virginia, I think his argument is with the framers of \nthe Constitution rather than with Senator Hatch and myself, because \nthey spent a great deal of time to see that we would avoid using this \nmatter of the military and national security as an excuse to get into \nwars excessively.\n  Washington's Farewell Address is on our desk. This was not put out \nhere by those of us who happen to favor this constitutional amendment. \nWashington warned about that, just as Washington in this farewell \naddress warned about acquiring debts.\n  I think this particular amendment is completely consistent with the \ndiscussions of 1787.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. Let me just say this. It will \nnot be an emergency unless you get a majority of the whole number of \neach House. But if you look at the other side of the coin, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, if you want to stretch the \nphilosophy here, is really arguing that emergencies can be solved by as \nfew as 25 Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Plus the Vice President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? The Senator says, I understood him \nto say, there would not be an emergency unless it was decided by a \nmajority of the whole number of each House. Is this how we are going to \ndetermine what an emergency is? An emergency is an emergency only when \nit is decided by a majority of the whole number of each House? That is \nwhat my friend seems to be saying?\n  Mr. HATCH. Under this provision, that is true, and we are talking \nabout an imminent and serious military threat to national security, not \njust any emergency.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Any emergency is going to have to meet either the three-\nfifths vote to increase the deficit or a constitutional majority to \nincrease taxes. There are lots of ways of meeting emergencies, but what \nwe are saying here is, we are going to have people vote and they are \ngoing to have to. If they want to call something an imminent and \nserious military threat, they are going to have to have a majority of \nthe whole number of each House, and we think that is right.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 31 minutes 36 \nseconds. The Senator from West Virginia has 43 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield the floor at this point to my \ncolleague or answer more questions.\n  Let me yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Utah has \nreferred to the six instances in the original Constitution in which a \nsupermajority is required, and he has referred to the three instances \nin the amendments thereto--amendment XII, amendment XIV, and amendment \nXXV, in all of which supermajorities are required, either \nsupermajorities that constitute a quorum, or a supermajority required \non a vote.\n  Mr. President, those supermajorities go either to the structure of \nour form of government or to the protection of individual rights. It is \na quite different supermajority. There is not one, as I \n[[Page S2931]] said a while ago, there is not a single supermajority \ninvolved in any of the great substantive powers enumerated in section 8 \nof article I or in section 9 of article I of the Constitution.\n  Now we are talking about including a supermajority requirement in a \nmatter involving fiscal policy, and we are talking about including that \nin the Constitution. And besides, may I say to my friend from the great \nState of Utah, there can be no tie vote anticipated in the \nsupermajority that is required in the Senate for the approval of the \nratification of a treaty. Two-thirds of the Senators present and voting \nare required to approve the ratification of a treaty. There can be no \ntie therein in which the Vice President would cast a vote.\n  The same thing is true with regard to the expulsion of a Member of \nthe Senate. Two-thirds of the Senators are required to expel a Member \nof the Senate. There can be no tie vote for a Vice President to break.\n  I had reference a moment ago to the two-thirds vote for approval of \nthe ratification of a treaty. That is a check and balance situation. \nThe framers spoke of it in the Federalist Papers. They spoke of the \nnecessity of having the Senate involved in treaties as a way of \nchecking against a President who is only elected for a 4-year term, or \nperhaps for a second term, where the possibility of corruption being \ninvolved. So, the protection against corruption and intrigue came in \nthe form of including the Senate in matters involving treaties and \nrequiring a two-thirds vote.\n  With respect to the expulsion of a Senator or a Member of the other \nbody, that involves the individual right of a Member who is about to be \nexpelled. That is for the protection of all Members and also to protect \nagainst a majority eliminating the minority. If a bare majority can \nexpel the senior Senator from West Virginia, then the next thing that \nthat majority could do would be to expel a Senator from Virginia or \nsome other State. They would not expel the second Senator from West \nVirginia, because that would deprive a State of an equal vote in the \nSenate, and nobody can change that guarantee in the Constitution. \nGradually, a majority could eliminate a minority. But a two-thirds vote \nis required for protection against such an event.\n  Now, the proponents continue to say, well, there are other \nsupermajority situations; the framers required two-thirds for this; \nthey required two-thirds for that; they required two-thirds for \nsomething else. But, Mr. President, there cannot be a tie in a two-\nthirds vote. In a two-thirds requirement, there cannot be a tie for a \nVice President to break.\n  Here we are talking about the possibility of such a tie.\n  May I say to the Senator from Utah, as I understand it, in last \nThursday's Record, a statement by Mr. Schaefer was included by Mr. \nLevin. Mr. Schaefer, the prime sponsor of this joint resolution in the \nother body, this constitutional amendment, stated on page H 758 of the \nCongressional Record of January 26--now I shall read it:\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President--\n\n  This is what Mr. Schaefer said. It does not square with what the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah has said.\n\n       This language is not intended--\n\n  Says Mr. Schaefer--\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President, in his or her constitutional capacity as President \n     of the Senate, from casting a tie-breaking vote that would \n     produce a 51-50 result. This is consistent with article I, \n     section 3, clause 4, which states: ``The Vice President of \n     the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall \n     have no vote, unless they be equally divided.'' Nothing in \n     section 4 of the substitute takes away the Vice President's \n     right to vote under such circumstances.\n\n  Thus, you have the House sponsor differing with Senators who have \nspoken on this matter. Even if the Vice President casts a vote, he is \nnot a Member of the Senate. Consequently, the requirement under section \n5 of this balanced budget amendment would not have been met.\n  I am still waiting for someone to tell me how this section 5 can be \nmade to work. How does this language square with the provision in the \noriginal Constitution that gives the Vice President the power, the \nauthority and the right to cast the deciding vote, the deciding vote, \nso as to secure ``a definitive resolution'' in this body. He may cast a \nvote, but it is not going to be the deciding vote. It is not going to \nsecure ``a definitive resolution'' of this body.\n  Well, I do not suppose I will get a clear answer to my question, but \nI hope Members will carefully study this question when they vote on \nthis amendment. This section creates a very serious question, a very \nserious question.\n  Let me read what Hamilton says in the Federalist 22 with regard to \nminority rule. All of these supermajorities in the balanced budget \namendment create a minority veto. They set up the possibility of a \nminority veto in this body and in the other body. In other words, we \nare getting away from the democratic majoritarian concept of our \ngovernmental system as laid down by the framers of the Constitution. \nHere is what Hamilton said in Federalist 22 with respect to minority \nrule.\n\n       In those emergencies of a nation, in which the goodness or \n     badness, the weakness or strength of its government, is of \n     the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for \n     action. The public business must in some way or other go \n     forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion \n     of a majority respecting the best mode of conducting it; the \n     majority in order that something may be done, must conform to \n     the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller \n     number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to \n     the national proceedings. Hence tedious delays--continual \n     negotiation and intrigue--contemptible compromises of the \n     public good * * *. For upon such occasions, things will not \n     admit of accommodation; and then the measures of government \n     must be injuriously suspended or fatally defeated. It is \n     often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence \n     of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state of \n     inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness--\n     sometimes border upon anarchy.\n\n  Hamilton goes on to say in the Federalist 22:\n\n       Suppose for instance we were engaged in a war, in \n     conjunction with one foreign nation against another. Suppose \n     the necessity of our situation demanded peace, and the \n     interest or ambition of our ally led him to seek the \n     prosecution of the war, with views that might justify us in \n     making separate terms. In such a state of things, this ally \n     of ours would evidently find it much easier by his bribes and \n     intrigues to tie up the hands of government from making \n     peace, where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to \n     that object than where a simple majority would suffice.\n\n  This does not require two-thirds in the case of the second sentence \nin section 5, but it does require more than an ordinary simple \nmajority.\n\n       In the first case he would have to corrupt a smaller \n     number; in the last a greater number. Upon the same principle \n     it would be much easier for a foreign power with which we \n     were at war, to perplex our councils and embarrass our \n     exertions. And in a commercial view we may be subjected to \n     similar inconveniences.\n\n  What Hamilton is saying there, Mr. President, goes to the point that \nI have raised. Mr. President, I have raised a question here which has \nnot been answered. This section 5 requires more than a simple majority. \nAnd when the vote comes out as a tie, it precludes the Vice President \nof the United States from casting a deciding vote, because under this \namendment his vote would not count, if it were cast to break a tie.\n The requisite number of 51 votes would not have been produced.\n\n       O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!\n       Then with a passion would I shake the world:\n\n  I have not gotten an answer to my question.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder where the other noble members of the response team \nare? Somebody, please come to the floor and answer this question for \nme. If not, the court will answer it at some day and time.\n  This is a serious constitutional question. We may find ourselves in a \nsituation in which the country's security is in jeopardy and, in order \nto waive the strictures of this balanced budget amendment, which says \nthat outlays and receipts have to balance every year, a joint \nresolution can be introduced to lift these strictures, in other words, \nto waive the requirements of this balanced budget amendment, in each \nfiscal year. But that resolution must be ``adopted by a majority of the \nwhole number of each House, which becomes law.''\n   [[Page S2932]] I ask the Senator from Utah again, how is he going to \nrespond to the necessity of that moment when 50 Senators vote for that \nresolution and 50 against? We are in danger. Our country's security is \ninvolved. Planes are flying in distant countries. Ships are plying the \nseveral seas. Mothers and fathers are wondering about their sons and \ndaughters. And here we have a Senate with a vote of 50-50 on that \nresolution to waive the amendment.\n  So, what is going to happen? We do not have time. We do not have time \nto wait, in a situation like that. We do not have time. We need to act \nquickly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to answer the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, if we do not get 51 Members of the Senate, in my opinion \nwe will not have had an imminent and serious military threat. I cannot \nimagine--I do not really believe the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia can imagine--\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, yes, I can.\n  Mr. HATCH. The serious, imminent and serious military threat to our \nnational security that would go unaddressed by either or both Houses of \nCongress. But more important, if that very unlikely situation occurred, \nthen what I would do is look for contingent moneys. I would try to cut \nspending--which is what the purpose of this amendment is--or I would go \nand try to increase taxes or I would try to get a three-fifths vote to \nincrease spending. But I would try to cut spending before I would say \nthat the country cannot survive.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, we do not have time to cut spending.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we do not have time and it is that imminent and serious \na military threat, then we will vote to sustain it.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is an emergency.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will vote for a tax increase to take care of it if we \ndo not have the money.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much of a majority does the constitutional amendment \nrequire for a tax increase?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, now, let me just propose back to the distinguished \nSenator. If we have an imminent and serious military threat, we do have \na military budget of almost $275 billion. If it is a large, imminent \nand serious military threat that would require all of our military, I \njust cannot conceive of one instance in the history of the country \nwhere we could not get 51 Senators to stand up and do something about \nit.\n  But if it is a small one, and something that involves one theater or \ninvolves, say, Cuba, or some small imminent and serious military \nthreat, we have enough money in our military to take care of that \nproblem.\n  We have enough money in our military to take care of that problem.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is really on the ropes.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I am not.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is really on the ropes. He is trying to use the old \nrope-a-dope on me here. But he is not Mohammad Ali.\n  Mr. HATCH. I learned it from him.\n  Mr. BYRD. This section does not say anything about the military \nthreats being large, small, middle-size, or whatever. I will read the \nlanguage of the section----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me read this. ``For any year in which the United States \nis engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security''--there is the threat. Somebody \ndetermines that it is serious. Perhaps it is the President.\n  But the point is, in order to lift the strictures of this amendment, \nthere must be a majority of the whole number of each House that casts \nsuch a vote. In other words, there must be at least 218 in the House \nand there must be at least 51 in the Senate. The Senator said he could \nnot imagine such a situation. If Senator Sarbanes were here, he would \ntell you. He read this into the Record the other day. Let me pick up on \nwhat he said. He said:\n\n       Let me bring the Senator back to the very real-life \n     problem--\n\n  He is talking with reference to the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nSmith], at that time.\n\n     that I wish to discuss with him.\n\n  Senator Sarbanes was reading from an article that appeared in the New \nYork Times, I believe, in the summer of 1991. Senator Sarbanes read \nthis article:\n\n       Fifty years ago last Monday, on August 12, 1941, House \n     Speaker Sam Rayburn saved the draft from legislative defeat \n     and kept the U.S. Army intact to fight a war that was only 4 \n     months away. The margin of victory was a single vote.\n\n  Now, this is a real-life situation, Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is not a hypothetical situation.\n\n       And the battle could have been lost as easily as won except \n     for Rayburn's personality and leadership and mastery of \n     parliamentary procedure. If Rayburn had failed, the Army \n     stood to lose about two-thirds of its strength and three-\n     fourths of the officer corps. At issue was whether to extend \n     the 12-month service obligation of more than 600,000 draftees \n     already in the army, thousands of others being inducted every \n     day, and the active duty term of several thousand National \n     Guardsmen and Reservists who had been called up for 1 year. \n     Without an extension, the obligations of both the draftees, \n     Guardsmen and Reservists would begin expiring in the fall. \n     The United States had adopted its first peacetime draft \n     during the previous summer after weeks of heated and \n     acrimonious debate in both congressional Chambers.\n\n  The article went on to point out:\n\n       Although the legislation limited the draftees' terms of \n     service to 12 months, it provided that the President could \n     extend the period indefinitely if Congress declared that the \n     national interest is imperiled.\n       On July 21, 1941, with the prospect of war increasing, \n     Roosevelt acted. In a Special Message to Capitol Hill, he \n     asked Congress to declare a national emergency that would \n     allow the Army to extend the service of draftees, guardsmen \n     and reservists for whatever period the legislators deemed \n     appropriate.\n       Despite the measure's unpopularity and strong lobbying by \n     isolationist forces, the Senate approved a joint resolution \n     on August 7 declaring the existence of a national emergency \n     and authorizing the President to extend the service of most \n     Army personnel by 18 months.\n\n  So there was a real-life situation, a real-life situation. And we can \nvery well face that kind of situation again. Mr. Sarbanes pointed out \nthat the vote on that occasion was 45-30 in the Senate. So it fell \nshort of the required 51 votes that would be necessary under this \nsection 5; 45-30. This shows you are going to need 51 here. And in the \nHouse the final vote was 203-202. It passed by one vote. One vote. It \npassed by a vote of 203-202, only after Rayburn walked the Halls and \nwent door to door over there, talking with Members of the House \nindividually. That was not a hypothetical situation. That can happen \nagain.\n  So what did the proponents have in mind? Did they think of this \npossible problem? What did they have in mind when writing that language \nthat requires a majority of the whole number of each House, which means \nthat the Vice President could not cast a tie-breaking vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Under this amendment, a majority vote would win today in \nboth of those cases--a simple majority vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, no. It says a majority of the whole number.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, no. We are talking about either increasing spending or \nincreasing taxes. In that situation, they increased the number of \nmonths, extending the Selective Service Act. So it would still--today, \nif you had the same vote, it would still be a simple majority vote. The \ndifference is this----\n  Mr. BYRD. I am saying in that situation--forgetting about the draft, \nsetting up this situation in which there is a serious military threat.\n  Mr. HATCH. My point is that the Senator is using a poor illustration \nbecause it does not apply in this situation.\n  Mr. BYRD. It applies in that it indicates that a situation can come \ndown to a vote with only a one-vote difference.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really.\n  Mr. BYRD. You could not get the three-fifths in the House.\n  Mr. HATCH. It did not involve an increase in spending or taxes, which \nis what is involved here.\n  Mr. BYRD. When you talk about increasing revenues, you are going to \nrun into the same problem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this.\n  Mr. BYRD. No bill to increase revenues shall become law unless \napproved by a majority of the whole number of each House.\n  [[Page S2933]] Mr. HATCH. What do those have to do with increasing \ntaxes or spending? Those----\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is the one who brought up raising revenues. He \nraised that subject.\n  Mr. HATCH. The point is, if that came up today and we wanted to \ninstitute the draft and extend it for another 12 months, we can do that \nby a simple majority vote. You do not have to have a constitutional \nmajority on every vote here--only on those that either increase taxes \nor increase spending.\n  Mr. BYRD. But under this section, if our country is confronted by a \nserious military threat to national security, the Senator says you can \nraise taxes. It runs under the same probability.\n  Mr. HATCH. You either have to cut spending or increase spending or \nincrease taxes. If you want to increase spending under the balanced \nbudget amendment, or increase taxes, then you have to stand up and vote \nto do so. And in the case of increasing spending, you have to have a \nthree-fifths vote. In the case of increasing taxes, you have to have a \nconstitutional majority. But we could have a majority of each House \nvote today on extending for 12 months the selective service.\n  What is important here, as I see it, is that if the balanced budget \namendment is in place, then the political posturing is going to be \nlessened by a great deal. You will find people--if we are really \nconfronted with an imminent, serious military threat under section 5, I \ndo not think there is going to be any difficulty getting that vote. \nAnybody who puts the country at jeopardy at a time like that is not \ngoing to be sitting here the next time his or her election comes \naround. People know that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, that is not the answer to the question. I am sure \nthe Senator would not be hesitant to cast the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would increase spending or taxes if I had to.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the Senator controls only one vote, as I do. When this \nhappens, neither the Senator nor I may be in this Chamber. We do not \nknow what the intent of Senators will be 5, 10, or 20 years from now. \nThis is a very difficult obstacle--in the event of a serious situation \narising that involves a military threat.\n  Nobody--not one Senator--has been able to explain why the proponents \nhave written into section 5 a provision that virtually deprives the \nVice President of the United States from casting a deciding vote in a \ncertain given situation.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield on that, many of us did not want \nthis provision in the balanced budget amendment. We wanted only a \nthree-fifths vote to increase spending or a constitutional majority to \nincrease taxes, and we only wanted the above part of that that said \nCongress may waive the provision of this article for any fiscal year \nfor which a declaration of war is in effect.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am going to offer an amendment that will strike that out. \nI hope the Senator will vote for that amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, not at this point. One of the reasons this amendment \nis important--and this is the only time in history we can pass it--is \nbecause it is a consensus, a bipartisan amendment. One of the things we \ndid was take Senator Heflin's provision. He was very concerned about \nany imminent and serious military threat that fell short of a \ndeclaration of war and, I think, rightly so. Personally, I have grown \nto prefer the language that he has put in here. But in order to \nprohibit the Congress from just using that loophole by calling \neverything an imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity, we provided for a constitutional majority which does \nalleviate the necessity of having the Vice President vote to break a \ntie. Now, this being a new constitutional amendment, this being in \naddition to the Constitution, fits the same mold as the supermajority \nrequired that I read off before and read into the Record.\n  Mr. BYRD. Except, as I have said, those supermajorities the Senator \nread off before, and which I read off some days ago in this Chamber, \nhave absolutely nothing to do with the substantive powers that are \ngranted in article I, sections 8 and 9 of the Constitution. And those \ninstances go to the structural parts of the Constitution and to the \nprotection of individual rights. This balanced budget amendment has \nnothing to do with such. We are talking about fiscal policy here, and \nthat has never been written into the Constitution. The Senator tries to \nexplain this dilemma by saying, well, it requires a constitutional \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, my problem goes not only to the fact that it requires \nthree-fifths in two instances, and a constitutional majority in two \nother instances--section 4 and section 5--but it also deprives the Vice \nPresident of the United States from casting his deciding vote. Nobody \nhas explained why the proponents would do that.\n  Mr. President, if any Senator wishes me to yield, I would be happy \nto.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question without losing \nhis right to the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. How much time would the Senator need? Mr. President, \nhow much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will need just 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I underscore what the very distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has been saying here on the floor. Section 5 \nof this article is fraught with danger, and I hope Members will \nconsider it very, very carefully.\n  It says:\n\n       The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security.\n\n  The first thing I want Members to think of in their own minds is \nthis: If we could face an imminent and serious military threat to our \nnational security at a time when we were not yet engaged in military \nconflict. We may recognize that we are going to become engaged in \nmilitary conflict and we need to take measures to address that \nsituation.\n  Under this provision, no waiver is available in that circumstance \nbecause this provision requires that you be engaged in military \nconflict. I listened to the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nwho made reference to the imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security, as though that was what you needed to show in order \nto get the waiver. That is not the case.\n  The way this sentence is structured, you have to be engaged in \nconflict, already engaged in conflict which causes an imminent and \nserious threat to national security. So you would not be able to react \nto what I regard as a very pressing situation.\n  Second, even in those situations in which you are able to act \naccording to a waiver, in order to invoke the waiver you have to have \nthe whole number of each House. Now what that means, simply put, in the \nHouse of Representatives with 435 Members, you have to have 218 votes \nto invoke the waiver.\n  Everyone says, ``Surely the Members of the Congress will invoke the \nwaiver in a dire situation of this sort and there will not be any \nproblem with it. Of course, you will get the waiver.'' And my response \nto that is, ``Don't be so sure.'' And then I say, ``If you go back \nthrough our history, there are numerous instances in which very \ncritical votes were carried by bare majorities not meeting the \nrequirement of a majority of the whole number.''\n  The example I used the other day in the course of the debate was the \nextension of the draft before World War II. In that instance, the \nextension in the summer of 1941 came on a vote of 203 to 202. Now, that \nis a majority of those present and voting and it is clearly a quorum, \nbut it was not adequate to meet the standard that is contained in this \namendment. That waiver, therefore, would not have taken place. You \nwould not have been able to make the expenditures necessary in order to \ncarry through this provision.\n  What was at stake then is our national security. As you will recall, \nin the summer of 1940 we put in place a draft, but the term of service \nof those who had been drafted was a year and it was due to expire. \nPresident Roosevelt sent a message to the Congress to extend the time \nof the draftees and the guardsmen and the reservists and that had to be \nenacted in a joint resolution. The joint resolution barely carried on \na \n[[Page S2934]] vote of 203 to 202. It was not a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which would have been 218 votes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It would have been 218 votes. The 203 votes fell well \nshort of the 218 votes which this amendment would require in order to \ninvoke the waiver.\n  Now I submit to you, it seems to me that is a clear example where the \nnational security interests of the United States were at stake. \nLiterally 4 months later, we were in World War II. Had that extension \nnot carried, more than 600,000 draftees already in the Army, their \nobligation would have begun to expire that fall and they would have \nbeen departing from the service. Four months later, Pearl Harbor \noccurred.\n  So I do not see how people can be so almost glib in the sense of \nasserting that surely this waiver will be invoked in a time of crisis. \nClearly then, had the standard applied, we would not have met it and I \nthink we would have been in dire circumstances. Therefore, I very \nstrongly support the amendment which the able Senator from West \nVirginia has offered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``How Mr. Sam \nSaved the Draft; One Vote and a Quick Gavel Rescued the Army on the Eve \nof War,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 18, 1991]\n\n  How Mr. Sam Saved the Draft; One Vote and a Quick Gavel Rescued the \n                         Army on the Eve of War\n                          (By John G. Leyden)\n\n       Fifty years ago last Monday--on Aug. 12, 1941--House \n     Speaker Sam Rayburn saved the ``draft'' from legislative \n     defeat and kept the U.S. Army intact to fight a war that was \n     only four months away.\n       The margin of victory was a single vote, and the battle \n     could have been lost as easily as won except for Rayburn's \n     personality, leadership, mastery of parliamentary procedure \n     and--when push came to shove--lightning-fast gavel.\n       If Rayburn had failed, the Army stood to lose about two-\n     thirds of its strength and three fourths of the officer \n     corps. At issue was whether to extend the 12-month service \n     obligation of more than 600,000 draftees already in the Army \n     and thousands of others being inducted every day, and the \n     active-duty term of several hundred thousand National \n     Guardsmen and reservists who had been called up for one year. \n     Without an extension, the obligations of both the draftees \n     and the Guardsmen and reservists would begin expiring in the \n     fall.\n       The United States had adopted its first peace time draft \n     during the previous summer after weeks of heated and \n     acrimonious debates in both congressional chambers. In the \n     House, tempers became so frayed that two Democratic members \n     got into a fist fight on the floor until both were ejected \n     with bloody noses and bruised egos.\n       Congress finally passed the Selective Training and Service \n     Act, authorizing the Army to induct up to 900,000 draftees \n     annually. President Roosevelt signed it into law on Sept. 16, \n     1940. One month later--on ``R'' Day--some 16\\1/2\\ million men \n     between the ages of 21 and 36 registered for the draft. The \n     first lottery drawing was held Oct. 29, and the dreaded \n     ``Greeting'' from local draft boards was in the mail shortly \n     thereafter.\n       Although the legislation limited the draftees' terms of \n     service to 12 months, it provided that the president could \n     extend the period indefinitely if Congress ``declared that \n     the national interest is imperiled.'' On July 21, 1941, with \n     the prospect of war increasing, Roosevelt acted. In a special \n     message to Capitol Hill, he asked Congress to declare a \n     ``national emergency'' that would allow the Army to extend \n     the service of draftees, guardsmen and reservists for \n     whatever period the legislators deemed appropriate.\n       Despite the measure's unpopularity and strong lobbying by \n     isolationist forces, the Senate approved a joint resolution \n     on Aug. 7 ``declaring the existence of a national emergency'' \n     and authorizing the president to extend the service of most \n     Army personnel by 18 months. The vote was 45-30.\n       In the House, it was a different story. The Republican \n     leadership viewed opposition to draft extension as a \n     political opportunity just too good to ignore. Others had \n     their own reasons for opposing the measure.\n       As summarized by Time magazine, they included 17 Irish \n     congressmen whose votes were based on anti-British \n     sentiments; Tammany Hall Democrats upset that the \n     administration was supporting nonpartisan New York Mayor \n     Fiorello LaGuardia for re-election; a large group of \n     Democrats who believed draft extension violated the \n     commitment given to those already in service; straight-out \n     pacifists who opposed all defense bills; and a ``big group in \n     both parties who vote blindly against anything Franklin \n     Roosevelt is for.''\n       In an effort to ``depoliticize'' the issue as much as \n     possible, Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson \n     designated Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall as the \n     administration's point man on the bill. Marshall worked \n     tirelessly but found converts difficult to come by despite \n     his tremendous prestige on Capitol Hill.\n       ``You put the case very well,'' one Republican congressman \n     told him, ``but I will be damned if I am going along with Mr. \n     Roosevelt.''\n       The vote was set for Monday, Aug. 11 but Rayburn put it off \n     for one day out of respect for a Republican member who had \n     died over the weekend. With the president out of town--\n     meeting secretly in Newfoundland with British Prime Minister \n     Winston Churchill to frame the ``Atlantic Charter''--Rayburn \n     spent the additional day roaming the corridors of Capitol \n     Hill, trying to win over recalcitrant Democrats and wavering \n     Republicans. His lobbying style was like the man himself--\n     honest, direct and intensely personal without a hint of \n     intimidation.\n       ``I wish you would stand by me because it means a lot to \n     me,'' he would say. Mr. Sam, up close and personal, was a \n     hard man to refuse.\n       Shortly after 10 a.m. on Aug. 12, the House began debating \n     the joint resolution already passed by the Senate. A largely \n     anti-draft crowd looked on sullenly from the packed visitor \n     gallery. Included among the spectators were many servicemen \n     in uniform and ``delegations of mothers clutching little \n     American flags.''\n       The debate dragged on for 10 hours, through lunch and \n     dinner. Amendments designed to weaken the bill were defeated \n     with the help, ironically, of isolationists who wanted an \n     ``all or nothing'' vote on the joint resolution. Finally, at \n     8:05 p.m., the reading clerk began calling the roll. Then, as \n     required, the clerk went back through the list, repeating the \n     names of members who had not answered the first roll call.\n       After 45 minutes of ``grinding suspense,'' the vote was \n     completed--204 to 201\n      in favor of the draft extension. But before it could be \n     announced, New York Democrat Andrew Sommers was on his \n     feet demanding recognition. Rayburn obliged and quickly \n     regretted the move: Sommers changed his vote from aye to \n     nay, opening the door for further defections.\n       To forestall this, Rayburn turned from other Democrats who \n     were calling for the floor and recognized Missouri Republican \n     Dewey Short, a leader of the anti-draft forces and thus a \n     known quantity. Short requested a recapitulation but \n     committed a fatal error--by not insisting that the recount \n     precede announcement of the original vote.\n       Sensing his opportunity, Rayburn quickly read the results: \n     ``On this roll call, 203 members have voted aye, 202 members \n     nay, and the bill is passed.''\n       In so doing, Rayburn had frozen the vote. Under House \n     rules, the recapitulation would be limited to those who \n     already had responded, and they were proscribed from changing \n     their vote. When the recount was completed, validating the \n     original results, Rayburn announced (some say ``mumbled''):\n       ``No correction to the vote. The vote stands, and the bill \n     is passed. Without objections, a motion to reconsider is laid \n     on the table.''\n       It was all over but the shouting, because the words ``laid \n     on the table'' meant the subject of reconsideration had been \n     decided adversely and could not be revived except by \n     unanimous consent. Still, there was plenty of shouting from \n     both the floor and the galleries.\n       The outvoted and outflanked Republican leaders denounced \n     the speaker's tactics and accused him of short-circuiting the \n     reconsideration process. Rayburn kept his composure. He was \n     patient with members who seemed not to understand that only \n     those who voted with the winning side could move for \n     reconsideration--and stern with those who challenged his \n     integrity. ``The Chair does not intend to have his word \n     questioned by the gentleman from Minnesota or anyone else,'' \n     he told one member icily. Opponents got the message, and the \n     debate fizzled out.\n       Three days later, after the Senate had approved the \n     slightly different House bill and thus prevented another \n     confrontation in the lower chamber, Rayburn decided he and \n     his colleagues deserved a rest.\n       ``I want to go home [to Bonhom, Tex.],'' he said in calling \n     for adjournment. ``I live on a broad highway, in a white \n     house where everyone can find me; but I have another little \n     place. * * * When I start toward that place--and it is about \n     13 miles from my home farm--the road gets narrower and \n     narrower every mile I go; and when I get to the end of the \n     narrowest part of the road, there is a gate and there is no \n     telephone out there.''\n       Another gavel stroke emptied the chamber and brought an end \n     to Rayburn's first year as speaker. The battle over draft \n     extension was one of his finest hours in a long and \n     distinguished congressional career. Any reservations or ill \n     feelings about the outcome would disappear on Dec. 7, 1941.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, for his resourcefulness and his diligence in going back, \nsearching for, and finding this real-life record of what actually \nhappened; not something that may have happened, not something that \nsomeone said would happen, but a real-life emergency occurred.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n   [[Page S2935]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from Utah have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 31 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a couple of \ncomments that have been made and respond to the Senator from West \nVirginia, who I know makes this suggestion with the integrity of the \nConstitution and the institution and the defense of the United States \nvery much in mind, and we all do.\n  I served in the House of Representatives for 8 years on the Armed \nServices Committee and have been criticized for being a hawk, so I \nappreciate arguments that could negatively impact our ability to carry \nout our defense functions as much as anyone.\n  But with all due respect to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, I think this argument overstates a potential problem. In \nfact, I think there is no potential problem.\n  Essentially, what we are arguing about here in the U.S. Senate is the \ndifference between 51 votes and 50 votes. And in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, it is the same 218 votes as would be required in any \ncase to carry a majority issue if all of the Members are present and \nvoting. So the only question is whether some Members may be absent or \nnot voting and therefore you still have to have the constitutional \nmajority of 218.\n  In my experience, in very few instances did you not have, on the \nmajor, important votes, almost all of the Members present and voting.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KYL. Of course, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think it is instructive that there are many, many \nclose votes in the House of Representatives in which the prevailing \nside did not obtain 218 votes. The fact of the matter is that, on most \nvotes in the House of Representatives, rarely are all the Members \npresent. After all, there are 435 of them. On many votes, 5, 10, 15, \nperhaps even 20 Members are absent. And there are a lot of votes in the \nHouse that are decided by very close margins--208 to 204, 211 to 205, \net cetera, et cetera. Close votes, but they do not reach this level of \nthe 218 votes.\n  I sought to cite what I thought was a really on-point example in \nterms of the national security being at stake, a 203 to 202 vote with \nrespect to extending the obligation under the draft before World War \nII.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the example that the Senator has cited.\n  In recent years, on important votes, most Members of the House of \nRepresentatives are present. It is only in situations of illness or in \nsituations where there has been a family emergency or something of that \nkind that Senators and Representatives do not care enough to be in the \nChamber voting on very important national security matters.\n  If it is the argument of the Senator from Maryland that this is such \nan important point that the national security of the United States of \nAmerica is jeopardized but he suggests, on the other hand, that a lot \nof Members will not bother to be present to vote, I suggest the \nargument fails. On important votes, Representatives and Senators do \ntheir duty.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. If I may just finish this thought.\n  By definition, if it is an important vote, they are there doing their \nduty.\n  It does not seem to me to be an unreasonable requirement that, for a \nmatter of this magnitude, one would require a majority of both the \nHouse and the Senate to approve exceeding the requirement for a \nbalanced budget. And especially on matters as important as those \nsuggested by the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from West \nVirginia, Members will be present, will reflect on the matter \nseriously, and therefore will vote.\n  I am happy to yield further to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I only point out to my colleague that you could have \nvirtually all the Members of the House there. Let us say you could have \n98 percent of the Members there, which would mean nine Members are \nmissing. You could have a very close vote, since the issue may well be \nvery controversial and divisive, and you would not reach the 218 \nbenchmark.\n  So the way this possibility is simply being brushed aside concerns me \ngreatly. The situation I am outlining could easily happen. It has \nhappened in the past.\n  By allowing it at that level, suppose we have ten Members absent?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may interrupt, the Senator from Maryland \nsaid this has happened in the past. I am not aware of a situation where \nthe Congress has refused to fund an ongoing military operation of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Because Congress was never required to produce a \nmajority of the whole number. All we had to produce in order to do that \nwas a majority of those present and voting.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, has the Congress ever refused to fund an \nongoing military operation of the United States? Not to my knowledge.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But it has funded such operations on occasions when it \ncarried the vote without having a majority of the whole number.\n  Mr. KYL. Of course.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, if we go back through the Vietnam \nexperience, there were instances in which the funding was carried \nthrough, but the vote by which it was done represented a majority of \nthose present and voting, but that number did not represent a majority \nof the whole number of the House.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could reclaim my time. I am not aware of \na situation. There may very well be one. I have not heard of any one \nsituation in which fewer than a constitutional majority but a majority, \na simple majority, voted to fund an important military operation of the \nUnited States, ongoing military operation.\n  I think it is important to put this in context. Throughout the entire \nyear the Congress can fund operations of the Government, including the \nDefense Department or the State Department, where we are involved in \nmilitary conflict. We are involved in military situations around the \nglobe today, some of which can involve conflict.\n  As a matter of fact, if something occurs in Haiti or one of the other \ncountries in which we have troops today, that is a military conflict. \nWe are funding those operations. We are not voting on that. We do not \ntake a vote every time we send another ship or more jeeps or tanks to \none of these places of military conflict.\n  This question of funding only arises in a few situations. It may \narise with regard to a supplemental appropriation where we will, in \neffect, refund the money to the Defense Department, or it may arise in \nconnection with a defense authorization bill, which we do once a year, \nor a defense appropriation bill.\n  So we can deal with these issues throughout the year. The only thing \nwe are talking about in the constitutional amendment is the question at \nthe end of the year when we have to either be in balance or vote to \nexceed that balanced budget requirement. At that one critical moment in \nthe year when we decide to let an ongoing military operation continue \nwith the funding it has rather than to override or to exceed the \nbalanced budget requirement, in that case we have to have a \nconstitutional majority rather than a simple majority, meaning 51 \nSenators out of 100, 218 Representatives out of 435.\n  Mr. President, I just suggest in closing the debate on this amendment \nfrom our side that while the seriousness of the Senator from West \nVirginia is always apparent and issues of national security are known \nto all Members to be of utmost importance, I suggest that this is much \nado about nothing. A constitutional amendment that says we should have \n51 Senators out of 100 or 218 Representatives out of 435, a mere \nmajority, is not too high a requirement. It is not too much to ask. If \nwe are going to be putting our young men and women in harm's way we \nbetter have the support of half of the Senate and half of the House of \nRepresentatives. That is all that the balanced budget amendment \nrequires with respect to the requirements for funding.\n  [[Page S2936]] I really do not think this is a significant matter. It \ncertainly is not something that would suggest the appropriateness of an \namendment to our proposed constitutional amendment here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question, Mr. President?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am looking at the report for votes dealing with the \nSDI. This was a motion to table an amendment which would have cut the \namount of money for SDI, so the tabling motion in effect would have \nkept the higher figure for the SDI Program.\n  I do not want to argue the substance of the SDI Program. As I recall, \nthe Senator was in favor of it when he was in the House. I want to get \nat the point of the close votes and the assumption that there is no \nproblem. That vote was 50-50. The Vice President voted ``yea'' to break \nthe tie. In other words, he voted to table this amendment which would \nhave cut the SDI. He wanted the higher SDI figure. This was Vice \nPresident Bush at the time.\n  Now, I take it, under your provision, that would not work. We would \nhave had a different outcome, correct, under this amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. It all depends on whether or not the expenditure--first, \nwhether this was an expenditure of funds, whether it would put Members \nover the balanced-budget-limit requirement, and whether it was done in \nfurtherance of support for our activities in an ongoing military \nconflict.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Assuming none of those factors were met, I take it that \nthis vote, then, under this amendment we would have a different outcome \nthan we had at the time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, no, no.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thought the Vice President's vote \nwould no longer count.\n  Mr. KYL. The vote the Senator is talking about is to fund the \nstrategic defense initiative, not a vote to support an ongoing military \nconflict or ongoing military operation. It simply has no relevance to \nthe amendment that the Senator from Maryland is espousing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If it is related to addressing an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat, it would be relevant.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if it were.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, just on the factual situation, that is a \nvery close vote.\n  I take it under this amendment, assuming all the other factors were \nmet, we would have a different outcome. Is it your view we have to \nproduce 51 Senators? Or can the Vice President cast the deciding vote \nin cases of a tie under this amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. In the amendment, we have to have 51 Senators to exceed the \nbalanced budget requirement in situations in support of an ongoing \nmilitary conflict.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the Vice President's casting a vote is nullified.\n  Mr. KYL. In this situation, the Vice President--just as in any other \nsituation where we do not have a tie--the Vice President is not casting \na tie vote.\n  It is very rare that the Vice President has to cast a tie vote, but \nwe are aware of the fact he has on occasion. No one will suggest that \nthere are not occasions where we have a tie vote. What we are saying \nis, if we are talking about supporting an ongoing military conflict \ninvolving a U.S. interest, we have American men and women sacrificing \nor at least risk their lives in support of this operation, if we cannot \nmuster 51 votes in support of those young men and women, then \npresumably the Senate has said we do not want them over there taking \nwhatever risks they are taking. If we cannot trust the U.S. Senate, 51 \nSenators, to make that kind of decision, it seems to me there are not \nvery many other judgments we could make.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could the Nation go to war with a declaration of war on \nthe basis of a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes, the Nation could.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Nation could do that. But the Nation could not then \nfund the war which it has declared on the basis of a tie-breaking vote \nby the Vice President?\n  Mr. KYL. It most certainly could. If I could finish.\n  Only in the event that we did not find the money to fund the war \neffort and all of the other obligations of Government, would we have to \nexceed this balanced-budget-requirement limitation.\n  Obviously, in a case of a World War II we would be spending a lot \nmore money. We probably would go into deficit. One would assume the \nvotes would be there. But, for example, the conflict of Haiti, which is \nnot a declared war and obviously would not necessarily require that we \nbreak the bank in order to support the operation in Haiti, it does not \nseem to me to be an unreasonable requirement to require 51 Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the crux of the problem was the \nSenator's comments that we just assume that we would fund these items. \nI do not know how we can make that assumption when one can show that \nthere had been close votes in the past which would not meet the \nrequirement of the amendment and, in fact, would give the opposite \nresult from what occurred in situations in which I think it can be \nargued very reasonably there were important national security interests \nat stake.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to yield to the Senator from Idaho, but I will make a \npoint first. The Senator is correct, I am assuming that in important \nmatters where funding was necessary, 51 Senators would be willing to do \nthat.\n  But the Senator from Maryland is assuming that that is the right \nthing to do, as am I in this situation. If 51 Senators said, ``No, \nwe're not going to break the budget; we're not going to unbalance the \nbudget to fund your operation in Haiti,'' or wherever it might be, I \ncannot assume that that is a wrong decision, if 51 Senators have made \nthat decision.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. This \nmost certainly is a serious discussion about the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia. Every time in our Constitution we have \nestablished a vote, in this case a constitutional majority, and in \nother cases a supermajority, we know that is the standard. That is the \nlevel we have to reach to perform in certain ways, to respond in \ncertain ways, as so prescribed by the Constitution.\n  The validity of analyzing prospectively a situation by the \ncomparative of other situations done in an entirely different \nenvironment really has no context in this debate. This debate is about \nan amendment that sets new standards, constitutional requirements that \nwe will meet. Certainly, the Senator from Maryland and I know that on \ncertain votes on this floor, we have watched our leadership orchestrate \nvotes. Some votes are very tough and some Members really do not care to \nvote. I have been on the floor on occasion when it was well known in \nadvance that the vote more than likely would occur in which the Vice \nPresident would have to break the tie, simply because it was a tough \nvote. But we do know that in instances where, if that did not occur, \nthere is a strong likelihood that if it was the position of the \nmajority party or the majority of those here that this was the kind of \nvote required, and it was by Constitution the vote necessary, that it \ncould be gained if it was of that importance.\n  But as the Senator from Arizona has so clearly stated, if the \npriorities rested that we would not break the budget to fund an ongoing \nmilitary operation that was outside the declaration of war, my guess is \nthe Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Idaho, if we agreed that \nit was important to fund that, and certainly the Senator from West \nVirginia, if he were in his past role as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, would change or shift the priorities necessary and move \nmoney from other programs of less importance to the program of high \nimportance, in this instance military funding, for the purposes of \ndoing those kinds of ongoing funding.\n  That is the real role of this Congress and the most important role \nunder a balanced budget amendment. That is, to establish priorities, \nnot just to get enough votes to bust the budget or to go beyond \nbalance, but in the environment of a declared war, which is \ndistinctively different and we all know that because it is then the \ndecision of this country to put its men and women at risk because our \nvery freedom is at \n[[Page S2937]] risk, that we go back to the majority necessary to do so \nunder that context, the simple majority.\n  That is why those who have spent their time crafting this amendment \nhave argued so and, therefore, established section 5 of this article to \nmake sure that we force the priorities of spending the way they have \nnever been forced before in the Congress of the United States.\n  If we had had that kind of prioritizing before, most certainly we \nwould not have the $4.8 trillion debt, the $18,000-plus debt per \ncitizen, the $300 billion interest charge--it simply would not be here, \nbecause the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Idaho would have \nbeen operating during their presence here under a different mindset. We \nknow our standards and levels of performance, and we may have argued \nvery loudly over what the priorities of spending ought to be, but in \nthe end, we know that those priorities would have to have been \nestablished under a balanced budget.\n  So I am suggesting that the Senator from Arizona is absolutely right. \nTo pull a vote from 1941 and argue that that is the context in which \narticle V fits is to argue that every circumstance, every emotion, \nevery understanding of the time and the situation would be identical \nand we, of course, know that is not the case.\n  How do you justify that 21 Senators did not vote on that critical \nday? Well, probably because there may have been a few pacifists, there \nmay have been a few who could not vote either way because they simply \ncould not make such a critical decision as to send this Nation to war \nor, in this case, the draft. Those are the realities of the moment and \ntime and the emotion and the politics of that vote, and certainly the \nSenator from West Virginia, who is senior to all of us with his \nexperience on the floor, knows that every vote has its own chemistry, \nits own politics, and its own emotion.\n  What we are saying here is this is a minimal standard to force the \nSenate to prioritize under fiscal matters which we think are terribly \nand critically important to maintaining the stability of the economy of \nthis country and the fiscal responsibility of this Senate and our \nGovernment.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for one further question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know that we have some additional time. I \nwould be happy to have the colloquy continue on our time, if that is \nthe preference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let us assume that two Members of the Senate are in the \nhospital. We take a vote on this waiver and the vote is 50 to 48 in \nfavor of making an expenditure to address a national security threat. \nSo a clear majority of those present and voting have voted to do it. \nThat does not meet the standard in this article; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And, therefore, that effort would fall, even though a \nmajority were in favor of it.\n  I have difficulty with understanding how one can be so quick to \ndismiss that possibility. I have seen many close votes on the floor of \nthe Senate. I have seen instances in which Members have been absent \nbecause they are in the hospital, or for other good reasons, in which \nthe sentiment is very closely divided and you get a majority in favor \nof a position but it does not rise to the level of a majority of the \nwhole number of a House.\n  I think the problem is even more pressing in the House of \nRepresentatives where you often have votes when all Members are not \npresent. In fact, if a seat is empty that, in effect, is a vote \nagainst. Let me ask the Senator this question: Is the majority of the \nwhole number reduced if there are absent seats? There are occasions in \nthe House of Representatives where you may have three, four, five seats \nthat are not filled at one time. That happens on occasion. Is the \nmajority to get reduced from the 218, or does the number stay at 218 \neven though there may be 4 or 5 empty seats in the House?\n  Mr. KYL. The answer, as I understand it, is the requirement would be \n218 irrespective, but I do think it is a mischaracterization to say not \ninfrequently there are 3, 4, or 5 vacant seats in the House. In my 8 \nyears there, the most ever at one time was three, and very rarely were \nthere any.\n  I think if I could get back and conclude my part of the debate on my \ntime, then I will be happy to hear from the Senators from West Virginia \nand Maryland.\n  I think we have to put this back in context. We have a very important \nissue before our country right now. It is the runaway Federal budget \ndeficit and the accumulating debt that we are consigning to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. All of us understand the importance of \ndealing with that. We have some disagreement about precisely how to \ndeal with it.\n  But those of us who support the balanced budget amendment believe \nthat one thing we should do is to say that if we are going to exceed \nthat balanced budget limit, even in a time of military conflict, it \nshould require a constitutional majority, meaning 51 Senators, 218 \nRepresentatives. That is hardly too much of a burden in that situation. \nWhy? Because in that situation, we have already put young American men \nand women in harm's way by definition. Therefore, the seriousness of \nthat commitment should require an equally serious commitment on the \npart of the House and Senate in providing for the funding for those \noperations.\n  We provided, in a case of declaration of war, of course, which, as \nthe Senator from Maryland correctly pointed out, only requires a \nmajority vote, you should only require a majority vote to fund that \noperation beyond the requirement of the balanced budget amendment.\n  But in those cases where you have not made a declaration of war, such \nas the situation in Haiti, just to cite one example, if the funding \ncannot occur any other way than by breaking the budget, then we suggest \nthat a mere 51 votes in the Senate and 218 in the House is not too much \nto ask for.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia would change that to \na simple majority of those here and voting, however many decide to \nvote. We think that that is not a substantial enough requirement to \nbreak the balance of the budget that we are trying to achieve by the \npassage of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say to the Senators, we get the same kind of answers \nto every question. They say, well, we will readjust priorities. We will \ntransfer funds from some other program in order to fund the military \nneeds during an emergency.\n  I have been chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and may \nI say to my friends, I am now in my 37th year on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We do not have time to adjust priorities in emergency \nsituations.\n  Suppose you are near the close of the fiscal year when a threat to \nour military security occurs. The funding that has been provided for \nvarious and sundry agencies is almost spent for that fiscal year. How \nare you going to dip around and readjust priorities and pay for the \nmilitary emergency that is confronting you at the end of that fiscal \nyear, as envisioned by this language? You do not have time. We are \ngoing soon to be into a new fiscal year.\n  There are those here who cannot conceptualize of our being in a \nsituation in which we will have a tie vote here in this Senate, 49 to \n49, 48 to 48, or 50 to 50. If the President of the Senate--the Vice \nPresident--casts a vote, it will not count, because only the votes of \nSenators will count.\n  We get the same old answers from the proponents all the time: Oh, I \ncannot conceive of this event; I cannot believe that this will happen; \nor the intent is not thus and so.\n  Mr. President, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\n\n       It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks--the \n     pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any \n     buttock.\n\n  That is not original with me. That was Shakespeare, but it makes my \npoint. The proponents have an answer that fits all questions. It is \njust that easy. They just brush aside these real-life questions, and I \nthink that this afternoon proves our point. This is a constitutional \namendment which is not well thought out, and I say that with the utmost \nrespect for those who were engaged in the writing of it. It was not \nwell thought out.\n   [[Page S2938]] I believe that if it is welded into this \nConstitution, those who have supported it in ``reaching to take of the \nfruit'' will ``chew dust and bitter ashes.''\n  I regret that questions I have raised, and those that have been \nraised by the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland, have been, \nnot necessarily treated with a cavalier attitude, but those who \nresponded to the questions cannot seem to conceive that real-life \nsituations can occur such as we have tried to present here. And if \nthose situations do occur--and there is no question but that they will \nin the long years ahead--the country is going to be faced with a \ndilemma. We seem to be observing a very, very lax attitude here by the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  Why would they want to make it difficult for the Nation to respond to \nour Nation's security? Why set up a hurdle like that in section 5?\n  The point here, again, is that we will be hamstringing the ability of \nthe Chief Executive, the Commander in Chief, to deal with a national \nsecurity emergency, a real-life national security emergency, by \ninsisting on 51 votes of Senators and by disallowing the Vice President \nto vote to break a tie. That is reckless--reckless. I am sure it is not \nintentionally reckless, but it is thoughtlessly reckless. It defies \nlogic. It counters simple common sense. If we ever reach a real-life \nsituation that confronts us and this language is nailed into the \nConstitution, then we will have found that a great disservice has been \nthe result--disservice to our fighting men and women--and it ought to \nbe changed. Why not strike out this sentence? Why not change it to say \nadopted by a majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield the remainder of \ntime on this side.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] is recognized to propose an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 306\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the disability and death benefits of veterans)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BENNETT). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] for \n     himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Akaka and Mr. Wellstone, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 306.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 6, add the following: ``However, no \n     legislation to enforce or implement this Article may impair \n     any payment or other benefit based upon a death or disability \n     incurred in, or aggravated by, service in the Armed Forces if \n     such payment or other benefit was earned under a program \n     established before the ratification of this Article.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia controls 60 minutes. The Senator from Utah controls 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing is extremely simple and \nvery straightforward. Should the balanced budget amendment go forward--\nand it is very close--and actually become part of the Constitution, \nwhich is a result that I continue to strongly oppose, the benefits \nfurnished by the Federal Government to those particular veterans \nsuffering from service-connected disabilities, and to their survivors, \nwill be protected by my amendment.\n  Specifically, my amendment provides that the balanced budget \namendment may not be implemented by impairing any benefit based upon a \ndeath or disability incurred in, or aggravated by, service in the Armed \nForces--service connected.\n  Mr. President, at the outset, I want to be clear that while my \namendment is targeted on benefits and services directed to service-\ndisabled veterans, I in fact wanted very much to be able to protect all \nveterans and all benefits from the kind of meat-ax cutting that I think \nwill take place if the balanced budget amendment becomes part of our \nConstitution. However, I have to be realistic and I have to target--and \nI am forced to do that by the circumstances--in an effort to focus most \ndirectly on the most critical parts of our commitment to veterans. I \nhave settled on those with service-connected disabilities, those with \nthe greatest call for our protection.\n  All who serve in the military deserve our thanks and our support. If \nI had my way, I repeat, they would also continue to benefit from the \nfull range of programs that have been developed over the years. \nUnfortunately, those who favor deficit reduction over all else have \nsignificant support today, and no Federal expenditure is secure. \nTherefore, while I intend to continue my strong support for all \nveterans programs as long as I am in a position to do so, my amendment \nis crafted narrowly. Specifically, the benefits that would be protected \nby my amendment are the most vital benefits administered by the VA: \ncompensation paid to service-connected veterans; dependency and \nindemnity compensation paid to the survivors of those who die in \nservice or from service-connected disabilities; vocational \nrehabilitation provided to disabled veterans, who are disabled because \nof their service; health care furnished by the treatment of service-\nrelated disabilities; burial allowances paid when the veteran dies in \nservice or from service-related causes; and certain other ancillary \nbenefits \n[[Page S2939]] provided to service-connected disabilities.\n  Mr. President, these benefits are at the core of the mission of the \nVA. Stated simply, the principal mission of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs is to ensure that we, as a Nation, honor the commitments to \nthose who have served us and protected us, often in times of need and \noften at enormous sacrifice to themselves, and most especially those \nwho were injured or disabled during that service.\n  Too often, this commitment and this obligation to those who have \nanswered the Nation's call and suffered as a consequence, frankly, sort \nof gets lost, glossed over, forgotten. Sometimes issues relating to the \nappropriate benefits and services for these brave men and women who \nhave served, who defended us and are now disabled by virtue of having \ndone so, get lumped with other obligations of Government, as though all \nof the things the Federal Government does are kind of on an equal \nbasis, that everything is equal. Plainly, this is not so.\n  We must never diminish the obligation that is owed to those who have \nserved in the armed forces, and especially to those who have suffered \ndisability or death from that service. Taking care of those who join \nthe military, so as to defend the general population, is a tradition \nthat goes way, way back in our Nation's history. In the history of \nAmerica, this imperative can be seen from our earliest days. One of the \nfirst American veterans benefits laws on record was enacted in 1636 by \nthe members of the Plymouth Colony.\n  That law provided that, in the event one who served in defense of the \nColony returned ``maimed and hurt,'' the Colony would maintain the \nsoldier ``competently'' during the soldier's life.\n  This commitment to care for the veteran who returned disabled from \nservice has remained strong, remained vital down through our time, and \nit must continue to be honored.\n  Mr. President, if we are to amend the Constitution in the name of \nfiscal policy in the mindless way that is proposed in the underlying \nresolution, then at a minimum we must ensure that disabled veterans and \ntheir survivors are protected in that same action in the Constitution.\n  President Lincoln would be, I suppose, the President with the \ngreatest sense of depth and immediacy of the obligation of those who \nserved. He spoke of this in 1864. He said:\n\n       All that a man hath, will he give for his life. While all \n     contribute of their substance, the soldier, the soldier, puts \n     his life at stake and often yields up in his country's cause. \n     The highest honor then is due the soldier.\n\n  That was Lincoln.\n  The terms of this obligation, which is the guiding principle of the \nVA, was characterized no better than when, again, President Lincoln \nspoke of the obligation to ``care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle and for his widow and orphan.'' That is what is written beside \nthe front door of the VA. That was a long time ago that he said that, \nbut these words ring no less true today.\n  Indeed, as we enter into this new era with the cold war behind us, we \nshould pause and recall how, in fact, we came to be where we are. We \nshould pause and remember those who served from the world wars through \nKorea, Vietnam, to the Nation's most recent conflict in the Persian \nGulf and reflect on what their service has gained for all of us and \nwhat they are owed by a grateful nation for that service, most \nespecially those disabled by that service and the survivors of those \nwho gave the last full measure.\n  We must keep faith with those who served. It is a simple sentence, \nbut it is a strong one. We must keep faith with those who served for \nthat is the sort of people that we are.\n  And on a far more pragmatic level, we must honor the commitments to \nthose who served in the past so that those who are considering entering \nthe service today know that the promises made to them today will be \nkept when their service ends. To fulfill our fundamental obligation, we \nas a nation have established a wide range of veterans benefits that are \nprovided to those with service-connected disabilities, and we must \nremain true to those commitments.\n  Mr. President, the Senate recently engaged in an extended debate on \nthe relationship between Social Security and the balanced budget \namendment. I agreed fully that Social Security deserves to be protected \nfrom the vagaries of the sort of mindless budget-cutting exercise that \nwill have to take place if the Constitution is amended to require a \nbalanced budget. I think the benefits of service-disabled veterans \ndeserve protection just as well.\n  There is no question that the Social Security benefits are in the \nnature of a contract. And it is equally appropriate to identify some \nGovernment benefits, you know, these days as mere gifts or giveaways, \nso as to contrast those benefits with Social Security.\n  But that is not the nature of benefits for service-disabled veterans. \nThe contract that relates to these benefits was one signed in blood and \nmany, many times over. Veterans paid for these benefits with their \nlimbs, their sight, their mobility, their mental and physical health, \nindeed, with their very lives.\n  Benefits paid to veterans who are injured while in service to their \ncountry are valued perhaps more than any other in the VA. And veterans \nin general would agree with that. Why? Because our Nation recognizes \nand respects, as we should, the commitment we made to those who gave up \ntheir livelihood, left their homes, agreed to risk their lives for \ntheir country, asked no questions and suffered an injury while in the \ncourse of their service. Many never came home.\n  Who here intends to break our contract with the disabled men and \nwomen who have served their country and risked so much? Who would do \nthat?\n  Cutting benefits to those who served us all and who became disabled \nduring that service is simply not the sort of thing we should allow to \nhappen in a country called America. I can think of no population with a \ngreater claim on our concern and our love and our protection than those \nwho sacrificed their well-being in our common defense.\n  Mr. President, I will not repeat the legal analysis that was \npresented during the debate on Senator Reid's amendment on Social \nSecurity as to why this provision needs to be a part of the amendment \nitself and not a mere afterthought in other and separate legislation. \nIt is enough to note the obvious. Since some of our colleagues believe \nthat it is necessary to amend the Constitution in the name of fiscal \npolicy, then surely in the same amendment they can be clear that they \ndo not intend, for whatever mischief is to follow in the name of fiscal \npolicy, to have an adverse impact on disabled veterans and the \nsurvivors of those veterans who gave, as I say, their all.\n  Mr. President, I want to believe that this is the point of view of \nthose who support the balanced budget amendment, but I must confess to \nhaving some serious worries. Being able to see the words that would \nprovide the protection included in the amendment itself would remove \nany lingering doubt on my part and on the part of America's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I have more to say about my amendment and in its \ndefense, but at this point I notice the Senator from Maryland is on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia yield time \nto the Senator from Maryland?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator indicate how much time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. How much time would the Senator require?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise with great enthusiasm to support the Rockefeller amendment. I \nbelieve that we should under no circumstances balance the red ink of \nthe Federal budget by using the red blood of America's veterans.\n  Americans have served the United States of America proudly with \nhonor, with dignity and enormous self-sacrifices.\n  We are at the 50th anniversary of the commemoration of World War II--\nWorld War II in which ordinary people were called to do extraordinary \nthings, and they did them. They did it at Normandy, they did it at \nOkinawa, they did it at the Battle of the Bulge.\n  And when, at the Battle of the Bulge, a message was sent to our \ntroops to \n[[Page S2940]] surrender, our military sent back a message and said, \n``Nuts.''\n  Well, that is exactly what we are saying on the floor today for those \nwho would not be willing to exempt veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities from the balanced budget amendment. We say, ``Nuts'' to \nthose who wish to use veterans funding and make them vulnerable to \nthese swashbuckling kinds of issues that we are discussing here.\n  We know that the veterans appropriation for medical care alone \nnumbers about $15 billion to $16 billion. I know that, Mr. Chairman, \nbecause I once was the Chair of the subcommittee that appropriates \nthose. Though I am now in a sabbatical from the chairmanship, I am not \nin a sabbatical from fighting for American veterans.\n  That $15 billion is designed to meet the needs of America's veterans \nin order to be able to meet their acute care, provide primary care \nconnected to service-connected disabilities, and long-term care for \nthose who bear the permanent wounds of war.\n  Do we really want to make that vulnerable to budget cuts, mandatory \nbudget cuts that will obviously come through a balanced budget \namendment?\n  The other part that the VA funds is disability pensions for those, \nagain, who were wounded in the war and for those who are also now \napplying for those, who served in Desert Storm and other recent \nconflicts. Because of inadequate funding, we have a backlog that needs \nto be addressed, because our veterans now have to wait several months \nin order for that backlog to be able to be processed.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the veterans who have already served \nthe United States of America should not be called to do double duty by \nplacing those programs related to the deficit--those veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities being exempted from that.\n  When we think of those veterans, they are the men and women of the \nArmed Forces who fought over there so we could be safe there. People \nlike my Uncle Pete, my Uncle Fred, my Uncle Richie, who left banks, \nshops, and grocery stores to fight the Nazis and the war in the \nPacific. They were the brave men who fought in Korea in an undeclared \nwar, and in Vietnam in an unpopular war, and in Desert Storm in a high-\ntechnology war, and countless other contingencies, so when a President \ndials 911 they are there to answer, ready and fit for duty.\n  Then what do we say? Thank you. We always say a grateful Nation will \nnever forget. Well, I am absolutely concerned that we will forget and \nthose who we will forget the most are those who wear the green \neyeshades rather than military epaulets, as they look down at the \nFederal budget.\n  That is why I support the Rockefeller amendment. Each and every one \nof those men and women in the military is a symbol and living testament \nto the principles that have kept this country strong and free: loyalty, \nself-sacrifice, and patriotism. When we think of our enlisted people, \nwe think of everything that is good about this country--courage, \nloyalty.\n  Our responsibility now is to live up to the kinds of promises we made \nto them when they were called to duty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the Rockefeller amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to \nconclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will think \nlong and hard, that when they go to Veterans Day observances, when they \ngo to Memorial Day, when they rise at Fourth of July parades and give \nthe V sign or the thumbs up, and when we vote we should never, ever \nbalance the red ink of the Federal budget on the backs of American \nveterans who have served so well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, veterans' benefits and veterans' programs \nwill continue to compete very well under a balanced budget amendment.\n  But this constitutional amendment is not the place to set budget \npriorities. We cannot put statutory programs into the Constitution. \nConstitutional and statutory confusion will result if we include \nreferences to statutory programs in the text of the Constitution. It \nwould create a new type of law somewhere between constitutional law and \nstatutory law. Would we need to amend the Constitution to increase \nveterans' benefits? Would we really want to give quai-constitutional \nstatus to the technical language of the veterans' benefits statutes? \nWould we want to allow those statutes to be a loophole to let off the \npressure of balancing the budget? This could pose a risk to veterans' \nprograms as Members of Congress would have an incentive to redefine \nspending programs as veterans' programs.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is yet another attempt by opponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment to use a worthy group of beneficiaries--\nin this case our Nation's veterans--to start putting loopholes in the \nbalanced budget amendment. This poses risks to the balanced budget \namendment, could engender constitutional confusion, and might hurt \nveterans' programs.\n  Let me repeat that veterans' benefits hold a priority place and will \nbe well protected. But we should not start exempting statutory programs \nfrom the broad universal mandate of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, and I resist in saying the words ``Here \nwe go again,'' for the simple reason that I now have the privilege of \nserving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee of this Senate and, by the \noutcome of the last election, missed the opportunity to serve under the \nchairmanship of the Senator from West Virginia of this critical and \nimportant committee.\n  So when the Senator from West Virginia stands up to speak about \nveterans and veterans issues, I know he speaks with the utmost \nsincerity as to his concerns, as does the Senator from Maryland.\n  Because of that sincerity, because of the commitment that this \nSenator has, we will prioritize at the top of nearly every budget the \nresponsibility we have to honor the commitment that this Government \nmade to the men and women who put their lives in harm's way to provide \nfor our safety and security as a nation.\n  But there is no question that as we debated the Social Security issue \nand as we now debate veterans issues, that we find our services falling \ninto the Gramm-Rudman trap of taking away or exempting from any budget \nconsideration, under a controlled scenario and under this instance of a \nbalanced budget, these programs.\n  What does that say? I guess it could say they are at the top of our \npriority list, but it says we can also spend in a lot of other areas \nthat have less priority, and we exempt these programs from any \nbudgetary consideration that is fair and responsible.\n  Two weekends ago, Mr. President, I visited a new veterans home in \nIdaho that I am very proud of. I helped gain the money for that home \nand the State of Idaho moved that money. It now is the residence for 70 \nveterans who served their country well but find the need to have \nshelter provided by this unique and beautiful home. I visited with most \nof them, spoke to them. We were talking about the very issue that we \nare debating on the floor tonight, the balanced budget amendment.\n  All of them said, ``Senator, get the budget under control. I am \nreally worried about the future of this country and I am worried about \nmy grandchildren. So I hope you win. I hope you balance the Federal \nbudget,'' because what those members of that Idaho veterans home knew \nwas that the commitment their Senator had was to always put their \nissues at the front, to prioritize, as the history of this Congress has \nalways demonstrated that we will treat fairly and responsibly those who \nserved our country, because of the commitment we made when they took \nthe oath. That does not mean we move them outside of the arena of \nbudgetary considerations or the intent to be fiscally responsible.\n  If we allow but one exemption, then there are a lot of other priority \nareas that many other Senators would find necessary. I would have to \nsay to the Senator from West Virginia, what about his coal miners? What \nabout our \n[[Page S2941]] rail workers? What about my farmers and ranchers? No, \nthey did not put their lives in harm's way to ensure the safety and \nsecurity and freedom of this country. But we have said for a long, long \ntime we have an obligation to them for a variety of reasons.\n  Yet, we have not chosen to exempt them, nor should we choose to \nexempt anyone, but to force this Congress to maintain the priorities we \nthink are critically necessary. We believe that that has to be done \nunder the context of a balanced budget. As I said when we debated the \nSocial Security amendments, the threats to veterans benefits is not \nthis amendment, the threat to veterans benefits is the debt and the \ndeficit. The deficit itself is crowding out the benefits, because we \nhave to pay interest on that debt.\n  I say now if we did not have the $300 billion deficit payment, \ninterest on debt payment on an annualized basis, the Senator from West \nVirginia and I would not have to make the critical decisions we are \ngoing to be making in this budgetary cycle, with or without a balanced \nbudget requirement, which will entail reductions in growth rates of \ncertain veterans benefits, not because of a balanced budget amendment, \nbut because for too long this Senate has not been fiscally responsible, \nand we are now crowding out the very real programs that are extremely \nvaluable.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming and \nthe chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee here in the Senate, \nsuch time as he might require.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this is one of the periodic missions \nassigned to those who chair the Veterans' Affairs Committee or who \nserve as ranking member during the debate on any issue that has \nanything to do with veterans.\n  I am a veteran. There are 27 million veterans. I know some get tired \nof me quoting the statistics. But I do not get tired of it, because the \nAmerican people have been forced, in this debate on the balanced \nbudget, to wake up and figure what is going to happen to them.\n  My wake-up call came during service on the Entitlements Commission, \nthe bipartisan Entitlements Commission, chaired so ably by Senator Bob \nKerrey and Senator Jack Danforth. And 30 of the 32 of us--a very \ndiverse group ranging from Rich Trumka, Malcolm Wallop, my fine senior \ncolleague in those days, John Dingell, Tom Downey, Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun, Senator Gregg--a wonderful group of people--and 30 of \nthe 32 of us have agreed and presented to the President the fact that \nin the year 2012, with no increase in taxes, that there would be only \nsufficient revenue to fund Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nFederal retirement and interest on the national debt and that there \nwill be nothing--absolutely nothing--to be used to fund transportation, \neducation, defense, Head Start or NEA or any other discretionary \nprogram of the Federal Government, and everybody knows it.\n  I would think the veterans would have picked up on it. Veterans are a \nbright group. They have powerful organizations in this community. But I \nmust say, in my 16 years here, and having served as ranking member \nunder a fine able chairman, Senator Al Cranston--people often confuse \nus and say, ``You're Al Cranston.'' ``No, I'm Al Simpson.'' I have to \nclear that up daily. Nobody ever calls him Al Simpson but many call me \nAl Cranston. But it was difficult. That was the only thing difficult in \nthat relationship because I enjoyed him thoroughly.\n  There is nobody I enjoy more than Jay Rockefeller. He is a splendid \nfriend. I watched the chairman through the years, Senator Frank \nMurkowski, and the wonderful work that he has done, and on it goes.\n  Always we get into this wretched excess about veterans: ``What are we \ndoing for the veterans of our country?'' And the answer is everything. \nI am telling you, when I came to this body, the veterans budget was $20 \nbillion in 1978, and today it is double--double, $39.5 billion proposed \nfor 1996. And in 1978 it was $20 billion. It has doubled. And every \nyear I have to come here and listen to what we are doing to the \nveterans of America. It is a tedious exercise, a truly tedious \nexercise.\n  It comes from the veterans' groups. The organizations gin the \nrhetoric up all day long. The average increase for veterans is over $1 \nbillion a year. When every other program in America is taking a hit, \nthe veterans do not take a hit. They have not taken a hit in any way. \nWe keep adding things.\n  What we really tragically do is add new things in the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee and on the floor, because you do not dare vote \nagainst any kind of bill that has the word ``veteran'' in it. So we \ncome here and we have voted for entitlement programs that we cannot \nfund, and then the veterans groups come back in and say, or the \nveterans themselves come back in and say, ``How come I couldn't get \ninto the VA Hospital in Cheyenne or Miles City?'' Or ``Why couldn't I \ndo this'' or ``Why couldn't I do that''?\n  The answer is, ``Well, we didn't fund that.''\n  ``Well,'' they said, ``you should have funded it.''\n  So all I can tell you is that if anyone can tell me that the people \nof the United States, through their elected representatives, have not \nsupported the veterans of America, that is plain erroneous information.\n  I suppose we are going to have some charts about GDP and increases in \nthis and or the increases in that. It is like dealing with Medicare. If \nyou want to deal with another power group, other than the veterans \norganizations, deal with the AARP, who have managed to tell the \nAmerican public that we have cut Medicare $200 billion in the last 10 \nyears. Well, I would like to see that one on paper because Medicare was \n$37 billion 10 years ago, and it is now $157 billion. So if somebody \ncan tell me where the $200 billion dropped off the table, just drop a \nfax or something or slip it under the door and I will be glad to read \nit if I can to see how $200 billion simply disappeared. It is absurd to \nsay that the veterans have not been taken care of in some way.\n  There is a terrible confusion here, a very unfortunate confusion, a \nfuzzing--unintentional, I am sure--about the difference between a \ncombat disabled veteran and a service-connected disabled veteran. I \nknow this may be inside baseball to some, but it is critical, very \ncritical, because this well-intentioned amendment will do some serious \nthings.\n  You have to remember, as Senator Rockefeller says, those who enter \nservice must know that their commitments will be met. Each Congress we \nhave added to the benefits available to veterans--each year.\n  Not a year has gone by in my presence as chairman or ranking member \nthat additional presumptive diseases have not been added. I know that \nis inside baseball, too. People say, ``What is a presumptive disease?'' \nWell, there are now 86, I believe, presumptive diseases. Some of them \nobviously are connected with service in the U.S. military and the \nmajority of them are simply connected with being alive: Ulcers, \nhypertension, stress, high blood pressure, the things that happen to \nevery other person in society. If you have been in the military, they \nare presumed to have happened to you because of your service in the \nmilitary. For example, the list includes lupus. I can get the list. It \nis an extraordinary list.\n  Ninety-three presumptive diseases are called to my attention--93. If \nyou saw the list you would see that it includes every malady--and some \nare serious and some are not as serious. But every malady on that list \naffects every other person in society.\n  We do that every year. We have made additions to the cost-of-living \nallowance. We have every year increased accessibility for services and \nbenefits, and benefits have been expanded in each and every year of my \nbeing here.\n  Hear this: The argument is that we need to care for those injured as \na result of their service. The amendment of my friend from West \nVirginia, by freezing benefits for many who are being paid for injuries \nor illness unrelated to their service, would impair the ability of a \nfuture Congress to respond to the needs of those actually harmed as a \nresult of their service. This is, I am sure, a highly unintended \nconsequence.\n  Furthermore, Senator Mikulski--and she did a yeoman job as chairman \nof the HUD and VA subcommittee. She and Senator Jake Garn worked so \nwell on that. She is a spirited advocate of the amendment. She cites \nmany combat veterans. No one--please--no one, not a soul in the land \nquestions our obligation to those injured in the performance of their \nduty. But this amendment goes far beyond that. This \n[[Page S2942]] amendment would include--hear this--it would include the \n19 percent of service-connected veterans with ordinary diseases \nunrelated to duty.\n  There is a 19 percent cadre of people who I do not think were ever \nintended to be included here. It would include the 6 percent of \nservice-connected vets who are injured off base in accidents unrelated \nto duty. I do not think that was ever intended.\n  It is a remarkable, periodic thing that we go through here, and some \nof it is, believe it or not, politically motivated. I know that is a \nshocking statement. I am not attributing that here, but over the years \nI have attributed it because I can remember very well one time when I \ncame to the floor of the U.S. Senate many years ago and there was a \nSenator--he is not in our midst, he is no longer in the Senate--who was \nrailing about the veterans of America and how they have been cheated, \nshort sheeted, ripped off, treated like bums. I have never heard a \nspeech quite like it. It was a ringing thing. In fact, it is still \nringing.\n  Afterwards, we were riding the subway back and I said, ``I have a \nquestion to ask: Have you ever been in the service?''\n  And our colleague, now not with us, said, ``No.''\n  I said, ``How come it is that a person like you who has never been in \nthe U.S. military will give a speech like that when you haven't even \nbeen in the Civil Air Patrol?'' I said, ``I get tired of that. And the \nnext time you do it, I'm going to get out there and rip one, and we're \nnot going to listen to that kind of stuff again.''\n  He said, ``You wouldn't do that. It would ruin the comity of the \nSenate.'' I said, ``Well, you are already ruining it by getting out and \npretending we don't do anything for the veterans in the United \nStates.''\n  That was 1979. That gentleman never spoke again on the issue of \nveterans because I just kept a big drawer full of the statistics about \nwhat we do for veterans in this country.\n  People cannot understand that there are 27 million veterans, and only \n3 million of us have ever had a live shell go past our head in combat. \nNow, they will say, ``Oh, we can't tell how many saw combat.'' Well, I \nsay you could get pretty close. We have a form, a DD-214, that tells \nwhere you were, where you served. It is a great ploy to assert that you \ncannot tell where someone served or what they did. I do not believe \nthat one anymore either.\n  The VA does not want to provide that information because you can use \nthe word ``veteran'' to cover, literally cover, people who served 6 \nmonths--6 months. There were thousands of veterans, when I came to the \ncommittee, who had served 6 months, never left the United States, and \ndid not know a mortar tube from either end. They received every benefit \nthis country had, and I said, ``This is absurd.'' And Al Cranston \nhelped me change that. We at least put in a requirement for 2 years \nservice, and I believe that is where we are now.\n  So you can serve 2 years, never leave the United States, and not know \na mortar tube from either end and still draw every single benefit that \na disabled veteran or a veteran of combat receives.\n  Now, people do not like to hear that, and they say, ``Simpson, you \nare not doing that again.'' I almost can feel my staff pulling on my \nclothing as I bring it up again. But it is true.\n  And then I ask you to remember another one. This will get me in deep \ntrouble. You can be a service-connected disabled veteran by busting up \nyour knee playing special services basketball at Heidelberg, ladies and \ngentlemen. Hear that. Hear it. Because if I get to have horror stories \nused on me, then I get to throw the horror stories going the other way \nback into the box.\n  You can really be a service-connected disabled veteran for hooking \nyour knee over a bayonet stuck in a tree, saying, ``I want to draw a \ngreen check for the rest of my life.'' I saw a guy do that in the woods \nof Germany, and he said, ``I'm out of here, see you.'' I said, ``Boy, \nthis is great. That's not what I had in mind when I put in my 2 \nyears.'' He said, ``Well, that's what I have in mind.''\n  I do not know where that man is now. But just to believe that every \nsingle veteran is ``deserving of everything out of the Federal \nTreasury'' is to believe that every lawyer is deserving--I am one of \nthose in life--or that every politician is wholly deserving, or that \nevery person deserves a Federal check. That is not so.\n  Veterans served, you bet they did, and with honor and distinction, \nand they sometimes fought, and, tragically, some were maimed and many \ndied. Does anyone believe that we do not all know that, and have \ntremendous passion and compassion for what they did. How absurd to have \nto come and get into a debate and hear that some of us do not care \nabout those veterans or for those who bore the battle and for their \nwidows and orphans. Their service and sacrifice gave their children and \ntheir grandchildren a chance to live in freedom.\n  But today, our country's future, and the freedom of our descendants, \nface threats that are every bit as dangerous as the foreign enemies \nthat America's 27 million veterans defeated. The victories won by \nAmerica's veterans in war will be lost in peace if our Nation is \nbrought to her knees by the burden of our national debt.\n  All of us know what we are doing. We will all vote on April 1, or \nthereabouts, to raise the debt limit to $5 trillion. Now, when we get \nthe debt limit to $5 trillion and the interest on the national debt to \n$300-plus billion, you could do a lot of things for veterans with the \n$300-plus billion interest payment that will instead have to be sent \ndown the rathole. You could do a lot of things for veterans with a $300 \nbillion payment down the rathole as interest on the national debt.\n  The budget this year is $1.6 trillion, and $40 billion of it is going \nto go to the veterans of America. And I have not the slightest qualm \nabout that. I am ready to vote that. And the veterans will get to watch \nalong with the rest of our American citizens as the deficit goes $200 \nbillion a year out into eternity, but that is nothing, because in 1997 \nit will begin to go to $250 billion, and then it will go to $300 \nbillion per year.\n  I think the veterans' organizations would want to pay attention to \nthat. And then the debt in the year 2003 will be $6.3 trillion. I think \nthe veterans' organizations would really want to pay attention to that \nbecause, if our country goes belly up and we monetize the debt, \nveterans are going to get stuck along with everybody else, along with \neverybody on Social Security, along with the seniors and Head Start and \neverybody else. That is the way that works.\n  If that happens, the sacrifice of service members who died or were \nwounded protecting the future of our country will have been in vain. \nTheir service will have been absolutely in vain if the future of our \ncountry is dictated by the demands of an ever-increasing debt and \ndeficit. And the commitment of the Congress and this country to care \nfor those who bore the battle, their widows and orphans will count for \nnothing if the economy that supports all of the veterans' benefits \ncollapses under the weight of the deficits we incur today.\n  Does anyone believe that will not occur? If we continue business as \nusual, we continue to spend based on desires and pressure from the \ninterest groups; rather than budget based upon our resources, the \nfuture is very clear and the outcome is inevitable. And I have \ndescribed to you what will occur in the year 2012. And, of course, \nthere is another fact to throw in the pot. The Social Security system \nwill be broke in the year 2029. That nightmare is not just a vision of \nsome mad Reagan supporter somewhere or Jimmy Carter or George Bush or \nanyone you wish to name who served our country with distinction as \nPresident.\n  No. We are told that the system will go broke by the trustees of the \nSocial Security system, who are not exactly off the wall. They are \npeople like Lloyd Bentsen, Robert Reich, Donna Shalala, and two members \nof the general public. And they are saying that in the year 2029 the \nsystem will be broke. And they moved the doomsday up from 2036 to 2029 \njust last year. Next year, when they meet again, will they move the \ndoomsday from 2029 down to 2025? I do not know. But those of us on the \nFinance Committee are asking those questions. People like Senator \nMoynihan are asking those questions. Senator Packwood, the chairman, is \nasking those questions. These are real issues, absolutely, totally real \nconcerns.\n  [[Page S2943]] So when we come to the point of monetizing the debt, \nor whatever you have to do when you have a debt of $6 trillion, and you \nput Federal borrowing in short-term securities because the interest \nrate is less. When we have to roll over that short term debt, as the \noccupant of the chair knows so well, a one-point increase in the \ninterest rate translates to, I think, $48 billion\n to 48--$48 billion; 1 point in the interest paid by the Government \ncosts that much.\n\n  So, when that happens we do not need to worry about little things \nlike this amendment. When that happens, there will be no money to pay \nthe salaries of VA employees who would process the benefits this \namendment proposes to protect. There will be no money to pay the \nsalaries of VA doctors or nurses to care for any nonservice-connected \nillness--any nonservice-connected illness. This is an important \ndistinction.\n  If any Senator offered any proposal to limit VA health care only to \nservice-connected disabilities he would face the ultimate, immediate \nand undisguised wrath of the veterans organizations. But that would be \nthe full effect of allowing the continued growth of the deficit.\n  A Federal budget with no room for discretionary spending, I can \nassure you, will have no room for nonservice-connected health care--\nbelieve me. It will not. Because, if you want to get into a description \nof nonservice-connected health care, there are some things in there \nthat you really don't want to see.\n  I thought the most interesting part of the debate, at least as some \nof the material has come out, is that I had a very pleasing letter from \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America. If we want to continue to talk about \npeople who gave their all and do their all, then I think we would want \nto listen to the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Let me read this letter \ndated February 14, saying:\n\n       On behalf of the Members of the Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America I urge you to oppose an amendment, which we \n     understand will be offered today by Senator Jay Rockefeller.\n\n  Then they go on to describe, and I would certainly subscribe to the \ndescription also--they describe the amendment, as being ``motivated by \na heartfelt desire to attempt to safeguard benefits and services.''\n  Boy, I believe that about my friend from West Virginia, that this is \nheartfelt. I subscribe to that and I believe that. But this attempt to \ndo this--and again I am reading from the Paralyzed Veterans Association \nletter\n\n       . . . will fragment veterans' programs and seriously weaken \n     the veterans' health care system. By protecting only a \n     portion of the funding needed to maintain the VA health care \n     system, the future of the entire system could well be \n     jeopardized.\n\n  I believe that. The VA health care system, and particularly its \nspecialized services such as spinal cord injury medicine, upon which \nthe PVA members rely, will be faced with a drastically eroded patient \nbase and diminished resources necessary for its continued existence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simpson: On behalf of the members of the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), I urge you to oppose an \n     amendment, which we understand will be offered today by \n     Senator John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller, IV, to H.J. Res. 1, the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. PVA also requests your opposition \n     to H.J. Res. 1 itself. Neither of these initiatives is in the \n     best interests of the veterans of this Nation.\n       Senator Rockefeller's amendment, while motivated by a \n     heartfelt desire to attempt to safeguard benefits and \n     services for veterans disabled in military service, will \n     fragment veterans' programs and seriously weaken the \n     veterans' health care system. By protecting only a portion of \n     the funding needed to maintain the VA health care system, the \n     future of the entire system could well be jeopardized. The VA \n     health care system, and particularly its specialized services \n     such as spinal cord injury medicine, upon which PVA's members \n     rely, will be faced with a drastically eroded patient base \n     and diminished resources necessary for its continued \n     existence.\n       If this Nation is to maintain its commitment to the men and \n     women who have served in the defense of freedom, then the \n     merits of veterans' benefits and programs should be judged on \n     their merits in an open, ongoing Congressional process. \n     Senator Rockefeller's amendment recognizes the service and \n     needs of some veterans, while leaving the benefits of \n     millions of other subject to the arbitrary cost-cutting \n     mechanism which a balanced budget amendment will no doubt \n     entail.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment, H.J. Res. 1, is itself a \n     fiscal artifice which in the name of expediency is touted as \n     a promise to cut federal spending with no regard for the \n     purposes, merits or rationales of the programs and benefits \n     which will be reduced. It is our strong belief that fiscal \n     constraint and balancing federal spending must be achieved in \n     open Congressional action, with the value and purpose of each \n     benefit of service independently judged. Not all federal \n     programs are of equal value, nor are they an equal reflection \n     of our national commitments.\n       Again, on behalf of the members of Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America, I request your strong opposition to both Senator \n     Rockefeller's amendment, and to the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     which motivated it. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Richard Grant,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, a balanced budget does not require a \nreduction in any benefit or program. It would require only a reduction \nin the rate of increase of entitlement spending.\n  I commend those who desire to ensure that our Nation remembers her \nobligation to those who are injured as a result of their military \nservice.\n  But I urge them to remember that the best way to protect the future \nof veterans' benefits--is to protect the future of the Nation that \nprovides those benefits.\n  If we are serious about our obligation to veterans--we have to be \nserious about protecting economy that supports the benefits veterans \nreceive.\n  I have no fear for the strength and persistence of our Nation's \ncommitment to veterans. I do fear for the ability of our Nation to \nconvert that commitment into the reality of effective and enduring \nprograms--unless we make a commitment to protect the future of our \nNation, and the future of our economy, by bringing our appetite for \ndebt under control.\n  It is by happy coincidence that the Washington Post published on \nTuesday, February 15, contains two columns illustrating my point.\n  The first piece, by Robert J. Samuelson, provides one blueprint for \nbalancing the budget. Samuelson's plan does not reduce veterans' \nbenefits. I am sure there are many others. Thus, we can lay to rest the \nnotion that balancing the budget must reduce veterans' benefits by 30 \npercent, or--for that matter--by any other percentage.\n  The second piece, by James K. Glassman, reminds us that, if the \nCongress makes no change in spending and entitlement policy, future \ngenerations will face ``net lifetime tax rates'' that average 84 \npercent.\n  Think about that.\n  If we continue with business as usual, future generations will have \nto pay 84 percent of their net lifetime income--that's what's left \nafter allowing for Government payments back to the taxpayers, to pay \nfor this generation's spending. The source of Mr. Glassman's \ncalculations? The President's budget for 1995.\n  Does anyone doubt that such a taxation rate would bring down the \neconomy, and the veterans' benefits that depend upon it? These articles \nare so illustrative of the point I am trying to make that I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record of this debate.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Budget With the Hidden Generation Gap\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       For the past three years, the most frightening part of the \n     president's budget has been a section discussing something \n     called ``generational accounting.''\n       The economists who wrote last year's section calculated \n     that if the government didn't change its policies on spending \n     and entitlements, future generations would face a net tax \n     rate of 94 percent!\n       That figure was buried deep inside last year's 2,000-page \n     budget, and it caused a small sensation when it surfaced in \n     the press. It reminded Americans that, while President \n     Clinton was indeed cutting the deficit, government spending--\n     especially on Social Security and Medicare--would still \n     overwhelm the young and children yet unborn.\n       So when the president's new budget came out last week, I \n     naturally searched the four volumes for this year's section \n     on generational accounting.\n       [[Page S2944]] It wasn't there.\n       I phoned Laurence Kotlikoff, the Boston University \n     economist who developed the idea of looking at the federal \n     budget from the point of view of the age groups that pay the \n     bills.\n       A mild-mannered fellow who voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, \n     Kotlikoff was distraught. ``I think it's a big scandal,'' he \n     said. ``We'd assisted OMB [the Office of Management and \n     Budget] on this through the fall. Then, at the last minute, \n     some of the political types in the White House threw it \n     out.''\n       Kotlikoff sent me the new analysis that he and Alan \n     Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley and \n     Jagadeesh Gokhale of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \n     had worked out for OMB.\n       They calculated that, if current policies continue, future \n     generations will face ``net lifetime tax rates'' that average \n     84 percent.\n       Gross tax rates--the percentage of their pay that members \n     of these generations send the government--will be even \n     higher. The ``net'' figures represent the difference between \n     their taxes and what they'll receive in transfer payments \n     like Social Security.\n       Using more optimistic assumptions about health care \n     spending, the net rate could be 59 percent to 74 percent. But \n     that's little comfort.\n       ``Levying such high net tax rates on future Americans is \n     not only unconscionable, it's also economically unfeasible,'' \n     wrote Kotlikoff and Auerbach.\n       But what to do? There are, as the Congressional Budget \n     Office has noted, infinite paths to a balanced budget--\n     cutting Medicare, freezing spending, raising taxes. ``The \n     real question,'' write Kotlikoff and Auerbach, ``is not \n     whether, but when.'' Yet, in this dire emergency, Clinton has \n     proposed a budget that projects deficits of $1 trillion over \n     the next five years. And Republicans, so far, have been \n     practically silent.\n       Which brings us back to the omission of the generational \n     accounting section from this year's budget. Was it cut \n     because of fears it would prove embarrassing? That it would \n     turn the spotlight on the deficit-cutting left undone?\n       OMB spokesman Lawrence J. Haas insists the section wasn't \n     suppressed. He says it wasn't included in the budget simply \n     because it wasn't ``in the kind of shape it needed to be in \n     to be printed.'' He added: ``We have committed to publishing \n     a paper of some sort down the road on long-term issues facing \n     the nation, of which generational accounting will be one \n     issue addressed.''\n       When that paper is finally presented, I hope it shows that \n     the 84 percent tax rate for future generations is only a \n     symptom of the real disease--which is the spectacular, but \n     largely unnoticed, disparity of wealth that's developed \n     between the young and the old in America.\n       Consider, for example, what Capital Research Associates \n     recently discovered about households with incomes of $30,000 \n     or more: Families headed by a person aged 35 to 44 had an \n     average net worth of $66,000 while those headed by a person \n     65 to 74 had $222,000.\n       Eliminate real estate and the\n        disparities are even greater. The net financial assets of \n     a family headed by someone under age 45 averaged less than \n     $8,000 while those of a family headed by someone over 65 \n     averaged more than $77,000.\n       But, even though the old are richer than the young, it's \n     the old who receive the government benefits. ``There has been \n     a huge redistribution'' over the past 30 years, says \n     Kotlikoff. And that shift in wealth helps explain why the \n     U.S. personal savings rate has fallen from 6.1 percent in the \n     1970s to a dangerously low 3.9 percent in the 1990s.\n       As Nobel prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani \n     demonstrated with his life-cycle model, young people save and \n     old people consume. So, if the government takes 15 percent \n     out of the paycheck of a saver and sticks it in the bank \n     account of a consumer, the nation as a whole will get less \n     saving and more consumption.\n       But if old people are getting more of the wealth, aren't \n     they giving some of it back to their kids? Alas, says \n     Kotlikoff, research shows that altruism doesn't operate much \n     in economic life, even within extended families. Old people \n     spend what they have--on travel, shelter, medical care.\n       Last week, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), the Finance \n     Committee chairman, warned that, if Congress did not pass a \n     balanced-budget amendment, the nation would face ``a \n     cataclysmic clash between the generations when Social \n     Security begins running out in the next century.'' Yes, just \n     imagine the nightmare when we self-centered Baby Boomers \n     reach retirement age.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Here's How To Balance the Budget\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       In 1,000 words, I am going to balance the budget. I am \n     going to do it without sweeping reductions in basic services, \n     crippling tax increases or major cuts in Social Security. The \n     point of the exercise is to puncture the bipartisan myth--the \n     whining by both parties--that balancing the budget involves \n     staggering sacrifices that would somehow change the face of \n     America. It doesn't.\n       I don't mean this would be fun. Balancing the budget does \n     require a ruthless elimination of marginal or ineffective \n     programs, such as farm subsidies. My plan also involves \n     abolishing some grants to states and localities for local \n     services (schools, police, mass transit); for example, it is \n     not the federal government's job ``to put 100,000 cops on the \n     street.'' Finally, a sensible budget-balancing plan cannot \n     afford new middle-class handouts (a k a, ``tax cuts'') and \n     would impose modest tax increases.\n       Still, most Americans would hardly notice the needed \n     changes. Our budget deficits now equal 2 to 3 percent of \n     gross domestic product (GDP), our economy's output. Almost \n     any mix of spending cuts or tax increases would leave the \n     government doing just about what it does now: taxing and \n     spending about 20 percent of GDP. Spreading changes over five \n     years--to allow people to adjust--would make them even less \n     jarring.\n       I start with Clinton's deficit projection for the year \n     2000; nearly $195 billion. This includes $20 billion for \n     middle-class tax cuts; I disregard this and use the $20 \n     billion as a cushion against optimistic estimates. To balance \n     the budget, I would do the following. (All deficit savings \n     are annual and are culled from documents of the Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.)\n       End outdated or marginal programs: Get rid of farm \n     subsidies (including the Farmers Home Administration), \n     culture subsidies (public broadcasting, the arts and \n     humanities endowments), Amtrak, the Small Business \n     Administration and Cold War propaganda agencies. Deficit \n     savings: $16 billion.\n       End some subsidies for local governments: Community \n     Development Block Grants should be axed; so should subsidies \n     for mass transit, ``special education'' and ``local impact'' \n     school aid. Ditto for law enforcement grants. Deficit \n     savings: $15 billion.\n       End inept programs: Federal job training programs don't do \n     much good; the Clinton administration admits as much by \n     proposing to end most existing programs and use the savings \n     for training ``vouchers.'' Just end the programs. Deficit \n     savings: $12 billion.\n       Trim Medicare and Medicaid: Reimbursement rates for \n     doctors, hospitals and laboratories can be cut. Clinton made \n     similar proposals to finance his health care plan but now has \n     dropped them. Deficit savings: $40 billion (by the year \n     2000).\n       Raise taxes: A 12-cent a gallon oil tax (introduced over \n     three years, or 4 cents a year) would raise $23 billion by \n     the year 2000. Taxing capital gains (profits on stocks, \n     bonds) when people die would raise $10 billion. Eliminating \n     tax-exempt bonds for some private investment (some housing, \n     for instance) would raise $2 billion. Cigarette taxes could \n     be raised modestly; other tax preferences could be ended. \n     Deficit savings: $50 billion.\n       Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA): Cut 0.5 points annually \n     from the COLA; a 3 percent change would become 2.5 percent. \n     Most economists think the consumer price index--used to \n     adjust tax brackets and spending for Social Security and \n     other programs--overstates inflation, though there's \n     disagreement on how much. Deficit savings (by the year 2000); \n     $22 billion ($13 billion in lower spending, $9 billion in \n     higher taxes).\n       All these spending cuts ($96 billion) and tax\n        increases ($59 billion) total $155 billion. But lower \n     deficits mean that government would borrow less and pay \n     less interest. By the year 2000, the annual interest \n     savings would reach about $40 billion. Total savings: $195 \n     billion. If Clinton's estimates are accurate, there would \n     be a small surplus and, if not, a small deficit.\n       You will notice the absence of defense cuts. This is not \n     because the Pentagon has no waste. But defense has already \n     been sharply cut and is still declining; as a share of GDP, \n     it will soon be lower than any time since 1940. I doubt \n     whether further cuts are wise, though we could improve how \n     well we spend. Nor have I included sweeping cuts in programs \n     for the poor. Before savaging the safety net, I would want a \n     major debate. But we do not need to wait for that to balance \n     the budget.\n       Although I don't say other cuts couldn't be made, I do say \n     that this plan involves no genuine national hardship. Food \n     would be grown without farm subsidies. Public broadcasting \n     would survive without federal aid. Older Americans would not \n     starve if their benefits rose 2.5 percent instead of 3 \n     percent. States and localities would howl about lost grants; \n     but these equal only one percent to 2 percent of their \n     revenues. And federal taxes? Well, the tax burden in 2000 \n     would be only slightly higher (19.5 percent of GDP) than now \n     (19.3 percent of GDP in 1995). Most tax ``increases'' offset \n     a slow erosion of taxes under present law.\n       Harder choices do loom for the future. The retirement of \n     the baby boom, beginning about 2010, will require either \n     steep tax increases or benefit cuts. In my view, retirement \n     ages need to be raised over the next 20 years; benefits for \n     affluent elderly need to be trimmed. Somehow, Medicare will \n     have to be reformed; doctor and hospital fees cannot be cut \n     forever. But these steps require ample advance warning and do \n     not involve today's budget deficits.\n       On these, Republicans and Democrats talk differently but \n     behave similarly; both act as if the process would involve \n     gut-wrenching changes. Democrats (led by Clinton) won't say \n     how they'd balance the budget--now or ever. Mostly, they \n     peddle false rhetoric about the harsh cuts in Social Security \n     or Medicare that would be needed for balance. Meanwhile, most \n     Republicans hide behind the constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       The press has adopted the same attitude, treating a \n     balanced budget as a feat beyond mortals. All programs are \n     considered permanent. Any spending cut or tax increase is \n     [[Page S2945]] seen as political suicide. Genuine debate \n     about government's role or competence is thought naive. The \n     supposed horror of deficit reduction rationalizes inaction \n     and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is not a \nthreat to veterans and their benefits. In fact, the balanced budget \namendment may be the last and best opportunity we will have to protect \nthe future economy upon which those benefits will depend.\n  For that reason, for veterans, and for veterans' children, and for \nthe grandchildren of veterans, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nprotecting the integrity of the balanced budget amendment by opposing \nthe well intentioned, but counterproductive, amendment of my friend \nfrom West Virginia\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What is the situation with regard to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 14 \nminutes and 42 seconds. The time controlled by the Senator from Utah \nhas expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. All time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was originally 30 minutes; and 1 hour.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment \nproposed by Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia, which would protect \nthe service-connected benefits received by our Nation's 2.2 million \nveterans from cuts that might be required--or may be required in the \nbalanced budget amendment. We have been hearing a lot about contracts, \ncontracts with America, but we have not heard that much about what is, \nI think, an irrevocable contract with America's veterans who have \noften, all too often, risked their lives for our country.\n  Abraham Lincoln, with his characteristic eloquence, laid out the term \nof this contract with America. It was 130 years ago when he spoke of \nour obligation: ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and for his orphan.''\n  I might add that President Lincoln did not say that this was an \nobligation that would or could be subordinated to our need to balance \nthe budget. When Americans from all walks of life have periodically \nvolunteered to serve our Nation, no one ever told them that if they \nwere injured or disabled or they died that their survivors could count \non Government assistance only if that funding was not needed to balance \nthe budget. That is what is so important about this amendment proposed \nby the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Let there be no mistake about it. What this amendment addresses is \nearned entitlements. Let me repeat that--earned entitlements. These are \nnot mere gifts to be given or withdrawn or curtailed at the whim of the \nCongress, but entitlements earned with the blood and the sweat and the \ntears of American service men and women, as well as with the anguish \nand the pain and the tears of their loved ones.\n  These service-connected programs for veterans and their survivors run \nthe gamut from compensation to injured veterans to health care for \nservice-connected injuries to vocational rehabilitation to burial \nallowances for those who die from service-connected conditions.\n  I want to speak to one particular group of veterans I feel very close \nto. By the way, when I hear the Senator from Wyoming--and I have no \ndoubts about his commitment to the veterans in this country, no doubt \nwhatsoever. This is one of those debates where people honorably just \nhave a different perspective.\n  Mr. President, I received a poem that I would like to read from a 13-\nyear-old daughter of a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD, Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder. I wish every citizen in the country knew \nwhat it was:\n\n       For someone to share\n       Is only to care.\n       He was in the war\n       And never opens his door.\n       He lives in a shell\n       And that must be like hell.\n       He used to be my dad\n       But now he looks so sad.\n       If only he knew\n       It makes me feel blue.\n       I know he loves me\n       Why won't he hug me.\n       My mom says ``he's numb.''\n       What will I become\n       Without my father to guide me.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Wyoming, this was not a poem written in \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment. This was not a poem \nwritten in behalf of the amendment proposed by the Senator from West \nVirginia. I do not want to decontextualize this poem, but it was one of \nthose moments we have as Senators that we just do not forget.\n  We have veterans calling in all the time--this is not an \nexaggeration--especially veterans who are suffering from PTSD. All the \ntime we get calls from veterans saying ``I do not have a place to stay. \nI am living in the streets.'' They suffer from PTSD and they are not \nreceiving the support, they are not receiving the help. Veterans who \ncall, ``I am going to blow my head off. I am going to take my life.'' \nThey are not receiving the support, the assistance they need. Veterans \nwho call suffering from PTSD who say, ``I have these flashbacks and \nviolent thoughts and I feel like I am going to kill someone.'' They are \nnot receiving the support that they need.\n  I was at the VA medical center in Minneapolis on Sunday. We were able \nto obtain several hundred thousand dollars more for some additional \ntreatment programs for vets that are suffering from posttraumatic \nstress syndrome.\n  I have to say, I read the poem from this 13-year-old girl about her \ndad. She lives in Glenwood, MN. There are some veterans out there who \nserved this Nation who, as a matter of fact, right now are not \nreceiving the kind of support they really need. These are just unmet \nhuman needs that cry out, I think, for assistance. These are men and \nwomen who served the country, and they deserve the support.\n  So when Senator Rockefeller proposes this amendment that there should \nnot be cuts in needed service-connected programs, I am thinking that \nthe existing programs right now do not meet the need. This is, if you \nwill, a very personal issue for me. It is to obtain more assistance for \nthese veterans that are dealing with PTSS.\n  Yet, we are talking about the potential of all sorts of deep cuts. We \nknow that. One more time. Let me give context. We are talking about \n$1.3 trillion worth of cuts. We are going to increase the Pentagon \nbudget. We have not talked about decreasing it. We have not talked \nabout decreasing military contractors. In addition, we are going to pay \nthe interest on the debt. We have this bidding war to cut taxes when we \nsay we are for more deficit reduction.\n  Senator Feingold and I had an amendment last week on the floor that \nsaid at least consider $425 billion of tax expenditures. These \nloopholes and deductions quite often are dodges when it gets down to \nthe question of how we are going to balance the budget. That was voted \ndown. We do not lay out where we are going to make the cuts. So once \nyou see what is off the table and then you see what is left, we know \nthere are going to be some deep cuts in veterans programs.\n  That, I believe, is the importance of this amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. That is why I rise to the floor to support this \namendment.\n  I really believe that we would be making a terrible mistake if we \nmade cuts in these service-connected programs, especially when we can \nmake a lot of cuts and balance the budget in a whole lot of other ways. \nIn the sense of holding us accountable with an amendment like this, I \nbelieve we are going to go back on a very sacred promise that was made \nto veterans in this country and veterans in the State of Minnesota.\n  I thank the Senator for his amendment. I am very pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor. I certainly hope the U.S. Senate will vote for it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for coming to the \nfloor and speaking the truth.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask my colleague for a moment? I ask unanimous \nconsent that the poem from the 13-year-old daughter of a Vietnam vet \nsuffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     For someone to share\n     Is only to care.\n     He was in the war\n     And never opens his door.\n     He lives in a shell\n     And that must be like hell.\n     He used to be my dad\n     But now he looks so sad.\n     If only he knew\n     It makes me feel blue.\n     I know he loves me\n     Why won't he hug me.\n     My mom says ``he's numb.''\n     What will I become\n     Without my father to guide me.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Democratic leader is about to \ncome onto the floor. So I will not get started on a number of things \nthat I have to talk about. But I note that the Senator from Wyoming, my \ngood friend, Senator Simpson, mentioned that the Paralyzed Veterans \nspoke out against this amendment, which is something that saddened me \nvery much. They wanted all veterans included. So did I. They want all \ntheir members included. They have 16,000 members of Paralyzed Veterans \nnationwide. Their chapter in West Virginia actually does not agree with \nthem. The head of the West Virginia chapter is non service disabled, in \na wheelchair. He said that he did not agree with his national \norganization's position, that he wanted me to do whatever I could to \npreserve veterans benefits.\n  On the other hand, let's turn to the Disabled American Veterans \n(DAV). They represent 1.4 million veterans, and DAV very much supports \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, last week was Valentine's Day. That is a day, of \ncourse, we remember to set aside for those we love. Valentine's Day has \nanother meaning altogether for a certain West Virginia veteran who \nserved in World War II through the Korean war. He is a friend of mine, \nEzra Miller. I want to talk about him.\n  It was on Valentine's Day, in fact, in 1943 that Ezra Miller was \ncaptured by the Germans and began his own private war, which was a \nprivate war to survive. Ezra grew up on a farm in Lincoln County, WV. \nThat is a rural county. Like so many of our mountaineers, he never \nhesitated when he thought that his country needed him.\n  Before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Ezra had enlisted in the Army. In \nearly 1943, Ezra found himself close to the front lines in North \nAfrica. His unit's mission was to go ahead as foot soldiers, and blow \nup a pass that would prevent the Germans from entering into North \nAfrica. He got this assignment on the 2d day in combat. His description \nof the event goes like this. This is one of the men that we will be \nprotecting.\n  He said:\n\n       On that day, a small American observation plane flew over \n     our gun emplacements and dropped a message from headquarters \n     that said, ``Destroy everything and get out on foot, if you \n     can. The Germans have you surrounded.'' After taking the \n     message to the outpost, I tried to get out of the area on \n     foot but I never made it because I got pinned down by dive \n     bombers. I laid down in a slit trench and a 500-pound bomb \n     exploded very close to me and pushed an enormous amount of \n     dirt all over me.\n\n  Ezra goes on to say that a German tank rolled right over that slit \ntrench now filled by dirt and by Ezra, and after it passed, he got up \nand found himself looking into the barrel of a German rifle. Ezra spent \nthe next 2 years, 3 months, and 27 days as a prisoner of war. During \nthat time he lived in five different prison camps, one of which was \ncalled Dachau. At one point, he and his fellow prisoners traveled in \nboxcars. We have heard about those things, have we not? The boxcars, \nMr. President, should have held only 40 men. The Germans crammed 84 \nPOW's and Ezra into a boxcar, and they rode like that for 4 days and 3 \nnights. They had to remain standing because they were packed in there \nso tightly that they were unable to move. Ezra called it ``pitiful.'' \nHe said they could hear the planes passing overhead, but had no idea \nwhose they were or what was happening.\n  When Ezra enlisted in the Army, he was in his early twenties. He \nstood 5 feet 11 inches tall and he weighed 174 pounds. When he was \nfreed, he weighed less than 90 pounds. Yet, he remained in the \nmilitary, and he went on to fight in Korea.\n  For the last 2 years, Ezra has made his home at the West Virginia \nVeterans Home in Barboursville, something I started when I was \nGovernor. He tells me that he loves living there, and I as a Senator \nand as his friend am delighted that Barboursville is there for Ezra and \nthe many deserving veterans like him.\n  But I want to make a very important point that I think cannot be \noverlooked. One would expect that our Government is paying a sizable \nbenefit to Ezra, I would think a large one, and the others like him who \nwere prisoners of war. No, not so. Ezra Miller is only 10 percent \n``service-connected.'' That is the terminology for it. That means his \nmonthly check to compensate him for injuries he received during his \nmilitary service--do you know how much per month? Eighty-seven bucks.\n  If we pass this balanced budget amendment and we do not pass this \namendment to it, and we take 30 percent of that, Ezra will receive 61 \nbucks per month. Are we going to tell Ezra that it is his time to \nsacrifice again, for him to pull in his belt? He is back up to over 90 \npounds again. Not this Senator from West Virginia, not me.\n  Our country had almost 150,000 Americans who were captured and \ninterned from World War I through the Persian Gulf war. Can we ask our \nPOW's to take a cut in benefits, our prisoners of war?\n  Mr. President, I notice the presence of the Democratic leader on the \nfloor. I will address a question to the Democratic leader. Would he \ncare to proceed? I know he wanted to say something on this amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and thank him for the leadership he has exhibited on \nthis issue. I rise in support of his amendment and urge my colleagues \nto support it when it comes up for a vote later this evening.\n  Mr. President, earlier in this debate on the balanced budget \namendment, I offered a proposal called the right-to-know amendment. \nThat measure would have required Congress to spell out how it would get \nto a balanced budget before sending the amendment to the States for \nratification.\n  I offered my proposal so that the American people would understand \nthe kinds of cuts in Federal spending that will be needed to zero out \nthe deficit.\n  But the Republican majority rejected my proposal. In doing so, they \nindicated that everything except Social Security would be on the table.\n  Let us be clear: Everything except Social Security includes the \nbenefits that are paid to veterans who were disabled as a result of \ntheir military service.\n  There are currently 2.2 million American veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities. They are men and women from all walks of life \nwith all kinds of injuries. But they all have one thing in common--they \nwere injured while serving our Nation in the Armed Forces.\n  When they joined the service, they made a simple pact with the \nFederal Government. Their part of the bargain was to defend this Nation \nand protect its national interests. In return, the Government promised \nto care for them should they be injured during their military service--\nor for their survivors should they be killed.\n  This commitment to our veterans is one which our Nation must uphold.\n  It is a commitment that we have upheld for decades. It is a \ncommitment that goes back virtually to the very foundation of this \ncountry. And we have renewed this commitment after each conflict, to \neach new group of veterans. This commitment has withstood the test of \ntime, and it has withstood the many forces that have sought to erode \nour firm promise to those who have defended this Nation so gallantly on \nso many occasions throughout our history.\n  The amendment offered by my friend Senator Rockefeller, the ranking \nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, is simple and \nstraightforward. It says that Congress cannot cut the \n[[Page S2947]] benefits that were promised to our disabled veterans in \norder to balance the budget.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that \nthis amendment is not necessary. They will say that Congress would \nnever cut these benefits, and indeed I hope that is true.\n  But I say to the American people--and to our veterans--how can we be \nso sure?\n  How can we be sure that these benefits will be protected if we do not \nspell it out in the amendment itself? How can we be sure if we are not \nwilling to put our intentions in writing? The only way we can be sure \nis if we are willing to put in writing, in the amendment itself, our \ndetermination to protect service-connected veterans from the budget \naxe. We must spell out that we will honor the commitment we made to the \nmen and women who risked and gave their lives for this Nation.\n  The disability compensation payments and the health care we provide \nto these veterans can never make them whole again. But it can help take \ncare of them in their time of need, just as they answered the call when \nthis Nation needed them.\n  Veterans should not be asked to give up the benefits they so rightly \ndeserve in the name of deficit reduction.\n  They have sacrificed enough for this Nation already.\n  I certainly hope that my colleagues will appreciate this commitment \nto our veterans and will agree to put into writing what we all say we \nwant: protection for disabled veterans at a time when they need it the \nmost. We need to support the Rockfeller amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the comments made on \nthis amendment by my friend, the Senator from West Virginia, regarding \nthe extreme importance of benefits for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities. I could not agree more.\n  I have heard the compelling arguments that veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities are the most deserving and most honorable \npopulation in our society. Again, I could not agree more. These \ncitizens have served their Nation, and have served well.\n  However, I must respectfully disagree with the notion that we should \nexclude these benefits from the strictures of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to the concept of the balanced budget \namendment. I am committed to the idea that the financial security of \nthis Nation rests on the ability of the Federal Government to curb the \npractice of spending beyond its means. In reviewing the fiscal history \nof this Nation over the past 25 years, it has become clear to me that \nthe will to exercise the necessary spending restraint does not exist \nwithin this body without a strict requirement that we do so. I believe \nthat the balanced budget amendment provides such a framework, and that \nis why I support it.\n  Clearly the Rockefeller amendment is difficult to vote against. But \nin listening to the debate, I believe strongly that the very arguments \nmade by the proponents of this amendment are exactly those that will \ninsulate veterans disability benefits from future budget cuts.\n  I am certain that every Senator in this body would put veterans' \ndisability benefits high on the list of expenditures to be protected. \nBut if we are serious about passing a meaningful balanced budget \namendment, then we must reject efforts to dismantle that effort through \npiecemeal exclusions of programs, however worthy they may be.\n  When it comes to the annual appropriations process, of which I am an \nactive participant as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nI will be at the front of the line to protect veterans' disability \nbenefits. But as a supporter of the balanced budget amendment, I must \nobject to this exclusion.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from West Virginia which seeks to protect our Nation's \nveterans from the cataclysmic impact of the balanced budget amendment.\n  The bill currently under consideration requires the Federal budget to \nbe balanced each year, beginning in the year 2002. If Congress is \nunable to balance the budget each year, across-the-board cuts would \nprobably be implemented to meet this balanced budget mandate. If this \noccurs, veterans programs, especially the Veterans Administration [VA] \nhealth care programs, would be decimated.\n  On October 6, 1994, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown \ntestified that an across-the-board cut in veterans programs would \nresult in a decrease of 44,000 VA medical personnel. In addition, \n250,000 veterans could no longer be treated at VA hospitals, 5.4 \nmillion outpatient visits could not be provided, and many of the VA \nmedical facilities would have to be shut down.\n  Other programs, including treatment of Persian Gulf veterans and \nveterans with PTSD, would not be receiving the level of quality care \nthey currently receive. Thousands of veterans who are leaving the \nservices due to the reductions and budgetary cut-backs would not be \nable to receive transitional services, which have been successful in \nintegrating our Nation's veterans back into the civilian work force.\n  More importantly, however, is the devastating impact the effects of \nthe balanced budget amendment would have on our Nation's service-\nconnected disabled veterans. Over 2,000 VA personnel, who counsel \nveterans and process claims, including service-connected disabilities \nand pensions, would have to be terminated. The current claims backlog \nwill only escalate without resources, which will directly impact the \nservice-connected benefits entitled to our disabled veterans.\n  Disabled veterans, often times, our most vulnerable citizens who \nbarely live above the poverty level would experience the greatest \nimpact. The balanced budget amendment would result in dramatic \ndecreases in health care service and financial assistance to our \nservice-connected disabled veterans. This would result in many disabled \nveterans and their survivors to live below the poverty level. Those who \nwere wounded defending our Nation deserve better treatment--they \ndeserve our appreciation and support. We should not be taking away \ntheir service-connected benefits in their time of need.\n  We need to balance our budget, however, I do not believe we need a \nbalanced budget amendment to do so. We must make difficult policy \ndecisions to reduce our spending and eliminate our deficit. We should \nnot do so on the backs of our Nation's service-connected veterans.\n  As a cosponsor, I urge my colleagues to support the Rockefeller \namendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent to have printed a letter I \nreferred to from the Disabled American Veterans.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             Disabled American Veterans, National Service and \n                                      Legislative Headquarters\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: On behalf of the more than 1.4 \n     million members of the Disabled American Veteran (DAV) and \n     its Women's Auxiliary, I take this opportunity to thank you \n     for your efforts to protect the VA benefits and services \n     provided to our nation's 2.5 million service-connected \n     disabled veterans, their dependents and survivors from \n     additional cuts.\n       While we in the DAV certainly understand the need to \n     balance our nation's budget, we do not support doing so on \n     the backs of America's service-connected disabled veterans \n     and their families. As you know, the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Acts of 1990 and 1993 alone cut VA benefits \n     and services by nearly $7 billion. In addition, the budget \n     recently sent to Congress by President Clinton proposes to \n     cut veterans' benefits by an additional $3 billion to the \n     year 2000.\n       Senator Rockefeller, we believe all veterans benefits and \n     services deserve the highest priority in this country and \n     should be protected from further cuts. Inasmuch as your \n     amendment to H.J. Res. 1 protects the benefits of those \n     veterans who became disabled during service in this nation's \n     military, we fully support it.\n       Again, thank you for your continued efforts to protect the \n     benefits earned by our nation's service-connected disabled \n     veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald A. Sioss,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n   [[Page S2948]] Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, am I going to have to \ntell approximately 21,000 service-connected veterans and their \ndependents who receive benefits in my State of West Virginia that the \npromises made to them will no longer be kept, that the amount of money \nthey are receiving for their injuries received while dutifully serving \ntheir country, or the survivors' benefits they are receiving, because \nthey lost their husband or their father, will be cut by 30 percent?\n  Zeke Trupo, in my home State of West Virginia, would be a good \nreference for us today and I advise my colleagues on the floor, \nparticularly as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Iwo Jima.\n  Zeke, a Marine, had been wounded once, treated and returned to his \nbattalion just in time to make the Iwo Jima landing. And engaged in one \nof the best known battles of World War II. Zeke describes the battle \nmuch like this: It was around the clock combat with flamethrowers, K-\nbar knives and trenching tools when the ever-present sand jammed the \nrifles. It was pitching grenades and point-blank artillery fire and \nsometimes even using the dead for cover. That is what he said.\n  He was wounded in the face, in the hands, arms and legs. He said he \nwas scared to death. He thinks about his buddies who did not make it. \nThis World War II U.S. Marine veteran from West Virginia, who earned \ntwo purple hearts, Zeke Trupo, as a service-connected veteran, is \nreceiving compensation for his injuries. He injured four parts of his \nbody, but he is rated 10-percent service-connected. He is a good \nexample of one of those service-connected veterans whose compensation \nsome think we should stop.\n  Raymond LaPointe lives in Mannington, West Virginia. He is a 70 \npercent service-connected veteran. Raymond served in the army, entered \nthe service in the late 1940's, was sent to the Pacific to help with \ncleanup after the war. He recalls searching caves for Japanese, who as \nyou may remember, many of them did not know that the war was over.\n  So it may have been after the war but was it? He then went on to \nKorea, where he was a combat veteran, earning a Purple Heart, two \nBronze Stars for valor and the Distinguished Service Cross.\n  Today, Raymond is not living out a happy-go-lucky life in Mannington, \nWest Virginia. He has PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder, one of the \nworse things that can happen to any human being, and he has it. He just \nrecently returned home from the hospital where he had been for 63 days \nfor the treatment of PTSD.\n  He is unable to work. He cannot be left alone for any extended period \nof time. He has intrusive recollections, he has nightmares, and he is \nconsiderably angry and focuses his anger on the war. His wife and grown \nchildren can readily explain how turbulent and sad the past years have \nbeen because of what Raymond has gone through.\n  Now, as a 70-percent service-connected veteran, this man, who has \nvirtually had no life of his own for so many years, receives $915 a \nmonth from what we are talking about here, service-connected \ndisability--$915 a month.\n  Without my amendment being adopted, Raymond and his wife, June, will \nsee their check drop from $915 a month to $614 a month. That is called \nbelow poverty.\n  George Zutaut is a 100-percent service-connected veteran--100 \npercent--who lives in Beckley, West Virginia. George is an Air Force \nveteran who served in Vietnam. His company would fly in and out of Viet \nNam repairing our C-130's, which were our cargo planes.\n  George has multiple sclerosis. He has been in a wheelchair now for \nalmost 20 years. He tells me he does not know how he would have made it \nwithout the services he received from VA.\n  George receives a service-connected compensation check that allowed \nhim to raise his family--it is one way you pay back a debt--and he got \nhelp under the adaptive housing benefit in the VA that enabled him to \nadapt his home--he has to have adaptive housing help--so he could \ncontinue to live there, because of his wheelchair, and continue his \nlife in spite of his disability.\n  What are we going to do about those benefits, Mr. President? Going to \ncut them, too.\n  Mr. President I must remind everybody that the benefits a service-\nconnected veteran is receiving is something that he or she is receiving \nto compensate--that is the key word--compensate--for an injury \nreceived. It is payback, as promised.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, may I ask a question, please?\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I wonder if I might direct it to the \nSenator from West Virginia, through the Chair.\n  If this amendment should be adopted, will my friend, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, vote for the balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. My record has been very clear from the very \nbeginning that I oppose the balanced budget amendment for a lot of \nreasons, of which my concern for veterans is a main one.\n  I have no illusions as to what is going to happen to this amendment \nand neither does the chairman of my committee, on which I am the \nRanking Member. My good friend Alan Simpson knows what is going to \nhappen to this.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], to table the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller].

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n   [[Page S2949]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] moves to refer \n     H. J. Res. 1 to the Budget Committee with instructions to \n     report back forthwith H. J. Res. 1 in status quo, and at the \n     earliest date possible report to the Senate a report \n     containing the following text:\n       Pursuant to section 201(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act, the Committee on the Budget recommends that the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives do not appoint a Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office for the term expiring January 3, \n     1999, until the Senate and House have had an opportunity to \n     consider legislation amending section 201 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act to require that the Director be \n     appointed by concurrent resolution of the Senate and House.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for my colleagues' information, I shall \ndiscuss this motion and then withdraw the motion. I intend to offer \nthis as an amendment on the next piece of legislation that comes to the \nfloor of the Senate following the disposition of the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. But I do wish to speak about it for a \nfew moments, and I am pleased to see the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is on the floor.\n  I want to make a couple of comments about the appointment of a \nDirector for the Congressional Budget Office. Let me state again, as I \nhave stated several times, my comments are not comments that are \ndirected to the capabilities of Prof. June O'Neill, who has been \nannounced by the chairmen of the two Budget Committees as their \nrecommendation for the post of Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  My concern is about the process. I do not know much about Professor \nO'Neill, but at least from what I understand about this process, it is \nnot in keeping with the process that has been used in the past.\n  Frankly, this is an extraordinarily important appointment. The person \nselected to head the Congressional Budget Office, in effect, becomes a \nreferee on a whole range of important economic and budget issues that \nare presented to the floor of the Senate and the House. We know from \nhaving seen many statements and heard a lot of discussion, some of it \npolitical, some of it policy, that there are people who are enormously \nfrustrated with the way things are scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Some say if we could just get a Congressional Budget Office that uses \ndynamic scoring rather than static scoring, well, then we would have a \nmuch different set of numbers to work with. I understand why people \nfeel that they would like numbers that are more satisfactory to them, \nthat better reflect their own views. Some people strongly believe in \ndynamic scoring and want to see it used.\n  I recall the discussion back in the early 1980's about dynamic \nscoring. They say if we do the following several things, it will \nproduce various kinds of incentives that will lead to other results. \nFor example, if you cut the tax rates, you will, in fact, increase the \ntax yield.\n  That is dynamic scoring. They produced the Laffer curve and a whole \nseries of things to describe what the dynamic scoring meant.\n  Well, Prof. June O'Neill is someone who has been designated now as \nthe person they want to head the Congressional Budget Office. My ears \nperked up when I heard the discussion about the appointment. The \ndiscussion in news reports indicated that Prof. O'Neill tried to be \ndiplomatic on the question of dynamic scorekeeping. She said, ``I \nexpect I will be dynamic when that's called for and static when that's \ncalled for.'' And then the chairman of the House Budget Committee \njumped in and said, ``I think it's fair to say we would not have \nselected somebody who is in concurrence with everything that's been \ndone up until now. I'm personally comfortable,'' the chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee said, ``with the fact that June O'Neill will \nbegin to upgrade the models within CBO.''\n  The point is, he said, ``I wouldn't have selected somebody who is in \nconcurrence with everything that's been done up until now.''\n  I happen to know that on the House side at least the ranking minority \nmember of the Budget Committee had a chance to visit with Professor \nO'Neill the afternoon following the morning that her selection was \nannounced by the chairman of that Budget Committee.\n  Well, we have in the past selected Alice Rivlin. We have selected \nRudy Penner. We have selected Bob Reischauer. Generally speaking, the \nappointment process has been a consultative process; it has been a \nbipartisan selection process in which each side respects the other's \njudgment about these things.\n  I have seen the letter in which the minority members on the Senate \nside indicated they felt that the Budget Committee should seek \nadditional applicants before reaching a decision.\n  So my point is not that this person is necessarily the wrong person. \nMy point is this person was selected without wide consultation. I do \nnot know about the Senate as much as I do about the House on the \nminority side, but I do know that the minority side in the other body, \nthe lead minority Member, did not get a chance to talk to Professor \nO'Neill until after the announcement was made that she was going to be \nselected.\n  Well, that is not, in my judgment, the process that we would like. I \npersonally think that the CBO Director should be subject to the \napproval of the full House and Senate. Let us go ahead and have a vote \non it. I am going to offer an amendment that will provide for that kind \nof process. I intend to offer that amendment to the very next \nlegislative bill that comes to the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope very much that the majority will withhold the appointment of \nProfessor O'Neill and let the House and the Senate express their will \non this appointment.\n  Now, I understand that many people have very strong feelings about \nthis. Some people think Professor O'Neill is exactly the right person \nfor this job. That may be the case. I do not know. I do know this, that \nwe have had plenty of debate around here by people who say we are going \nto change things down at CBO. ``No more of this static scoring \nnonsense,'' people have said. ``We are going to get somebody in there \nwho sees this the way we see it. We want somebody who scores it our \nway.''\n  Well, I do not know whether this is a candidate who would do that. If \nshe is, I would be greatly concerned. If she is not a dynamic scorer, \nmaybe we have more discussion about it and maybe everybody is \ncomfortable, and that is just fine. But my point is that it is not just \nfine the way it rests now because I do not think this process has \nproduced a consensus among people who should develop a consensus on \nthis on both sides of the political aisle.\n  So that is why I raise this issue today. This is not just some other \nold, ordinary appointment. This is the selection of a referee. I want \nthat referee to have the respect of everyone in the House and the \nSenate. I want that referee to be someone in whose judgments the full \nSenate can have confidence. We need to know that a CBO Director's \njudgment will be impartial, and that the judgment is not biased due to \nsome notion about how one side or the other in this Congress will be \naffected by the decision coming from CBO.\n  I think most of us believe that has been the case with the past \nseveral Directors of the Congressional Budget Office. I hope it will be \nthe case with the next several Budget Directors. But I do not have \nconfidence that is the case now, given the lack of consultation during \nthis appointment process. Again, my hope is that we will not proceed \nwith this appointment until I have an opportunity on the next piece of \nlegislation to make a change in the process by which the appointment is \nmade.\n  I know my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, wishes to \nspeak. Let me indicate again I intend to withdraw this on this \nparticular measure because this is not the place to do this, and I will \noffer it on the next legislative measure before this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  [[Page S2950]] Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to join Senator \nDorgan, my colleague from North Dakota, in raising this issue. I do so \nbecause I genuinely believe that the appointment of the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office ought to be a bipartisan undertaking. Both \nsides need to have confidence in the fairness and objectivity of \nwhoever is the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. And it \nseems to me the appropriate way to reach a decision is for both sides \nto have input and both sides to participate in the conclusion as to who \nshould hold that office.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. I serve on the Finance Committee. I \nthink all of us recognize the critical importance the Director of CBO \nplays. We saw last year that Director Reischauer, who was put in place \nwhen the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, disagreed with \na central part of the President's presentation on health care. The \nPresident believed that should be treated as an off-budget matter, and \nthe Director of CBO felt differently and ruled differently. It had a \nsignificant impact on that debate. I personally think Dr. Reischauer \nwas correct. I told him at the time I thought he had done the right \nthing by ruling as he did, even though it was adverse to the interests \nof a President of my own party.\n  And yet I think that is what distinguishes the Congressional Budget \nOffice for all of us, that we have an ability to have confidence in the \ndecisions of that person, and that person is above partisanship; that \nperson is above weighting the evidence; that person is above changing \nprojections for political purposes.\n  Mr. President, when I was in my previous life before I came to the \nSenate, I was the tax commissioner of the State of North Dakota. In \nthat position, I had a responsibility for estimating the revenues that \nwere under my administrative direction for the State of North Dakota. \nWe had one requirement in my office, and that was we were going to do \nour level best to make an objective determination as to projections for \nthe fiscal types that were under our control and authority.\n  I am very concerned that Dr. O'Neill, Professor O'Neill, may be \nwilling to shade her opinion. And I say that because of the press \nreports of what Chairman Kasich indicated he believed were commitments \nthat he had from Professor O'Neill.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the process we have gone through \nhere, because I do not think we have a circumstance in which there is a \nmeeting of minds between the two sides. I do not for one moment take \naway from the majority that they have the lead in this matter. I think \nthey have that obligation and that responsibility. But I think there \nought to be at least a concurrence on the other side, and I believe \nthat ought to be the case if my party were in control, because \nultimately both sides must have confidence in the judgments made by the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office. That is absolutely \ncritical to the success of the work that we do here.\n  I have great regard for the chairman of the Budget Committee. There \nare very few people who do their homework around here as seriously as \nthe chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. We sometimes disagree on \npolicy, but I have never questioned his commitment to fairness. I have \nnever questioned his commitment to making certain that both sides are \ndealt with in an equal and even-handed way.\n  Mr. President, I must say, I rise on this matter to say I do have \nsincere reservations about the way this has been handled. I do not \nthink it is something that should be repeated, and I say that whether \nit is the Democrats who are in control or the Republicans in control. \nWith respect to this position I believe both parties ought to have an \nability to contribute to the selection of the person named.\n  We have had people of, really, I think, broad reputation, people who \nwere held in high regard by both parties in that position since I have \nbeen here. Dr. Reischauer, Rudy Penner, Alice Rivlin--all of them came \nto that position held in high regard, were taken seriously and I think \nrespected on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield to me, my \nunderstanding was when you take a look at this process you see how \nunusual it was. On the House side in the Budget Committee when they \nbegan to have a short discussion on this potential appointment, and \napparently not too far into the discussion, a Member of the majority \nparty moved the previous question--which is almost unprecedented in the \nBudget Committee, to move the previous question to cut off discussion.\n  So there are a whole series of things that are unusual here. I wonder \nwhy, especially the statement when the chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee jumps in and says, ``Well, I think it would be fair to say \nthat we would not have selected somebody who is in concurrence with \neverything that has been done up until now.'' This coming from the \nperson who has led the way here in the last few months talking about \nthe need to change the way we score. We need to have dynamic scoring, \nwe are told. I do not understand what he understands about this nominee \nbecause I am not on the Budget Committee. But this at least says \nsomething to me that is of interest. I just wonder why. Why move the \nprevious question when they began a short discussion about the subject \nin the House Budget Committee?\n  All I am saying is this process somehow has broken down, if it is \nsupposed to be a process, as the law says, that results in ``the \nappointment of a director without regard to political affiliation'' et \ncetera. The process has broken down. It needs to be a process that \nengenders trust on both sides that this person is a fair person. Maybe \nthis person is but I am just saying the process does not lead us to \nachieve that result at this point.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say in conclusion, perhaps this person is fair. I \ndo not know that. But I do know the process we have gone through is not \nan appropriate process, certainly not in the eyes of this Senator. I \nhope very much that we revisit this issue before it is concluded and \nhave a chance to do it in a way that will engender respect and support \non both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not take a lot of time. It is \nlate. I say to my good friends, both of the Senators who have spoken \nwith reference to the selection of Dr. June O'Neill for CBO Director, I \ngreatly respect their opinions. I just happen not to agree with them \ntonight.\n  I would like to share with the Senate what this is really all about. \nFirst, the biggest issues with reference to dynamic versus static \nscoring have come with reference to taxes, for some contend that the \nRepublicans intend to pass a capital gains tax and to use some kind of \nmiraculous scoring to make it easier to pass it than it would otherwise \nbe from the standpoint of budgets and fiscal policy. Everybody should \nunderstand that the Congressional Budget Office director, whether it be \nRudy Penner, who was a Republican when the Republicans controlled, or \nwhether it be Dr. Alice Rivlin, when the Democrats controlled, or Dr. \nReischauer, when the Democrats controlled both Houses--in none of those \nevents, as will be the case for this new director, do they have \nanything to say about dynamic scoring of taxes.\n  There was a formal decision made by the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives that the estimation of taxes, both the loss of revenue \nand the increases in revenue, the extent to which they are dynamic \nversus static, is totally within the judgment call of the Joint Tax \nCommittee. So, No. 1, whatever our friends on the House side say--\neither for real or in exuberant state--that they expect the new budget \ndirector to change the way they have done business, of course I do not \nhave anything to say about what they say. I cannot control that. But \nthe truth of the matter is this new director will have nothing to say \nabout dynamic or static, with reference to tax changes by the U.S. \nCongress in the tax codes of this country. So I think one must \nunderstand that.\n  [[Page S2951]] That is just the first few remarks. Let me make sure \nthe Senate understands, and I greatly appreciate that we are not going \nto vote on this issue, that Rudy Penner, once this decision was made, \nsaid: She will be a good director. I recommend her. The Senate should \nknow that.\n  Bob Reischauer, one of the esteemed current operatives within public \nservice in Washington, DC, when some on the other side started the flap \nover Dr. June O'Neill, got ahold of one of the Senators on that side--I \nthink it is common knowledge now, and has since gotten ahold of a \nnumber of them--and said: Nothing is wrong with Dr. June O'Neill. If \nshe is the one being recommended she is a competent economist and \ndeserves an opportunity to serve.\n  Dr. Alice Rivlin contacted the candidate, the nominee, and said: I \ncongratulate you. I think you will do a good job.\n  Just tonight I went to a reception for the esteemed Dr. O'Neill, who \nwill be the budget director of the United States--and the Senate can \ncount on that. That will happen. She will be. At the reception were two \nof the liberal-to-moderate economists, renowned in this city for their \npositions opposite to many currently serving in the majority in the \nU.S. Congress. And they were there as members of the community of \neconomists to wish her well.\n  How does this process go? Frankly, I have been part of the process \nfor each of the budget directors that have been chosen previously, and \nintimately involved in two out of the previous three. I know on the \nSenate side there is consultation between Democrat and Republican, \nmajority and minority--whichever the case may be. In the House they do \nthings differently and I do not stand before the Senate and account for \nthat process. They vote and in that committee they voted after John \nKasich, chairman, did some interviewing and concurred with Senator \nDomenici on this side, the chairman, that we ought to recommend Dr. \nJune O'Neill.\n  I understand some Democrats on that committee voted for Dr. O'Neill. \nI do not know that, but if a vote occurred I think some Democrats did. \nIf I am mistaken please correct me right now.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I might say the majority of the Democrats \neither abstained or voted against her. I believe 4 voted for her, 4 \nagainst her, and most abstained, and they did that because of the \nprocess.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much for the clarification. \nBut I think my statement was right. It was not a purely Republican \nvote, even though the consultative process is much narrower in the \nHouse than it is here. Knowing of the need for consultation and input, \nlet me put in the Record a letter dated November 21, 1994. This was \nwritten by myself to every Senator. This is a copy of the one I sent to \nthe leader. Every Senator can go look in his or her files. Perhaps they \ndid not check, perhaps they do not know. I asked them to please submit \nsuggestions, ideas, concerns they might have as to who might be budget \ndirector for the United States.\n  I might state not a single one recommended a single person nor had a \nsingle comment to submit to the chairman of the committee which I am \nprivileged to be at this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                       Committee on the Budget\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 21, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Republican Leader's Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader: CBO Director Bob Reischauer's term of office \n     expires on January 3, 1995. Dr. Reischauer has served \n     Congress in a highly professional and nonpartisan manner \n     these last six years. Because of his leadership, CBO has \n     maintained its high degree of professionalism and integrity. \n     I believe we in the Congress, and the country as a whole, owe \n     Dr. Reischauer our sincere thanks for his years of dedication \n     to public service.\n       By statue the Director is appointed by the Speaker of the \n     House and the President pro tempore of the Senate after \n     considering recommendations from the Committees on the Budget \n     of both the House and Senate. According to the law, political \n     affiliation is not to be considered in the appointment, but \n     by precedent the next Director will be Republican.\n       It is my hope that the Senate Budget Committee can act \n     quickly to make its recommendation. Dr. Reischauer may \n     continue to serve until his successor is appointed.\n       This letter is to invite your recommendations for this \n     important position. The Budget Committee will establish a \n     Search Committee to review all recommendations, conduct \n     appropriate interviews, and come to one recommendation for \n     the President pro tempore. This entire procedure is being \n     coordinated with the incoming House Budget Committee Chairman \n     John Kasich.\n       Please forward any recommendations or resumes no later than \n     December 9th. Thank you for your cooperation in this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Pete V. Domenici\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Second, I suggest the Washington Post, on Friday last, \nhad it right. Anybody you select for budget director, they decide they \nare going to call them all skunks, because they are skunks at the lawn \nparty, so as to speak. They indicated in their editorial that we once \nagain succeeded for we have selected another skunk who is not going to \nbe beholden to anyone and will most positively, as they view it--\nbecause of her excellence in economics, her being part of that \ncommunity and her reputation therein--that she will be an excellent \noverseer to this very important body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 17, 1995]\n\n                           An Excellent Skunk\n\n       In the 21 years since it was founded to help Congress take \n     back the power of the purse from the executive branch, the \n     Congressional Budget Office has become among the most \n     valuable and widely trusted agencies in the government. The \n     trust reflects not just the consistently high quality of its \n     work but also its carefully guarded reputation for \n     independence. The symbols of that independence have been the \n     agency's gifted directors, Alice Rivlin, Rudy Penner and \n     Robert Reischauer.\n       Now Mr. Reischauer is to be succeeded by June O'Neill, an \n     economics professor at Bernard Baruch College in New York who \n     herself once served on the CBO staff under Ms. Rivlin as well \n     as on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers in the \n     Nixon-Ford administrations. She has also over the years been \n     a research associate at both the Brookings Institution and \n     Urban Institute. It's a reassuring appointment. Mrs. O'Neill \n     appears to be well within the tradition that it will be her \n     responsibility to carry on. The Democrats complaining without \n     any basis that she will toe a Republican line and the \n     Republicans muttering likewise that she won't toe it enough \n     should both back off.\n       Some leading House Republicans had threatened just after \n     the election to politicize the agency. They wanted to use \n     their new majority status to appoint not just a new \n     director--Mr. Reischauer's term was expiring--but one who \n     could be counted upon to switch to a ``dynamic'' method of \n     scoring or estimating the cost of tax cuts. The charge was \n     that CBO had over the years exaggerated such costs--and \n     thereby made tax cuts harder to pass--by failing to allow for \n     the revenue the cuts would generate by stimulating the \n     economy.\n       In fact, it's a false issue. CBO has traditionally allowed \n     for all the stimulative effects that mainstream economic \n     theory would permit; it just hasn't been willing to go \n     beyond, and rightly so. The threat to turn the agency into a \n     rubber stamp for policy that sound analysis might thwart set \n     off alarms among other Republicans, particularly in the \n     Senate. The O'Neill appointment indicates that they \n     prevailed.\n       We once wrote about a particular piece of testimony by Mr. \n     Reischauer that CBO's job, and his, was to be the skunk at \n     the congressional picnic. Someone has to be willing when it \n     is required to spoil the party--to say that no, these things \n     aren't free, that they can't be done at no cost or, when the \n     occasion arises, that the numbers being put forward are \n     really suspect. Mr. Reischauer was an excellent skunk, as \n     were his Democratic- and Republican-appointed predecessors \n     and as his successor will likely be too. Congress itself has \n     been the principal beneficiary of their disciplined analysis. \n     The good news is that the discipline and benefits both seem \n     likely to continue.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I greatly respect the proposal that the U.S. House and \nthe U.S. Senate vote in confirmation of the Congressional Budget Office \nin the future.\n  But I must say, when it is offered, if it is offered, I will resist \nit. It is not because I will be part of choosing very many more CBO \ndirectors; maybe one more; maybe no more. Who knows? I frankly do not \nthink an open vote in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate is the \ninviolate way to protect and assure \n[[Page S2952]] impartiality and to assure that there is a neutrality of \nthe type sought by my colleagues on the other side. In fact, it is one \nof a number of ways.\n  I might submit, while it is part of our Constitution for many \nappointments and nominees, I am not at all sure that it is even the \nbest way. It is also riddled with opportunities for candidates to lose \nwho should win and nominees who should lose to win. Frankly, I think a \nsmaller circle representing the entire group might just as well work \ntheir will and do better for the people of this country.\n  So I do not think that I want to change because we have had excellent \nbudget directors, and we have not had the entire Senate vote on them \never before. Who would deny that they have been good, that they have \nbeen impartial, and that they are professional? Not a single one came \nbefore the U.S. Senate for a confirmation vote to make sure that they \nwere good, that they were neutral, and that they would do a good job.\n  Lastly, nobody is truly challenging my reputation here. I thank both \nSenators for their kind remarks with reference to this Senator. But in \na sense, they have said in this case you did not do it very well. I \nthink we did it under the circumstances very well. Things are very \ndifferent. Things are very different than they were 6, 8 or 10 years \nago. Clearly, everybody knows that. I mean when the chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee says at a press conference, at which I am with \nthe nominee we have both chosen--he chooses to say what he expects, and \nI choose to say what I expect. And we are very different in what we \nexpect. But it surely does not mean that what either of us expect is \nwhat a well-reputed economist is going to do taking on the mantle of \nthe predecessors, which is excellence personified.\n  So John Kasich, chairman of the House committee, says that he expects \nsomething different out of the budget director than past directors, I \nsaid I do not come here to this meeting with the press expecting \nanything other than a good job and integrity, honesty and a full-faith \nimplementation of your responsibility.\n  So in a sense, if you add to that the fact that we interviewed a \nnumber of candidates, that I did not shut out Democrats from the \ninterviewing process--in the House they do not let them interview. Here \nwe did. I regret in this instance that I did not get the full \nconcurrence of Senator Exon of Nebraska, the ranking member, but \nactually the letter that he sent, right at the end in one sentence at \nleast, acknowledges that perhaps she is a competent economist, and then \nsuggests we should look at some more. I made a decision that looking \nfor some more was not worthwhile. I will not divulge all the details. \nBut I will tell you it is not very easy anymore to get people to want \nto come to be interviewed for jobs like this. And I think we ended up \nwith a splendid candidate. I am proud of her.\n  I respect my fellow Senators on the other side for their feelings. \nBut she is going to be the CBO director, and she is going to do a good \njob. That is all I can tell the Senate in the same kind of sensitive \napproach that I have taken in the past, whether I was leader of the \ncrew, or whether I was in the minority helping the process along. She \nwill be a good one.\n  For those who do not like some of her writings, let me remind the \nU.S. Senate that every CBO director that we appointed had some writings \nthat some Senators did not like. Some were too liberal in their \nwritings. Some were too conservative in their writings. Some were too \nsupply oriented. But if we are going to judge them as competent \neconomists schooled in American economics from the best of our schools \nmanaging different jobs--in this case having worked 4 years for the \nCBO--and then to second guess with reference to whether they are going \nto be fair or right or prejudiced, I just do not think we can work all \nof that out.\n  So I regret that I cannot agree with those who seek to delay this. It \nwill not be delayed. It should not be delayed. She will be the CBO \ndirector. If she is not already, she will be very, very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to withdraw this. Let me make a \ncouple of observations quickly.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is very able and makes his case \naggressively. I must say that I smiled a bit when he reached for the \nWashington Post for a measure of support for his position. It is not \nusual to see that coming from that side of the aisle. But, nonetheless, \nI understood his citation of that editorial.\n  This is different. The Senator from New Mexico will understand and \nknow when I say that we have not chosen a CBO director in these \ncircumstances where you have people calling for a vote on the previous \nquestion in the Budget Committee, not having the ranking minority \nmember on the Budget Committee even having the opportunity to interview \nthe appointee before the decision is made. I think anybody would agree \nthat this process is different.\n  Again, I would have said to the Senator from New Mexico that I am not \nmaking a judgment about Professor O'Neill. I do not know Professor \nO'Neill. I know economists get in the room, and they like each other \nand speak well of each other. I am not surprised. I used to teach a \nlittle economics. So the fact that the Senator argues that some other \neconomists think well of this economist, that probably is not \nsurprising.\n  But I must say that I also spoke with Dr. Reischauer, and he told me \nthe same thing the Senator from New Mexico suggested; that his view is \nthat this is a good candidate. I said, ``What do you think of this \nprocess?'' He said he did not think much of the process. The other side \nof it, at least in my discussions with Dr. Reischauer--and I hope he \nwill not mind my disclosing that--was as to process.\n  We are going to vote on this. We will not vote on it this evening. \nBut I intend to offer this amendment to the next bill, and then I \nintend to ask for a vote because I think in the future, if we have \npeople who on the one side or other decide they are going to call the \nprevious questions and do these kinds of things, then I think those of \nus who believe that we ought to have somebody who ought not have \nquestions about them raised after the fact, we ought to have someone \nwho is subject to a vote of approval by the House and the Senate.\n  So that would be my intention on the next legislation that comes \nbefore the Senate. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from \nUtah.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the motion that I have previously \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  So the motion was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2920-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute Fred Stroble for \nhis 33 years of truly exceptional public service as a law enforcement \nofficer in South Carolina--including more than 23 years as a deputy \nmarshal with the U.S. Marshals Service in Charleston.\n  As the deputy marshal with the longest continuous service in South \nCarolina, Fred has been a superb marshal, a public servant whose career \nepitomizes dedication and loyalty. In all the years that I've known \nFred, he has been kind and helpful to everyone, from hardworking \ncitizens to the prominent people he has protected, such as the Reverend \nMartin Luther King, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, former U.N. Ambassador \nAndrew Young, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William F. Reinquist, \nand Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  Mr. President, Fred Stroble started his law enforcement career in \nJanuary 1962 in Charleston as a walking patrolman with the city police \ndepartment. He came to be known as the nice cop because of his \ncompassion for people \n[[Page S2953]] who didn't understand the law or hold it in particularly \nhigh esteem. After walking a beat for a year, he was assigned to the \nvice squad. In January 1964, Fred became the city of Charleston's and \nSouth Carolina's first African-American motorcycle patrolman. A year \nlater, he was promoted to detective. In October 1969, he became the \nfirst African-American deputy sheriff for Charleston County.\n  Fred left the sheriff's department for the Marshalls Service in \nJanuary 1972. Since then, he has served with great distinction and \nhonor. Anybody at the Federal courthouse in Charleston will tell you \nthat no matter what has happened, Fred has been there to help. I, like \nmany other leaders and judges across South Carolina, am grateful for \nhis dedication over the years. If it were not for a requirement that \nmade his retirement mandatory, I'm sure Fred would provide many more \nyears of outstanding and professional service.\n  Mr. President, Fred Stroble is held in such high esteem today because \nof the more than 30 years that he has helped people across South \nCarolina. I appreciate this opportunity to express my respect and \ngratitude, and to wish Fred many happy years of retirement, new \nchallenges, and exciting opportunities.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2952-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       MEXICAN ECONOMIC AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, after weeks of intense negotiation, the \nUnited States and Mexico yesterday agreed on a package of guarantees \nand swap transactions to help restore investor confidence in the \nMexican economy while addressing United States concerns about the \nfundamental soundness of the Mexican economy and the level of risk to \nAmerican taxpayers. I commend the President for his efforts to respond \nto this crisis while ensuring that adequate safeguards and conditions \nare in place to protect U.S. national interests.\n  I must say that, when the administration first proposed, in the \nimmediate aftermath of the peso devaluation, a major U.S. response, I \nwas quite skeptical. In many discussions with the administration I \nraised my concerns and urged that tough questions be asked about the \nwisdom of United States involvement and tough conditions be applied on \nMexico as a precondition to any aid package.\n  Mr. President, I believe the administration has negotiated tough-\nminded terms for the package. I commend them for this and now believe \nit is both appropriate and in our national interest for this program to \nbe put into operation.\n  In all candor, I continue to have some concerns about the possible \nlong-term negative consequences of this whole crisis to our national \neconomy and national economic interest. But I do believe as a nation we \nhad to act and that the administration has acted skillfully. And if we \ndid not act, real economic disaster could result.\n  The economic stabilization package signed Tuesday by Treasury \nSecretary Robert Rubin and Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz \nactually consists of four separate agreements. The framework agreement \nsets the overall terms and conditions for U.S. support. These include \ncommitments on the part of Mexico to reduce inflation, strengthen the \npeso, and encourage new investment by cutting Government spending, \npursuing tight monetary policy, and raising short-term interest rates. \nMexico is also committed to accelerate structural reforms in the \ntransportation, telecommunications, and banking sectors, speed \nprivatization, and improve financial transparency.\n  The Medium-Term Exchange Stabilization Agreement provides the basis \nfor currency swap transactions, under which Mexico can exchange pesos \nfor dollars for a period of up to 5 years. The interest rate charged \nfor these swaps is to cover the U.S. risk for such transactions.\n  Under the guarantee agreement, the United States will provide \nguarantees for the issuance of Mexican debt securities with maturities \nof up to 10 years. This portion of the package is intended to convince \ninvestors to lend money to Mexico for longer terms at lower interest \nrates, thus alleviating the short-term debt burden that precipitated \nthis crisis.\n  Finally, the oil proceeds facility agreement establishes the \nmechanism by which the United States is assured substantial repayment \nshould Mexico default on its obligations. The agreement would set up a \nbank account in the United States into which foreign purchasers of \nMexican oil would be required to make their payments. If Mexico fails \nto repay the United States under any of the financing agreements, the \nTreasury Department would be able, in effect, to take over that bank \naccount.\n  All told, these agreements total $20 billion in United States support \nfor Mexico--a bold and comprehensive package designed to prevent an \nimmediate shortfall from leading to long-term economic and political \ninstability. This support is designed to entail no direct costs to our \ntaxpayers. Mexico will be charged fees for the guarantees and interest \nfor the medium-term swaps, and all of Mexico's obligations to the \nUnited States will be backed by proceeds from the export of Mexican \ncrude oil and oil products.\n  Moreover, the U.S. action is more than matched by the international \nresponse. The IMF has offered an unprecedented $17.8 billion in medium-\nterm assistance, while the other G-10 countries plan to provide another \n$10 billion in short-term credit through the Bank of International \nSettlements.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is essential that we continue to monitor \nthis situation closely, and the agreements that were signed yesterday \nprovide the means and expand our ability to do just that. Even with \nthis assistance, Mexico will face difficult economic choices, many of \nwhich could have an impact upon us.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the \nadministration to ensure that Mexico lives up to its commitments under \nthis package and that broad United States interests continue to be \nserved through its implementation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2953-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2953-S2954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       THE QUALIFICATIONS OF PETER EDELMAN TO BE A FEDERAL JUDGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, an unfair, unfortunate, and negative \ncampaign of distortions and preposterous character attacks has been \nunder way for some time by partisans on the extreme right to prevent \nthe nomination of an excellent lawyer, Peter Edelman, to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  I have known Peter Edelman well for more than three decades, ever \nsince his years as an outstanding Senate staff member for my brother, \nSenator Robert Kennedy. A magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law \nSchool, Peter served as a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly on the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals and Justice Arthur Goldberg on the \nSupreme Court.\n  In his subsequent career, he has consistently earned great \ndistinction and respect for his service--in the Civil Division at the \nDepartment of Justice, as a vice president of the University of \nMassachusetts, as director of the New York State Division for Youth \nunder Gov. Hugh Carey, as a partner in the Washington, DC, law firm of \nFoley & Lardner, as professor and associate dean at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, and currently as counselor in the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  By virtue of his outstanding ability, background, experience, \njudgment, and temperament, Peter Edelman is clearly and well-qualified \nto serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals. As much as anyone I know, Peter \nEdelman understands that our laws are the wise restraints that make us \nfree. He also very clearly understands the proper constitutional role \nof Federal judges in our Federal system.\n  I am confident that he would be an excellent Federal judge. I hope \nthat President Clinton nominates him, and I believe he will be \nconfirmed by the Senate. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to keep an \nopen mind about this distinguished lawyer.\n  Last week, many of us received a letter in strong support of Peter \nEdelman, signed by 71 distinguished law professors, including 19 law \nschool deans and 8 former law school deans. Because an editorial in the \nWashington Times earlier last week grossly distorted the letter, I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter may be printed in the Record.\n  [[Page S2954]] There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n                             Georgetown University Law Center,\n\n                                                 February 9, 1995.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Enclosed please find a letter that we \n     have sent to Senator Hatch. As you will see, it is a letter \n     from more than seventy law professors and deans who are upset \n     about the tactics being used by some who are attempting to \n     stop the nomination of Peter Edelman to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We are \n     concerned that the current specter of distorted prenomination \n     sniping is undermining the integrity of the constitutionally \n     prescribed appointment process and we cannot stand by \n     silently while this is occurring.\n       We appreciate your consideration.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Susan Bloch,\n                                 Georgetown University Law Center.\n     Barbara Babcock,\n                                              Stanford Law School.\n\n                             Georgetown University Law Center,\n\n                                                 February 9, 1995.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As law professors concerned with \n     protecting the Constitution and the judiciary, we are \n     troubled to see orchestrated attempts to distort the record \n     of potential nominees even before they have been nominated. \n     In particular, we are very troubled by the attacks on Peter \n     Edelman, a respected scholar with an extensive record of \n     public service who has exactly the kind of qualifications the \n     nation should look for in nominees for the Courts of Appeals. \n     We urge you to remain open-minded so as not to encourage \n     those seeking to derail the appointment process.\n       As you know, before joining the Administration, Peter \n     Edelman was Associate Dean at the Georgetown University Law \n     Center. In his outstanding career, Professor Edelman has been \n     a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, a key aide \n     to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Director of the New York \n     State Division for Youth. As respected within academia as in \n     public service, Professor Edelman has shown himself to be a \n     sensitive, thoughtful, and responsible counselor, \n     policymaker, and scholar. The judiciary and the nation would \n     be well served by his presence on the Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       To single out for attack, as his critics have, one article \n     that Professor Edelman wrote in 1987 in an effort to provoke \n     thought about the growing inequities in income distribution \n     in this country is grossly distorting in at least two ways. \n     First, it overlooks the fact that Professor Edelman has \n     produced a body of work on poverty issues that sets out his \n     framework for understanding the 1987 article. Second, the \n     attack ignores the rest of his record of excellent service in \n     all three branches of government.\n       Our constitutional system will be severely damaged if an \n     organized campaign of misrepresentation can block the \n     nomination of someone so clearly qualified. The President \n     should nominate Professor Edelman and let the Senators decide \n     whether or not to confirm. Peter Edelman should have the \n     chance to explain his views and set forth his entire record \n     in the\n      framework of a confirmation hearing. We are confident that \n     if you will receive his nomination with an open mind, you \n     will find that he is one of the most well qualified \n     nominees you have seen in your tenure on the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       Professor Lee Albert, State University of New York at \n     Buffalo, School of Law; Dean Barbara Bader Aldave, St. Mary's \n     University of San Antonio, School of Law; Professor Ellen P. \n     Aprill, Loyola Law School; Dean Judith C.

THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is a \nlot like television's well-known energizer bunny--it keeps going and \ngoing--at the expense, of course, of the American taxpayers.\n  A lot of politicians talk a good game--when they are back home--about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress--which perhaps is a primary \nfactor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators.\n  This is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress gets down to \nbusiness. As of Tuesday, February 21, 1995, the Federal debt stood--\ndown to the penny--at exactly $4,834,640,034,065.84 or $18,352.38 per \nperson.\n  Mr. President, it is important that all of us monitor, closely and \nconstantly the incredible cost we incur each week due to this debt. As \na matter of fact, in the past week the debt has increased over $25 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can bring under \ncontrol the outrageous spending that created this outrageous debt. If \nthe party now controlling both Houses of Congress, as a result of the \nNovember elections last year, does not do a better job of getting a \nhandle on this enormous debt, the American people are not likely to \noverlook it in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2954-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2955-S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n               THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF WALTER SHERIDAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us who knew him, respected him, \nand loved him were saddened by the death last month of Walter Sheridan. \nWalter was the outstanding investigator on the staff of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee for nearly two decades, and before \nthat, he had been one of Attorney General Robert Kennedy's most trusted \nand effective aides in the Department of Justice.\n  Walter Sheridan lived an extraodinary life, and all of us who worked \nwith him have many warm memories of his achievements and his \nfriendship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my tribute to Walter last month at Holy \nTrinity Church in Georgetown, an earlier tribute I made to Walter on \nthe occasion of his final hearing at the Labor Committee in 1990, and \nother materials may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTribute to Walter Sheridan, by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Holy Trinity \n                Church, Washington, DC, January 17, 1995\n\n       ``Some men see things as they are and say, `Why?' I dream \n     things that never were and say `Why not?'''\n       These words that Robert Kennedy loved were words that \n     Walter Sheridan lived by. And what a magnificent life he \n     lived.\n       Walter and my brother were exact contemporaries, born on \n     the same day, November 20th, 1925. It took them a little over \n     thirty years to find each other. But it was inevitable that \n     they would, and now they have found each other again.\n       I suspect some grand investigation is under way in heaven, \n     and that Bobby and Carmine Bellino finally decided last week, \n     ``We need Walter up here on this one.''\n       My brother loved to tease Walter about his mild demeanor \n     and quiet manner. But as Bobby wrote in ``The Enemy Within,'' \n     Walter's angelic appearance hid a core of toughness. As any \n     wrongdoer well knew, the angelic quality also represented the \n     avenging angel.\n       All the Kennedys have lost one of the finest friends we \n     ever knew. Walter Sheridan was an extraordinary investigator \n     and an extraordinary human being. He had a heart as large as \n     his ability, and his courage and dedication to justice and \n     the public interest were unmatched by anyone. Everything he \n     touched he left better than he found it.\n       Walter was also family, far and wide. His wife, Nancy, his \n     daughter Hannah, his sons Walter, John, Joseph, and Donald, \n     and all their families and all his fourteen grandchildren \n     know how much Walter loved them and how deeply he cared for \n     them. The Sheridan home was always warm and welcoming, a \n     continuously open house and gathering place for the legions \n     of friends he made across the years.\n       Everyone Walter worked with loved him too. He lit up every \n     room he entered, and there was an obvious mutual affection \n     that made people not only want to work with him, but work \n     harder because of him. He had a famous and well-deserved \n     reputation from the Hoffa years for ability, integrity and \n     loyalty--and he was a legend for his modesty about it.\n       He lived up to the Sheridan mystique all his life and in \n     everything he later did. You could sense the power of his \n     commitment to justice and honesty in public and private life. \n     You knew he would go to the end of the earth to sustain those \n     standards against any who tried to undermine them. The \n     cynical view that everyone has his price met its match and \n     its defeat in Walter Sheridan.\n       As Bobby knew, and as those on the other side learned to \n     their dismay, when the going got tough, Walter Sheridan got \n     going. His highly principled convictions about the public \n     trust ensured the criminal convictions of those who violated \n     that trust. His book about those years is among his lasting \n     legacies--a call for constant vigilance to protect the public \n     interest against corruption.\n       In any fight, my brother said, he would always want Walter \n     on his side. You wanted Walter with you in any foxhole, and \n     that is why he always seemed to get the most difficult \n     assignments. He had been in the service in World War II, and \n     his exploits reminded me of a famous slogan of those years--\n     the difficult we do immediately; the impossible takes a \n     little longer.\n       In the Senate years, each time we settled on the subject of \n     a new investigation, Walter would do his famous disappearing \n     act. He'd be away for three or four weeks. ``Walter's gone \n     fishing,'' we would wink and say, and everyone knew what that \n     meant. When Walter surfaced with his catch, all the networks \n     and reporters were there, ready to record it at our hearings.\n       Walter knew how to follow a paper trail, find the \n     unfindable document, and make it speak truth to power. Once, \n     when the mine owners persuaded the federal agency to \n     drastically weaken protections for health and safety, it was \n     Walter who uncovered the irrefutable document. The agency had \n     simply tried to write the mine owners' wish list into law--\n     complete with the same spelling and grammatical mistakes.\n       Walter was also a hero to workers in the many industries he \n     investigated. I especially think of his coal mine safety \n     investigations. Miners and mine safety officials who \n     testified in our Labor Committee hearings would continue to \n     call up Walter for many years, eager to tell him about the \n     new births and marriages and grandchildren in their lives. \n     They knew Walter never stopped caring about them, and they \n     loved him for it and made him part of their family too.\n       For all his warmth and wit, Walter was rightly feared by \n     certain kinds of industry leaders and government officials--\n     by anyone misusing their position or abusing their high \n     office. His mission in many of his Senate investigations was \n     to see that federal regulators did not become captives of the \n     industry they regulated.\n       Once, a mine worker who worshipped Walter told us that an \n     official of the Mine Safety and Health Administration had \n     walked into his agency office one day and resigned \n     immediately--when he saw the pink message slip with the \n     notation that ``a Mr. Walter Sheridan'' had called.\n       His unique combination of high intelligence, low-key \n     manner, and warm personality was an irresistible asset in all \n     his work, and he loved to tell his war stories. During his \n     investigation of the pharmaceutical industry, two drug \n     company executives told him extensive details they never \n     intended to disclose about their company's operations. They \n     said Walter just kept asking simple, understated questions \n     and nodded politely at their responses. As one of the \n     officials later said, ``It took us about ten minutes after we \n     walked out of the room to realize that Walter Sheridan had \n     just picked both our pockets clean.''\n       He had a flair for the dramatic too. For several years, he \n     served as a Special Correspondent for NBC and made \n     documentaries on many issues, including crime and gun \n     control. He liked to tell of the time he went into a gun \n     shop, plunked down a couple hundred dollars, and walked out \n     with an anti-tank weapon. He later loaded and fired it on \n     camera to demonstrate the shocking laxity of our gun control \n     laws. He said he couldn't remember what finally happened to \n     the weapon, but he kept it stored somewhere around the house \n     for a while and thought Nancy finally threw it out.\n       Another of his documentaries dealt with organized crime. \n     Walter persuaded a key informant to speak on camera for the \n     first time about the activities of one of the crime families. \n     Later, a few of Walter's friends who had gathered to watch \n     the broadcast at the Sheridans' home thought the informant on \n     the screen looked familiar, and he was. He was sitting on the \n     couch in Walter's living room, watching the program too. He \n     told Walter it was the first time he felt truly safe, because \n     no one would dare try to harm him while Walter was on the \n     case.\n       Of course, all of us who knew Walter understood something \n     else as well--that we would never know everything he knew. \n     Business or pleasure, secrets were safe with Walter. Whether \n     working on an investigation or planning a surprise party, \n     nothing ever leaked. On that point we all agreed--Walter \n     Sheridan kept his mouth shut.\n       Genius, it is said, is the capacity for taking infinite \n     pains, and Walter passed that test with flying colors. No one \n     worked harder or longer or more effectively. But sometimes \n     even that wasn't enough. One of my brother's and Walter's \n     favorite stories from the McClellan Committee days was about \n     the time they were driving home together after working very \n     late one evening. As they drove past the Teamsters Building, \n     they saw the light still on in Hoffa's office. So they turned \n     the car around and went back to work themselves.\n       It has been said that all men are dust, but some are gold \n     dust. And that was true of Walter. In those great years with \n     my brother on the McClellan Committee and in the Justice \n     Department, he was a regular for touch football at Hickory \n     Hill. Everyone wanted to be on Walter's team, including \n     Bobby. To new friends there, he was always ``Walter,'' never \n     ``Mr. Sheridan,'' even though they felt the first name was \n     somehow disrespectful after reading about Mr. Sheridan in \n     ``The Enemy Within.'' Walter made sure that everyone got to \n     play, no matter how young or unathletic. He also mastered the \n     most important rule for those games, which was that there \n     were no rules.\n       And in the sad months and years after June of 1968, Walter \n     continued to be a fixture at Hickory Hill, helping Ethel, \n     helping all of us, to carry on. We loved you, Walter, as a \n     brother and as a member of our family.\n       In a sense, Bobby lived on through Walter. In the nearly 20 \n     years that he worked with me in the Senate, I never met with \n     Walter or talked with Walter or laughed with Walter that I \n     didn't think of Bobby. As the poet wrote: ``Think where man's \n     glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such \n     friends.'' Our glory is that we had Walter as a friend.\n       In so many ways, he lived up to the ideals of dedication to \n     family, country, and service to others. His contributions to \n     integrity in government and the private sector are immense. \n     His achievements are proof that each of us can make a \n     difference--and what a difference Walter Sheridan made.\n       His life is symbolized in the inspiring words my brother \n     used: ``Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to \n     improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, \n     he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other \n     from a million different \n     [[Page S2956]] centers of energy and daring, those ripples \n     build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of \n     oppression and resistance.''\n       You left us too suddenly and too soon, Walter, and we miss \n     you all the more.\n                                                                    ____\n\nClosing Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Hearing on Advertising, \n  Marketing and Promotional Practices of the Pharmaceutical Industry, \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Washington, DC, December \n                                12, 1990\n\n       The testimony in these hearings raised troubling questions \n     about the marketing practices of the pharmaceutical industry \n     and their corrupt relationship with physicians.\n       Commendably, as the committee investigation began to \n     uncover these abusive relationships, both the AMA and the PMA \n     endorsed new guidelines on the eve of the hearings, in order \n     to correct these problems and ensure the confidence of \n     patients and the public.\n       The committee intends to monitor these reforms closely, in \n     order to determine whether the abuses covered by the \n     guidelines are truly corrected.\n       Finally, I want to pay tribute to the person who deserves \n     the real credit not only for these hearings--but a thousand \n     other contributions to the Senate, the country, and the \n     public interest.\n       In a sense, these hearings are his swan song. But he'll \n     never really retire. He was also our chief investigator in \n     the initial committee hearings on this issue in the 1970's. \n     And I have no doubt he'll come out of retirement in the year \n     2000, or whenever the industry steps out of line again.\n       There's a famous saying that there's no limit to what you \n     can accomplish in this town if you're willing to give someone \n     else the credit. That may be the secret of how he's been able \n     to accomplish so much.\n       We've known each other for over 30 years, and worked \n     together for nearly 20. Robert Kennedy discovered him in the \n     1950's in the McClellan Committee investigations. It turned \n     out they were both born on the same day in the same year.\n       My brother took him with him to the Justice Department in \n     the 1960's. He may well have been the best and most tenacious \n     investigator the Senate or the Department ever had. I \n     inherited him from my brother, and he's been the same way \n     ever since.\n       As Robert Kennedy once said in the 1950 investigations, \n     ``Investigators are the backbone of the hearings. Without \n     their work, we'd have nothing.'' Those words are still true, \n     and all these years he has continued to make them true.\n       We'll have a chance to pay a proper tribute to him at \n     another time.

His family and some of \n     his children and grandchildren are here today, and I think \n     they know how much we admire him and love him--Walter \n     Sheridan. We'll miss him.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 14, 1995]\n\n           Walter Sheridan Dies; Helped To Investigate Hoffa\n\n                            (By Martin Weil)\n\n       Walter Sheridan, 69, a prominent federal investigator for \n     many years who played a key role in the epic struggle between \n     the government and Teamsters union leader Jimmy Hoffa, died \n     of lung cancer Jan. 13 at his home in Derwood.\n       He was a staff member of the Senate rackets subcommittee of \n     which Robert F. Kennedy was chief counsel and on which John \n     F. Kennedy served as a senator. He was also an associate of \n     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who lauded him yesterday as \n     ``an extraordinary investigator and an extraordinary human \n     being.''\n       By 1960, years of contentious investigation and dramatic, \n     nationally televised hearings had made celebrities of the \n     Senate subcommittee's lawyer, Robert kennedy, and Hoffa. \n     Hoffa had become one of the best-known labor leaders of the \n     postwar era.\n       After John Kennedy became president in 1961 and his brother \n     became attorney general, Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Sheridan to \n     become his special assistant. In that job, he and a small \n     group of lawyers were made responsible for prosecuting \n     federal crimes associated with the Teamsters.\n       The lawyers in the unit described themselves as the ``Get \n     Hoffa Squad,'' and Mr. Sheridan, though himself not a lawyer, \n     was their chief, Arthur A. Sloane wrote in ``Hoffa,'' his \n     1991 biography of the labor leader. In his 1971 book \n     ``Kennedy Justice,'' Victor Navasky also described Mr. \n     Sheridan as the unit's chief.\n       In 1962, Hoffa was brought to trial in Nashville. The chief \n     prosecutor and his assistants, accoring to Sloane's book, \n     operated ``under the overall direction of . . . Walter \n     Sheridan . . . who himself was in daily telephone contact \n     with Attorney General Kennedy.''\n       In a brief interview last night, Navasky said Mr. Sheridan \n     ``knew the worst things there were'' about Hoffa and \n     ``devoted those years to doing something about that.''\n       The trial, on a misdemeanor charge, ended in a hung jury.\n       But that trial led to a second trial on a charge of jury \n     tampering, based at least in part on evidence gathered and \n     investigated by Mr. Sheridan, according to Sloane's book. In \n     1964, Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and began serving \n     a prison term three years later.\n       In 1960, Robert Kennedy published a book called ``The Enemy \n     Within,'' based on his Senate committee investigations into \n     labor matters. In it, he described Mr. Sheridan this way: ``A \n     slight, quiet friendly-faced man'' who ``was one of our best \n     and most relentless investigators.''\n       ``His almost angelic appearance hides a core of toughness \n     and he takes great pride in his work,'' Kennedy said.\n       ``In any kind of fight, I would always want him on my \n     side.''\n       Mr. Sheridan was born in Utica, N.Y., served in the \n     Submarine Service during World War II and later graduated \n     from Fordham University. He was an FBI agent for four years \n     and spent three years with the National Security Agency.\n       He was a regional coordinator for John Kennedy in the 1960 \n     presidential campaign and had key roles in the political \n     campaigns of Robert and Edward Kennedy.\n       As a Senate investigator in the 1980s, he helped show that \n     clinical data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration \n     had been tampered with, which led to new safeguards. He also \n     led investigations into improper payments to physicians to \n     influence how they prescribed medicines. His investigations \n     into mine and on-the-job safety and health and into \n     exploitation of farm workers also were credited with leading \n     to new federal protections.\n       From 1965 to 1970, he was a special correspondent for NBC \n     and his unit received a Peabody Award for a documentary on \n     the 1967 Detroit riots.\n       He was the author of ``The Fall and Rise of Jimmy Hoffa.''\n       In his statement yesterday, Edward Kennedy said Mr. \n     Sheridan ``had a heart as large as his ability, and his \n     courage and dedication to justice and the public interest \n     were unmatched by anyone.''\n       Survivors include his wife, Nancy; five children, Walter \n     Sheridan of Gaithersburg, Hannah Shorey of Dallas, John \n     Sheridan of Germantown, Joseph Sheridan of Lansdale, Pa., and \n     Donald Sheridan of Harrisburg, Pa.; and 14 grandchildren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 15, 1995]\n\n   Walter J.

Sheridan, a Federal investigator who was an \n     associate of the Kennedy family and pursued the teamsters' \n     union leader James R. Hoffa, died on Friday at his home in \n     Derwood, Md. He was 69.\n       The cause was lung cancer, friends said.\n       Mr. Sheridan worked closely with Robert F. Kennedy in the \n     1950's when Mr. Kennedy was chief counsel to the Senate \n     rackets committee and John F. Kennedy was a committee member. \n     Mr. Sheridan and Robert Kennedy spent much time investigating \n     labor corruption, especially in the International Brotherhood \n     of Teamsters.\n       When Robert Kennedy became Attorney General, he recruited \n     Mr. Sheridan as a special assistant to investigate Federal \n     crimes, particularly involving the teamsters.\n       In March 1964, a Federal Court jury in Chattanooga, Tenn., \n     convicted Mr. Hoffa of tampering with a Federal jury two \n     years earlier, and he went to prison. He was released in 1971 \n     when his sentence was commuted by President Richard M. Nixon.\n       Mr. Sheridan was the author of a 1972 book, ``The Fall and \n     Rise of Jimmy Hoffa.'' Mr. Hoffa disappeared in 1975.\n       Mr. Sheridan was an agent for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation for four years but resigned, he said later, \n     because J. Edgar Hoover's fierce brand of anti-Communism made \n     him uneasy. He was also an investigator for the National \n     Security Agency for three years.\n       As a principal aide for the Senate Judiciary and Labor and \n     Human Resources Committees in the 1970's and 80's, Mr. \n     Sheridan led investigations into drug companies that tampered \n     with data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, \n     working conditions in mines and exploitation of farm workers.\n       Mr. Sheridan was a regional coordinator for John F. \n     Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign. He also worked in the \n     senatorial and Presidential campaigns of Robert and Edward M. \n     Kennedy.\n       From 1965 to 1970, he was a special correspondent for NBC, \n     producing documentaries on crime, gun control and other \n     issues.\n       He is survived by his wife, Nancy; four sons, Walter, of \n     Gaithersburg, Md., John, of Germantown, Md., Joseph, of \n     Lansdale, Pa., and Donald, of Harrisburg, Pa.; a daughter, \n     Hannah Shorey of Dallas, and 14 grandchildren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           [From the Utica Observer-Dispatch, Jan. 14, 1995]\n\n                 Sheridan, Former FBI Agent Dies at 69\n\n       Utica native Walter Sheridan--once listed among possible \n     successors to J.

No, it is not communism. \n     Despite Wallace, Goldwater and the right-wing doomsday \n     criers, it is not even creeping socialism. It is, as readers \n     of this book will find alarmingly documented, an altogether \n     different sort of creeping disease. Creeping, hell, it's now \n     boldly up on two feet and running. Toward what goal? More. \n     More houses? More schools? More daycare centers? Forget it. \n     More money. More power. Power to do what? Enjoy life, liberty \n     and the pursuit of happiness? Not as Jefferson and our \n     eighteenth-century idealists imagined it in those simpler \n     times. today it is the high life, the deal that brings \n     liberty in the form of ``commutation'' from the federal pen \n     and the pursuit of the easy buck--be it at the gangster \n     Xanadus of Las Vegas, or at millionaire retreats built with \n     Teamster money like Moe Dalitz's La Costa Country Club, or at \n     the various White Houses, Dicknixon style. There the Big \n     Money, that unholy alliance of over-and-under-the-table, has \n     enjoyed the friendship of the man who grasped early in his \n     checkered career the sharp-edged triangle of money, power and \n     politics.\n       Throughout our history Big Money has been decried, by \n     Andrew Jackson, William Jennings Bryan, both the Roosevelts. \n     . . . There are periodic appeals to our idealism, compassion \n     and sense of community. Reform movements rise and fall like \n     the tides. Today our children's crusade turns its back on the \n     sources of wealth and power and wanders into the desert to \n     smoke its pot and live the good life to the music of Led \n     Zeppelin, James Taylor and Joe Cocker. They have chosen to \n     abandon the system rather than reshape it. The old system, \n     their gypsy life-style is telling us, is a rat-race is a \n     money-game is a war-machine conceived in materialism\n      and dedicated to the proposition that the race is to the \n     swift and the poker pot to the swift at hand.\n       Left behind to fight the network of graft-organized greed \n     that has infected our profit system are the Walter Sheridans \n     of this land, unlikely Don Quixotes who tilt not at windmills \n     but at syndicates and are willing to take on single-handed an \n     army of hoodlums, fixers, purchasable politicos and business \n     opportunists, to go it alone if their leaders are shot down \n     and a Mitchellized Justice Department moves to deliver them \n     and their witnesses to the enemy.\n       I first came to know Walter Sheridan in the early sixties \n     when I went to Washington to discuss with the then Attorney \n     General, Robert Kennedy, the possibility of adapting his \n     book, The Enemy Within, as a motion picture. Our \n     irrepressible producer, the late Jerry Wald, had called me in \n     Mexico to say that Kennedy had chosen me from a list of film \n     writers Wald had submitted. Kennedy had been impressed with \n     On the Waterfront and The Harder They Fall and felt that I \n     would be particularly responsive to the job of dramatizing \n     corruptive power in America.\n       It is true that the subject had fascinated me from my high \n     school days. And The Enemy Within, a hard-hitting account of \n     Kennedy's experiences as chief counsel for the Senate Rackets \n     Committee, would give me the chance to write not merely a \n     sequel to Waterfront but a significant extension of that film \n     on a national scale. Kennedy's book presented startling \n     evidence of the collusion between Jimmy Hoffa (plus other \n     crooked union leaders), Mafia racketeers and their \n     ``respectable'' allies in the world of business.\n       At Kennedy's home in McLean, Virginia, it took time to \n     break the ice, but gradually we established good rapport. \n     Then, characteristically, young Kennedy asked me when I could \n     begin and how soon my screenplay would be ready. I told him \n     that I had researched the New York waterfront for more than a \n     year before I had begun that script; I would not feel ready \n     to plunge into the writing of Enemy until I had fully \n     absorbed this even more complicated material. ``But it's all \n     in the book,'' Kennedy said with an author's pride. I told \n     him I would like to read the entire hearings of the Senate \n     Committee. ``That's fifty-nine volumes,'' Kennedy warned. \n     ``Millions of words.'' When I held out, he passed me on to \n     his lieutenant in charge of the Hoffa investigation, Walter \n     Sheridan.\n       Sheridan turned out to be the most unlikely of G-men. \n     Television and movie fans accustomed to Lee Marvin or Rod \n     Steiger and Efrem Zimbalist as their gangbuster heroes would \n     be badly let down by Mr. Sheridan. So quiet-spoken you \n     literally have to lean forward to hear him, on the surface a \n     diffident, even shy and eminently gentle man.\n       But Kennedy's book had indicated the tiger that lurked \n     within the deceptively bland exterior, praising Walter as \n     tireless and unbendable, committed to the principle of \n     integrity in government and labor-management. Outraged by the \n     labor racketeering encouraged by political and business \n     connivance, he would work around the clock day after day to \n     stitch together a collar of evidence to fit even the thick, \n     tough necks of the Jimmy Hoffas.\n       Until the Kennedy investigations, the robber barons of the \n     labor movement had carved up their million dollar pies with \n     impunity. It is one thing merely to dream the impossible \n     dream, quite another to gather together for a convincing \n     indictment all the little jigsaw facts buried by professional \n     deceivers. How Walter Sheridan persevered in this quest, \n     despite bribes, threats and government roadblocks, provides \n     an encouraging lining for an essentially discouraging story.\n       For months, after Walter sent me the Rackets Committee \n     material, I immersed myself in the testimony of thousands of \n     witnesses who talked (or balked) about pension funds looted \n     of millions of dollars, with a majority of those six- and \n     seven-figure loans going to notorious Mafiosi, of \n     ``sweetheart'' contracts arranged between greedy company \n     executives and union officials on the take (including, as \n     this book makes clear, President Hoffa himself), of once \n     respectable industries and unions infiltrated by a blatant \n     army of extortionists and enforcers, terrorizing the would-be \n     honest into silence or connivance. It was material, I \n     realized, that made waterfront crime-evil as that was--seem \n     like very small potatoes.\n       Now I understood more clearly the conclusion Bob Kennedy \n     had reached in his book--that the real enemy within was the \n     increasingly effective alliance of big money, labor \n     racketeers, the mob, and dishonest prosecutors, judges and \n     government officials, without whom billions could not be \n     stolen from our economy--and that this nationwide conspiracy \n     was poisoning the wellspring of the nation. From my talks \n     with Bob Kennedy, Walter Sheridan and their colleagues in the \n     Justice Department, I was convinced of\n      their passionate devotion to this theme--and to the \n     conviction that we could never defeat an external enemy \n     unless we first cut from our body politic the growing \n     cancer of corruption that would finally destroy our \n     society as Rome was eaten away from within two thousand \n     years ago.\n       When I returned to Washington with all fifty-nine volumes \n     of testimony buzzing in my head, I outlined a possible story \n     line to Bob Kennedy and his staff. But now I felt a further \n     step in research was necessary: to move on from the \n     transcripts to the people behind the transcripts, those who \n     had endured the pressure of belonging to a union whose \n     dictatorship they despised and whose goon-squad violence they \n     feared.\n       When I discussed this request with Kennedy he again passed \n     me on to Walter, who, in his calm, cautious way, put me in \n     touch with a fascinating union leader, a highly placed \n     officer who had been secretly cooperating with the Kennedy \n     investigation because he had lived his life as an honest \n     trade unionist and had become disgusted with the wholesale \n     looting of union funds, the terrorizing of union members who \n     protested, the Mafia leaders allowed to pass themselves off \n     as union leaders. The roster of Teamster vice presidents read \n     like a Who's Who in American Crime, and ``Max,'' as we shall \n     call our inside contact, had had a bellyfull.\n       Here, through Walter's sensitive liaison, I was to get a \n     one-on-one insight into the ongoing drama--the tension that \n     runs through so much of Walter's book--a man's conscience \n     struggling to keep afloat in a sea of fear. For the next few \n     months I was to meet Max under conditions that reminded me of \n     my World War II days in the O.S.S. We met in Los Angeles, in \n     a small town in Florida, and in Mexico--using pseudonyms and \n     even taking the precaution of meeting in a third, neutral \n     room in case we were being followed or bugged. His nerves \n     were shot and he was drinking himself through the day, \n     terrified of Hoffa and his henchmen, yet driven by the gut-\n     conviction that mobsters like Johnny Dio and Red Dorfman and \n     Joey Glimco and Tony Provenzano and all the rest of the tribe \n     were poison to the labor movement to which he had dedicated \n     his life. Through Max, I met other Teamster dissidents, all \n     hating Hoffa's guts and all afraid to face his wrath.\n       Thanks to Max, I was able to personify in my script a \n     reluctant, tormented thorn in the tough hide of the composite \n     labor boss I \n     [[Page S2958]] call Pete Bonner. Alas, the film for reasons \n     that bring me very\n      close to the spirit of this uncompromising book, has never \n     reached the screen. Jerry Wald, who alone had had the \n     courage to produce it, died suddenly, at a time when 20th \n     Century-Fox was fighting for survival after its \n     spendthrift Cleopatra. A labor tough walked right into the \n     office of the new head of the studio to warn him that if \n     the picture was ever made drivers would refuse to deliver \n     the prints to the theaters. And, if they got there by any \n     other means, stink bombs would drive out the audiences.\n       With Bob Kennedy's encouragement, I tried to produce the \n     film myself. One film star phoned to say he loved the script, \n     then came to my house drunk to tell me he was afraid he might \n     be killed if he did it. There have been ever-increasing ties \n     between the mob and some of the film studios and, of course, \n     those studios rejected it out of hand. Finally, I had firm \n     interest from Columbia, the company that had released On the \n     Waterfront. On the eve of the meeting with Columbia \n     executives to which I had been invited, every one of the \n     people who was to attend that conference received a letter \n     from William Bufalino, whose activities on behalf of Hoffa \n     are a matter of record (as Sheridan's book confirms). \n     Bufalino is, among other things, a lawyer, but this letter \n     was disturbingly extra-legal. It stated flatly that 20th \n     Century-Fox had wisely abandoned the project as soon as all \n     the possible eventualities had been pointed out to them, and \n     he felt confident that Columbia would be smart enough to do \n     likewise. On the morning of the meeting, a studio secretary \n     called to tell me that it had been canceled, indefinitely. \n     Apparently Hoffa and Bufalino had decided what the American \n     people could and could not see. And the Hollywood ``front \n     office''--notorious for its vincibility--had meekly complied.\n       But that was only a taste of the frustration that Walter \n     Sheridan had suffered over the years as he battled against \n     the invisible empire. The jury tampering in Nashville reads \n     like Police Gazette fiction, but it's all too true. The \n     Chicago trial, in which Jimmy Hoffa was finally convicted of \n     stealing more than a million dollars from his Teamsters \n     Pension Fund, is the stuff of high social drama. And the \n     trials and tribulations of Ed Partin, the big and tough \n     Teamster from Baton Rouge who turned on Hoffa, helped to \n     convict him, and then was offered a million dollars if he \n     would perjure himself and retract his testimony--or be \n     destroyed if he refused; all of this must be read, and then \n     reread and digested, to be believed.\n      And remembered. The incredible cast of those working to gain \n     a pardon for Hoffa, and a buy-off or conviction of Partin, \n     includes governors, federal judges, Louisiana Mafiosi, \n     Chicago gangsters, Pension Fund lawyer-grafters, senators, \n     congressmen, administration officials, con-men, sleazy go-\n     betweens. Even Audie Murphy and George Murphy get into the \n     act, not to mention gun-totin' William Loeb and his \n     infamous Teamsters-financed Manchester Union Leader.\n       Here is the enemy within, in all its star-spangled unglory.\n       The enemy walks among us, not as an underworld fugitive but \n     as an adornment of cafe society, enjoying the best tables in \n     New York and Miami, Las Vegas, Hollywood and Acapulco. You'll \n     find him chumming with the celebrities at Le Club or ``21'' \n     or the Sands, or in the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills \n     Hotel. Instead of fearing government pressure, he'll boast of \n     his in with the White House. And the ``cream'' of our society \n     don't shun him, they invite him to their parties. And they \n     hope he will return the favor.\n       In this painstaking book, Sheridan faces up to the reality \n     that, after all the convictions and sensational disclosures, \n     corruption flows on. George Jackson rotted in jail for nearly \n     a decade for heisting $70. Jimmy Hoffa cops a million, bribes \n     juries, runs with the most dangerous gangsters in America \n     and, thanks to the intervention of his good friend Dick \n     Nixon, does an easy five. This, after the parole board had \n     rejected Hoffa's appeal three times in a row. This, in an \n     election year when Nixon has become anathema to the \n     legitimate labor movement and the Teamsters wind up as his \n     only big-labor support.\n       The Nixon-Hoffa friendship, beginning when Nixon was Vice \n     President, was emphasized again by his recent attendance at \n     the executive board meeting of the Teamsters. And his \n     Secretary of Labor gave fulsome praise to that gang-ridden \n     union at its most recent convention. ``A strange love \n     affair,'' The New York Times has described it.

Mr. Archer was \nborn on December 17, 1932 to Frank and Jimmie Archer of Van Zandt \nCounty. His early years were spent in Terell and Van Zandt Counties \nduring the Depression. In order to assist his family, he quit school in \nthe eighth grade and later received his GED in the U.S. Army.\n  He served our Nation honorably in the U.S. Army from 1953 until 1955 \nand completed his Army Reserve obligation in 1961 in the rank of \nprivate first class. He graduated from Baylor University Law School in \n1963.\n  Following his work for the Dallas County attorney and district \nattorney, he served as city attorney for the city of Mesquite from \n1970-87. From 1989-93, he was the city manager and attorney for the \ncity of Balch Springs. He was married for 35 years to the late Virginia \nLois Archer.\n  Elland Archer passed away on September 1, 1994 and is survived by \nfive children and two grandchildren in addition to his mother and six \nbrothers and sisters.\n  Mr. Archer will be remembered by his family and friends for his \ndedication to our Nation, our State, and to the many citizens he served \nduring his career. In setting high standards during his public service, \nhis life was a model for others to follow.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2958-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have done each week \nof the 104th Congress, to announce to the Senate that 14 people were \nkilled by gunshot in New York City this past week, bringing the total \nfor 1995 to 89.\n  Mr. President, in an introduction to a published series of editorials \non America's gun epidemic, Los Angeles Times editorial writer and \nresearch director Molly Selvin, writes:\n\n       People do kill people--but they can do it more efficiently, \n     more potently and more massively with guns. And guns, these \n     days, are killing more people on the streets and in the \n     homes, schools and workplaces of America than ever before * * \n     * We can let the gun violence continue unabated, or we can do \n     something and do something dramatic, effective, historic.\n\n  Ms. Selvin is quite correct. It will take dramatic measures to bring \nan end to the plague of gun violence. But the Senator from New York is \ncompelled to point out that the solution proposed by the editorial \nseries--a near-total ban on ownership and possession of guns--is simply \nnot plausible. We have a two-century supply of guns. Unless abused, \nguns last almost indefinitely. Even if we could succeed in banning \nfurther production and sale of guns, it is unrealistic to think that we \ncould reclaim the 200 million guns already in circulation today.\n  On the other hand, we have a very limited supply of bullets--perhaps \nonly a four-year supply. I have repeatedly attempted to make the case \nthat it is here we should focus our attention. By banning or taxing out \nof existence those calibers of bullets used most often in crime, the \nmillions of guns already in the hands of criminals would soon be \nrendered useless.\n  To date, I have had difficulty convincing the Congress and past and \npresent administrations of the merits of ammunition control. But as we \nsit idly by and watch bullets take the lives of nearly 40,000 Americans \neach year, I urge my colleagues to consider this sensible approach.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2958-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2958-S2959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         U.S. ARMY 2D LT. CURT SANSOUCIE--A NEW HAMPSHIRE HERO\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to salute U.S. Army Second \nLieutenant Curt Sansoucie, from Rochester, NH, who died February 15, \n1995, during a training exercise at Eglin Air Force Base Ranger School \nin Florida.\n  The accident that took the life of this fine young man was a terrible \ntragedy for his family and for the State of New Hampshire. Curt is the \nson of Gary and Theresa Sansoucie. He graduated from Somersworth High \nSchool where he was a member of the National Honor Society and a \nvarsity football player.\n  I had the privilege of nominating Curt to West Point in December \n1989. \n[[Page S2959]] After graduating in June 1994, he attended Infantry \nOfficer Basic School in Fort Benning, GA, where he completed a Master \nof Trainer's Fitness School. Curt then began Ranger School, where \nsoldiers undergo the toughest training in the forest, mountains, \ndesert, and swamps to prepare them for extreme war conditions.\n  Curt died doing exactly what he wanted to do; serving his country in \nthe U.S. Army. I extend my deepest sympathies to Curt's family and \nfriends. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am \nhonored to have represented Second Lt.

Mr. President, tomorrow evening our friend and \ncolleague, Senator Paul Simon, will be honored by the Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Service for his many distinguished years of \ncommitment and achievement on behalf of immigrants and refugees.\n  This honor is eminently deserved. Senator Simon has served with great \ndistinction on the Immigration Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee since he first came to the Senate in 1985. Throughout his \nservice, he has been an outstanding leader and defender of our Nation's \nlong and proud history as a nation of immigrants and a haven for \nrefugees. He has challenged all of us to honor this heritage, and to do \nall we can to alleviate the plight of victims of oppression throughout \nthe world. Paul has pursued this vision with integrity, dignity, \nfairness, and great intelligence and common sense.\n  In many respects, he has been the conscience of the Senate on \nimmigration and refugee issues. The 10 yeas in which he has so ably \nserved on the subcommittee have been years of major reform. His steady \nhand and deep moral conviction have been felt throughout this process \nof change.\n  In his book, ``The Glass House,'' Senator Simon observed: ``There are \nmorally preferred options, and . . . it is the responsibility of \nhumanity and of government to strive toward the good, no matter how \nerratic and tortuous that path might be''. Paul Simon exemplifies that \ngood, and all of us who have worked with him are proud of his \nleadership.\n  His presence in the Senate will be deeply missed when he retires at \nthe end of next year. In all his achievements, he has reminded us that \nAmerica is at its best when it upholds the traditions of fairness, \nopportunity, and compassion which made our country great.\n  I commend the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service for this \ntribute to our friend and colleague, and join with my colleague Senator \nSimpson, the chairman of our Immigration Subcommittee, in \ncongratulating Senator Simon on this well-deserved honor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Paul Simon, will \nbe honored tomorrow evening by the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee \nService for his tireless devotion to the plight of refugees throughout \nthe world. I want everyone to know how special this award is and how \nspecial Paul Simon is.\n  Paul and I have worked together on the Immigration Subcommittee since \nhe came to the Senate in 1985. He has become a dear friend. But Paul \nSimon is also a friend to the millions who suffer the devastation of \ntyranny and war. He is the unknown benefactor of the refugees who have \nfound a safe haven on our shores. And he has been a benefactor of our \nNation, for these refugees are a revitalizing force among us.\n  We enjoy the warm glow of bipartisanship on our subcommittee, and we \nneed it. The issue of immigration is political dynamite and must be \ndealt with fairly. Paul Simon has been a persistent voice of justice \nand compassion on the subcommittee.\n  The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has served thousands of \nthose new to our shores, and their award is an honor and a trust. Paul \nSimon has lived up to that trust.\n  The Statue of Liberty enlightens the world, but her torch does not \nburn untended. Paul Simon has helped keep her lamp fueled and lit for \nAmerica's newest immigrants.\n  I am so pleased that Paul's hard work has been recognized with such \nan honor, and I know our colleagues share that pleasure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2959-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2959-S2964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND--THE FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Irish and British Governments \nreleased their much-anticipated Framework Document, which offers a fair \nand balanced approach to moving the Northern Ireland peace process \nforward.\n  The document imposes nothing on anyone. It reaffirms the solemn \nguarantee that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland is the \nindispensable condition for any future settlement.\n  The great virtue of the document is that it provides exactly what was \npromised--a thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the fundamental \nissues. Above all, it offers a solid basis for moving to the next \nstep--which is talks among all the parties, and which I hope will begin \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that today's statements by \nIrish Prime Minister John Bruton and British Prime Minister John Major \nand the text of the framework document may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Introductory Remarks by the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mr. John \nBruton, TD, at Belfast Launching of Joint Framework Document, February \n                                22, 1995\n\n       Today's new framework for agreement is a landmark event in \n     the affairs of this island.\n       The two Governments are presenting to the political parties \n     in Northern Ireland, and to the Irish and British people, a \n     document which is the most detailed expression to date of our \n     views on the subject of Northern Ireland.\n       The Prime Minister and I hope that the Framework Document \n     will receive calm and measured consideration over the days \n     and weeks ahead.\n       It is an important and serious text, offered as an aid to \n     discussion and negotiation. It presents our best judgement of \n     what might be an agreed outcome from future talks involving \n     the two Governments and the political parties.\n       We commend it to the parties for their careful \n     consideration and we look forward to discussing it in detail \n     with them at the earliest opportunity.\n       May at this point pay a special tribute to my colleague the \n     Tanaiste and his officials and to the Northern Ireland \n     Secretary of State Patrick Mayhew and his team. Their \n     determined efforts over many months have brought us to \n     today's new framework for agreement.\n       The proposals which it contains are, we believe, balanced \n     and fair and threaten nobody. No party need fear this \n     document.\n       To the nationalist and republican people, the document:\n       Reaffirms that the British Government have no selfish, \n     strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and that \n     they will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of \n     the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they \n     prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.\n       Says that the British Government will enshrine in its \n     constitutional legislation the principles embodied in this \n     new framework for agreement by the amendment of the \n     Government of Ireland Act of 1920 or by its replacement by \n     appropriate new legislation.\n       It will also be important to nationalists that both \n     Governments consider that new institutions should be created \n     to cater for present and future political, social and \n     economic inter-connections within the island of Ireland. \n     These institutions will enable representatives of the main \n     traditions, North and South, to enter agreed relationships. \n     This is the purpose of the North/South body proposed in this \n     document.\n       To the unionist and loyalist people, I would point out that \n     the document commits the Irish Government to ask the \n     electorate to change the Irish Constitution. The change \n     proposed will address Articles 2 and 3 in the following ways:\n       It would remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of \n     legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary \n     to the will of its people.\n       It would provide that the creation of a sovereign united \n     Ireland could therefore only occur in circumstances where a \n     majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally chose to \n     be part of a united Ireland.\n       It is also important to unionists that the document also \n     contains a recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy \n     of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the \n     people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional \n     status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union \n     or a sovereign united Ireland.\n       [[Page S2960]] The proposals will challenge the two \n     traditions on this island but it will do so in an even-handed \n     way. Neither tradition need fear its contents. As I have \n     emphasized at every appropriate opportunity, it is a \n     framework for discussion and not a blueprint to be imposed \n     over the heads of anyone. Its purpose is to facilitate, not \n     pre-empt, dialogue. At the end of the day, the people of both \n     North and South respectively will have the final say.\n       The document is our carefully considered response to many \n     suggestions, from the parties and others, that it would be \n     helpful to have the view of the two Governments as to what \n     might be an agreed outcome from future talks.\n       We are asking the parties to come and talk to us, openly \n     and candidly, about these proposals. We believe that, taken \n     in the round, they offer a basis for structured discussions \n     leading to a new agreement.\n       We believe that they do. It is our hope that the political \n     parties, having given them the attention they deserve, will \n     take a similar view.\n       There can be no doubt about the enormous desire on the part \n     of the ordinary pubilc--here, in the rest of Ireland and in \n     Britain--for the earliest possible resumption of political \n     dialogue.\n       The ending of all campaigns of paramilitary violence last \n     autumn has created an unrivalled opportunity for such \n     dialogue to take place with a reasonable prospect of a \n     successful conclusion.\n       I join the Prime Minister in appealing to all the parties \n     concerned to grasp this opportunity.\n       The Framework Document is our judgment of how things can \n     best be taken forward. We have, in our view, the best \n     opportunity in a generation for a lasting political \n     settlement. We owe it to the peoples of both of these islands \n     to put that opportunity to the test.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Opening Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, at a Joint \n  Press Conference With the Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, to Launch the \n    Joint Framework Document, Belfast, Wednesday, February 22, 1995\n\n\n                        joint framework document\n\n       There is one reason, above all, why the Taoiseach and I \n     have come to Belfast today.\n       We wish to offer our proposals here in Northern Ireland--to \n     Northern Ireland's people and their representatives.\n       We seek to help peace, but only the people of Northern \n     Ireland can deliver it.\n       So let me say to them:\n       These are our ideas, but the future is up to you;\n       You have an opportunity now which has not been there for \n     many years;\n       An opportunity to work together to build a better future \n     and a lasting peace.\n       Our proposals stem from the talks process launched four \n     years ago, in March 1991.\n       It was agreed then by the two governments and the four \n     participating parties that the process would have three \n     strands. It would seek a new beginning for:\n       Relationships within Northern Ireland;\n       Relationships between the North and South of the island of \n     Ireland;\n       And relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic.\n       We agreed that it was only by addressing all these \n     relationships together that agreement would be found across \n     the community in Northern Ireland.\n       At this press conference, the Taoiseach and I are \n     publishing the document `A New Framework for Agreement' which \n     deals with the second and third of these strands. A little \n     later this morning I shall put forward a separate document \n     proposing new arrangements within Northern Ireland--which is \n     of course a matter for the British Government and the \n     Northern Ireland parties alone.\n       Our proposals are based on several principles: self-\n     determination, consent, democratic and peaceful methods, and \n     respect for the identities of both traditions.\n       Consent is and will remain paramount in our policy.\n       It is the democratic right and the safeguard of the people \n     of Northern Ireland.\n       No proposals for the future would be workable, let alone \n     successful, without the consent and active support of all \n     Northern Ireland's people. For they are the people who would \n     carry them out and whose lives would be affected.\n       That is why any eventual settlement must be agreed by the \n     parties; supported by the people of Northern Ireland in a \n     referendum; and approved by Parliament--a triple consent \n     procedure.\n       Our constitutional matters, each Government has offered \n     crucial new commitments in this Framework Document:\n       As part of a balanced agreement the British Government \n     would enshrine its willingness to accept the will of a \n     majority of the people of Northern Ireland in British \n     Constitutional legislation. We shall embody the commitments \n     we made in the Downing Street Declaration.\n       The Irish government would introduce and support proposals \n     to change its Constitution, so that ``no territorial claim of \n     right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the \n     will of a majority of its people is asserted''. This is a \n     very important proposal that I welcome unreservedly.\n       These changes would offer Northern Ireland a constitutional \n     stability which it has not hitherto enjoyed. Its future \n     status, by agreement between the two governments, would be \n     irrevocably vested in the wishes of a majority of its people.\n       In line with the three-stranded approach, we propose new \n     institutions for North/South cooperation.\n       The North/South body which we outline would comprise \n     elected representatives chosen from a new Northern Ireland \n     Assembly and from the Irish Parliament. It would draw its \n     authority from these two bodies. It would operate by \n     agreement, and only by agreement.\n       On the UK side, the North/South body would initially be set \n     up by legislation at Westminster, as part of a balanced \n     agreement. It would come into operation following the \n     establishment of the new Assembly. Thereafter, it would be \n     for the Assembly and the Irish Parliament both to operate the \n     body and to decide whether its functions should be extended.\n       Like all of our proposals, the new North/South institutions \n     will be a matter for negotiation. But the way should now be \n     open for beneficial co-operation between North and South \n     without the constitutional tensions which have been such \n     impediments in the past. We have made suggestions about areas \n     which might be covered in this co-operation, to the advantage \n     of both sides. Like all aspects of the document, they will be \n     for discussion and agreement\n      between all concerned.\n       The European Union, already operates cross-border \n     programmes between Northern Ireland the Republic, as it does \n     elsewhere. We propose that North and South could usefully \n     work together in specific areas, to take advantage of what \n     the EU has to offer. But the making of United Kingdom policy \n     and the responsibility for representing Northern Ireland in \n     the European Union will remain solely in the hands of the UK \n     Government.\n       In the third of our Strands, we outline a new broader-based \n     agreement to take the place of the 1985 Anglo-Irish \n     Agreement.\n       The 1985 Agreement was criticised because the Northern \n     Ireland parties has not contributed to it. Our new proposals \n     are offered for discussion in the Talks process. We want to \n     hear the views of the parties; and we envisage that their \n     representatives would be formally associated with the future \n     work of the Intergovernmental Conference.\n       The Intergovernmental Conference would allow concerns to be \n     expressed about any problems or breaches of the Agreement. \n     But there would be no mechanism for the two Governments \n     jointly to supervise or override either the Northern Ireland \n     Assembly or the North/South body. It would be for each \n     Government to deal on its own with any problems within its \n     own jurisdiction. This would not be a question for joint \n     decision, still less joint action. It is important to be \n     clear about this, as there have been concerns on this score.\n       Our two Governments have worked with patient determination \n     to agree on this Framework, and I am grateful to the \n     Taoiseach, his predecessor, and the Tanaiste for their \n     efforts and their spirit of accommodation.\n       Our proposals seek to stimulate constructive and open \n     discussion and give a fresh impetus to the political \n     negotiations. The outcome of these negotiations will depend, \n     not on us, but on the consent of the parties, people, and \n     Parliament.\n       It is not for us to impose. But what we propose is an end \n     to the uncertainty, instability and internal divisions which \n     have bedevilled Northern Ireland.\n       For over four years as Prime Minister, I have listened \n     intently to the people of Northern Ireland. I have visited \n     them, consulted them, travelled more widely than any \n     predecessor throughout the Province, and held meetings with \n     political leaders, church leaders, council leaders, community \n     leaders, and people from all walks of life.\n       It is my duty as Prime Minister of the UK to maintain the \n     Union for as long as that is the will of the people. It is a \n     duty in which I strongly believe, and one which these \n     proposals protect. Just as people cannot be held within the \n     Union against their will, so equally they will never be asked \n     to leave it in defiance of the will of the majority.\n       Consent and free negotiation are fundamental to me, and \n     they are the foundation stones of this Joint Document.\n       In the four years of the Talks process, we have travelled a \n     long way, but not yet far enough.\n       I know that many people will be worried, perhaps even \n     pessimistic, about the future.\n       But as we look at the hurdles ahead, let us consider where \n     we have come from.\n       The dialogue of the deaf has ended.\n       For four years, we have been engaged in talks.\n       The three-stranded approach is becoming a reality.\n       The Joint Declaration has been accepted.\n       The British Government is engaged in talks with \n     paramilitaries on both sides.\n       We have had nearly six months of peace.\n       Prosperity and a normal life are returning to Northern \n     Ireland.\n       The principle of consent, once accepted only by Unionists \n     and the British Government, is today accepted almost \n     everywhere.\n       These are some of the gains for everyone in Northern \n     Ireland.\n       More gains can lie ahead if we have the courage to conduct \n     ourselves with patience, with foresight and with \n     consideration.\n       To reach our destination, all concerned must be ready to \n     look to the future rather \n     [[Page S2961]] than to the past. We must put aside old \n     shibboleths. We must show fairmindedness and imagination.\n       The destination I seek is a lasting and peaceful \n     settlement. It is attainable, and I believe we have taken a \n     very important step towards it today.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     A New Framework for Agreement\n\n (A shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments to \n   assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland \n                                parties)\n\n       1. The Joint Declaration acknowledges that the most urgent \n     and important issue facing the people of Ireland, North and \n     South, and the British and Irish Governments together, is to \n     remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of \n     history and to heal the divisions which have resulted.\n       2. Both Governments recognize that there is much for deep \n     regret on all sides in the long and often tragic history of \n     Anglo-Irish relations, and of relations in Ireland. They \n     believe it is now time to lay aside, with dignity and \n     forbearance, the mistakes of the past. A collective effort is \n     needed to create, through agreement and reconciliation, a new \n     beginning founded on consent, for relationships within \n     Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between \n     the peoples of these islands. The Joint Declaration itself \n     represents an important step towards this goal, offering the \n     people of Ireland, North and South, whatever their tradition, \n     the basis to agree that from now on their differences can be \n     negotiated and resolved exclusively by peaceful political \n     means.\n       3. The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on \n     31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on \n     13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire \n     of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the \n     violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and \n     served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, \n     impeding the search for agreement.\n       4. A climate of peace enables the process of healing to \n     begin. It transforms the prospects for political progress, \n     building on that already made in the Talks process. Everyone \n     now has a role to play in moving irreversibly beyond the \n     failures of the past and creating new relationships capable \n     of perpetuating peace with freedom and justice.\n       5. In the Joint Declaration both Governments set themselves \n     the aid of fostering agreement and reconciliation, leading to \n     a new political framework founded on consent. A vital \n     dimension of this three-stranded process is the search, \n     through dialogue with the relevant Northern Ireland parties, \n     for new institutions and structures to take account of the \n     totality of relationships and to enable the people of Ireland \n     to work together in all areas of common interest while fully \n     respecting their diversity.\n       6. Both Governments are conscious of the widespread desire, \n     throughout both islands and more widely, to see negotiations \n     underway as soon as possible. They also acknowledge the many \n     requests, from parties in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, for \n     both Governments to set out their views on how agreement \n     might be reached on relationships within the island of \n     Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.\n       7. In this Framework Document both Governments therefore \n     describe a shared understanding reached between them on the \n     parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, \n     consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 \n     March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and \n     direction to the process and to show that a fair and \n     honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the \n     relationships, which would enable people to work \n     constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising \n     the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or \n     interests of either tradition or of either community.\n       8. Both Governments are aware that the approach in this \n     document presents challenges to strongly-held positions on \n     all sides. However, a new beginning in relationships means \n     addressing fundamental issues in a new way and inevitably \n     requires significant movement from all sides. This document \n     is not a rigid blueprint to be imposed but both Governments \n     believe it sets out a realistic and balanced framework for \n     agreement which could be achieved, with flexibility and \n     goodwill on all sides, in comprehensive negotiations with the \n     relevant political parties in Northern Ireland. In this \n     spirit, both Governments offer this document for \n     consideration and accordingly strongly commend it to the \n     parties, the people in the island of Ireland and more widely.\n       9. The primary objective of both Governments in their \n     approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish \n     agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building \n     on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy \n     their political resources with the aim of securing a new and \n     comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political \n     parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest \n     possible support.\n       10. They take as guiding principles for their co-operation \n     in search of this agreement:\n       (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the \n     Joint Declaration;\n       (ii) that the consent of the governed is an essential \n     ingredient for stability in any political arrangement;\n       (iii) that agreement must be pursued and established by \n     exclusively democratic, peaceful means, without resort to \n     violence or coercion;\n       (iv) that any new political arrangements must be based on \n     full respect for, and protection and expression of, the \n     rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland and even-\n     handedly afford both communities in Northern Ireland party of \n     esteem and treatment including equality of opportunity and \n     advantage.\n       11. They acknowledge that in Northern Ireland, unlike the \n     situation which prevails elsewhere throughout both islands, \n     there is a fundamental absence of consensus about \n     constitutional issues. There are deep divisions between the \n     members of the two main traditions living there over their \n     respective sense of identity and allegiance, their views on \n     the present status of Northern Ireland and their vision of \n     future relationships in Ireland and between the two islands. \n     However, the two Governments also recognize that the large \n     majority of people, in both parts of Ireland, are at one in \n     their commitment to the democratic process and in their \n     desire to resolve political differences by peaceful means.\n       12. In their search for political agreement, based on \n     consent, the two Governments are determined to address in a \n     fresh way all of the relationships involved. Their aim is to \n     overcome the legacy of division by reconciling the rights of \n     both traditions in the fullest and most equitable manner. \n     They will continue to work towards and encourage the \n     achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out \n     in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ``a new beginning for \n     relationships within Northern Ireland, with the island of \n     Ireland and between the peoples of these islands''.\n       13. The two Governments will work together with the parties \n     to achieve a comprehensive accommodation, the implementation \n     of which would include interlocking and mutually supportive \n     institutions across the three strands, including:\n       (a) Structures within Northern Ireland (paragraphs 22 and \n     23)--to enable elected representatives in Northern Ireland to \n     exercise shared administrative and legislative control over \n     all those matters that can be agreed across both communities \n     and which can most effectively and appropriately be dealt \n     with at that level;\n       (b) North/South institutions (paragraphs 24-38)--with clear \n     identity and purpose, to enable representatives of democratic \n     institutions, North and South, to enter into new, co-\n     operative and constructive relationships; to promote \n     agreement among the people of the island of Ireland; to carry \n     out on a democratically accountable basis delegated \n     executive, harmonising and consultative functions over a \n     range of designated matters to be agreed; and to serve to \n     acknowledge and reconcile the rights, identities and \n     aspirations of the two major traditions;\n       (c) East-West structures (paragraphs 39-49)--to enhance the \n     existing basis for co-operation between the two Governments, \n     and to promote, support and underwrite the fair and effective \n     operation of the new arrangements.\n\n\n                         constitutional issues\n\n       14. Both Governments accept that agreement on an overall \n     settlement requires, inter alia, a balanced accommodation of \n     the differing views of the two main traditions on the \n     constitutional issues in relation to the special position of \n     Northern Ireland.\n       15. Given the absence of consensus and depth of divisions \n     between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland, the two \n     Governments agree that such an accommodation will involve an \n     agreed new approach to the traditional constitutional \n     doctrines on both sides. This would be aimed at enhancing and \n     codifying the fullest attainable measure of consent across \n     both traditions in Ireland and fostering the growth of \n     consensus between them.\n       16. In their approach to Northern Ireland they will apply \n     the principle of self-determination by the people of Ireland \n     on the basis set out in the Joint Declaration: the British \n     Government recognise that it is for the people of Ireland \n     alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and \n     without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-\n     determination on the basis of consent, freely and \n     concurrently given. North and South, to bring about a united \n     Ireland, if that is their wish; the Irish Government accept \n     that the democratic right of self-determination by the people \n     of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and \n     subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the \n     people of Northern Ireland.\n       17. New arrangements should be in accordance with the \n     commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint \n     Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong \n     to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save \n     with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern \n     Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for \n     and formally consent to the establishment of a united \n     Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support \n     legislation to give effect to that wish.\n       18. Both Governments recognize that Northern Ireland's \n     current constitutional status reflects and relies upon the \n     present wish of a majority of its people. They also \n     acknowledge that at present a substantial minority of its \n     people wish for a united Ireland. Reaffirming the commitment \n     to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of \n     agreement over a period among all \n     [[Page S2962]] the people who inhabit the island, they \n     acknowledge that the option of a sovereign united Ireland \n     does not command the consent of the unionist tradition, nor \n     does the existing status of Northern Ireland command the \n     consent of the nationalist tradition. Against this \n     background, they acknowledge the need for new arrangements \n     and structures--to reflect the reality of diverse \n     aspirations, to reconcile as fully as possible the rights of \n     both traditions, and to promote co-operation between them, so \n     as to foster the process of developing agreement and \n     consensus between all the people of Ireland.\n       19. They agree that future arrangements relating to \n     Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland's wider relationships, \n     should respect the full and equal legitimacy and worth of one \n     identity, sense of allegiance, aspiration and ethos of both \n     the unionist and nationalist communities there. Consequently, \n     both Governments commit themselves to the principle that \n     institutions and arrangements in Northern Ireland and North/\n     South institutions should afford both communities secure and \n     satisfactory political, administrative and symbolic \n     expression and protection. In particular, they commit \n     themselves to entrenched provisions guaranteeing equitable \n     and effective political participation for whichever community \n     finds itself in a minority position by reference to the \n     Northern Ireland framework, or the wider Irish framework, as \n     the case may be, consequent upon the operation of the \n     principle of consent.\n       20. The British Government reaffirm that they will uphold \n     the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of \n     Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to \n     support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland. On this \n     basis, they reiterate that they have no selfish strategic or \n     economic interest in Northern Ireland. For as long as the \n     democratic wish of the people of Northern Ireland is for no \n     change in its present status, the British Government pledge \n     that their jurisdiction there will be exercised with rigorous \n     impartiality on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland \n     in their diversity. It will be founded on the principles \n     outlined in the previous paragraph with emphasis on full \n     respect for, and equality of, civil, political, social and \n     cultural rights and freedom from discrimination for all \n     citizens, on parity of esteem, and on just and equal \n     treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both \n     communities. The British Government will discharge their \n     responsibilities in a way which does not prejudice the \n     freedom of the people of Northern Ireland to determine, by \n     peaceful and democratic means, its future constitutional \n     status, whether in remaining a part of the United Kingdom or \n     in forming part of a united Ireland. They will be equally \n     cognizant of either option and open to its democratic \n     realization, and will not impede the latter option, their \n     primary interest being to see peace, stability and \n     reconciliation established by agreement among the people who \n     inhabit the island. This new approach for Northern Ireland, \n     based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a \n     majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British \n     constitutional legislation embodying the principles and \n     commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework \n     Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland \n     Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new \n     legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by \n     agreement.\n       21. As part of an agreement confirming the foregoing \n     understanding between the two Governments on constitutional \n     issues, the Irish Government will introduce and support \n     proposals for changes in the Irish Constitution to implement \n     the commitments in the Joint Declaration. These change in the \n     Irish Constitution will fully reflect the principle of \n     consent in Northern Ireland and demonstrably be such that no \n     territorial claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern \n     Ireland contrary to the will of a majority of its people is \n     asserted, while maintaining the existing birthright of \n     everyone born in either jurisdiction in Ireland to be part, \n     as of right, of the Irish nation. They will enable a new \n     Agreement to be ratified which will include, as part of a new \n     and equitable dispensation for Northern Ireland embodying the \n     principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this \n     Framework Document, recognition by both Governments of the \n     legitimacy of whatever choices is freely exercised by a \n     majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its \n     constitutional status, whether they prefer to continue to \n     support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.\n\n\n                     structures in northern ireland\n\n       22. Both Governments recognize that new political \n     structures within Northern Ireland must depend on the co-\n     operation of elected representatives there. They confirm that \n     cross-community agreement is an essential requirement for the \n     establishment and operation of such structures. They strongly \n     favour and will support provision for cross-community \n     consensus in relation to decisions affecting the basic \n     rights, concerns and fundamental interests of both \n     communities, for example on the lines adumbrated in Strand 1 \n     discussions in the 1992 round-table talks.\n       23. While the principles and overall context for such new \n     structures are a recognized concern of both Governments in \n     the exercise of their respective responsibilities, they \n     consider that the structures themselves would be most \n     effectively negotiated, as part of a comprehensive three-\n     stranded process, in direct dialogue involving the relevant \n     political parties in Northern Ireland who would be called \n     upon to operate them.\n\n\n                        north/south institutions\n\n       24. Both Governments consider that new institutions should \n     be created to cater adequately for present and future \n     political, social and economic inter-connections on the \n     island of Ireland, enabling representatives of the main \n     traditions, North and South, to enter agreed dynamic, new, \n     co-operative and constructive relationships.\n       25. Both Governments agree that these institutions should \n     include a North/South body involving Heads of Department on \n     both sides and duly established and maintained by legislation \n     in both sovereign Parliaments. This body would bring together \n     these Heads of Department representing the Irish Government \n     and new democratic institutions in Northern Ireland, to \n     discharge or oversee delegated executive, harmonising or \n     consultative functions, as appropriate, over a range of \n     matters which the two Governments designate in the first \n     instance in agreement with the parties or which the two \n     administrations, North and South, subsequently agree to \n     designate. It is envisaged or overseen by the North/South \n     body, whether by executive action, harmonisation or \n     consultation, account will be taken of:\n       i the common interest in a given matter on the part of both \n     parts of the island; or\n       ii the mutual advantage of addressing a matter together; or\n       iii the mutual benefit which may derive from it being \n     administered by the North/South body; or\n       iv the achievement of economies of scale and the avoidance \n     of unnecessary duplication of effort.\n       In relevant posts in each of the two administrations \n     participation in the North/South body would be a duty of \n     service. Both Governments believe that the legislation should \n     provide for a clear institutional identity and purpose for \n     the North/South body.It would also establish the body's terms \n     of reference, legal status and arrangements for political, \n     legal, administrative and financial accountability. The \n     North/South body could operate through, or oversee, a range \n     of functionally-related subsidiary bodies or other entities \n     established to administer designated functions on an all-\n     island or cross-border basis.\n       26. Specific arrangements would need to be developed to \n     apply to EU matters. Any EU matter relevant to the competence \n     of either administration could be raised for consideration in \n     the North/South body. Across all designated matters and in \n     accordance with the delegated functions, both Governments \n     agree that the body will have an important role, with their \n     support and co-operation and in consultation with them, in \n     developing on a continuing basis an agreed approach for the \n     whole island in respect of the challenges and opportunities \n     of the European Union. In respect of matters designated at \n     the executive level, which would include all EC programmes \n     and initiatives to be implemented on a cross-border or \n     island-wide basis in Ireland, the body itself would be \n     responsible, subject to the Treaty obligations of each \n     Government, for the implementation and management of EC \n     policies and programmes on a joint basis. This would include \n     the preparation, in consultation with the two Governments, of \n     joint submissions under EC programmes and initiatives and \n     their joint monitoring and implementation, although \n     individual projects could be implemented either jointly or \n     separately.\n       27. Both Governments envisage regular and frequent meetings \n     of the North/South body:\n       To discharge the functions agreed for it in relation to a \n     range of matters designated for treatment on an all-Ireland \n     or cross-border basis:\n       To oversee the work of subsidiary bodies.\n       28. The two Governments envisage that legislation in the \n     sovereign Parliaments should designate those functions which \n     should, from the outset, be discharged or overseen by the \n     North/South body; and they will seek agreement on these, as \n     on other features of North/South arrangements, in discussion \n     with the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland. It \n     would also be open to the North/South body to recommend to \n     the respective administrations and legislatures for their \n     consideration that new functions should be designated to be \n     discharged or overseen by that body; and to recommend that \n     matters already designated should be moved on the scale \n     between consultation, harmonization and executive action. \n     Within those responsibilities transferred to new institutions \n     in Northern Ireland, the British Government have no limits of \n     their own to impose on the nature and extent of functions \n     which could be agreed for designation at the outset or, \n     subsequently, between the Irish Government and the Northern \n     Ireland administration. Both Governments expect that \n     significant responsibilities, including\n      meaningful functions at executive level, will be a feature \n     of such agreement. The British Government believe that, in \n     principle, any function devolved to the institutions in \n     Northern Ireland could be so designated, subject to any \n     necessary savings in respect of the British Government's \n     powers and duties, for example to ensure compliance with \n     EU and international obligations. The Irish Government \n     also expect to designate a comparable range of functions.\n       29. Although both Governments envisage that representatives \n     of North and South in the body could raise for discussion any \n     matter of interest to either side which falls within the \n     competence of either administration, it is envisaged, as \n     already mentioned, that \n     [[Page S2963]] its designated functions would fall into three \n     broad categories:\n       consultative: the North/South body would be a forum where \n     the two sides would consult on any aspect of designated \n     matters on which either side wished to hold consultations. \n     Both sides would share a duty to exchange information and to \n     consult about existing and future policy, though there would \n     be no formal requirement that agreement would be reached or \n     that policy would be harmonized or implemented jointly, but \n     the development of mutual understanding or common or agreed \n     positions would be the general goal;\n       harmonising: in respect of these designated \n     responsibilities there would be, in addition to the duty to \n     exchange information and to consult of the formulation of \n     policy, an obligation on both sides to use their best \n     endeavors to reach agreement on a common policy and to make \n     determined efforts to overcome any obstacles in the way of \n     that objective, even though its implementation might be \n     undertaken by the two administrations separately;\n       executive: in the case of these designated responsibilities \n     the North/South body would itself be directly responsible for \n     the establishment of an agreed policy and for its \n     implementation on a joint basis. It would however be open to \n     the body, where appropriate, to agree that the implementation \n     of the agreed policy would be undertaken either by existing \n     bodies, acting in an agency capacity, whether jointly or \n     separately, North and South, or by new bodies specifically \n     created and mandated for this purpose.\n       30. In this light, both Governments are continuing to give \n     consideration to the range of functions that might, with the \n     agreement of the parties, be designated at the outset and \n     accordingly they will be ready to make proposals in that \n     regard in future discussions with the relevant Northern \n     Ireland parties.\n       31. By way of illustration, it is intended that these \n     proposals would include at the executive level a range of \n     functions, clearly defined in scope, from within the \n     following broad categories:\n       Sectors involving a natural or physical all-Ireland \n     framework;\n       EC programmes and initiatives;\n       Marketing and promotion activities abroad;\n       Culture and heritage.\n       32. Again, by way of illustration, the Governments would \n     make proposals at the harmonising level for a broader range \n     of functions, clearly defined in scope (including as\n      appropriate, relevant EU aspects; from within the following \n     categories:\n       Aspects of--agriculture and fisheries; industrial \n     development; consumer affairs; transport; energy; trade; \n     health; social welfare; education; and economic policy.\n       33. By way of example, the category of agriculture and \n     fisheries might include agricultural and fisheries research, \n     training and advisory services, and animal welfare; health \n     might include co-operative ventures in medical, paramedical \n     and nursing training, cross-border provision of hospital \n     services and major emergency/accident planning; and education \n     might include mutual recognition of teacher qualifications, \n     co-operative ventures in higher education, in teacher \n     training, in education for mutual understanding and in \n     education for specialized needs.\n       34. The Governments also expect that a wide range of \n     functions would be designated at the consultative level.\n       35. Both Governments envisage that all decisions within the \n     body would be by agreement between the two sides. The Heads \n     of Department on each side would operate within the overall \n     terms of references mandated by legislation in the two \n     sovereign Parliaments. They would exercise their powers in \n     accordance with the rules for democratic authority and \n     accountability for this function in force in the Oireachtas \n     and in new institutions in Northern Ireland. The operation of \n     the North/South body's functions would be subject to regular \n     scrutiny in agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland \n     and the Oireachtas respectively.\n       36. Both Governments expect that there would be a \n     Parliamentary Forum, with representatives from agreed \n     political institutions in Northern Ireland and members of the \n     Oireachtas, to consider a wide range of matters of mutual \n     interest.\n       37. Both Governments envisage that the framework would \n     include administrative support staffed jointly by members of \n     the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Irish Civil \n     Service. They also envisage that both administrations will \n     need to arrange finance for the North/South body and its \n     agencies on the basis that these constitute a necessary \n     public function.\n       38. Both Governments envisage that this new framework \n     should serve to help heal the divisions among the communities \n     on the island of Ireland; provide a forum for acknowledging \n     the respective identities and requirements of the two major \n     traditions: express and enlarge the mutual acceptance of the \n     validity of those traditions; and promote understanding and \n     agreement among the people and institutions in both parts of \n     the island. The remit of the body should be dynamic, enabling \n     progressive extension by agreement of its functions to new \n     areas. Its role should develop to keep pace with the growth \n     of harmonization and with greater integration between the two \n     economies.\n\n\n                          east-west structures\n\n       39. Both Governments envisage a new and more broadly-based \n     Agreement, developing and extending their co-operation,\n      reflecting the totality of relationships between the two \n     islands, and dedicated to fostering co-operation, \n     reconciliation and agreement in Ireland at all levels.\n       40. They intend that under such a new Agreement a standing \n     Intergovernmental Conference will be maintained, chaired by \n     the designated Irish Minister and by the Secretary of State \n     for Northern Ireland. It would be supported by a Permanent \n     Secretariat of civil servants from both Governments.\n       41. The Conference will be a forum through which the two \n     Governments will work together in pursuance of their joint \n     objectives of securing agreement and reconciliation amongst \n     the people of the island of Ireland and of laying the \n     foundations for a peaceful and harmonious future based on \n     mutual trust and understanding between them.\n       42. The Conference will provide a continuing institutional \n     expression for the Irish Government's recognized concern and \n     role in relation to Northern Ireland. The Irish Government \n     will put forward views and proposals on issues falling within \n     the ambit of the new Conference or involving both \n     Governments, and determined efforts will be made to resolve \n     any differences between the two Governments. The Conference \n     will be the principal instrument for an intensification of \n     the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, \n     with particular reference to the principles contained in the \n     Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new \n     Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern \n     Ireland and with the relations between the two parts of the \n     island of Ireland. It will facilitate the promotion of \n     lasting peace, stability, justice and reconciliation among \n     the people of the island of Ireland and maintenance of \n     effective security co-operation between the two Governments.\n       43. Both Governments believe that there should also be \n     provision in the Agreement for developing co-operation \n     between the two Governments and both islands on a range of \n     ``East-West'' issues and bilateral matters of mutual interest \n     not covered by other specific arrangements, either through \n     the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council, the Conference or \n     otherwise.\n       44. Both Governments accept that issues of law and order in \n     Northern Ireland are closely intertwined with the issues of \n     political consensus. For so long as these matters are not \n     devolved, it will be for the Governments to consider ways in \n     which a climate of peace, new institutions and the growth of \n     political agreement may offer new possibilities and \n     opportunities for enhancing community identification with \n     policing in Northern Ireland, while maintaining the most \n     effective possible deployment of the resources of each \n     Government in their common determination to combat crime and \n     prevent any possible recourse to the use or threat of \n     violence for political ends, from any source whatsoever.\n       45. The Governments envisage that matters for which \n     responsibility is transferred to new political institutions \n     in Northern Ireland will be excluded from consideration in \n     the Conference, except to the extent that the continuing \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Northern \n     Ireland are relevant, or that cross-border aspects of \n     transferred issues are not otherwise provided for, or in the \n     circumstances described in the following paragraph.\n       46. The Intergovernmental Conference will be a forum for \n     the two Governments jointly to keep under review the workings \n     of the Agreement and to promote, support and underwrite the \n     fair and effective operation of all its provisions and the \n     new arrangements established under it. Where either \n     Government considers that any institution, established as \n     part of the\n      overall accomodation. Is not properly functioning within the \n     Agreement or that a breach of the Agreement has otherwise \n     occurred. The conference shall consider the matter on the \n     basis of 3 shared commitment to arrive at a common \n     position or, where that is not possible, to agree a \n     procedure to resolve the difference between them. If the \n     two Governments conclude that a breach has occurred in any \n     of the above circumstances, either Government may make \n     proposals for remedy and adequate measures to redress the \n     situation shall be taken. However, each Government will be \n     responsible for the implementation of such measures of \n     redress within its own jurisdiction. There would be no \n     derogation from the sovereignty of either Government; each \n     will retain responsibility for the decisions and \n     administration of government within its own jurisdiction.\n       47. In the event that devolved institutions in Northern \n     Ireland ceased to operate, and direct rule from Westminster \n     was reintroduced, the British Government agree that other \n     arrangements would be made to implement the commitment to \n     promote co-operation at all levels between the people, North \n     and South, representing both traditions in Ireland, as agreed \n     by the two Governments in the Joint Declaration, and to \n     ensure that the co-operation that had been developed through \n     the North/South body be maintained.\n       48. Both Governments envisage that representatives of \n     agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland may be \n     formally associated with the work of the Conference, in a \n     manner and to an extent to be agreed by both Governments \n     after consultation with them. This might involve giving them \n     advance notice of what is to be discussed in the \n     [[Page S2964]] Conference, enabling them to express views to \n     either Government and inviting them to participate in various \n     aspects of the work of the Conference. Other more structured \n     arrangements could be devised by agreement.\n       49. The Conference will also be a framework for \n     consultation and coordination between both Governments and \n     the new North/South institutions, where the wider role of the \n     two Governments is particularly relevant to the work of those \n     institutions, for example in a coordinated approach on EU \n     issues. It would be for consideration by both Governments, in \n     consultation with the relevant parties in the North, or with \n     the institutions after they have been established, whether to \n     achieve this through formal or ad hoc arrangements.\n\n\n                          protection of rights\n\n       50. There is a large body of support, transcending the \n     political divide, for the comprehensive protection and \n     guarantee of fundamental human rights. Acknowledging this, \n     both Governments envisage that the arrangements set out in \n     this Framework Document will be complemented and underpinned \n     by an explicit undertaking in the Agreement on the part of \n     each Government, equally, to ensure in its jurisdiction in \n     the island of Ireland, in accordance with its constitutional \n     arrangements, the systematic and effective protection of \n     common specified civil, political, social and cultural \n     rights. They will discuss and seek agreement with the \n     relevant political parties in Northern Ireland as to what \n     rights should be so specified and how they might best be \n     further protected, having regard to each Government's overall \n     responsibilities including its international obligations. \n     Each Government will introduce appropriate legislation in its \n     jurisdiction to give effect to any such measure of agreement.\n       51. In addition, both Governments would encourage \n     democratic representatives from both jurisdictions in Ireland \n     to adopt a Charter or Covenant, which might reflect and \n     endorse\n      agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights \n     of everyone living in Ireland. It could also pledge a \n     commitment to mutual respect and to the civil rights and \n     religious liberties of both communities, including: The \n     right of free political thought, the right to freedom and \n     expression of religion, the right to pursue democratically \n     national and political aspirations, the right to seek \n     constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate means, \n     the right to live wherever one chooses without hindrance, \n     the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic \n     activity, regardless of class, creed, gender or colour.\n       52. This Charter or Covenant might also contain a \n     commitment to the principle of consent in the relationships \n     between the two traditions in Ireland. It could incorporate \n     also an enduring commitment on behalf of all the people of \n     the island to guarantee and protect the rights, interests, \n     ethos and dignity of the unionist community in any all-\n     Ireland framework that might be developed with consent in the \n     future, to at least the same extent as provided for the \n     nationalist community in the context of Northern Ireland \n     under the structures and provisions of the new Agreement.\n       53. The Covenant might also affirm on behalf of all \n     traditions in Ireland a solemn commitment to the exclusively \n     peaceful resolution of all differences between them including \n     in relation to all issues of self-determination, and a solemn \n     repudiation of all recourse to violence between them for any \n     political end or purpose.\n                               conclusion\n\n       54. Both Governments agree that the issues set out in this \n     Framework Document should be examined in the most \n     comprehensive attainable negotiations with democratically \n     mandated political parties in Northern Ireland which abide \n     exclusively by peaceful means and wish to join in dialoque on \n     the way ahead.\n       55. Both Governments intend that the outcome of these \n     negotiations will be submitted for democratic ratification \n     through referendums, North and South.\n       56. Both Governments believe that the present climate of \n     peace, which owes much to the imagination, courage and \n     steadfastness of all those who have suffered from violence, \n     offers the best prospect for the Governments and the parties \n     in Northern Ireland to work to secure agreement and consent \n     to a new political accommodation. To accomplish that would be \n     an inestimable prize for all, and especially for people \n     living in Northern Ireland, who have so much to gain from \n     such an accommodation, in which the divisions of the past are \n     laid aside forever and differences are resolved by \n     exclusively political means. Both Governments believe that a \n     new political dispensation, such as they set out in this \n     Framework Document, achieved through agreement and \n     reconciliation and founded on the principle of consent, would \n     achieve that objective and transform relationships in \n     Northern Ireland, in the island of Ireland and between both \n     islands.\n       57. With agreement, co-operation to the mutual benefit of \n     all living in Ireland could develop without impediment, \n     attaining its full potential for stimulating economic growth \n     and prosperity. New arrangements could return power, \n     authority and responsibility to locally-elected \n     representatives in Northern Ireland on a basis acceptable to \n     both sides of the community, enabling them to work together \n     for the common welfare and interests of all the community. \n     The diversity of identities and allegiances could be regarded \n     by all as a source of mutual enrichment, rather than a threat \n     to either side. The divisive issue of sovereignty might cease \n     to be symbolic of the domination of one community over \n     another. It would instead be for decision under agreed \n     ground-rules, fair and balanced towards both aspirations, \n     through a process of democratic persuasion governed by the \n     principle of consent rather than by threat, fear or coercion. \n     In such circumstances the Governments hope that the \n     relationship between the traditions in Northern Ireland could \n     become a positive bond of further understanding, co-operation \n     and amity, rather than a source of contention, between the \n     wider British and Irish democracies.\n       58. Accordingly the British and Irish Governments offer for \n     consideration and strongly commend these proposals, trusting \n     that, with generosity and goodwill, the peoples of these \n     islands will build on them a new and lasting agreement.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2959-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2964-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2964-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF A DEFERRAL AND RESCISSIONS AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \n         AND HUMAN SERVICES--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 21\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975, as modified by the \norder of April 11, 1986; referred jointly to the Committee on the \nBudget, the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Finance, the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, and the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works; as follows:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, I herewith report one revised deferral, totaling $7.3 \nmillion, and two revised rescission proposals, totaling $106.7 million.\n  The revised deferral affects the Department of Health and Human \nServices.

The pattern of the proposed increase is identical to that \nof the last increase, which passed the Congress with a broad bipartisan \nmajority and was signed by President Bush in 1989. The first increment \nof the proposal simply restores the minimum wage to its real value \nfollowing the change enacted in 1989.\n  If the Congress does not act now, the minimum wage will fall to its \nlowest real level in 40 years. That would dishonor one of the great \npromises of American life--that everyone who works hard can earn a \nliving wage.\n[[Page S2965]] More than 11 million workers would benefit under this \nproposal, and a full-time, year-round worker at the minimum wage would \nget a $1,800 raise--the equivalent of 7 months of groceries for the \naverage family.\n  To reform the Nation's welfare system, we should make work pay, and \nthis legislation would help achieve that result. It would offer a raise \nto families that are working hard, but struggling to make ends meet. \nMost individuals earning the minimum wage are adults, and the average \nworker affected by this proposal brings home half of the family's \nearnings. Numerous empirical studies indicate that an increase in the \nminimum wage of the magnitude proposed would not have a significant \nimpact on employment. The legislation would ensure that those who work \nhard and play by the rules can live with the dignity they have earned.\n  I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this \nlegislation.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to update \nreferences in the classification of children for purposes of U.S. \nimmigration laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           legislation to facilitate international adoptions\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp individuals trying to adopt a child from a foreign country.\n  The adoption landscape has changed dramatically in this country over \nthe past 25 years. While international adoptions continue to be a small \npart of total U.S. adoptions--about 15 percent--thousands of Americans \npursue them every year.\n  Our law regarding international adoption is in a state of some \nconfusion. U.S. law requires that a child be certified as an orphan in \norder to be eligible for adoption by an American and for an immigrant \nvisa to the United States. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: \nproof that both parents are dead or; irrevocable release by a sole \nparent for adoption and emigration. Under U.S. law, a sole parent is \nthe mother of an illegitimate child. Many countries, however, have \nstopped using the term illegitimate, as have many States in this \ncountry. Children born in such countries to parents who are not married \nare now considered legitimate but born out of wedlock. Technology, \nthese children are no longer eligible for adoption and emigration to \nthe United States, even if the child's father has abandoned him or her.\n  [[Page S2966]] Despite this quirk in our international adoption law, \nthe INS until recently allowed the adoption and emigration of children \nwho were legitimate but born out of wedlock under their native \ncountries' laws. Last fall, however, the INS issued a new \ninterpretation of the law that required written notice of abandonment \nfrom both biological parents. U.S. Consular offices in host countries \nbegan disapproving visa applications for children who do not fit the \nstatutory sole parent of an illegitimate child definition, even when it \nwas clear that the biological father had abandoned a child. Around the \nworld, adoptions by U.S. families ground to a halt.\n  There is a simple and easy fix to this problem and this legislation \nwill do just that. My bill would change the current use of legitimate \nand illegitimate in the section of the INS Act that defines ``child'' \nfor immigration purposes to born out of wedlock. With this relatively \nsimple change, we can ensure that hundreds of Americans will be able to \nproceed with international adoptions that are legitimate and meet the \nlegal definitions of both a host country and of the U.S. Both INS and \nthe State Department strongly support this bill.\n  I request that this legislation be printed in full in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the opening of the 1995 season for the \nhunting of migratory birds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n     legislation protecting the opening of the 1995 hunting season\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise on the floor of the Senate to \nintroduce a bill which protects the opening of the 1995 season for the \nhunting of migratory birds. This is a hugely important issue in my \nState of Minnesota and I believe in some other States as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter that I sent to \nChairman Roth, as well as the ranking minority member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator John Glenn, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord , as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Governmental Affairs Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth and Ranking Member Glenn: I am writing \n     to you regarding the regulatory moratorium bill, S. 219, to \n     ask for your assistance in eliminating what I believe would \n     be a harmful effect of this legislation.\n       As you are aware, S. 219 would impose a moratorium on \n     governmental rulemaking retroactive to last November. While I \n     do agree that some federal rules may be needlessly intrusive, \n     I want to bring to your attention the extreme impact this \n     blanket moratorium would have on my state's hunting \n     enthusiasts.\n       Under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the hunting \n     season is closed unless the responsible federal agency opens \n     it by regulation. Each year the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service completes a long, complex rulemaking that opens the \n     waterfowl hunting season and specifies the limits of the \n     hunt. Under S. 219, the USFWS would be delayed in proceeding \n     with this rulemaking and in opening the season in Minnesota \n     this fall.\n       As Minnesota is home to some of America's best waterfowl \n     hunting, I must oppose any legislative measure that would \n     limit or eliminate the annual migratory bird hunting season. \n     As introduced, S. 219 would have the effect of delaying the \n     1995 migratory bird hunting season for at least a month; such \n     a delay would be tantamount to cancellation of at least part \n     of the season (the ``local shoot,'' when the vast majority of \n     Minnesotans do their hunting), since Minnesota's colder \n     climate means that the birds would likely have already \n     migrated south.\n       The result would be unacceptable to Minnesotans. In \n     Minnesota, the waterfowl hunting season is eagerly awaited by \n     hundreds of thousands of hunting enthusiasts, in addition to \n     being responsible for millions of dollars of economic \n     activity. Therefore, I request that when the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee considers this legislation, it attach an \n     amendment to exempt from the moratorium any rulemaking \n     necessary and appropriate to allow the annual migratory bird \n     hunting season to go forward as usual.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D. Wellstone,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me read the relevant portions of this letter:\n\n       I am writing to you regarding the regulatory moratorium \n     bill S. 219, to ask for your assistance in eliminating what I \n     believe would be a harmful effect of this legislation.\n       As you are aware, S. 219 would impose a moratorium on \n     governmental rulemaking retroactive to last November. While I \n     do agree that some Federal rules may be needlessly intrusive, \n     I want to bring to your attention the extreme impact this \n     blanket moratorium would have on my State's hunting \n     enthusiasts.\n       Under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918--\n\n  I need to be clear about this, Mr. President--\n\n     the hunting season is closed unless the responsible Federal \n     agency opens it by regulation. Each year the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service completes a long, complex rulemaking that \n     opens the waterfowl hunting season and specifies the limits \n     of the hunt. Under S. 219, the USFWS would be delayed in \n     proceeding with this rulemaking and in opening the season in \n     Minnesota this fall.\n       As Minnesota is home to some of America's best waterfowl \n     hunting, I would oppose any legislative measure that would \n     limit or eliminate the annual migratory bird hunting season. \n     As introduced, S. 219 would have the effect of delaying the \n     1995 migratory bird hunting season for at least a month; such \n     a delay would be tantamount to cancellation of at least part \n     of the season (the ``local shoot,'' when the vast majority of \n     Minnesotans do their hunting), since Minnesota's colder \n     climate means the birds would likely have already migrated \n     south.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, let me be crystal clear about it. This bill that \nI introduce today makes it clear that this moratorium on rules would \ninclude an exemption for hunting season rules. I am not talking about \nan exception for agency administration rules. I am simply saying that \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service has made it crystal clear that they have \nto do the rule making for us to have our hunting season.\n  Best case scenario, it would be delayed too long a period of time for \nthe early, local shoot, and worst-case scenario, we would not have the \nseason.\n  The bill I introduce is very clear:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n     notwithstanding a law that imposes a moratorium on the \n     issuance of regulations, or any other law (except a law that \n     specifically refers to this Act), that is in effect or comes \n     into effect on or after the date of enactment of the Act, the \n     Secretary of Interior may issue such regulations as are \n     appropriate under section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act \n     to establish the framework for and to open the migratory \n     hunting season for 1995.\n\n  Mr. President, some Senators have said there is no problem. But we \nare lawmakers. And we have to be crystal clear in our language. \nSometimes haste makes waste. As I look at S. 219 right now, there is \nabsolutely no provision whatever in this piece of legislation which \nmakes it clear that Fish and Wildlife Service will be able to go \nforward with the rulemaking so we will have this hunting season.\n  Mr. President, there are at least 100,000 active duck hunt \nparticipants each year in Minnesota--100,000. And as many as 170,000 in \na good year. And the DNR officials estimate that waterfowl hunting \ndirectly contributes between $35 to $40 million each year to the \nMinnesota economy. Tim Bermicker, section chief of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Natural Resources, summed up this issue better than I \never could: ``Duck hunting is more than just an annual event. It is the \ncherished way of life in Minnesota, part of the fabric of the State.''\n  I just say, Mr. President, I fully expect for there to be a debate on \nthis bill. But with some Senators haste makes waste and some may have \nmoved forward too quickly on this blanket moratorium and did not take \nthis into account with their current legislation. I am fully prepared \nto be a part of this debate.\n   [[Page S2967]] I see no reason why my bill cannot be accepted as an \namendment at the markup of this piece of legislation in committee, and \nthere is absolutely on my part as a Senator from Minnesota a commitment \nto make sure that we get the language to make it clear that the \nrulemaking goes forward so we have this hunt, so that we have our duck \nhunting season.\n  Now, other Senators have said there is nothing to worry about. There \nwill not be anything to worry about when we get our language included \nand make the exemption clear. There will not be anything to worry about \nwhen we do our work as legislators. But I will not accept word of mouth \nassurances, or arguments that all this is scare tactics.\n  What I know is what I read in the legislation. I am a legislator. I \nunderstand legislation. And I know right now we do not have the \nnecessary language that will enable the agency to go forward with this \nhunting season or the necessary language to make sure that Minnesotans \nwill be able to fully participate.\n  This bill I introduced today is extremely important, and it is my \nfervent hope that the language in this bill will find its way into what \nhappens on the House side and what also happens in the U.S. Senate. \nThis is no small issue, and it is a perfect example of what happens \nwhen we are not careful in the legislative work that we do.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 459. A bill to provide surveillance, research, and services aimed \nat prevention of birth defects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      birth defects prevention act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, birth defects are the leading cause of \ninfant death in this country, and a national research and prevention \nstrategy is desperately needed. The infant mortality rate in the United \nStates is higher than in most other industrialized nations and higher \nthan some Third World countries. One out of every five infant deaths \nresults from a birth defect. Birth defects cause more infant deaths in \nthis country than any other single factor. In Missouri, birth defects \naccount for 21 percent of total infant deaths.\n  Today, I am introducing the Birth Defects Prevention Act. This bill \nlays out a national strategy to prevent birth defects. Congressman \nSolomon Ortiz is simultaneously introducing this bill in the other \nbody.\n  In 1991, I introduced the Families in Need Act, S. 1380, to address \nmany important health, nutrition, and housing needs of families in \ncrises. In that bill, I proposed efforts that would lead to a \ncoordinated effort to reduce the incidence of birth defects. \nSimultaneously, I worked in the Appropriations Committee to obtain \nfunding for this effort at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. This funding is the basis for CDCP's efforts in this area \ntoday. This bill is a continuation of efforts in this area.\n  More than 100,000 children are born each year with a serious birth \ndefect. Many more children have serious disorders from a birth defect \nthat are discovered later in life. Birth defects are the leading cause \nof disability in infants who survive their first birthday. Infants of \nall races, economic classes, and in every State are at risk. This is a \nserious public health problem.\n  More children die before their first birthday because of birth \ndefects than from any other cause. More infant deaths result from birth \ndefects than from prematurity and low birth weight. In 10 States, over \n25 percent of infant deaths were caused by birth defects. Birth defects \nare also a leading cause of childhood disability that leads to a \nlifelong suffering. This is a serious problem that has a terrible \nimpact on the well-being of many children in our Nation.\n  It may surprise you to learn that the United States has no \ncoordinated strategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. It is \nshocking how few resources are devoted to preventing this devastating \nproblem. That must change.\n  A tragic situation in the State of Texas a few years ago exemplifies \nhow the lack of a coordinated birth defects prevention strategy can \naffect a community. The result was a delayed response to an outbreak of \nbirth defects and the needless cost of innocent lives. In the incident \nin Texas, health professionals observed that six infants were born with \nanencephaly over a 6-week period. Anencephaly is a fatal birth defect \nin which the infant is born without a brain.\n  The Texas Department of Health conducted a thorough study after this \ninformation was reported. This study revealed that, since 1989, at \nleast 30 infants in south Texas had been born without any or with very \nlittle brain tissue. However, like many States, Texas does not have a \nbirth defects surveillance program. As a result, the severity of the \nproblem was not recognized until the incidence of anencephaly was so \nhigh that it was difficult to miss. It is only because so many infants \nwere born without any brain tissue that this terrible catastrophe was \ndiscovered.\n  This tragic story from south Texas underlines the need for a \ncoordinated national effort to research the causes of birth defects and \ndevelop prevention strategies. Infants are being born today somewhere \nin America with serious birth defects that could have been prevented. \nWithout a coordinated surveillance system, we may not discover these \ndefects and discover how to prevent them.\n  Many birth defects are preventable. Tragically, many opportunities at \nprevention are missed because few States have prevention strategies.\n  One example of a serious, yet preventable, birth defect is fetal \nalcohol syndrome or FAS. Pregnant mothers cause FAS when alcoholic \nbeverages are consumed. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a leading cause of \nmental retardation. It affects an estimated 8,000 newborns each year \nplus, 36,000 who suffer a related set of birth defects. It is \ncompletely preventable.\n  Neural tube defects are one of the top three causes of birth defects \nthat result in the death of the infant. Neural tube defects are severe \ndefects of the brain and spinal cord. They include spina bifida and \nanencephaly. This birth defect is also preventable. The majority of \nneural tube defects could be prevented through the consumption of a \nsimple folic acid vitamin supplement by pregnant women and women of \nchildbearing age.\n  The Birth Defects Prevention Act lays out a strategy to prevent \nchildren from being born with defects and to find possible cures for \nthose already afflicted with certain defects.\n  Under this bill a national birth defects surveillance and prevention \nresearch system would be established. Regional birth defects research \nprograms would be established as centers of excellence to provide the \ncomprehensive surveillance data and epidemiological research needed to \nstudy clusters of birth defects, identify their causes, and develop and \nevaluate prevention efforts. Such centers also would provide training \nand education to health professionals. The surveillance and monitoring \nof birth defects would be carried out using vital records, hospital \nrecords, and other data while protecting privacy.\n  This bill would develop and implement birth defects prevention and \nintervention programs. When the cause of a birth defect is known, we \nmust have a prevention strategy. This bill would authorize prevention \ndemonstration programs to develop new strategies to reduce the \nincidence of birth defects. This bill would also provide funding and \ntechnical assistance to State health departments to implement programs \nof proven effectiveness and safety in prevention of birth defects.\n  And finally, this bill would broaden public and professional \nawareness of birth defects and prevention opportunities. To do this, a \nclearinghouse at the Centers for Disease Control would be established \nfor the collection, storage, and interpretation of data generated from \nState birth defects surveillance programs and regional birth defects \ncenters. This bill would also enhance public information and education \nprograms for the prevention of birth defects, such as programs using \nfolic acid vitamin supplementation to prevent spina bifida and alcohol \navoidance strategies to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  Without a strategy to discover the causes of birth defects and \nprevent them, the terrible tragedy of birth defects will continue. Too \nfew resources are devoted to reducing birth defects which are the \nleading cause of infant \n[[Page S2968]] morality. We cannot reach the national goal of reducing \ninfant morality to 7 death per 1,000 live\n births by the year 2000 without a national birth defects prevention \nstrategy.\n\n  The March of Dimes has done such important and tireless work toward \nthe prevention of birth defects. This country and its children \ncertainly owe the March of Dimes a heartfelt thank you. In particular, \nKay Johnson and Vivian Gabore of the March of Dimes staff deserve a \nspecial thank you for their seemingly never-ending efforts to get the \nBirth Defects Prevention Act passed. It is their research, study, and \nwork that has resulted in this bill, and I am exceedingly grateful to \nthem.\n  In addition to the March of Dimes, this bill also has the endorsement \nof 18 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the Epilepsy Foundation, the \nNational Easter Seal Society, the Spina Bifida Association, and many \nothers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Birth Defects Prevention Act\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       To prevent birth defects by developing and implementing new \n     prevention strategies, targeting research into the causes of \n     birth defects, monitoring the incidence of clusters of birth \n     defects, and increasing the collection of national data on \n     birth defects.\n\n\n                                the need\n\n       More children die from birth defects in the first year of \n     life in the U.S. than from any other cause including \n     prematurity and low birth weight. Birth defects are also a \n     leading cause of childhood disability. Each year, over \n     100,000 children are born with serious defects, and many more \n     are found later in life to have disorders. Medical care and \n     special education made necessary by birth defects cost \n     billions of dollars each year.\n       Recent research shows that a significant proportion of \n     common birth defects are preventable, although the causes of \n     most birth defects remain unknown. Few states have prevention \n     strategies and many opportunities are being missed. Despite \n     the fact that birth defects are the leading cause of infant \n     mortality, research and prevention has not received priority \n     attention.\n\n\nestablish a national birth defects surveillance and prevention research \n                                 system\n\n       A. Establish regional birth defects research programs as \n     ``centers of excellence'' to provide the comprehensive \n     surveillance data and epidemiologic research needed to study \n     clusters of birth defects, identify their causes, and develop \n     and evaluate prevention efforts. Such centers also would \n     provide training and education to health professionals.\n       B.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to ensure \nequity in the extent to which businesses located near Interstate and \nFederal-aid primary highways may erect outdoor advertising signs, \ndisplays, and devices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     highway advertising equity act\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing Senate Bill 460, \nentitled Highway Advertising Equity Act, to amend section 131 of title \n23, United States Code. Enacted on August 28, 1958, 23 U.S.C. 131, \nControl of Outdoor Advertising, was designed to protect public \ninvestment, promote safety and recreational value, and preserve natural \nbeauty along the interstate system. Therefore, the statute reflects a \nsocioeconomic and demographic environment of 36 years ago.\n  Roadways that were once rural, narrow, and sparsely populated are now \nmultilane highways bordered with burgeoning businesses and linking the \nNation in a well-traveled web. This growth in commercial and industrial \nuse areas has increased the need to inform the motoring public of \navailable services, food, lodging, and attractions of special interest.\n  Current law allows only on-premises advertising by business owners \nwhose property is adjacent to the interstate system. Restricting \nadvertising to owners of businesses adjacent to the interstate system \nto advertise on-premise services discriminates against property owners \nin the same commercial area who wish to advertise off-premise services \nnear the interstate system.\n  Commercial and industrial areas have expanded beyond the properties \nwhich were once only found adjacent to interstate systems. However, the \nneed for businesses, no matter where they are located, to advertise \nalong the interstate system is imperative to their success.\n  Senate bill 460 is offered to bring the law up to date with the needs \nof our growing business communities. I think it is fitting that we \naddress this issue in today's environment where the Federal Government \nhas said it intends to give more power back to the localities and stop \nplacing mandates on middle class Americans who spend everyday honestly \ntrying to make a decent living for their family.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 462. A bill to provide for the temporary suspension of the \nreformulated gasoline rules under the Clean Air Act; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   reformulated gasoline requirements\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to temporarily \nsuspend enforcement of the reformulated gas requirements as mandated by \nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. I do so, Mr. President, as a \nsupporter of the Clean Air Act, the reformulated fuels program, and of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. However, the situation over the \npast few weeks in Milwaukee, since the introduction of reformulated \nfuel on January 1, 1995, has caused me great concern. In introducing \nthis measure, I am joined today by two of my colleagues in the other \nbody, Representative Kleczka and Representative Barrett, who have \nintroduced similar legislation.\n\n  The EPA Regional Office in Chicago has received at least a thousand \ncalls from individuals in Milwaukee who are experiencing problems using \nreformulated fuels. During the first week of February, 1995 phone calls \nto my Milwaukee office were coming in at rates of 5-8 per hour, and \nseveral hundred constituents have contacted me to share their \nexperiences. Among the concerns that these individuals express, and of \nprimary concern to me, is that this gasoline is making them ill. \nAdditionally, Mr. President, citizens of Milwaukee want to know what \nthe EPA knows about how the gasoline will perform both in their cars \nand in two stroke-engines such as snow blowers and snowmobiles, when \nthe price, which is currently running between 10 and 15 cents more than \nregular gas will come down, and how to identify the various blends of \ngasoline at the pump. I wrote to Administrator Browner on February 10, \n1995 expressing these concerns and have not yet received a response.\n  While price and performance are significant problems that need to be \nexamined, the health of the citizens of Milwaukee, Mr. President, \nsimply cannot wait. Administrator Browner, in a meeting with the \nWisconsin delegation last Friday, February 17, 1995, announced that the \nAgency would not make a final decision on suspending the fuels until \nafter they went to Wisconsin. The Agency believes, Mr. President, that \nWisconsin's problems could best be addressed by switching fuels among \ndifferent reformulated blends.\n  In response to the calls and inquiries from the Wisconsin delegation \nand Governor Thompson, and in line with the EPA's announced position, \nthe Agency did hold a public meeting in \n[[Page S2969]] Milwaukee this past Monday, February 20, 1995 on \nreformulated gasoline. The Milwaukee Sentinel reported that more than \n400 people showed up for the meeting, overflowing the room. The Agency \nhas pledged to say in Wisconsin as long as it takes to address my \nconstituents' concerns.\n  It seems, Mr. President, that these concerns are significant and that \nthe Agency should suspend its enforcement of the rule until it \ncompletes its on the ground assessment, particularly while people's \nhealth is potentially at risk. Gasoline blended\n with three different oxygenates is being sold in Milwaukee, some \ncontaining MTBE derived from methane, some containing ETBE derived from \nethanol and natural gas, and some containing ethanol. The EPA knows \nfrom more than $2 million in health studies, Mr. President, that one of \nthe oxygenates, MTBE, has the potential to produce both cancer and \nother health effects--and the jury is still out on the ethanol blends. \nThe current data that the Agency has on Milwaukee's overall air quality \nand on specific situations my constituents face every day such as \nrefueling, riding inside their cars, and having their vehicles sit in \nenclosed garages, is too limited for a quantitive estimate of \npopulation exposure to the host of oxygenates used in the six county \narea. At best, the data have been used to estimate a broad range of \npotential exposures. However, Mr. President, we are no longer in a \npotential exposure situation--people are putting this stuff into their \ntanks.\n\n  While I understand that actual epidemiological experiences in \nMilwaukee may be difficult for EPA to interpret, I cannot as a \nresponsible policymaker rule out the fact that Milwaukee's topography \nand temperature results in exposures in my State that are different \nthan the other parts of the country. I also understand, Mr. President, \nthat Milwaukee is not alone in experiencing problems with reformulated \nfuels. Several of the nine other cities required to use the fuels are \nfacing similar concerns.\n  I believe that these requirements should be suspended until the \nhealth concerns can be fully investigated. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 462\n\n     SECTION 1. SUSPENSION OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE RULES.\n\n       Upon the enactment of this Act, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency rules under section 211(k) of the Clean Air \n     shall be suspended. Such suspension shall remain in effect \n     until such time as the Administrator--\n       (1) demonstrates, after notice and opportunity for hearing, \n     that reformulated gasoline manufactured and distributed in \n     accordance with such rules does not cause adverse health \n     effects; or\n       (2) revises such rules to eliminate any such adverse health \n     effects, and\n\n     submits a report to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     setting forth the steps taken under paragraph (1) or (2).\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, Jim Wright served as Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives and, prior to that, majority leader of the \nHouse.\n  I had the privilege of working with him on a number of things and \nfound him to be a genuine leader, not just someone who holds the title \nof leader.\n  Not long ago, I read a reference about a column that he had done for \nthe Fort Worth Star Telegram on the subject of civility.\n  I wrote to him and asked for a copy of a column, and it is the kind \nof enlightened common sense that you would expect from Jim Wright.\n  The first paragraph of his column sums up our situation beautifully:\n\n       Civility. The word is little used these days, the quality \n     it describes too little practiced. It is a necessary \n     lubricating oil for the machinery of a free society. In its \n     absence, the gears of democracy grind in noisy dissonance to \n     a screeching halt.\n\n  I ask that the entire Jim Wright column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n           [From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Oct. 23, 1994]\n\n                  Throwing Sand in Society's Machinery\n\n       Civility. The word is little used these days, the quality \n     it describes too little practiced. It is the necessary \n     lubricating oil for the machinery of a free society. In its \n     absence, the gears of democracy grind in noisy dissonance to \n     a screeching halt.\n       Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary defines civility \n     as the state of being civilized. Its marks, the dictionary \n     notes, are politeness, consideration, courtesy. The modern \n     term grew from a Latin word, civilitas. In its original form, \n     it signified ``the art of government.''\n       The preservation of liberties--free speech, free press, \n     free religious expression--has always exacted a price. Part \n     of that price is civility, respect for the institutions of \n     our government and fellow citizens with whom we disagree. \n     Deprived of its oxygen, the lungs of a democratic society \n     would ultimately collapse.\n       Too much of what passes for debate in this election year, \n     protected by the liberties to which we pay homage, pollutes \n     the public dialogue as noxiously as carbon monoxide \n     contaminates a living environment.\n       The hallmark of a civilized human order is the ability to \n     disagree without being disagreeable. We seem to be losing \n     this. Instead of reasoned disputation, we hear increasingly \n     hateful and unreasoning allegations brandished like weapons \n     designed to inflict injury and mortal hurt.\n       The mail last week brought astonished recipients a fund-\n     raising appeal so rotten and rancid with hate as to offend \n     the very garbage cans into which it should be forthrightly \n     consigned.\n       On an official-looking letterhead with a Washington \n     address, the plea for contributions begins with the following \n     outrageous claim: ``I have in my possession compelling \n     evidence that proves beyond all shadow of a doubt that White \n     House aid [sic] Vincent Foster was murdered * * * vital clues \n     that lead right to the Oval Office.''\n       Begging for money to spew out more such bile, the writer \n     promises to prosecute a case of impeachment against President \n     Clinton, presumably for the murder of his lifelong friend.\n       Really, this is beyond the pale. No president of the United \n     States should have to contend with such inflammatory and \n     unfounded libel. It is not enough that special counsel Robert \n     B. Fiske, a Republican and no friend of Clinton's looked \n     carefully into this bizarre allegation concerning poor \n     Foster's suicide and reported it to be just that.\n       Tasting blood and heedless of the proven emptiness of their \n     brazen claim or the hurt it inflicts upon loved ones and \n     friends of the late presidential aide, professional purveyors \n     of venom continue their calculated campaign of calumny \n     against the president.\n       Hate-Clinton solicitation letters have become a cottage \n     industry. For some the good is political power. For others \n     it's just a way to fill greedy coffers with contributions \n     bilked from innocent, well-meaning Americans gullibly alarmed \n     by the strident claims of right-wing media personalities such \n     as Rush Limbaugh and the Rev. Jerry Falwell.\n       Preachments of hate, prejudgments of guilt and eagerness to \n     repeat the vilest slanders are not new to American society. \n     But they do seem to have reached preposterous proportions in \n     this election year.\n       Twenty-six years ago, Lyndon B. Johnson deplored the \n     incivility of some anti-war demonstrators who shouted slogans \n     to drown out opposition. ``They are chiefly united in the \n     certainty with which they advance their views,'' he said, \n     ``and in the vehemence with which they mock the views of \n     others.''\n       Thomas Jefferson 160 years earlier compared political \n     extremists to ``patients of Bedlam, needing medical more than \n     moral counsel.'' He despaired of ``any attempt to set one of \n     these zealots to right, either in fact or principle.''\n       Presently, things are going better. American policy is \n     working. In Haiti and Iraq our will prevails without war. \n     North Korea, after 40 years of implacable hostility, agrees \n     to remove its nuclear threat.\n      World tensions abate. Israel and Jordan proclaim a historic \n     peace. At home the economy grows, unemployment falls, \n     prices are stable. We should rejoice, but we don't.\n       Pollsters report a sour mood, agitated to anger by apostles \n     of discontent. Seldom have political partisans so boldly \n     boasted of obstruction, so viciously attacked colleagues and \n     their own institutions. What's missing is civility.\n       [[Page S2974]] The assault on mutual respect has pervaded \n     Congress. Republicans, desperate after 40 years in the \n     minority, are turning ever more negative. Some nervous \n     Democrats follow suit. Not only do dissident members attack \n     the personal integrity of our president, but they seem out to \n     weaken and destroy Congress itself. Absurdly, they think this \n     is what the public wants.\n       Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and House Whip Newt \n     Gingrich recently pledged support on the Capitol steps for a \n     constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms. House \n     members should not be trusted, the argument goes, to serve \n     faithfully for more than six years, nor senators for more \n     than 12.\n       But at the heart of this gimmicky assault on the \n     Constitution lies an unspoken assumption that the public \n     cannot be trusted to choose wisely. The hypocrisy of the \n     position that these two publicly profess is transparent in \n     the fact that Dole has been in Congress continuously since \n     1960, and Gingrich, who would limit future colleagues to no \n     more than three terms, is seeking his ninth.\n       If their logic should ever prevail, the legislative branch \n     will be vastly weakened, bereft of strong and experienced \n     leaders, much more at the mercy of an authoritative executive \n     branch. There will be no Sam Rayburns, no Robert A. Tafts, no \n     Arthur Vandenbergs or Barry Goldwaters to curb the \n     presidential appetite for power or to soften its occasional \n     rashness with their wisdom. And civility.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2973-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to draw to the \nattention of the Senate my concern about declines in recent decades in \nvoter participation in local and national elections. In the 1988 \nelection, only about half of those citizens eligible to vote went to \nthe polls. While turnout improved during the last Presidential \nelection, voter participation remains low in this country compared to \nother advanced democratic countries. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, only 61 percent of U.S. citizens eligible to vote are \nregistered. While there are many reasons why people do not vote, \nstudies indicate that the major reason is that they are not registered. \nIn fact, the Bureau of Census reports that voter turnout of registered \nvoters in Presidential elections typically exceeds 85 percent.\n  Recognizing the need to establish uniform national voter registration \nprocedures to allow greater opportunities for all eligible citizens to \nparticipate in the electoral process, the U.S. Congress adopted the \nNational Voter Registration Act early in the 103d Congress, legislation \nI was proud to support. The National Voter Registration Act, also known \nas the motor-voter bill, provides greater opportunities for all \neligible citizens to participate in the electoral process.\n  The methods for voter registration established by the legislation--by \nmail, as part of drivers license renewal, and when visiting Government \nagencies--are well tested and successful methods for registering \nvoters. And, in fact, States which have implemented the motor-voter \nprovisions have experienced significant increases in voter \nregistration. About 3,700 voters were registered in Washington State \nwithin the first 7 days of motor-voter operation. Florida has been \naveraging more than 3,000 new voter registrations per day from people \nobtaining drivers licenses. The successes continue to be documented in \nother States such as Georgia, where more than 18,000 people have been \nregistered under the new procedures since January 1, 1995, and in \nKentucky where 10,000 new voters were registered in the first 10 days \nof implementation. In my own State of Maryland, approximately 90,000 \npeople have been registered through the Motor Vehicle Administration in \n1995 alone, and Maryland election officials expect an additional \n900,000 citizens to register under the new system.\n  While some critics of this legislation have charged that by making \nvoter registration easier, there may be increased opportunities for \nfraud, the bill includes important safeguards to prevent such fraud. \nThe mail registration form requires a statement of eligibility to vote, \nan attestation that the applicant meets each requirement of eligibility \nto vote, and the signature of the applicant under penalty of perjury.\n  Mr. President, there are further misconceptions surrounding this bill \nthat should be clarified. First, though agencies are required to \nprovide registrants with assistance when requested, the National Voter \nRegistration Act does not require agency personnel to fill out \nregistration forms--it is the applicant who fills out the form. Second, \nthe legislation requires that an applicant be informed that the quality \nand quantity of Government assistance they receive will not be effected \nby their willingness or refusal to register. Third, the legislation \nprotects the privacy of the applicant by restricting the use of voter \nregistration information. An applicant has the option of completing the \nform at home and returning it by mail, and agency employees may not \nforce an individual to register or attempt to persuade an applicant to \njoin a particular political party.\n  I understand that concerns have also been raised about potential \nadditional costs for State and local governments to implement this \nlegislation. I would simply note that any increased costs for a State \nto comply with the uniform voter registration standards provided by \nthis legislation would be relatively small, particularly in those \nStates, such as Maryland, that have already taken steps to increase the \nopportunity for citizens to register to vote. In addition, the \nlegislation provides relief to all States in the form of a postal rate \nreduction for State and local election officials which will save State \nand local governments more than $4 million per year. There are also \nexpected to be savings through the use of uniform registration forms in \nthose States that have not yet adopted uniformity between jurisdictions \nand because voter registration is now likely to be spread out over the \nyear as people renew drivers licenses. Consequently, there will be less \nneed to hire additional registrars to handle the higher volume of \nregistration that typically occurs in some States before registration \ndeadlines.\n  Mr. President, it is my strongly held view that we must be careful \nabout attaching price tags to civil rights. Imagine if we had decided \nnot to extend the right to vote to 18-year-olds, women, or other \nminorities because it would place a burden on the States due to an \nincreased workload or the purchasing of new voting machines. The \nNational Voter Registration Act is already making it easier for \ncitizens to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of a \ndemocracy--the right to vote. A healthy democracy thrives on the active \nparticipation of the governed.\n  This important new law is clearly working and should not be repealed \nnor should its implementation be delayed as some have proposed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2974-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2974-S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY ACT--S. 381\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join several of \nmy colleagues as a cosponsor of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act, although I have reservations concerning the trade \nsanctions included in the legislation. Fidel Castro's 36-year \ndictatorship has been catastrophic for Cuba's society and economy. \nAgricultural and industrial production have been stymied by \nauthoritarian state control. Many of Cuba's most skilled and talented \ncitizens have chosen to risk their lives to achieve freedom elsewhere, \nincluding the United States. Meanwhile, living standards for those who \nremained have fallen steadily. The backward direction of Cuba's \ndevelopment stands in sharp contrast to other states in Central and \nSouth America, who have flourished under policies of market and \ndemocratic liberalization. Castro is among the last adherents to the \nbankrupt philosophy of Communist authoritarianism. The Cuban people \ncannot move forward to the prosperity which their human and natural \nresources entitle them as long as Castro's authoritarian rule remains \nintact. The United States must continue to do what it can to help the \nCuban people in their struggle for economic and political freedom and \nto reestablish the rule of law.\n  We also have an obligation to American citizens, many of whom have \nunresolved property claims against the Castro government, to work for \njustice on their behalf. At the same time, I believe the United States \nmust balance its goals in Cuba with other important foreign policy \nobjectives, such as free trade and support for market and political \nreforms in other countries. Accordingly, I associate myself with the \nobjectives of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act and look \nforward to working with my colleagues to improve the bill particularly \nin the \n[[Page S2975]] trade areas as it receives further \nconsideration.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2974-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        HOW COLORBLIND ADOPTIONS CHANGED AND ENRICHED OUR LIVES\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, for several years I had an \noutstanding staff member, Pamela J. Huey, who, unfortunately for me, \nmoved to Minneapolis with her husband and family.\n  She was not only a superb staff person but she is a genuine \nhumanitarian.\n  She and her husband have adopted two African-American children. I \nhave seen Benjamin develop into a fine young man and their new child, \nAnthony, I am sure will do the same.\n  She has written for the Minneapolis Star Tribune an article titled, \n``Colorblind Adoptions Changed and Enriched Our Lives.''\n  I ask that her article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Jan. 29, 1995]\n\n          Colorblind Adoptions Changed and Enriched Our Lives\n\n                            (By Pamela Huey)\n\n       The national debate on welfare reform, teenage pregnancy \n     and orphanages demands another look at transracial adoption \n     as one positive alternative for children who need stable, \n     loving homes.\n       While some within the African-American community and other \n     minorities continue to oppose the adoption of children of \n     color by Caucasian parents, I would argue that such adoptions \n     are not only successful but desirable, producing benefits for \n     parents, children and society as a whole.\n       Five years ago, childless and wanting to start a family, my \n     husband and I approached an agency in Washington, D.C., \n     specializing in foreign adoptions. But the paperwork, red \n     tape, cost and prospect of spending an undetermined amount of \n     time in another country were daunting.\n       We learned our agency did receive ``domestic'' placements \n     but these children were nearly always black or biracial. We \n     wondered why, if there were babies in our own country in need \n     of loving, nurturing homes, would anyone travel halfway \n     around the world for a baby? Skin color seemed the only \n     answer. We told the agency that the race of the child did not \n     matter--a baby was a baby--and within seven months we were \n     parents of a beautiful black 17-day-old boy. This Christmas, \n     we became parents of Anthony, a 6-week-old African-American \n     baby, also born in Washington, D.C.\n       Adopting Benjamin and Anthony has changed and enriched our \n     lives in profound ways that we did not anticipate.\n       When we moved to the Twin Cities in 1992, we chose an \n     integrated neighborhood in south Minneapolis.\n       The church we chose, Park Avenue United Methodist, has a \n     spiritual mission to increase understanding between the races \n     and to bring people together as one to worship God.\n       Benjamin attends Seed Academy, a private school with an \n     Afrocentric curriculum.\n       We've attended classes for multicultural families. We've \n     participated in the YMCA's ``home team'' program for \n     multicultural families. The Twin Cities area seems to have no \n     end of opportunities for us.\n       But most importantly, we have a perspective on race \n     relations and racial prejudice that we otherwise would never \n     have had. The love of parent for child has no equal, and \n     loving Benjamin and Anthony was given us a window on a world \n     previously closed to us. Now, as parents, we hurt for the \n     young black males who are considered threats just because of \n     their race.\n       Interracial adoption breaks down barriers and increases \n     understanding in new ways that filter through the extended \n     family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters and \n     cousins, even neighbors and family friends, also are exposed \n     to this new understanding and a family love that crosses \n     racial lines.\n       We hope growing up in our racially blended family will give \n     Benjamin and Anthony skills for living in both white and \n     black worlds and that their worlds will be more human and \n     loving, rather than divided along racial lines.\n       Harvard Law Prof. Elizabeth Bartholet wrote in the May 1991 \n     issue of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review that \n     ``transracial adoptees appear more positive than blacks \n     raised inracially about relationships with whites, more \n     comfortable in those relationships and more interested in a \n     racially integrated lifestyle.''\n       American University Prof. Rita Simon, who has done \n     exhaustive studies on the long-term effects of these \n     adoptions, has written that transracial adoptees perceive \n     ``their world as essentially pluralistic and multicolored.''\n       We hope we are not being naive. We know Benjamin and \n     Anthony will face racism and hatred in future years, and we \n     are trying to prepare them for that.\n       As we prepared for our second adoption, I asked Benjamin \n     what kind of sister or brother he would like. His first \n     response was ``black.'' But then he thought for a moment and \n     responded, ``Any color would be OK.''\n       Pamela Huey is a journalist who lives in \n     Minneapolis.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2975-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2975-S2977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING\n\n Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthose who have already spoken in recognition of February as Black \nHistory Month. Since 1926 this nation has designated February as the \nmonth in which we honor the achievements and contributions of African-\nAmericans to our history, our culture, and our future. One could also \nsay that February is the month in which we honor our Nation's unsung \nheroes--from the African-American soldiers who have often received no \nacknowledgment for fighting in the American Revolution to the African-\nAmerican poets and authors often excluded from literary anthologies. \nThe history of African-Americans is the history of what this country \nhas come to mean to so many people around the world. It is the history \nof possibilities, of dreams, and of the equality of all human beings. \nIt is the story of insurmountable odds overcome and of challenges yet \nto be faced.\n  Mr. President, my own State of Maryland has been blessed to be the \nbirthplace and home of countless outstanding African-Americans. \nMaryland was a bedrock of the Underground Railroad which helped many \nAfrican-Americans find their way out of slavery to freedom. In fact, \nHarriet Tubman, the African-American woman credited with leading more \nthan 300 men, women, and children to freedom on the Underground \nRailroad was a Marylander. The history of Maryland is replete with the \ncontributions of African-Americans, many of which have gone \nundocumented and unrecognized. Black History Month affords us an \nopportunity to honor our heroes both past and present, and to remind \nourselves of the many national heroes whose faces do not adorn currency \nor postage stamps and whose stories are not told in history books or \nencyclopedias.\n  During this month of celebration, one of the three great African-\nAmericans receiving special honor across the Nation is Frederick \nDouglass, a man whose life symbolized heroism. Born on Maryland's \nEastern Shore in 1818, Frederick Douglass escaped slavery to become one \nof the leading abolitionists of his time. For Frederick Douglass it was \nnot enough that he won his own freedom; he spent his life fighting for \nthe freedom and advancement of millions of other people. His life, like \nthe lives of many of the other men and women honored during Black \nHistory Month, was a life of triumph against overwhelming odds. One \nonly has to visit the birthplace of Frederick Douglass and take a \nmoment to imagine it without the nearby highway, automobiles, and \nconvenience stores in order to have an inkling of the challenges which \nfaced a slave seeking freedom. Not only was there the challenge of \nescaping an isolated plantation and the constant fear of recapture and \ntorture, but also the challenge to self-educate, find work, and build a \nnew life away from all that was familiar.\n  The history of African-Americans, however, does not begin or end with \nslavery and the Civil War. Long after the end of slavery, African-\nAmericans continued to fight for freedom and all of its rights. It is a \nstruggle which has inspired people around the world to fight for their \nfreedom. Mr. President, I utter the name of Frederick Douglass not only \nto honor the man who was known as Frederick Douglass and who achieved \nso very much with his life, but for all nameless thousands who like \nFrederick Douglass achieved so much from so little--people who gave \ntheir lives so that their children and grandchildren might have better \nlives, people who have helped to define the real possibilities of \nfreedom and equality in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, as we near the end of this month, I hope that each of \nus will take a moment to remember the lessons of Black History Month \nand to carry them with us throughout the year as a reminder of all that \nis truly possible. Two hundred years ago, how many Americans would have \nimagined a Thurgood Marshall or an Alice Walker? Black History Month is \na time to celebrate--to celebrate all of the great achievements of \nAfrican-Americans, to celebrate how far this country has come, and to \nremind us of how much further we have to go.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2977-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2977-S2978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      U.S. POLICY VIS-A-VIS SERBIA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nstrong disapproval at the latest developments in the administration's \napproach to Bosnia. The national press reported last week the \nadministration's decision to concur with a Contact Group proposal to \noffer Serbia a complete lifting of U.N. sanctions if it would recognize \nthe independence of Croatia and Bosnia and cut off arms to rebel \nSerbian armies in both countries.\n  This might have been a reasonable proposal if, as the New York Times \nput it, ``Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, had a record of \nhonoring his commitments, or if the five-power group had a record of \ninsisting on compliance with its deals. Neither is true.''\n  This latest step in United States compliance with the Contact Group's \npolicy of appeasement followed the decision just 1 month ago to extend \nfor another 100 days a partial easing of U.N. sanctions on Serbia with \nthe understanding that it would deny assistance to rebel Serbs in both \nCroatia and Bosnia. During the previous 100-day, sanctions-easing \nperiod last fall, SAM 6 missiles mysteriously appeared at Serbian \npositions in Bosnia and regular soldiers of the Serbian army \nparticipated in the Serb attack on Bihac. But since there was no proof \nof Serbian complicity, the sanctions easing was extended.\n  Two weeks ago, U.N. monitors were temporarily barred from a Serbian \nairfield during a time when U.N. troops in northern Bosnia observed \nhelicopters travel from Serbia to Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia. \nOnce again, Serbia created a fact--continued assistance to the Bosnian \nSerbs--for which there was no documentary proof.\n  Now it appears from press reports that Milosevic has rejected this \nlatest Contact Group offer, just as the Serbs have refused earlier \noffers--in which the United States has concurred--to effectively \nlegitimize Serbian gains from aggression in exchange for promises to \ncease fighting.\n  But even if Milosevic were to agree, there is no reason to believe \nthat he would honor a new pledge to cease supporting Serbian aggression \nin Bosnia now any more than he has any previous similar promise. And \neven if Milosevic were to accept the Contact Group offer, this would \nnot necessarily persuade the Croatian or Bosnian Serbs to accept the \npeace plans. Both are well supplied at the moment. They need only wait \nfor a few months until Milosevic finds a way to renew his support, as \nhe has always done.\n  The Contact Group's offer to Milosevic was objectionable from the \n[[Page S2978]] outset because it was immoral. It was an expression of \nweakness and indecision on the part of five of the strongest and most \nprincipled nations on Earth. It remains wrong on the grounds of realism \nand practicality, not just because Milosevic rejected it, but because \nit would not work even if he changed his mind.\n  The further we go down the path of appeasement in the Balkans, the \nmore obvious it becomes that not only does this policy offer no hope of \nresolving the Bosnian tragedy, it demeans the role of the United States \nin the world. I am more convinced than ever that we must abandon the \npolicy of weakness and appeasement and return to the lift-and-strike \npolicy President Clinton brought into the Oval Office in 1993.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2977-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TURKEY'S CONFIDENT LEADER\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Lally Weymouth had an op-\ned piece in the Washington Post about Turkey's remarkable Prime \nMinister.\n  It's a great tribute to her.\n  The political storms are not easy to weather in Turkey, but one of \nthe things that our friends in Turkey must understand is that an \nimproved relationship with the United States, and much of Western \nEurope, is in the interest of all of us, but it is not likely to happen \nuntil Turkey faces up to the Cyprus question and the Armenia question.\n  I recognize that is easy for a politician of the United States to \nsay, and not easy for a political leader in Turkey to say because of \nthe decades of emotion on these issues.\n  But if the people in the Middle East can get together, even though it \nis not all smooth, and if the people in Northern Ireland can get \ntogether, then it seems to me, the Turks, the Greeks, and the Armenians \nought to be able to work out a better relationship than the one they \nnow have, and that is in the interest of all parties.\n  I ask that the Lally Weymouth column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 28, 1994]\n\n                       Turkey's Confident Leader\n\n                          (By Lally Weymouth)\n\n       In a country where a radical Islamist party is growing in \n     strength, and increasingly women are seen on the streets of \n     major cities wearing the chador, the prime minister is a \n     decidedly modern woman who has surprised the experts with her \n     staying power. From the day 48-year-old Tansu Ciller came to \n     power little over a year ago, analysts have been predicting \n     the fall of her coalition. So far, however, she has managed \n     to prove them wrong.\n       It remains true, however, that virtually every move Ciller \n     makes is controversial. Some Turks criticize her as a \n     disorganized novice; she's an academic-turned-prime minister. \n     Others say she has failed to deal with Turkey's economic \n     crisis; inflation this year is running at 116 percent, and \n     the growth rate is negative.\n       Yet the prime minister appears cool and unflappable as she \n     stops out of a helicopter in Istanbul and enters her palace \n     to talk about Turkey's problems.\n       For one thing, Turdey's relationship with Washington has \n     deteriorated in the post-cold war era. Meanwhile, Ciller has \n     many soldiers deployed fighting terrorists in the southeast \n     of Turkey. On the domestic front, she's engaged in an effort \n     to reschedule a by-election for some national assembly seats, \n     a vote originally scheduled for early December. Experts have \n     been predicting that Ciller's party wouldn't fare well in \n     these elections, since the majority of seats at stake are \n     located in southeast Turkey, where the fundamentalist \n     ``Welfare Party'' is strong.\n       Ciller, however, says confidently, ``We are the majority \n     party in the parliament *  *  * and I think we'll increase \n     that majority. We're going to do much better than ANAP [the \n     other right-of-center party.] I'm secular and democratic and \n     progressive and this is what people want.\n       The central threat to Ciller's party and to all mainstream \n     Turkish parties is the radical Islamist ``Welfare Party.'' \n     The prime minister nevertheless plays down the fundamentalist \n     threat, claiming that the fundamentalists have only 15 or 16 \n     percent of the vote. Indeed, she argues that their core vote \n     is even smaller than that; she believes that Welfare attracts \n     a considerable number of protest voters who are reacting to \n     Turkey's economic problems.\n       Shouldn't her party (the True Path) merge with the other \n     right-of-center party (the Motherland Party)--to offer voters \n     a united front against the fundamentalists? Ciller, who has \n     acquired a populist touch, strikes out at the Motherland \n     Party, calling it elitist, ``the product of the military \n     coup. They had contacts [only] with the upper class,'' says \n     Ciller, claiming that her True Path Party ``represents the \n     peasants and small businessmen, the artisans and free \n     trades--the private sector.'' In the next elections, she \n     predicts, Turkish voters will opt for one party, and ``very \n     likely it's going to be me and my party they will choose.''\n       As Ciller sees it, she's faced with two major problems: an \n     economic crisis and a terror threat. In the economic realm, \n     she's trying to privatize the state sector: ``I'm for a free \n     market economy * * * but we've had problems in the economy \n     because the government sector was so big. The government is \n     in finance, in banking, in manufacture--everywhere.''\n       As for terrorism, when Ciller became prime minister, the \n     Syrian-sponsored PKK terrorists controlled large areas of \n     southeast Turkey. Although she and other Turkish officials \n     have not noticed any dropoff in Syrian support for the terror \n     group, Ciller says she has used her army to regain control \n     over much of the southeast. The prime minister says \n     confidently that factories and schools are open again after \n     having been closed for six years. ``Life is going back to \n     normal * * * and I did it in one year,'' she said. ``We still \n     have problems, but it's a big step in the right direction.''\n       Her government has been criticized for the harsh methods \n     used by the army in fighting the PKK, but Ciller claims she \n     had no choice: ``The fight was not against people living in \n     the southeast [but] against the PKK who were killing the \n     Kurdish and Turkish people without discrimination.''\n       Turning to foreign affairs, Ciller notes that Turkey was a \n     faithful U.S. ally during the Cold War, and cooperated with \n     the United States and its allies in prosecuting the gulf war, \n     shutting down an oil pipeline from Iraq that had produced \n     large revenues for Turkey, thus causing economic hardship.\n       Recently, when Saddam marched toward Kuwait, Ciller said \n     she told President Clinton that ``we back the U.S. 100 \n     percent and that I would provide any help the president would \n     ask.''\n       Yet she hesitates when it comes to the question of renewing \n     ``Operation Provide Comfort''--the program started by the \n     United States and the international community to aid the \n     Kurds in northern Iraq. ``My people have hesitations about \n     Provide Comfort because they feel it might help separate \n     northern Iraq from the rest of the country,'' she said. ``We \n     feel the territorial integrity of Iraq should be \n     maintained.''\n       Ciller has endeavored to warn Washington about Russia's \n     aggressive posture. ``We know what is going on there * * * \n     and we cannot close our eyes to the fact * * * that there are \n     forces within Russia who want to go back to the old empire, \n     to the old ways * * *. Aggression should be stopped--be it in \n     Bosnia, in Azerbaijan or Kuwait.''\n       Tansu Ciller is looking to the future. She plans to guide \n     Turkey into the Customs Union of the European Union. Then, \n     she wants Turkey to play some role in the Middle East peace \n     process. Moreover, she wants to aid the Turkic Republics of \n     the former Soviet Union emerge into independence.\n       But, says the prime minister, ``we need help.'' She does; \n     she also deserves it.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/22/senate-section/article/S2978-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2978-S2983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RULES OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

An unclassified \n     version of each report may be made available to the public at \n     the discretion of the select committee. Nothing herein shall \n     be construed as requiring the public disclosure in such \n     reports of the names of individuals engaged in intelligence \n     activities for the United States or the divulging \n     of intelligence methods employed or the sources of \n     information on which such reports are based or the amount of \n     funds authorized to be appropriated for intelligence \n     activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters within \n     the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5.

The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee\n      which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates \n     the constitutional rights of such person or persons. \n     Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent such \n     committee from publicly disclosing any such information in \n     any case in which such committee determines the national \n     interest in the disclosure of such information clearly \n     outweighs any infringement on the privacy of any person or \n     persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the \n     executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall notify the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such \n     five-day period, the President, personally in writing, \n     notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of \n     such information, provides his reasons therefor, and \n     certifies that the threat to national interest of the United \n     States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it \n     outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may, \n     by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration. The \n     committee shall not publicly disclose such information \n     without leave of the Senate.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the information of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined\n      should not be disclosed shall be made available to any \n     person by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate \n     except in a closed session of the Senate or as provided in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which the committee or which Members of the Senate received \n     such information under this subsection, shall disclose such \n     information except in a closed session of the Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on \n     Standards and Conduct\\1\\ to investigate any unauthorized \n     disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer \n     or employee of the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and \n     to report to the Senate concerning any allegation which it \n     finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct\\1\\ shall release to such individual at the conclusion \n     of its investigation a summary of its investigation together \n     with its findings. If, at the conclusion of its \n     investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct\\1\\ determines that there has been a significant \n     breach of confidentiality or unauthorized disclosure by a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall report \n     its findings to the Senate and recommend appropriate action \n     such as censure, removal from committee membership, or \n     expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a Member, or \n     removal from office or employment or punishment for contempt, \n     in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       [[Page S2983]] Sec. 10.
