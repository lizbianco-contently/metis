Mr. President, in 1987, a study was made of a major bridge \nconnecting my State of Kentucky and the State of Indiana. It was \ndetermined--this was on a major highway--that the bridge's life would \nbe no more than 15 years as it related to the ability to carry major \nloads. At that time, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson decided that he would do \neverything he could to replace that bridge, and $10 million of Kentucky \nmoney was put up front.\n  To make a long story short, the people of that area approached then \nCongressman William H. Natcher, who was on the Appropriations Committee \nin the House, and was chairman a little bit later of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the House. And after much study and discussion, in order \nto speed up the ability to have the funds as it related to that \nparticular bridge, it was decided that it should become a demonstration \nproject. Otherwise, it could have been delayed for a long, long time. \nThe bridge was then designated, through Congressman Natcher's effort, \nas a demonstration project, and the construction started through the \ndesign, and almost 7 miles of road now has been built. That road has \nbeen built up to the river bank. The approach has been built on the \nIndiana side. And two piers have been built in the middle of the Ohio \nRiver.\n  Mr. President, Congressman Natcher was an unusual individual. Using \nhis influence in the Appropriations Committee, he could have funded \nthis bridge up front, some $80 million, the State paying the balance. \nBut instead of doing that, Congressman Natcher would only take what was \nnecessary for that one 12-month period, leaving the balance of the \nmoney then for his colleagues on the committee to use as they saw \nnecessary.\n  Unfortunately, the death of Congressman Natcher eliminated a powerful \nvoice and one who could be depended upon to fund the bridge. After the \ndemonstration projects were eliminated on the House side and on the \nSenate side, Congressman Natcher was able to get some money in the bill \nas it related to appropriations and directed a line item for this \nparticular bridge. After Congressman Natcher's untimely and unfortunate \ndeath, no funds were included on the House side as it related to the \nbridge.\n  I worked with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee here in \nthe Senate. We were able to make a modest contribution to the \nconstruction.\n  Now we have a budget going through the House and Senate with not one \nthin dime in there for that bridge.\n  As I said, there has been a lot of work done, four lanes now, for 7 \nmiles on the Kentucky side, right up to the river bank. On the other \nside, the approach has been constructed by the State of Indiana. Two \npiers stick out of the Ohio River. We say, no, we are not going to \nfinish or complete that bridge, with $58 million already expended.\n  I have an amendment I wanted to put on reconciliation to fund the \nbridge because it is a very necessary bridge because we are getting \nclose to the day when the present bridge will not be able to carry \ntraffic. That means trucks will have to go at least 100 miles out of \ntheir way in order to make deliveries in order to serve our area.\n  It is very important to the economic development of both the northern \npart of western Kentucky and the southern \n\n[[Page S15596]]\n\npart of Indiana, a very key economic development tool, the life of that \nparticular area.\n  In checking, Mr. President, on this particular amendment, I \nunderstand that the Budget Committee--which has the right to do so--\nwould make a point of order against my amendment and that it would \nrequire 60 votes, a supermajority, in order for me to pass the \namendment. Of course, I know I cannot do that.\n  There are things in this life that you realize cannot be done. You \naccept that and move on. Well, I accept this for the moment. I accept \nthis for the moment. We are going to revisit this question time and \ntime again because it is an abomination for a major highway to have a \nmajor bridge constructed to a point--two piers sticking out of the Ohio \nRiver--and not a dime to complete it.\n  My State is not a wealthy State, but the money is available by the \nState to pay for its part, and it has paid more than its part in the \ndesignation of the highway to the bridge and the four-lane facility, \nand the bridge will be a four-lane facility and has been recognized as \none of the outstanding designs for not only design but safety that we \nhave had in this country.\n  Mr. President, I regret the attitude of the Budget Committee. At \nleast I thought I might have a fighting chance to be able to secure the \nfunds for this bridge. However, if the Members on the other side stick \ntogether, then I have no chance.\n  I just wanted the record to reflect this morning that my constituents \nand those in Indiana are being denied infrastructure, that $58 million \nof our tax dollars have been spent, and they say, ``No, we will not \nbuild the rest of it.'' It seems to me that it is no longer a \ndemonstration project, with $58 million having been spent, the piers \nbeing built in the river, and the span now is all that is lacking.\n  This new majority here in the Congress has said to my people, ``We \nare not going to finish it. It is up to you.'' They even reduced the \nfunds to my State by some $45 million for this fiscal year compared to \nlast fiscal year, and they say, ``Just take it out of your funds and \nbuild it.''\n  Well, that is not easy to swallow. I do not intend to see my people \ndenied something that is real, something that is necessary, and \nsomething I do not think you could hold fault with, take umbrage with, \nbecause of its need, and we are in the position which we are in.\n  Mr. President, I will file my amendment. I will not call it up. I \nwant it to be on record. It will be there. I will offer it this \nafternoon, at least file it at the desk and let my colleagues know of \nmy interest and how much damage they are doing to the commerce from \nsouth to north that goes through Tennessee, Kentucky, on into Indiana, \nthat hooks up with interstate highways.\n  It will cause major economic devastation to our area. Many companies \nthat have built there, that have come there, have been depending on \nthis mode of transportation because trucks are important to the new \ndevelopment of new businesses that have come into that area.\n  Mr. President, again, I regret that the majority has said to my \npeople and those in southern Indiana that we are just going to let the \npiers stick out of the river like two sore spots and not complete the \nbridge.\n  Mr. President, I imagine my 5 minutes are up. I know the Chair is \npatient, and I appreciate that, but I did want the record to reflect \nthat I am very disappointed in the way that the constituents in Indiana \nand Kentucky have been treated in this particular budget for this \nparticular item.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15595-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15596-S15597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will begin deliberating \nsomething called the budget reconciliation bill, which for most \nAmericans is a term that does not mean very much. The reconciliation \nbill means reconciling spending on Federal programs to the terms of the \nbudget agreement that was agreed to earlier this year by the Congress.\n  The reconciliation bill is probably one of the most significant \npieces of legislation that has been considered in this Chamber in \nseveral decades. Yet we were provided with the reconciliation bill late \nyesterday afternoon.\n  For purposes of illustrating what the Senate is going to be \nconsidering, this bill is contained in these two volumes, about 2,000 \npages of legislation. It is 1,949 pages, to be exact, and was delivered \nlate yesterday to our desks.\n  Because there was a World Series game last night and I was \npreoccupied, unfortunately, until the 11th inning of that game--until \nquarter to 1 in the morning--I did try to muddle my way through these \n2,000 pages but without great success. This is not a very good way to \nlegislate.\n  However, I want to make two points about this bill. First, even \nthough there will be a lot of criticism back and forth, and much of it \njustifiable, we should recognize that there are some provisions in this \nbill on which both political parties agree. There are things in this \nreconciliation bill that make a lot of sense, and I commend the \nmajority party for a number of things that they intend to do. For \ninstance, we do need to cut spending.\n  There are a number of areas of spending cuts offered by the majority \nparty for which I say to them, ``Good job; I support you.'' There are \nareas here where there is agreement. The American people in most cases \nhear only about where we disagree --for good reason, because there is \nno need to stand up and debate for hours about an issue where there's \nalready agreement. In those areas where we agree, I think we should \nrecognize there has been some good work done, bringing some of this to \nthe floor of the Senate. I commend the people who worked to do that.\n  I do note, however, that some of the proposals in this bill are very \ntroublesome and those are the ones that will engender a substantial \namount of debate.\n  One of my colleagues took to the floor yesterday, and I am sure it \ntook a fair amount of courage to do so. Senator Specter spoke at length \nabout this reconciliation bill, and one thing he said struck me. He \nsaid, and I am paraphrasing, ``I have concern that the tax cuts are \nunfair or at least give the perception of unfairness.'' Senator Specter \nsaid, ``I express this concern because much of the pain of the spending \ncuts goes to the elderly, the young, the infirm, while allowing tax \ncuts for corporate America and those in higher brackets.''\n  It is not often that someone in the Chamber speaks in such an \nunvarnished way. I am sure it was not easy for Senator Specter to do, \nbecause I do not think that is the prevailing message on that side of \nthe aisle. Yet that is what is in these 2,000 pages.\n  It seems to me that, while containing some good recommendations and \nsome commendable work, this bill is also a vehicle making profound \nchanges in Medicare and Medicaid. It is also going to make it harder \nfor middle-income parents to send their kids to college. It represents \na set of priorities that I think Senator Specter properly says will \nimpose most of the burden on lower income folks and will bestow most of \nthe benefits on those who are very privileged in our country.\n  There is reason for us to be having a disagreement if we each believe \nin a different approach. I happen to agree that we should cut spending, \nbut I do think there are some areas of spending that are more important \nthan others. I personally do not support the star wars program. I do \nnot think we have to build 20 more B-2 bombers at $30 billion. I could \ngo through a whole list of items I think we should cut. But I do think \nit is valuable to keep the Head Start Program running and fully funded. \nI do not think it is wise to kick 55,000 kids off Head Start. I think \nit is valuable to keep kids in Head Start. That is a priority of mine. \nThis is going to be a debate over the next 3 or 4 days about \npriorities.\n  Again, I have said this several times in the last couple of weeks, \nbut people should not lament the fact that we are debating and \naggressively disagreeing in this Chamber. The way you reach compromise \nis to take different positions that you might believe in very strongly, \ndebate them aggressively, and from that debate comes compromise. My \nhope is that there will be a compromise on this reconciliation bill \nafter these 2,000 pages are most likely passed by the Congress without \n\n[[Page S15597]]\n\nmy vote and then vetoed by the President of the United States. \nFollowing that veto, there must follow, by necessity, some kind of \ncompromise. This system is predicated on compromise.\n  I think this is a sign of strength. We come to the floor. We discuss \n2,000 pages. It is not a sign of strength that we get 2,000 pages in \nthe late afternoon and are told, ``By the way, we will start in the \nmorning.'' That is not the right way to do it.\n  But we will have, I think, in the next few days, a pretty aggressive \ndebate about priorities, and I hope at the end, after this bill is \nvetoed, we will come back to another set of priorities that better \nrepresents this country's interests.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is a sign of strength just to be able to lift this \nmonstrosity. Does anybody in this Senate know what is in this bill; \n1,949 pages? We will be flying deaf, dumb, and blind, because we do not \nknow what we are voting on here. I suppose there are a few members of \nthe Budget Committee who will know something about it, but the rest of \nus, though, do not. It is a monstrosity. It is an abomination. And we \nhave all of 20 hours--20 hours for debate, for amendments, motions, et \ncetera. It is ridiculous.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I could not agree more with the Senator. Again, I think \nthis will be vetoed and perhaps after that, we will have a more orderly \nprocess that results in better priorities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as soon as Senator Daschle or Senator Exon \nare on the floor, I will call up the reconciliation package, but I will \nawait their arrival and go ahead and make my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15596-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15597-S15598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 31 years ago this Friday, Ronald Reagan \ndelivered a nationally televised speech that began his career in \npolitics. The speech was called ``A Time for Choosing.''\n  Ronald Reagan made clear that the choice facing America was not one \nbetween right or left--rather it was one between up or down.\n  More than three decades later, this Congress now faces that same \nchoice.\n  We can either go down the path of the status quo--a path that will \nlead America into a downward spiral of bigger government, higher \ndeficits, more taxes, and a financially bankrupt Medicare system.\n  Or we can move America up to a brighter future, a future where our \nchildren and grandchildren are free from staggering deficits. A future \nwhere power flows from our States to Washington, and not the other way \naround. A future with a strong and secure Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, I believe the choice is clear.\n  For this historic Republican Congress, the vote on the reconciliation \nbills will be a defining moment. It will be the moment when the \nAmerican public will see that we are not business as usual. We are not \nthe status quo. Rather, this Congress is one that keeps its promises to \nthe American people.\n\n  There will be plenty of debate in the coming days, and I know the \nAmerican people will be listening closely. Judging from what has been \ncoming out of the Whit House lately, I know they will hear a lot of \nrhetoric, and a lot of scare tactics.\n  But I believe that in the end, they will see through this \nsmokescreen, and they will see the truth.\n  And the truth is that the Republican budget contained in this bill is \na realistic, thoughtful budget blueprint for America. The truth is that \nit will ratchet down the deficit by roughly $30 billion a year during \nthe next 7 years. The truth is that it will balance the budget in the \nyear 2002. And the truth is that it is the only real honest budget plan \nbefore the American people.\n  The truth also is that a balanced budget means a brighter future for \nour children and grandchildren. Our national debt is now so huge that a \nchild born in 1995 will pay more than $187,000 in taxes over his or her \nlifetime just to pay their share of the debt. We owe our children a far \nbetter future.\n  A balanced budget will create lower interest rates, which means that \nmore Americans will be able to own a house, buy a car, or go to \ncollege, or to borrow money. Lower interest rates also mean business \nwill have more money to invest and hire workers.\n  The truth also is that the American people are more able to decide \nhow to spend their hard earned money than are Government bureaucrats.\n  And with the $245 billion tax cut contained in this bill, millions of \nAmerican families will have more money to spend. Our $500-per-child tax \ncredit will mean that over the coming years, families will have \nthousands and thousands more dollars to spend on college tuition or \nbraces for their kids.\n  We will include in the Record during the debate how such money will \nbe coming to each State, such as my own State of Kansas. There are a \nlot of families with children. They are not rich. But a $500 tax \ncredit--if you have two or three children, that is $1,500. They can \nspend it better on their families than any bureaucrat I know of in \nWashington, DC, or any Member of Congress, for that matter, on either \nside of the aisle.\n  By rewarding those who save and invest, our capital gains tax cut \nwill also create jobs and opportunity.\n  There is an undeniable truth that the President has tried to ignore \nfor months and months. And that is the fact that three of the \nPresident's own Cabinet members tell us that if no action is taken, \nMedicare will be completely broke by the year 2002.\n  This bill makes the tough decisions necessary to preserve, protect, \nand strengthen Medicare. And we have been aided a great deal in this \neffort by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New Hamphsire, \nSenator Gregg.\n  We do it by slowing its rate of growth, and by giving seniors more \noptions in selecting their health care.\n  And despite the phony talk you may hear of ``cutting Medicare,'' the \nRepublican plan will increase Medicare spending from $4,800 per \nbeneficiary in 1995 to $6,700 per beneficiary in 2002.\n  Let me repeat: The Republican plan will increase Medicare spending \nfrom $4,800 per beneficiary in 1995 to $6,700 per beneficiary in 2002.\n  I know that during the next few days, some of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will be painting horrible pictures. They will tell us \nthat passage of this bill means we are turning our backs on children, \non seniors, and on the disabled. They will repeat it again and again. \nBut no matter how many times they repeat it, it does not make it true.\n  Mr. President, I wish all Americans could read the column by budget \nexpert James Glassman that was printed in the October 17 edition of the \nWashington Post. Mr. Glassman's column--and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record following my remarks--makes clear the \nfalsehoods contained in some of the emotional rhetoric we have been \nhearing.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. Glassman writes that under the Republican plan, Federal \nspending will rise between 1995 and 2002 by $358 billion--or 24 \npercent. It is going to rise 24 percent over the next 7 years. Is that \ndevastation? Is that cutting programs? No. Only in Washington would a \n$358 billion increase be called a cut.\n  The media bought onto the President's spin for the most part; they \nkeep talking about it. Turn on NBC, and Katie Couric is talking about \n``big cuts, big cuts.'' She does not know anything about the budget. \nAll she is picking up on is the liberal spin which the Democrats have \nbeen dishing out there with no facts, no effort to save Medicare, to \nbalance the budget, or tax cuts; a lot of talk, but that is about all.\n  Mr. Glassman makes very clear that President Clinton was absolutely \noff the mark when he said--and I quote--``I will not let balancing the \nbudget \n\n[[Page S15598]]\n\nserve as a cover for destroying the social compact.''\n  The truth is, as Mr. Glassman writes, if the budget becomes law, the \nsocial compact will actually be strengthened, for not only will the \nGovernment keep its commitments to the elderly and the poor, it will \nalso meet an even more important obligation to the public--the \nobligation to spend no more than it takes in.\n  Throughout this process, on every major issue contained in this \nlegislation, the Speaker and I have invited President Clinton to join \nwith us in giving the American people the fundamental change they want. \nInstead of sitting down with us, however, the President has flown \naround the country making speeches, playing politics, taking polls, and \navoiding the work and making policy decisions. The President apparently \nbelieves that the American people do not really want a balanced budget. \nHe believes that the people are so dependent on the Federal Government \nthat they will not tolerate slowing its rate of growth. He believes the \nAmerican people are willing to sacrifice the future of their children \nand grandchildren so that the Government can continue its free spending \nways, and he is wrong, and he will find out that he is wrong. And one \nof these days he is going to find out how to contact the majority \nleader in the Senate and the Speaker of the House, and when he does we \nare willing to sit down with the President of the United States.\n  But right now it is all rhetoric. It is all politics. It is all \npolls. It is all scaring seniors, scaring veterans, scaring children, \nand all a week before Halloween. Maybe by the time Halloween comes he \nwill have everybody in a state of frenzy and we will be in that funk \nthe President talked about. He said America is in a funk. America is \nnot in a funk. They want fundamental change, and we are about to give \nthem fundamental change. We would like to do it with the President's \ncooperation.\n  I am reminded of the words of Winston Churchill who said:\n\n       We have not journeyed all the way across the centuries, \n     across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, \n     because we are made of sugar candy.\n\n  I say to President Clinton: Mr. President, the American people are \nnot made of sugar candy. They are far stronger and wiser than you \nthink.\n  I also say that this Republican Congress is not made of sugar candy. \nWe promised we would balance the budget, and we will. We promised we \nwould cut taxes, and we will. We promised we would preserve and protect \nand strengthen Medicare, and we will. We promised we would have welfare \nreform, and we will. October 1995 is a time for choosing, and I invite \nall Senators on both sides of the aisle and all Americans, regardless \nof their party, regardless of their philosophy, to stand with us as we \nmove our country up to a future of unlimited hope, freedom, and \nopportunity. That is what this debate is going to be all about.\n  There will be some policy differences, obviously--some legitimate \npolicy differences, but there will also be a lot of politics, and we \nprepared for that. And I just urge my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, this is the most historic moment in my memory in the Congress of \nthe United States. And I have been here for some time. Never before \nhave we tried to bring about such fundamental change. It is going to be \nup to us. We have the majority. It is our responsibility. And we need \n53 Republicans standing together when the final vote comes.\n  So I urge my colleagues to pay attention. I know that both Senators \nDomenici and Exon will be explaining in detail all the different \namendments and their opposition or support for the different \namendments.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 17, 1995]\n\n                           The No-Cut Budget\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       Despite what you've read and heard, the Republican budget--\n     now moving toward passage in its final, ``reconciliation'' \n     form--does not cut total federal spending, nor does it cut \n     tax revenues. Not by a long shot.\n       An illuminating way to look at this budget is to take what \n     the government actually spent and raised over the past seven \n     years and compare it to what Republicans propose to spend and \n     raise over the next seven years. The results:\n       Spending will increase by $2.6 trillion.\n       Revenues will increase by $3.3 trillion.\n       These figures may surprise you; they run counter to what \n     you've seen in the press, which continually uses the word \n     ``cuts'' when referring to both spending and taxes. But in \n     the misleading baseline-budgeting nomenclature of Washington, \n     a cut is a reduction from a previously projected increase.\n       The real spending and revenue numbers show something quite \n     different: that the Republican revolution is more modest than \n     both Republicans and Democrats claim.\n       During the seven years from 1989 to 1995, federal spending \n     totaled $9.5 trillion. During the next seven years, the \n     congressional budget agreement calls for spending of $12.1 \n     trillion.\n       As for revenues: During the seven years just past, the \n     government collected $7.9 trillion in taxes. Over the next \n     seven years, the Republican plan will raise $11.2 trillion in \n     taxes--even taking into account the $500-per-child credit and \n     GOP changes to capital gains that will reduce expected tax \n     revenues by $245 billion.\n       If Congress did not make any changes to the budget, \n     spending would rise by 37 percent and revenues by 44 percent, \n     the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates. But under \n     the GOP seven-year plan, spending will rise by 27 percent and \n     tax revenues by 41 percent.\n       Stop and think about those numbers. They seem to represent \n     a reasonable path toward an objective that most Americans \n     share: a zero deficit.\n       In the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1995, the \n     government ran a deficit of $161 billion. If nothing is done, \n     CBO says the annual deficit will continue to rise in 1996 and \n     each successive year, reaching $256 billion in 2002.\n       Any business or household facing such a prospect would \n     quickly reduce its spending. But the federal government \n     doesn't have to do that--mainly because the U.S. economy, \n     even growing at a moderate 2.4 percent a year, is so powerful \n     that it will generate vastly higher tax revenues.\n       The aggregate numbers I've just cited--1989-95 vs. 1996-\n     2002--are probably the best way to look at budget changes. \n     But, in case you think I'm pulling a fast one, let's look \n     simply at two specific years: the one just past (fiscal 1995) \n     and the one in which the congressional resolution requires a \n     zero deficit (fiscal 2002).\n       In 1995, federal spending was $1.5 trillion. If current \n     policies were to continue, spending, according to the CBO, \n     would be $2.1 trillion in 2002. That's an increase of $600 \n     billion, or 40 percent. Under the GOP plan, spending will \n     rise between 1995 and 2002 by $358 billion, or 24 percent. \n     (That's slightly ahead of inflation if prices increase 3 \n     percent annually.)\n       Only in Washington would a $358 billion increase be called \n     a ``cut.'' In fact, Republicans who want to sound as if \n     they're making big changes and Democrats who want to frighten \n     the public both say that the GOP budget ``cuts'' total about \n     $1 trillion. This absurd figure is derived by taking the \n     difference between the CBO's projection and the Republicans' \n     proposed spending for each year from 1996 to 2002, then \n     adding all seven numbers up.\n       Consider Medicare. Politicians talk about $271 billion in \n     cuts, but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will \n     be $86 billion higher than in 1995, an increase of more than \n     6 percent annually.\n       The real question for voters assessing the GOP budget is \n     where the additional $358 billion in federal spending in 2002 \n     is going. The answer is entitlements: Social Security will \n     cost $146 billion more in 2002 than in 1995, Medicare (for \n     the elderly) will cost $86 billion more and Medicaid (for the \n     poor) will cost $35 billion more.\n       Miscellaneous entitlements (food stamps, the earned income \n     tax credit, military retirement, etc.) will rise $63 billion. \n     Add interest on the national debt (there's nothing we can do \n     about that one), and the total additional spending exceeds \n     $358 billion.\n       By deciding to preserve and increase these entitlements, \n     Congress had nothing left for increasing the \n     ``discretionary'' side of the budget, where outlays will \n     total $515 billion in 2002, down from $548 billion in 1995.\n       Defense comprises most of discretionary spending, and it \n     will be flat at roughly $270 billion. Transportation spending \n     will fall from $39 billion to $32 billion; education and \n     training will drop from $39 billion to $35 billion; foreign \n     aid and other spending on international affairs from $21 \n     billion to $15 billion.\n       Intelligent folks can differ on where to spend the \n     government's money. Maybe defense should be cut and \n     transportation increased.\n       But once the nation has decided to balance the budget, keep \n     Social Security intact and pare back expected tax revenues \n     slightly (and voters made those decisions last November), the \n     choices are pretty limited.\n       President Clinton knows this very well, but with a devotion \n     to the first-person singular exceeded only by Sen. Phil \n     Gramm's, he said on Friday, ``I will not let balancing the \n     budget serve as a cover for destroying the social compact.''\n       The truth is that, if Congress's budget becomes law, the \n     social compact will actually be strengthened. Not only will \n     the government keep its commitments to the elderly and the \n     poor on health care, it will also meet an even more important \n     obligation to the public that it abrogated 30 years ago--to \n     spend no more than it takes in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15597-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15599-S15606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S15599]]\n\n\n             THE BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1357, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1357) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 105 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1996.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be recognized \nfor up to 60 minutes for debate only and Senator Exon for up to 30 \nminutes for debate only.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, I would like to make a \nclarification on this, if I might, and I do not think we have a \ndifference of opinion on this.\n  It is the desire of the majority to move as quickly as we can into \nthe amendment process, and as Senator Domenici knows--and I suspect he \nhas told the majority leader--we are working to try to cut these down \nto move this proposition along. However, since we are limited to 10 \nhours each, as I understand the unanimous-consent request that has just \nbeen offered by the majority leader, there would be 1 hour off of the \nRepublican 10 hours, if we agree to this, and a half an hour on our \nside, which would mean that you are giving up an hour; we are giving up \na half an hour of our 10. Is that right?\n  Mr. DOLE. We would like to have you give up more but we will settle \nfor that.\n  Mr. EXON. Let us not press it at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me just say--and I am going to depart here. I first \nwant to say I hope we can work out some agreement so that we are not \nhaving 50 votes here before final passage when you do not have any time \nto debate the amendments. And I think I could speak for my colleagues \non this side that we would be prepared, if there were a number of basic \nmajor amendments the Democrats wanted to offer period, we might be able \nto convince our colleagues not to second degree those amendments, if \nthere were no other amendments following that. And I know that is being \nworked on, and we hope to reinvestigate that shortly after noon.\n  I now have to leave, but I would be happy to work with the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. We have in the past. Maybe we can this time around.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, we have no objection to \nSenator Exon's restatement of the proposition so long as it is not \nintended to in any way change the allocation other than this hour and \nthis half-hour.\n  Mr. EXON. No, no.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not agreeing on different allotments of time or \ndifferent treatment of amendment times.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, would Senator Exon like to proceed with \npart of his time?\n  Mr. EXON. For clarification of all, I was advised the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, would be speaking, as I understand it, during part of the 1 \nhour that the Senator has reserved. As a result of that, I have alerted \nSenator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, and \nbasically I would simply say that the opening remarks beginning on this \nside would be essentially 15 minutes for myself and 15 minutes for the \nranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, which I think will basically \ntake up most of the half hour. Then it is up to the Senator to allot \nthe time on that side.\n  Is the chairman suggesting that he would like to have me proceed with \nmy opening statement at this time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I think so other than if the Senator would give me \n3 minutes for a little kind of house-cleaning work.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. And I would ask unanimous consent that this \nhousekeeping work not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following staff of \nboth the majority and minority on the Budget Committee be permitted to \nremain on the Senate floor during consideration of S. 1357 and that the \nlist be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Majority Staff\n\n       Karen Bilton, Lisa Cieplak, Jim Hearn, Keith Hennessy, Bill \n     Hoagland, Carol McGuire, Anne Miller, Roy Phillips, Denise G. \n     Ramonas, Cheri Reidy, Ricardo Rel, J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npresence and use of small electronic calculators, as we have done \nheretofore, be permitted in the Chamber during the consideration of \nthis measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 1 minute off my time at this point and \nthen I will yield. To Republican Senators, this is, as I understand it \nfor the last few weeks, a very important couple of days. Many of you \nwant to speak on subject matters before the Senate and some want to \njust speak about a balanced budget. I want to say to all the Republican \nSenators I am going to do my very best to accommodate you, but I would \ntell Senators that it is not easy to just give you a time when you want \nit. So I would hope that Senators would be flexible, and if we call on \nyou, if you turn in your names, if you really want to speak and if we \ncall on you, you be able to do it on a half-hour's notice or so because \nI just cannot arrange the floor in any other way.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator proceeds, will the Senator engage me \nin a little dialog about our efforts to see if we can better manage?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe, Senator Exon, we are going to have some time \nduring this hour and a half, you and I, and perhaps your leader and I \nunderstand you have a small task force.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have asked our leader if we could use his office, so \nI wonder if maybe looking at the clock, if you could arrange a meeting \nat maybe 20 after, 25 after. You would be finished speaking. And we \nwould have our side start going. Could we meet in the leader's office \nabout trying to reduce the number of amendments and make some \naccommodation?\n  Mr. EXON. It sounds reasonable. Are you suggesting the timeframe of \n11:20?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I said 10 but let us say 11:20.\n  Mr. EXON. Agreed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make sure in this dialog, in this exchange that \neverybody understands----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will Senator Roth have spoken by then?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope so. We have sent word for him to come.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Everybody knows hopefully that the Senator from New \nMexico on most matters coming before the Senate that he has anything to \ndo with tries to be fair, and I truly intend to do that. But I do want \nto state right up front that there are many Republican Senators, if not \nevery one, who do not want to have the Senate go through 50 or 60 votes \non single targeted issues.\n  I might just suggest right up front, for those who are going to do \nthat and insist, with the Senator's leadership, that they are going to \ndo that, they will not get a vote on their amendment. I mean, they can \nbe assured that they will not, because we will indeed \n\n[[Page S15600]]\n\nsecond degree those kinds of amendments. And we have as much stamina, I \nthink--I do not know--as much stamina as the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. EXON. And more votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And more votes. The Senator got it. That is very \nimportant. We only need 50. Let us make sure that is understood on both \nsides.\n  On the other hand, we are meeting to try to see if we can accommodate \na more amicable approach. And let us hope that we can. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague. I want to \ncontinue to work together. We have sharp differences on these things, \nbut I think over the period of time for the 18 years that we have \nserved on the committee together we have been accommodating to each \nother. I think that is the desire.\n  I will simply say that the chairman of the committee has indicated \nthat people on that side are very much concerned about how we proceed \non this. That is true on this side. Unfortunately, with the time \nconstraints that we have, with the mammoth bill we have before us, the \nSenator from Nebraska is going to have to be an unpopular traffic cop, \ntrying to direct traffic to say no, since we do not have time. But at \nthis time I yield myself 15 minutes, and ask that I be notified if I \nexceed that time.\n  Mr. President, there was a marriage on Monday, a marriage that did \nnot quite make the wedding notices. As my colleagues know, the \nRepublican majority on the Budget Committee generously provided $224 to \n$245 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and wedded it \nofficially to the $270 billion in Medicare cuts. The seniors of America \npaid for that wedding, and they will pay and pay and pay again over the \nyears. The Congressional Budget Office issued the marriage license. In \nan October 20 letter to me, CBO Director O'Neill wrote that without the \ndrastic cuts in Medicare, the tax break for the wealthy would not have \nbeen possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. The happy couple of tax breaks and Medicare cuts are now \nbefore the Senate in the form of the reconciliation bill. They are \nasking for our blessing. We should not give it. This marriage should be \nannulled. Had the question been asked, ``Is there anyone present who \nobjects to the joining of these two, speak now or forever hold your \npeace?'' I would have objected.\n  Mr. President, it has been almost 4 months since the Senate passed \nthe conference report on the budget resolution which begat this \nreconciliation bill, a bill that has now grown to grotesque \nproportions.\n  This reconciliation bill was created behind closed doors. It is the \nfirst of the illegitimate births of this union. By comparison, it makes \n``Rosemary's Baby'' look like a dream child. They brought it out into \nthe light of the day for the first time at midday last Friday. There \nwere no hearings on Medicare. There were no hearings on Medicaid. There \nwere no hearings on the cuts of the earned income tax credit. There \nwere no hearings on the cuts in education. There were no hearings on \nhow this budget cuts a huge swath like a tornado through rural America.\n  Last Friday, during the markup of this reconciliation bill, I asked \nif we could not hear from just four witnesses who could describe how \nthis Republican budget would do great violence to their lives. I asked \nfor an hour. That is just 1 minute for each $4.5 billion in Medicare \ncuts. But my offer was spurned.\n  Why the hurry, Mr. President? Why is the majority so breathless about \nsealing the deal on this budget? Why are they now moving in convoy \nfashion to pass this bill? The great pitcher, Satchel Paige, might have \nhad the answer. He once said, ``Don't look back. Something might be \ngaining on you.'' Something is gaining on the Republicans. They are \nhearing footsteps. They are hearing the American people gaining on \nthem. More and more Americans are finding out what is in this monstrous \nbill. And they feel deceived and betrayed.\n  Mr. President, I will speak in a moment about the particulars of this \nreconciliation bill and the terrible hardships that it inflicts. But I \nwould like to take a moment to discuss what I believe is the large \npicture here.\n  When we get into these debates about budget resolutions and budget \nreconciliation bills, Senators can all too easily lose sight--lose \nsight--of the ordinary Americans. The stage overshadows the people on \nit. In this same vein, my colleagues on the other side cannot see \nbeyond the gesture of the moment. They cannot see beyond the \nscaffolding they have erected in this reconciliation bill. They cannot \nsee the people that they will harm. They cannot see the Nation that \nthey are tearing apart. This Republican budget does not speak to the \nAmerican values that I know and the ones that I cherish, values that I \nsee every day in my fellow Nebraskans. The greatest of these values are \nshared sacrifice, fairness, and compassion for our neighbors. That is \nthe social fabric that runs through our great Nation. But this \nRepublican budget is tugging at every thread to unravel it.\n  In spite of the inflated rhetoric, the Republican budget reached a \nshallow bottom in no time at all. Some have called it social Darwinism \nat its shabby worst, I say, where citizens are pitted against citizens, \nyoung against the old, rural Americans against urban Americans.\n  Last week Speaker Gingrich feigned that he wants no class warfare. \nWhat nonsense. It is this bill that fires the first shot of class \nwarfare. It is this bill that goes to war against the working people on \nbehalf of the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, the more this budget is exposed to the sunlight, the \nmore we are finding that this is not the right key to open a \ncomplicated problem which we all agree is necessary--balancing the \nbudget.\n  I am one of the few Senators who has actually balanced budgets and \nused the line-item veto to do it. I did it for 8 years as Governor of \nNebraska. But I say to my colleagues today, this Republican budget is \nnot the way to do it. Tax breaks for the wealthy are writ large all \nover this reconciliation bill. Tax breaks for the wealthy have riveted \nthe attention of the Republicans to the exclusion of everything else. \nTax breaks for the wealthy have established primacy over time-honored \ncommitments to provide a safety net for our fellow citizens.\n  Medicare became the most convenient laboratory for conducting these \ntax breaks. The Republican Medicare plan cuts the program three times \nmore than necessary to keep it solvent through the year 2006, just to \npay the freight for the tax breaks.\n  The Republican reconciliation bill doubles the premiums under part B \nMedicare. It doubles the deductibles under part B. It increases the \nMedicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, all for the tax breaks.\n  And on October 2, in an editorial in the New York Times, the Times \nstates, and I quote:\n\n       Right now, Medicare makes up less than 12 percent of the \n     Federal budget. But Medicare cuts account for more than twice \n     that percentage of the lower spending in the Republican \n     approved budgets over the next 7 years. Not withstanding Mr. \n     Gingrich's appeal, the facts clearly demonstrate that health \n     programs for the elderly are bearing a disproportionate share \n     of the austerity pushed by the Republicans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial that I \nhave referenced in the New York Times be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the shocking truth is that more than 88 \npercent of the Republican mandatory cuts come from means-tested \nprograms, those which serve predominantly low- and moderate-income \nAmericans, and from Medicare, where three-quarters of the beneficiaries \nhave annual incomes under $25,000.\n  A Joint Economic Committee study also concluded that the poorest \nfifth of Americans would shoulder fully half of the proposed program \ncuts, for an average loss of nearly $2,500 per family in the year 2002. \nThere are no breaks for these folks in this Republican bag of tricks.\n\n[[Page S15601]]\n\n  The Republicans trumpet that their tax breaks will benefit all \nAmericans, especially the middle class. The truth, however, sounds a \ndifferent note, and it is definitely sour.\n  Last week, the Joint Committee on Taxation confessed that families \nmaking up to $30,000 a year--and that is about half of all taxpayers--\nwould actually see their taxes go up under the Republican tax plan. \nYes, Mr. President, their taxes would go up. They would pay more for \nincreased Medicare premiums and deductibles. They would pay more for \nnew student loan fees. They would pay more for higher taxes on State \nand local employees. They would pay more for higher contributions for \nGI bill benefits.\n  What about the other side of the gilded reconciliation bill? The \nTreasury Department estimates that nearly half--nearly half--of the \nSenate's tax breaks would go to 12 percent of the American families \nmaking $100,000 a year or more.\n  The New York Times also said, and I quote:\n\n       The Republicans are rushing through Congress the greatest \n     attempt in modern history to reward the wealthy at the \n     expense of the poor.\n\n  Earlier in my statement, I mentioned that the Republicans are not \nonly pitting young against old and rich against the middle class, but \nour rural areas against urban industrialized centers throughout the \nmany States of our great land.\n  This Republican reconciliation bill is a cruel joke, above everything \nelse, upon rural America. More than 9 million rural Americans will pay \nhigher out-of-pocket costs for second-class Medicare programs. The \ntypical rural hospital could find its annual budget cut by a third, \nforcing many to close and causing many physicians to leave and to never \nreturn. Medicaid cuts will eliminate coverage for 2.2 million rural \nAmericans, including 1 million children. Net farm income will decline \nby $9 billion over the next 7 years. And for what, Mr. President? Once \nagain, for the almighty tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  The evidence clearly keeps mounting. It is compelling. It is heart-\nwrenching. This reconciliation bill is wrong for our great Nation. For \nthe good of our Nation, it should be defeated. At a time when we should \nbe formulating a balanced budget that unites America and unites its \npeople, this one only seeks to divide us.\n  We know that this reconciliation bill will be vetoed by the \nPresident. Those of us who reject the extremism of the day, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, should be looking beyond this doomed \nreconciliation bill. We should be looking to a workable alternative, a \ncompromise. We should be looking toward building on the structures and \nvalues of our great Nation, not tearing them down.\n  I have offered before, and I offer again now, to my Republican \ncolleagues: Come, let us reason together and develop a true and \nworkable compromise. If we can stop this Republican juggernaut and stop \nit now, we can get on with fashioning a reasonable formula to balance \nthe budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. EXON. I allocate myself 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. President, if we pass this bill, it will certainly receive a \nPresidential veto, and we will belatedly start all over again.\n  The American woman of letters, Lillian Hellman, once commented: ``I \ncannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year's fabric.''\n  Nor will I, Mr. President. I will vote against this budget, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office on October 18 provided the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee with a projection of \n     the budget deficits or surpluses that would result from \n     enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \n     Budget Committee as of that date. As stated in the letter to \n     Chairman Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-\n     budget surplus of $10 billion in 2002, using the economic and \n     technical assumptions underlying the budget resolution, and \n     assuming the level of discretionary spending specified in \n     that resolution. If the estimated Medicare savings in 1996 \n     through 2002 resulting from the legislation submitted by the \n     Finance Committee were excluded from the calculation, CBO \n     would project a deficit of $82 billion in 2002. Similarly, if \n     any other savings submitted to the Budget Committee were \n     excluded from the calculation, CBO would project a higher \n     deficit.\n       CBO also stated in the letter to the Chairman that the \n     estimated deficit reduction would likely reduce federal \n     interest costs and increase revenues by an amount similar to \n     the fiscal dividend that CBO discussed in its August report, \n     The Economic and Budget Outlook: An Update. If deficit \n     reduction in each year were lower by the amount of the \n     estimated Medicare savings (and the associated debt service), \n     the fiscal dividend would likely be lower than the estimated \n     CBO published in August.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n     June E. O'Neill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 22, 1995]\n\n                      Class Conflict in Washington\n\n       How touching it was for House Speaker Newt Gingrich to \n     appeal for brotherly love at the end of the titanic debate \n     over Medicare last week. ``We want no class warfare,'' he \n     declared. ``We want no conflict between generations.'' Even \n     by Mr. Gingrich's standards, this was a remarkable statement. \n     The Republicans are rushing through Congress the greatest \n     attempt in modern history to reward the wealthy at the \n     expense of the poor. They are also sacrificing the health \n     needs of the elderly to pay for a tax cut for the affluent. \n     Incredible, Mr. Gingrich was accusing the Democrats of \n     formenting class and generational resentments by pointing \n     this out. President Clinton can do no less than veto the \n     Republican legislative package that is roaring toward passage \n     in Congress.\n       We have long argued that Medicare, the health insurance \n     program for elderly Americans, is in need of reform. Many \n     Republican ideas for introducing competition into the health \n     care system and forcing providers to deliver care more \n     efficiently are sound. But the cuts being pushed through \n     Congress are so big they threaten to dry up money for medical \n     training, devastate nursing homes and drive hospitals and \n     doctors away from taking care of Medicare patients. Right \n     now, Medicare makes up less than 12 percent of the Federal \n     budget. But Medicare cuts account for more than twice that \n     percentage of the lower spending in the Republican-approved \n     budgets over the next seven years. Notwithstanding Mr. \n     Gingrich's appeal, the facts clearly demonstrate that health \n     programs for the elderly are bearing a disproportionate share \n     of the austerity pushed by the Republicans.\n       The charge that Democrats have been playing on American \n     resentments has also been sounded by Bob Dole, the Senate \n     majority leader, who recently accused Mr. Clinton of \n     encouraging ``envy and class warfare.'' He made it sound \n     almost Marxist to discuss which classes gain and which lose \n     in any legislation. True, the Democrats are playing the \n     politics of winners and losers,but their criticisms are \n     rooted in a certain reality.\n       It was the Republican-controlled Joint Taxation Committee \n     that acknowledged last week that families making up to \n     $30,000, about half of all taxpayers, would actually see \n     their taxes go up under the tax package heading toward \n     approval in the Senate. The reason is that the Republicans \n     are insisting on scaling back the earned-income tax credit, \n     which goes to low-income workers to keep them out of poverty. \n     The Treasury Department estimates that nearly half the \n     Senate's $43 billion in tax cuts, meanwhile, would go to the \n     12 percent of Americans in families earning $100,000 or more.\n       On the spending side, it takes ideological blinders to \n     argue that Republicans are not waging their budget wars on \n     the poor. The budget bills racing through Congress embody a \n     gargantuan $1.1 trillion in spending cuts over the next seven \n     years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \n     Office. Out of this sum, the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities, a liberal group, estimates that welfare, \n     Medicaid, food stamps, housing and other programs for the \n     poor are being cut by 37 to 47 percent. That is far more than \n     seems fair given that only 21 percent of the Federal budget \n     is spent on the poor.\n       Another way of looking at this is to see how the \n     Republicans are approaching the two biggest health care \n     programs in the country. Medicare is for everyone and \n     Medicaid is for the poor. Both have been growing out of \n     control and have to be reined in. But cost estimates of the \n     Congressional Budget Office show that Medicare is being kept \n     by Republican legislation at a 6.4 percent growth rate in the \n     next several years and Medicaid is being kept as a 4 percent \n     growth rate. There is no way to see this except as a \n     deliberate effort to inflict greater hardship on those \n     delivering health care to the poor.\n       The Republican Congressional handiwork of the last week \n     provides a reminder of a grim truth. It is much easier to \n     destroy something than it is to create it. Reform of many of \n     these programs is surely in order. \n\n[[Page S15602]]\n\n     But reform is certain to be undermined if it is coupled with \n     a reactionary redistribution of government resources.\n       In the coming weeks and months, the House and Senate will \n     be struggling to reconcile their differences and put them in \n     one massive piece of legislation, possibly attaching it to a \n     measure keeping the United States out of default, Mr. Clinton \n     must not be rattled by the threat. If he stands firm, the \n     Republicans will be forced to scale back their assault and \n     confront the reality that a huge and regressive tax cut is \n     inappropriate as a matter of social equity and fiscal common \n     sense.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement, \nwe have almost 1 hour on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 15 minutes, and then I am going to \nexcuse myself for a half hour or so and see what we can negotiate with \nthe Democrats in terms of a more orderly process than confronts us \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, to all those interested in today's debate, let me \nsuggest the other side, including my good friend, Senator Exon, plays \nvery loose with words like ``truth'' and ``right.'' As a matter of \nfact, before this debate is finished, I believe most of the contentions \nabout the poor and about the rich will be dispelled and be disposed of. \nI think the Joint Committee on Taxation will acknowledge before this \nday is out that their estimates of the tax bill were wrong and based on \nerroneous assumptions. I believe we will prove that this is a fair \nbudget.\n  Frankly, for those who think only of 10 days and of the next \nelection, obviously they can come up with something much easier. But we \nare not talking about 10 days and the next election; we are talking \nabout 10 years, we are talking about 50 years, and we are talking about \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Anybody who does not want to do that and wants to just say to \nAmerica, ``Don't worry about it, seniors, don't worry about it; we have \namendments that will leave everything status quo,'' just listen. That \nis how America will fall. That is how America's money will become \nworthless. That is how interest rates will skyrocket. That is how our \nstandard of living, which is already in jeopardy for a lot of things, \nwill come falling and tumbling down. Because if we do not tell the \ntruth about the fact that we are incurring debt at such an outrageous \namount, we are saying we are talking about only 10 days or 6 months, do \nnot worry about 10 years, do not worry about the future, worry about \npolitics.\n  I believe when we are finished and when the President of the United \nStates finally agrees to a real budget, the seniors are going to say, \n``What was this argument all about?'' Medicare will be intact. Seniors \nwill be taken care of across the land and, yes, they may be even \nsurprised. They may decide to join some institutions that will deliver \nservices differently, and they may save money. As a matter of fact, \nthey may find in the next 2 or 3 years that they get more care and \nbetter care than under the Medicare Program we have today.\n  Let me dispose of two items. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska \nsays we are doing all these things to the poor people of the country. I \nassume he is suggesting that we are cutting food stamps, child \nnutrition, AFDC, and that he really means they are being cut.\n  I want to insert in the Record just one simple chart. Food stamps, \nAFDC, child care, child nutrition, SSI, Medicaid, and EITC. In the year \n1996, we will spend $195 billion on those programs. The next year, $202 \nbillion; the next year, $211 billion; the next year, $221 billion; the \nfollowing year, $235 billion. In summary, by the year 2002, these \nprograms, which today are at $195 billion, will be $253 billion. Now, \nthat is not contending anything. It is merely stating the facts of this \nreconciliation bill, as found by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  How about hearings? Just one little statement about hearings. The \nlast time the Democrats controlled this body, they did the President's \nbidding. I believe some of them are sorry they did because, of late, he \nhas suggested they had been duped. He did not want all those taxes you \nall voted for--only $270 billion, the largest tax increase in history. \nHe is suggesting that somebody made him do it. As an aside, I want to \nsay to the Democrats in this institution that that is not only bunk, he \nactually asked for $360 billion; you reduced it to $270 billion, \nbecause he had the Btu tax in there.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Against my better judgment. We reduced it against my \nbetter judgment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Moynihan wanted to keep it higher. This is the \nchronology for the budget process. When they were in control, the \nnumber of hearings held by the then Democrat Budget Committee was 7; \nthe number we held was 22. The number of witnesses who offered \ntestimony in the Senate Budget Committee, throughout their hearings, \nwas 10; we had 110. The number of days the Budget Committee spent in \nmarkup, they had 3; we had 4, giving them more opportunity to express \nthemselves. The number of days spent in conference, they had 6; we had \n18. We make no apologies with reference to hearings. We had plenty of \nhearings and the Budget Committee set the targets.\n  Mr. President, I want to suggest, by using just two quotes, what this \nissue is about. Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and are morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. Do we want to pay our debts, or do \nwe want our children and grandchildren to pay for the Government we \nwant to give to people that we cannot afford?\n  To put it another way, a modern lawyer and thoughtful person on \nAmerica's Constitution, Laurence Tribe, philosophically a liberal \nlawyer from Harvard, said:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we seek somehow to tie our hands so we cannot spend our \n     children's legacy.\n\n  Now, we are bent today and tomorrow on this floor to decide what kind \nof legacy we are going to leave our children--a legacy of debt, of \ndiminished standard of living, a legacy which says to them, ``We want \nyou to work perhaps 30 or 40 percent of your working lives to pay our \nbills,'' for they will have to do that. It is estimated, Mr. President, \nthat every child born today will spend at least $100,000 in new income \ntax to pay just the interest on the national debt. What kind of legacy \nis that? Is that a legacy that should permit us to hide from reality \nand to say to our seniors and our young people and our veterans and our \nstudents--every American--``You do not have to worry about it, we are \ngoing to leave everything alone. Whatever you are getting from your \nGovernment, you can keep getting.'' The legacy for that kind of \nleadership is a bleak future for the greatest Nation on Earth--$4.7 \ntrillion in debt, and rising at the rate of $420 million a day; $420 \nmillion a day, just tick it off, tick it off. We will be here for 2 \ndays, so that is $420 million times two while we decide a Republican \nproposal that says we have to stop it.\n  Now, before you pass judgment, fellow Senators and fellow Americans, \nabout the bill and the summaries that will be given from the other \nside, hear from those who put the package together and put the programs \ntogether on our side. Somewhere you can pass judgment upon whether we \nare being fair or unfair. I believe you will come down on the side of \nsaying that this is fair to our children and to our children's future, \nand everybody has to be part of the change that will bring that into \nfruition a couple of nights from now.\n  I must say to the President of the United States that veto and veto \nthreats, as you might want to issue them day by day, do not get you a \nbalanced budget; nor does it get you close to eliminating a legacy for \nour children and grandchildren of servitude, or perhaps a partial \nservitude of that next generation to ours, for they will work to pay \nour bills. Mr. President, is that the kind of leader you want to be? \nDemocrats on the other side, is that what you want to be? You are going \nto bring before us, one at a time, amendments to strike pieces of this, \nand each \n\n[[Page S15603]]\n\none is going to sound neat, sound worrisome. I hope every single one of \nthem is defeated, and I hope we take this budget resolution to \nconference and then to the President of the United States and let us \nsee what he does; let us see what he offers. Mr. President, we extend \nthat to you now, and we say it is going to happen. So get ready, Mr. \nPresident. Be prepared for what you are going to do when we give you \nthis package. Fellow Democrats, we understand you differ with us. We \nwill try our best to be truthful and to point out where you are wrong. \nIn many of the statements made to the American people you are wrong on \nthe facts. We will try to get them before you.\n  Having said that, I assume I have used 15 minutes, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to reserve any of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I have 15 seconds for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am wondering when the Senator is going to explain the \njustification for the tax cuts. I have been on the floor listening to \nthe justification that the Senator has given, without a single word \nabout what the justification is in this bill for the tax cuts for the \nwealthiest individuals. I have not heard a discussion about the \nimplications of that in those terms.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You can rest assured that we will answer that. Many \nissues have been raised, and I am trying to give an overview. That will \nbe answered a number of times.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Could it be that you delegated that joyous task to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My friend knows that each committee does their work. He \nis in charge of that work. I will not take a back seat to anybody on \nexplaining the tax bill. I do not know it in detail, but I think it is \na very good tax bill. When the American people understand where the tax \ncuts really go, they are going to find out that what we said we would \ndo was get a balanced budget, and we did; and then the economic \ndividend that comes from that, we would use to give American people \nback some tax dollars so they could spend it themselves. We think the \ntax writing committee has come very close to doing that in a way that \nalmost all of that money will go to middle-income Americans, making \n$110,000 and under. We will show that unequivocally, and I believe the \nJoint Tax Committee will be saying that, too.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, point of inquiry; how much time does the \nSenator from Nebraska have under the unanimous-consent agreement in \nplace now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, upon his seeking recognition, I ask \nunanimous consent the Chair recognize the Senator from New York, and \nthe remaining time under my discretion is allocated to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, one observation, please and then I yield \nthe time that Senator Brown desires, with the Senator from Michigan \ncontrolling our time after that.\n  Mr. President, I forgot to mention on the tax cuts, obviously the \nPresident thinks the taxes were raised too much last year under his \nproposal. One way of looking at it, we are getting set to right that \nwrong which the President complained about in Houston, about which he \nwas beginning to say he should not be blamed for that tax increase.\n  We will accommodate and reduce some taxes so that maybe he can \nsupport us on that.\n  I yield to Senator Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise for just a short comment because I \nthink it is important for the American people to keep this perspective \nin mind.\n  This package has been attacked by those opposed to it. That is the \nprivilege and indeed the obligation of Members who find this \nunacceptable. No one should be fooled as to the contents of this \npackage. This package ensures that Federal spending goes up 3 percent a \nyear instead of 5 or 6 percent.\n  Now, some Members find that unacceptable, some find that cruel and \ninhumane. As a matter of fact, the description that was just given by \nthe Democratic Budget Committee leader compared the package to \n```Rosemary's Baby'--a look-alike dream child.''\n  Mr. President, indeed, there are some Americans, particularly in \nCongress, particularly on the spending side, who think that increasing \nspending only 3 percent a year is the worst thing that has ever \nhappened in Western civilization. We will hear a lot about that in \ndebate.\n  The American people ought to keep in mind what this is. This is a \nplan to increase spending 3 percent a year instead of 6 percent a year. \nThe difference is our future. By controlling the increases to a \nmoderate rate we are able to offer a future to our children and our \ngrandchildren. We are able to focus on the deficit. Mr. President, \nwithout doing that we consume their future with debt, deficits, and \neconomic stagnation.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to make one other point that I think is \nrelevant to this debate and very important. I hope the American people \nwho listen to this, who listen to the rhetoric that has been made about \nthis budget plan, will understand that we are not talking about cuts in \nmost programs. What we are talking about is slowing the rate of \nincrease.\n  In the discussion of tax cuts, let me simply mention that I hope \nMembers will be on guard, or Americans will be on guard, as they \nlisten. I have heard the most incredible debate of the tax cuts that I \nhave ever heard or I ever thought I would hear in my life. Pinocchio's \nnose would be a world-record length if he had to listen to the \ndiscussions that we have had put on.\n  Let me give an example. I have heard of tax credits that are not yet \nimplemented as being called increases in taxes. That is ludicrous. I \nhave heard welfare programs that are being controlled in the rate they \nspend money as being increases in taxes.\n  Mr. President, an increase in spending is an increase in spending. A \ncut in spending is a cut in spending. Frankly, the American people have \nthe good judgment to see through this kind of rhetoric.\n  What we need are real valid estimates. What we need is a solid budget \nthat gets us where we want to go.\n  Mr. President, there is only one budget that is considered here today \nthat will do that. There is only one budget that has been certified by \nthe Congressional Budget Office as meeting those targets. There is only \none alternative that brings us to a real balanced budget. That is the \nbudget before us. This is the only game in town.\n  Are there critics? Of course there are critics. Are there people who \nsimply cannot live with limiting growth of Federal spending? Of course \nthere are.\n  Everyone knows this country does not have a future if we do not do \nthe kind of things that are in this budget.\n  The question is whether or not we will act for blue smoke and \nmirrors, for invalid assumptions that the President suggests, or \nwhether we will opt for the real thing.\n  Mr. President, this is the real thing. It offers a future to \nAmericans. I retain the balance of our time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we are awaiting the arrival of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee who will set forth the \nproposals of the tax cut in this measure.\n  I say to my friend from Colorado that it might surprise him, there \nare those on this side of the aisle who see the debt crisis in the same \ncrisis terms that he does and have a feeling that we know when it arose \nin the 1980's, and it was not from this side of the aisle--and we want \nto get hold of it.\n  We do not think you can solve a deficit problem by cutting taxes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I simply observe--and I greatly respect the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, both his intellect and his \nintegrity--from this Member's viewpoint, I believe an objective review \nof the programs that have risen in increased spending would indicate \nthat the programs that are in question were not adopted during the \n1980's.\n  I think any objective review of the question of the deficit will \nindicate that.\n  Second, I observe that there were valiant efforts made during the \n1980's, a few by this Member. I am not sure I describe my efforts as \nvaliant but they \n\n[[Page S15604]]\n\nwere persistent and they were consistently rejected by Democratic \nmajorities in the House of Representatives where I served.\n  At least from this Member's point of view, if you want to talk about \nthe history of the deficit, you look at when those programs were passed \nand who put them on automatic pilot.\n  Second, I think you cannot but look at the record and recognize that \nthe Democratic-controlled Congress, at least in the House of \nRepresentatives during the 1980's, consistently opposed efforts to \ncontrol that spending and limit the increase in spending.\n  I retain the balance of our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, where is the current time being charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, who is being charged with the current \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time the time is \ndistributed equally between the two sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could we have the attention of the Senator from New \nYork?\n  As I understand, the time is being charged against us at the present \ntime. I just had a question for the Senator from Colorado for 15 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is running equally at this time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 15 seconds to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator from Colorado, regarding his review of \nthe period of the 1980's--does the Senator understand every year what \nwas actually appropriated by the Congress, with the exception of 1 \nyear, was less than what was actually requested by President Reagan \nduring that period of time?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the Senator, at least from this Member's \nviewpoint, that the relevant facts are not what was appropriated in the \noriginal. It was what Congress ended up spending.\n  If you look at what is totally spent by Congress versus what they did \nwith the congressional budget, you come up with a much different \nviewpoint.\n  The fact is during that period Congress continuously overspent its \nown budget; so to compare it with official budget requests I think does \nnot give the accurate picture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator from Iowa 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We ought to be very proud, Mr. President, of delivering \nin this Congress on a promise that Congresses have made probably for \nthe last 15 years and maybe even longer than that, that we are going to \nbalance the budget and that we have a nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice certification that we are balancing the budget.\n  Balancing the budget is the most important goal that we have \naccomplished since I have been a member of the Budget Committee, and I \nam glad we are able to do that.\n  Some people question whether or not we ought to decrease taxes as \nwell as balance the budget. There are people that might say we ought to \ndecrease taxes and forget about balancing the budget; there are other \npeople that would say we might balance the budget and forget about \ndecreasing taxes.\n  To me, it is a question of priority. The priority is to balance the \nbudget. And if we can have tax cuts, and they are paid for, and the \nnonpartisan budget office will certify that we have a balanced budget, \nthen it seems to me we ought to give the people back some of the money \nthat the President took in OBRA '93. He said that he understands that \nhe raised taxes too much 2 years ago. This will not give back all the \nmoney obtained when the President raised taxes then, but it will go a \nlong way toward correcting that inequity.\n  So, in a very historic way--at least historic as far as the last 15 \nyears is concerned--we have a chance today and tomorrow, during this 20 \nhours of debate, to show the people that the promises of the last \nelection are delivered, those are the promises of a balanced budget and \nof a paid-for tax decrease. It seems to me that a balanced budget will \ngo far in making our children's and grandchildren's futures much \nbrighter and more hopeful.\n  I think this is a very, very good national program. It is good for \nall 50 States. But I can look at it and say it is good for my State as \nwell as it is for the country as a whole. I look at the $500-per-child \ntax credit. This credit will bring approximately $300 million back into \nthe pockets of Iowans, the pockets of middle-class working families in \nmy State.\n  For the first time since 1986, students in my State, as well as those \nin the Nation as a whole, will be able to claim a tax credit for the \ninterest on student loans because this bill provides a credit for 20 \npercent of the qualified interest, up to $500 per student.\n  This legislation is not partisan. This legislation is bipartisan \nbecause it is identical to the bill that I introduced earlier this year \nwith my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this credit will send \nover $1 billion to young people all over the country who are just \nstarting out in life after college. This change should especially aid \nyoung people who plan to stay in rural America instead of having to \nseek high-paying jobs in the cities to meet loan payments.\n  In addition to that, for the benefit of the country as a whole and \nthe benefit of people in my State, there is a capital gains tax cut \nthat will reduce an individual's effective capital gains tax rate by 50 \npercent. In Iowa we will be able to watch and see a lot of farmland and \na lot of other capital assets that have been tied up begin to change \nhands. People have been waiting for the correct incentive and \nopportunity to sell because they naturally do not want to pay a high \ntax on inflation because that is not taxation, that is confiscation. \nYou are going to see formerly less productive property change hands at \nrecord rates. This is going to be very beneficial for families passing \non to younger generations the fruits of their labors and their \ninvestment in that business or that farm. Of course, when property is \ntied up in the Tax Code, that means our farm population is going to \ncontinue to get older, the average farmer in my State is 62 years old. \nYoung people are not going into farming because they cannot. Only 3 \npercent of the farmers in my State are under 30 years of age. We have \nlost a whole generation of farmers because of bad tax policy and \ndepression in agriculture in the 1980's. This will help that.\n  The same for the changes we are making in the estate tax; especially \nit is going to help family farmers and small business people. Family-\nowned businesses and farms do not have to be sold anymore in order to \njust pay the Federal taxes. The estate tax system will now serve small \nbusinesses instead of consume them.\n  While we are fixing the business of taxing small business, this bill \nalso ratchets up the unified credit exemption equivalent all the way \nfrom $600,000 to $750,000. It has been at $600,000 since 1980 and, of \ncourse, it has been depleted considerably by the inflation of the last \n15 years. The legislative move from $600,000 toward $700,000 recognizes \nboth the fact of inflation and the fact that every asset in Iowa is not \na member of a qualified family-owned business.\n  For my colleagues who are going to rant and rave about an estate tax \nexemption helping rich people, I hope they will take a little bit of \ntime to understand that when you are talking about a family farm \noperation, operated just by family members who are providing the \ncapital, providing the labor, providing the management, that you do not \nprovide a job on a family farm for the same cost that you do in \nindustrial America, about a $50,000 investment. For the American \nservice industry, you can create a job for about $10,000 to $15,000 a \nyear. Jobs on farms in America are created by the investment or the \nborrowing--and in most cases to get started it is borrowing--of \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in land and machinery to create one \njob, or an income for one family. I am not talking about hiring a lot \nof labor in the process. I am talking about the family doing the labor.\n  So you have, after a life of work, one half million dollars invested \nin land and machinery to create one job and one family income. Some \npeople in this body might think small farmers are rich. Maybe a lot of \nAmerica will think small farmers are rich. But, remember, \n\n[[Page S15605]]\n\nsmall farmers create income for one family. It is not like the economy \ndoes in an industrial job, one income for a family with $50,000 \ninvestment and somebody else is investing it, somebody else is managing \nit; or in a service job where the economy needs only $10,000 or \n$15,000.\n  We are also providing, in this bill, tax changes that are meaningful \nin ending the marriage penalty for nonitemizers. We are answering the \npleas of a lot of young people everywhere who want to know why their \nGovernment is penalizing them for exchanging marriage vows.\n  This bill says we are not going to tax reasonable dues to farm \norganizations. This IRS ruling, as stupid as it is, creates a lot of \nproblems for a lot of cooperatives and nonfarm organizations out there. \nJust like the President's tax increase last year--albeit in that \ninstance it was something passed by a Democrat controlled Congress, and \nnot some uninformed ruling by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight that this bill also improves and \nexpands IRA's. We are reinstating an IRA to which working people can \nmake tax-deductible contributions. Even homemakers and even nonworking \nspouses will be able to make contributions for the first time ever. \nThere will be penalty-free taxable withdrawals for qualified uses.\n  Everyone knows that we need to double the current savings rate of 4 \npercent. Young people in my State know that they will have to save for \ntheir own retirements while they are financing the retirements of baby \nboomers, and the IRA incentives in this bill will provide the \nopportunity. Expanding and strengthening the individual retirement \naccounts is something I supported for many years. I am glad to see \nthose efforts bear fruit, and I compliment the new chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, for getting that job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to yield the floor. I am not done, but I \nwant to inform my colleagues I have spoken all I wanted to on the tax \nprovisions. I do have something I want to say on the Medicare \nprovisions, and I will get time on that later on.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the balance of the \nopening Democratic time. I had hoped to speak in response to my good \nfriend, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. He is \nunavoidably detained. So I will go ahead as if in rebuttal.\n  But first to continue the exchange I was having with the Senator from \nColorado, there are those on this side of the aisle who are deeply \noffended by the continuing deficits which have increasingly produced \nstalemate in our Government. This sequence began in the late 1970's, \nearly 1980's, and there was an idea behind it--the idea was that, if \nyou wanted to paralyze the Federal Government you simply put it into a \nparalyzing debt by the reduction of revenues and simultaneously \nincreasing spending on defense and such matters. Indeed, that happened. \nWe forecast it. We tracked it. And we are here today to say that it is \nthe case.\n  Just a few years ago in a wonderful book ``The Deficit and the Public \nInterest,'' Joseph White, and the late revered Aaron Wildavsky, said: \n``Strife over the deficit has affected procedure as well as policy, \nmonopolizing the congressional agenda, encouraging paralyzing and \ndeceptive legislation like Gramm-Rudman, frustrating our public \nofficials, and stalemating the Government.''\n  As regards deceptive legislation, Mr. President, I have to place this \npresent proposal in that category. We are not balancing the budget. We \nare adding $700 billion to the debt in the next 7 years. One of the \nways we are doing it is, while talking about the deficit, while talking \nabout the debt, we are going to cut taxes. Well, no. No, Mr. President. \nI correct myself. I correct myself. We are going to raise taxes on half \nthe population, and cut taxes on the other half.\n  Mr. President, here is a table from data produced by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, which is an authoritative, intermittently \nnonpartisan, body which calculates the effects of tax measures taken by \nthe Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Finance. In the \ncourse of our markup, as we say, voting out the tax bill, I requested \nthat the Joint Committee give us the distribution of the $245 billion \ntax cut, and they did, including the reductions in the earned income \ntax credit which are tax increases, in my view. If you have to pay more \ntax, you have had a tax increase.\n  Sir, here is the data: 51 percent of American taxpayers will have a \ntax increase; 49 percent will have a tax decrease. How we can do this, \nand then talk about fiscal responsibility eludes this Senator.\n  Now a second table from the Treasury, showing the actual distribution \nof the tax cuts and tax increases across the population of taxpayers, \nby income. It shows a tax increase for taxpayers with incomes of \n$30,000 or less. I should point out that according to the analysis of \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, 51 percent of American taxpayers make \n$30,000 or less. Once we get above $30,000, then we see tax cuts for \neveryone.\n  I am embarrassed for my friends on the other side of the aisle. This \nis a caricature. A comic Democrat might have come along and have said, \n``Let me show you what a Republican tax cut looks like.''\n  Families with incomes above $200,000 will have a tax cut of $3,416. \nFamilies with incomes under $10,000 will have a tax increase. That \nsimply is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nearlier spoke about what Thomas Jefferson had to say on the subject of \ndebt. I have not met Mr. Jefferson, but you can sense his presence in \nthese precincts. The Senator said what Laurence Tribe has said about \nthe accumulation of debt. I taught at the same university, and I know \nhim well. And the legacy of debt of which the chairman spoke--we are \nthe ones appalled by that legacy. We did not create it.\n  At the end of the 1970's, at the end of the administration of \nPresident Carter, the national debt was in the neighborhood of $800 \nbillion. That was at the end of nearly two centuries in this Republic. \nAfter 15 years it is now approaching $5 trillion. That did not happen \naccidentally, and it did not happen as a consequence of activities on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  To the contrary, 2 years ago the Democrats put together, in the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, a combination of program \nspending cuts and ``tax increases''--I do not forbear to use the term--\nof $500 billion. And we brought a deficit, which in that year, in \nfiscal 1992 was $290 billion. We started a glidepath down to where this \nfiscal year just concluded, the deficit will be somewhere between $160 \nand $170 billion. We cut the deficit in half.\n  In consequence of what we did, the so-called deficit premium on \ninterest rates was reduced. The deficit premium is simply that extra \ncharge which lenders exact when governmental deficits are running very \nhigh--because in the end the way governments typically have handled \ntheir debt was through inflation, to wipe it out, wipe out the \ncurrency, and wipe out the society frequently. But it happens. It \nhappened enough that this premium exists. The ``deficit premium'' being \ncharged on interest rates went down, and resulted in a savings to the \nFederal Government of about $100 billion more. So in total we achieved \ndeficit reduction of $600 billion as a result of the 1993 legislation--\npassed without a single Republican vote.\n  What have we to show for that? First, let we say that the average \nlength of recovery for 10 postwar business cycles has been 50 months, \nbut the current recovery has now lasted 55 months and is still going. \nThe annual rate of growth in real gross domestic product has been 3.3 \npercent, more than twice what it was in the previous 4 years. \nUnemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent, which is very close to full \nemployment. The annual inflation rate has dropped to 2.5 percent.\n  If you correct for the CPI overstatement, you may have something very \nclose to zero inflation. The New York Times this morning devotes a lead \narticle in its business section to it. ``Has inflation finally been \nwhipped?'' It did not just happen. It was made to happen by what we did \nin 1993, and we do not apologize for a thing. We would rather state we \nhave shown the way--shown what you can do, if you have the courage to \ngovern. There are things in this \n\n[[Page S15606]]\n\n\npresent proposal from the majority with which I would disagree. There \nare things with which I would not disagree in the least. I do not \nobject in the least to the statement of the Senator from Colorado that \na reduction in the rate of increase is not a cut.\n  However, to cut taxes is an act of unforgiven irresponsibility. I did \nnot say ``unforgivable.'' I said the consequences will be unforgiving \nat this moment in our business cycle expansion. We do not need to do \nthis and, Mr. President, we would not be doing it save for the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In our hearings on this subject, in the Finance Committee, one \nRepublican Senator after another said no, we have to bring the budget \ninto balance. This is no time to cut taxes.\n  We do not have to stimulate the economy. The economy is in its 55th \nmonth of expansion; we are practically at full employment; inflation \nhas practically disappeared. Business investment is at the highest rate \nin 30 years--investment savings is at the highest rate in 30 years. \nThis is not the time to get into an inflationary stimulus. We know \nenough about our economy to know that.\n  One Senator after another from the other side of the aisle said no, \ncertainly not; we would never pass a $245 billion tax cut. And then we \nlearned that--and I do not mean in any way to seem to ridicule, but it \nturns out that the Contract With America written in the other body \nrequired this tax cut. And so here it is today. But it is not a tax cut \nfor all. It is a tax cut for half the population and a tax increase for \nthe other half. That surely is something we would not wish to do in \nordinary circumstances.\n  Has the prospect of a Presidential election brought us to this? I \nhope not, Mr. President. I hope we would not be doing things we are \ndoing in the process of cutting, cutting Medicare as much as we do, \ncutting Medicaid as much as we do.\n  Mr. President, before this decade is out, we are going to have a \ncrisis in our teaching hospitals and our medical schools because of the \nmeasures in this bill. We currently have in Medicare a provision to \nprovide medical schools and teaching hospitals with some extra support. \nWe currently have a provision on disproportionate share which in effect \ncompensates those hospitals, including teaching hospitals, that treat \nlarge proportions of the uninsured. They are already in a precarious \nfinancial position, and the bill before us will exacerbate their \nproblems. They will be in genuine jeopardy if this bill becomes law. At \nthe greatest moment of medical science for this country's institutions, \nwe are decimating their finances in order to give a tax cut to people \nwith incomes over $200,000.\n  Sir, I believe my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair for its courtesy, and I hope I will \nhave the attention of my friends on the other side of the aisle. It is \nnot too late to do the right thing.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Could I inquire as to how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes of the 1 hour remains.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes on our side and \nthen I will yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nDelaware. I use my 2 minutes very briefly to be responsive to some of \nthe comments that have been made here already about the nature of the \ntax cut. I am sure the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, will elaborate in more detail. But I was very \nconcerned recently when I began to see this chart appear and some of \nthe comments related to it that suggested somehow the tax cut that is \nbeing proposed as part of this reconciliation bill would \ndisproportionately fall on the shoulders of the less affluent and \ntremendously benefit the wealthiest among us which is the frequently \nused term that we hear.\n  So I said to myself, gee, that does not sound like the tax bill the \nFinance Committee passed. And indeed, I then began looking into the tax \nbill the Finance Committee passed, and according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee calculations, in the first year of this tax bill 90 percent \nof the tax cuts will go to people whose earnings are below $100,000 a \nyear. Over three-quarters or 77 percent of the proposal's tax cuts will \ngo to those making under $75,000 in the first year. Less than 1 percent \nof the proposal's tax cuts will go to those making over $200,000 in the \nfirst year. Over four-fifths, 84 percent, of the proposal's tax cuts \nwill go to those making under $100,000 in the first 5 years; 70 percent \nof the proposal's tax cuts will go to those making under $75,000 in the \nfirst 5 years, and so on and so on.\n  Indeed, charts and statistics can always yield certain kinds of \ninferences, but those are the actual numbers that the Joint Tax \nCommittee produced when it evaluated this plan.\n  I said maybe there has to be a discrepancy here. What could it be? \nLet me look at the individual provisions of this tax cut and see. In \norder to fulfill the numbers we have been hearing, they must all be tax \ncuts that benefit the wealthiest people in America. So I looked and I \nfound a $500 per child tax credit; $141 billion of the total tax cut is \nthe child tax credit, and it is phased out for people beginning at \nfamily incomes of $110,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  In addition, we have an adoption credit, marriage penalty relief, \nstudent loan interest deduction, individual retirement accounts, and \ncountless other provisions in the bill that are aimed at people in the \nincome categories I have already referenced, primarily people making \nunder $75,000 a year and to a large extent, approximately 85 percent of \nthis tax cut to people making less than $100,000 a year. It is a \nmiddle-class tax cut.\n  That is why yesterday, in describing the reconciliation bill, the \nWashington Post in referencing the tax sections described it as family \nfriendly. It is family friendly to middle-class families, to people who \nhave felt the squeeze for so many years. That is why it is part of this \nlegislation and why we are supporting it.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield the remainder of our side's time \nto the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15599-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ORDER FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, this is certainly a momentous time. Change \nis the order of the day. And it is a time to renounce old and \nunworkable programs and philosophies and adopt those that will move \nAmerica forward, those that will offer prosperity, security, \nopportunity, and growth to our families and to our communities.\n  As Henry George once said, ``The sailor who raises the same sail \nregardless of changes in the direction of the wind will never reach his \nport.''\n  In this Congress, we have not only trimmed the sails but we have set \na \n\n[[Page S15607]]\n\nbold new course for the future. For the first time in more than a \ndecade, we are serious about balancing the budget, and we have a plan \nto do it. For the first time in 50 years, we have changed the dynamics \nof the welfare State, creating incentives that encourage work and \nstrong families, incentives that balance rights with responsibilities.\n  At last, we have changed the questions concerning Government. No \nlonger do we ask: ``How big can we make it?'' No longer do we ask: \n``How can we control the States? How can we concentrate more power in \nWashington?''\n  These are not the questions anymore.\n  Rather, the new questions are: ``What is Government's proper role? \nHow can we make it more cost-effective and efficient? And what do we \nneed to do to create an environment of security for those who \nlegitimately need Government assistance but an environment for economic \ngrowth and opportunity for the valiant taxpayers who provide that \nassistance?'' And for the first time in my memory, we are returning \npower back to where it belongs, back to the States.\n  This is what we were sent here to do. It is the message we heard last \nNovember. And the job is getting done. At home we have energetic \nGovernors with innovative plans, many with success stories. We have \nfriends, neighbors, and constituents who want, once again, to feel like \nthey have a powerful voice in the system. These are men and women who \nover the years have come to build this franchise as their Government \nhas moved further and further away.\n  We are in the process of putting the power back where it belongs, in \nthe States, where our friends, our neighbors, our constituents have a \nstronger voice and are more active.\n  As I watched this 104th Congress move forward, I have thought on many \noccasions that I can think of no other Congress in which I have been \nmore honored to call myself a Member than this one. And I am grateful \nfor my colleagues, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, who have come \nto agree that the old way just is not good enough, not for America, not \nfor Americans.\n  In many ways there has been an immeasurable amount of cooperation in \nthis Congress, and it should not be overlooked. In other areas I would \nlike to see more. But I believe a part of the cooperation that is \napparent, of course, is borne by the fact that we all know what needs \nto be done. Republican and Democrat, we all realize the challenges that \nmust be addressed.\n  Even President Clinton, from time to time, has indicated his insight \nand understanding, saying that his record-setting tax increase was a \nmistake and finally agreeing with House and Senate Republicans that the \nbudget could be balanced in 7 years.\n  With the reconciliation bill we bring to the floor today, we again \nneed this cooperation, perhaps more than ever, as we turn our attention \nto saving and strengthening the Medicare system, toward curbing runaway \nspending and toward giving Americans what they most need now after a \ndecade of tax increases: a real, workable, economy-expanding tax cut.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, there should be cooperation. President \nClinton himself has been a most certain voice in expressing the \nimportance of making real and lasting changes. As I said, he has \nadmitted his tax increases were too high. He knows spending is out of \ncontrol. He has proposed his own child credit, a credit of up to $800 \nper child. He has stated that it is possible to balance the budget in 7 \nyears. And almost 2 years ago, he took a firm stand on Medicare, saying \nthat--and I quote --``Today * * * Medicare [is] going up three times \nthe rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate \nof inflation. This is not a Medicare * * * cut.'' End of the \nPresident's quote.\n  President Clinton understands what needs to be done. After all, he \nwas the one who ran on the platform of bringing change to Washington. \nNow, he cannot have it both ways. We either change the old and failed \nways of doing business, or we keep business as usual.\n  Well, Mr. President, I vote for change. I encourage my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to join us in making change possible, \nrather than retreating into gridlock and defending 30-year-old policies \nthat have spent some $3 trillion to have more children living below the \npoverty line today than when those programs began. This is not \nprogress.\n  According to economist Walter Williams, the taxpayers' money that \nWashington has spent on these programs to cure social ills over the \nlast three decades could have bought the entire assets of the Fortune \n500 companies and virtually all the U.S. farmland. But today the \nproblems not only remain, they are even worse. The fact is, we cannot \nafford business as usual. Americans do not deserve business as usual, \nespecially those Americans who in the last 30 years have fallen prey to \nthe pathologies that attend poverty: dependency, crime, unwed mothers, \nbroken families, decaying neighborhoods.\n  Certainly we must keep a safety net. None here argues that we should \nnot. But we must change the system.\n  I believe that except for politics, President Clinton and many of his \nallies in Congress would be with us on most of the proposals we have \nincluded in the reconciliation package, even on our historic efforts to \nsave and to strengthen Medicare.\n  Remember, it was the President's own Medicare trustee report that so \nvividly outlined the problems we are attacking today. According to that \nreport:\n\n       . . . the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) continues \n     to be severely out of financial balance and is projected to \n     be exhausted in about seven years. The SMI Trust Fund (Part \n     B), while in balance on an annual basis, shows a rate of \n     growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable. Moreover, \n     this fund is projected to be 75 percent or more financed by \n     general revenues, so that given the general budget deficit \n     problem, it is a major contributor to the larger fiscal \n     problems of the Nation. The Medicare program is clearly \n     unsustainable in its present form.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, this is from the administration's own \ntrustees.\n  There has been no question about the absolute need to restore the \nintegrity of the Medicare Program, to save, to strengthen it, so that \nGovernment can meet its contract with the American people. Similarly, \nthere has been no question concerning the need to control runaway \nGovernment spending. Government has grown accustomed to living beyond \nits means.\n  This must change, and reform efforts must be real. They must maintain \nthe agreements Washington has made with the American people. They must \nsee that the needy are cared for. They must keep the contract that \nexists between the Government and our retired constituents concerning \nMedicare. They must ensure the integrity of the program for a \nsufficient period of time to allow us to chart the distant future of \nthat program so it can absorb the baby-boom generation.\n  And in doing all this, our efforts at reform must also create \nconditions, an environment, if you will, where our economy can expand \nand the harvest for coming generations can be planted. The \nreconciliation package we present today accomplishes just that. It \nkeeps our promise to the American people.\n  Our proposal does not engender dependency on Government like the \nfailed policies of the past. It does not perpetuate the negative \nincentive that feed the welfare bureaucracy and those who maintain \ntheir political power base by pandering to that bureaucracy.\n  Of course, our policies address the needs of citizens who cannot care \nfor themselves, but, more importantly, they create conditions for \nupward mobility, conditions for economic opportunity, incentives for \nself-reliance. And I cannot express how important it is that we create \nthese kinds of conditions.\n  At the moment our economy is not growing as strongly as it should be \ngrowing, and perhaps this is why President Clinton now believes his \nrecord-setting tax increases were a mistake. At the moment, there is \nlittle incentive for Americans to save and invest. Perhaps this is why \ntoday the average 50-year-old is so ill-prepared for retirement and \nwhy, among the industrial nations of the world, we lag behind even our \ncompetitors in our rate of personal savings. Incidentally, this, \naccording to Federal Chairman Alan Greenspan, is one of the most \npressing problems confronting our Nation economically.\n  At the moment, the Medicare Program stares into the abyss of \nbankruptcy, and this is why many of our \n\n[[Page S15608]]\n\nseniors are living with fear and uncertainty. But not just our seniors; \nfear and uncertainty grip their children and grandchildren because they \nknow that, left unchecked, entitlement spending is growing so fast \nthat, along with interest on the national debt, it will consume almost \nall Federal revenues in the year 2010, just 15 short years from now. \nLeft unchecked, by 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover \nentitlement spending alone.\n  Though we live in a Nation of infinite possibilities, we are, of \ncourse, a land of finite resources. At the moment, the Federal debt is \napproaching $4.9 trillion, deficit spending is well over $150 billion a \nyear, and the fact is, Medicare, Medicaid, and earned income tax credit \nare some of the fastest growing entitlement programs on the books. \nStrengthening and restoring the integrity of these programs will not \nonly benefit those who should appropriately receive them, but it will \nalso help us balance the budget, and this, Mr. President, is what the \nvast majority of Americans not only want but demand.\n  A balanced budget is necessary for economic security. A balanced \nbudget would increase job opportunity. Some forecast that over 6 \nmillion jobs would be created if the budget were balanced. Interest \nrates would be lower. They would fall by almost 2 percent, some say \neven higher. And Americans everywhere would enjoy a higher standard of \nliving. There would be a reduced burden of debt on our children and our \ngrandchildren, and people would be able to keep more of their hard-\nearned money rather than sending it to Washington.\n  To balance the budget, we must control the growth of entitlements. I \nam not suggesting these programs be abolished or even cut. We simply \nneed to get them back within our budget, within our ability to pay for \nthem. It is easy to see how they got out of control.\n  Simply put, these programs escape the discipline of the annual budget \nprocess. Increased entitlement spending occurs automatically, covering \nany individual who meets eligibility criteria. These increases are \nheavily influenced by the rapid rise in health care costs, the growing \nnumber of beneficiaries and real benefit expansion.\n  Of course, today America is aging. Our population is getting older as \npeople are living longer. This is a good thing. It is indicative of \nprogress. These changing demographics, however, must be accompanied by \nchanging policies and programs. Programs that were created in 1965 when \nthe average American lived to be 61 and when our Nation had five \nworkers to support every one retiree must be modified to reflect \ncurrent reality. Today, the average American lives more than 76 years, \nand there are less than four workers to support each retiree.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, the average American who reached \nretirement age could expect to collect benefits for 15 years. Today, \nthe average 65-year-old will receive benefits for 18 years.\n  This is where we are now, Mr. President. Looking into the future \ngives us even greater reason to make the necessary changes we are \nproposing. The chart, which we will bring out a little later, \ndemonstrates just how important it is that we begin now to make \nnecessary changes in entitlement programs.\n  Today, there are less than 40 million Americans who qualify to \nreceive Medicare. By the year 2010, the number will be approaching 50 \nmillion. By 2020, it will be over 60 million. While these numbers are \nincreasing, there will be fewer workers to support each retiree, and \nwhile we have almost four workers per retiree today, we will have about \ntwo workers per retiree by the year 2030.\n  So, Mr. President, we must change the program. We cannot move into \nthe future with blueprints that were designed for the past. Medicare \nand Medicaid have been the most significant contributors to entitlement \ngrowth in recent years. It is projected that these programs will \ncripple as a share of the economy within the next 35 years. Thus, they \nare unsustainable.\n  In 1994, Medicare spending was $160 billion. Over the past decade, \nMedicare grew by about 10 percent per year, and CBO projects similar \ngrowth over the next decade. Because of this rapid growth, the Medicare \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund, part A, is projected to go bankrupt in \n2002.\n  As the baby-boom generation retires, Medicare costs will continue to \nsoar. The Medicare trustees project that between 1995 and 2020, \nMedicare will grow from 2.6 percent of the economy to 6 percent, an \nincrease of over 200 percent. Likewise, Medicaid is out of control. \nThis program alone is scheduled to grow at an annual rate of 10.4 \npercent between fiscal year 1995 and 2002, devouring both Federal and \nState budgets. Already, Medicaid consumes about 20 percent of State \nbudgets, exploding from $15 billion in 1980 to a projected $180 billion \nin 2002.\n  These are serious concerns, and keeping in mind the demographics that \nI cited earlier, it is easy to see that without real change in policies \nand programs, there is no way the Federal Government will meet its \nobligation. There is no way that we can offer assurance to even the \nnext generation of retirees that they will have coverage under Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  The year 2002 is only 74 months away. However, as I have said on many \noccasions, I am an optimist. I am an optimist because we know what \nworks. We know the right kinds of policy and program changes that need \nto be made, changes that will allow Medicare and Medicaid to meet their \ncurrent obligations while at the same time saving these programs for \nfuture beneficiaries.\n  We know how to restore sound financial practices to the Federal \nGovernment, practices that can strengthen the economy, create an \nenvironment for employment growth and an environment where Americans \nare encouraged to work, save and invest. And achieving these conditions \nshould be our primary responsibility.\n  Towards this end, we must see our proposal in this budget \nreconciliation process in its entirety, for its overall balance and how \nall components work together to benefit Americans at all ages and in \nall income groups. To single out one reform in our proposal, without \nlooking at the others, is to do a great disservice to what this \nreconciliation package offers.\n  It is balanced, it is workable, and it is long, long overdue. It \nchanges business as usual in Washington. It answers the clarion call \nfrom our constituents to make the kind of changes that so obviously \nneed to be made.\n  I remember that an astute political adviser once warned his boss that \nthere is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to \nconduct or more uncertain than to take the lead in the introduction of \na new order of thing. I believe, with some of the inflammatory rhetoric \nwe have heard surrounding this important debate, there is good reason \nto say that this adviser knew what he was talking about.\n  Change is difficult, but change is more necessary now than ever \nbefore. Where some may feel they lose in one aspect while single-\nmindedly absorbing one component of these changes, they are sure to \ngain in others. What we seek to achieve here is balance, balance that \nimproves conditions and opportunities for all. It is not the voices of \nindividual special interest groups that govern our actions, but the \ncollective voice of America. And we understand one fundamental truth \nabout reform--a truth stated eloquently by Vaclav Havel:\n\n       The more half-measures we take, and the longer they drag \n     on, the greater the sacrifices will be, the longer they will \n     have to be made, and the more pointless sacrifices will have \n     to be piled on top of those that are unavoidable.\n\n  We must be resolved; we must have confidence in the balance that our \nprogram offers. I have that confidence--as do other Members who join me \ntoday in introducing this reconciliation package.\n  Quite simply, there are four components to our program--promises we \nmade to the American people--promises we are now keeping:\n  First, we provide for a balanced budget;\n  Second, we strengthen and preserve Medicare and Medicaid, thus \nallowing these two important programs to continue to protect Americans \ninto the future;\n  Third, we reform welfare; and finally, once we show that the budget \nis balanced;\n  We create an environment for economic expansion through tax cuts that \n\n\n[[Page S15609]]\n\noffer relief to our families and encourage Americans to work, to save, \nand to invest.\n  To give a little history, the EITC was a bipartisan program, created \nto offset the sting of payroll taxes on working families with children. \nThe fact is, each dollar Government taxes creates a disincentive to \nwork, while each dollar that people keep for themselves is an incentive \nto work. History has proven this point. The economies of nations that \nhave cut taxes have thrived, while those nations who have increased \ntaxes--even to the point of taking everything the people earn--have \nfallen into ruin.\n  The EITC was to create incentives for low-income parents to work. It \nwas that simple. But as they say about too much of a good thing \nbecoming dangerous, such is what happened to this once-well-intended \nprogram. Over the years, the EITC has been expanded by a welfare-\noriented Congress into another Federal handout. And today, some 85 \npercent of the EITC is a Federal outlay paid directly to individuals. \nNo longer do individuals need to have families or children to qualify; \nno longer does the EITC encourage work, as it once did; no longer is \nthe program fair and cost-effective. Much of the EITC cannot even be \nconsidered tax relief because those who receive a direct payment from \nthe Government pay no income taxes at all. Make no mistake about it, \nmost of the EITC is a welfare check.\n  Beyond this, the EITC is plagued by fraud and abuse. It sports a \nfraud and error rate between 24 and 40 percent, making it the most \nfraudulent welfare program on the books. Though the administration has \nworked to reduce these high rates, there is no evidence that current \nrates are below double digits. Many of those who commit fraud are not \neven legally able to work in the United States. And the fact is, since \nthe program's inception, American taxpayers have lost $25 billion to \nfraud, waste, and abuse in the program. The GAO estimates that if this \nkind of fraud continues over the next 5 years, the EITC could waste \nanother $37 billion. We can't afford this.\n\n  We need to get the program back to its original purpose: to help \nfamilies with children offset the sting of payroll taxes. And that is \nexactly what we do with our proposal. We focus the program on the \npopulation for whom it was originally intended. We return it from being \njust another welfare program to where it belongs as a legitimate tax \nbreak for lower income working Americans with children.\n  Our reforms will place an important degree of control on this \nprogram. They successfully address the problems of rampant growth, \nfraud, and abuse. The key phrase here is ``controlling growth.'' \nRemember, EITC will continue to grow. It will continue to meet the \nneeds of those most vulnerable among us.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, families with children, \nwho now receive the maximum earned income tax credit, will continue to \nreceive a larger earned income credit in the future. When combined with \nthe $500 child credit and marriage penalty relief--issues that I will \nspeak about in a minute--low-income working families will be better off \nunder our bill than they are today. Finally, we will continue to spend \nin excess of $20 billion on the EITC, keeping it as a significant \nprogram for the working poor.\n\n\n                                medicare\n\n  Our second major objective with the proposal we are introducing is to \nstrengthen, preserve, and protect the Medicare system--not only for \nthose who depend on the system today, but for those who will need \nMedicare tomorrow. We accomplish this by allowing the program to grow \nat about twice the rate of inflation, and by introducing choice in the \nsystem. In this way, seniors are guaranteed continued coverage as well \nas the ability to choose those plans and health care providers that \nbest meet their needs.\n\n  In our proposal, Medicare spending increases form $178 billion in \n1995 to $286 billion in 2002. Average spending per beneficiary grows \nfrom $4,800 to $7,000.\n  Our proposal controls runaway costs by introducing choice into the \nsystem, giving our seniors the ability to remain in the current fee-\nfor-service plan, if that is what they want. On the other hand, we also \noffer them an unlimited number of health care plan options that they \nmay choose to better meet their needs. We call this Medicare choice, \nand it includes, beyond the current fee-for-service plan, the \nopportunity for our seniors to join plans sponsored by local hospital \nand physician groups, health maintenance organizations, point-of-\nservice plans, or preferred provider organizations. It also allows for \nseniors to join high deductible medical savings account plans, union or \nassociation plans, and, in fact, any other kind of health plan that \nmeets the standards we set to protect the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries \nwill be protected under our proposal. Despite the plan they choose, all \nseniors will receive coverage for the same services and items that are \ncurrently covered by the traditional Medicare Program. The good news is \nthat as these new plans compete with each other for business, it's \nlikely that they will offer even more benefits and improved services.\n\n  The private sector, which has done much better in keeping costs down \nthan the Government, has proven that choice creates competition, and \ncompetition is good for the consumer. And the fact is, in our proposal \nwe are offering seniors even more efficient and effective health care \nplan options than are available to most working Americans through their \nemployers.\n  By introducing private market incentives into the Medicare Program--\nby giving consumers options and encouraging providers to compete for \nbusiness--we could control program growth sufficiently enough to save \nit in the longterm. It is no surprise that the private sector has been \nmuch more successful at controlling health care costs, with innovative \nprograms based on market principles, than the Government, which has \ndepended largely on price controls. To survive, the Medicare system \nmust allow patients and providers to use health resources efficiently \nthrough a choice of plans.\n  This is not a new idea; it is an approach that's been tested and \nproven.\n  Offering choice in Medicare is based on the highly successful Federal \nemployees health benefit plan. Largely because of choice, this year the \naverage FEHBP premium was reduced by 3.3 percent. Next year, the \naverage increase will only be 0.4 percent, proving that choice brings \ncompetition and savings. In fact, choice could work so well that our \ncurrent projctions--projections that keep Medicare solvent through \n2020--could be understated.\n  Beyond using choice to strengthen the program, beneficiaries will \ncontinue to pay 31.5 percent of the premium for part B. In 1997 we will \nphase out the taxpayer subsidy of the affluent for part B; we will \nincrease the deductibles from $100 to $150, and then increase it $10 \nevery year, thereafter. Savings will also be made on the part of \nMedicare providers, predominantly through reductions in scheduled \npayment increases. Despite these restraints, providers will continue to \nenjoy annual growth rates of between 4 and 10 percent over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Our proposal also aggressively attacks fraud and abuse in the \nMedicare Program. The GAO estimates that the loss to Medicare from \nfraud and abuse equals some 10 percent of the program's total spending, \nand law enforcement officials claim that the majority of Medicare fraud \ngoes undetected. What we propose is to earmark a portion of trust fund \nmoney, starting in its first year with $200 million, to use for \ninvestigation and prosecution of health care fraud. We also offer a \nnumber of new tools to assist investigators and prosecutors in \nattacking this problem. The CBO has estimates that our provisions in \nthis area will save the program more than $4 billion over 7 years.\n  Under our program, reforms would extend the solvency of Medicare for \nabout 18 years. According to the CBO estimates, under our proposal, the \nMedicare HI trust fund balance will total $300 billion in the year \n2005. The CBO states, ``the HI trust fund would meet the Trustees' test \nof short-range financial adequacy.'' In other words, for the next 10 \nyears, the HI trust fund balance, at the end of every year, will be \nmore than enough to pay Medicare benefits for the following year.\n  More importantly, using the CBO's estimates through 2005, our Finance \nCommittee staff, in consultation with the Office of the Actuary within \nthe Department of Health and Human \n\n[[Page S15610]]\n\nServices, estimates that the Medicare Hi trust fund will be solvent \nthrough about the year 2020. That's 10 years--10 years--after the baby-\nboom generation begins to retire, a quarter of a century from today.\n  Concerning Medicaid, our objective is, again, quite simple, to \ncontrol the unsustainable growth rate of this program--a rate which \nreached as high as 30 percent in 1993. Even at its current 10.4 \npercent, the growth rate is too high. We bring it down to a manageable \nand more realistic 5 percent. We can accomplish this by moving the \nprogram back to where it belongs--back to the States. In fact, \nGovernors have said that they can manage the program with the more \nmoderate spending increases if the Federal Government will simply get \nout of their way.\n  Medicaid is best addressed by giving States adequate funds and the \nauthority necessary to meet the needs of their most vulnerable \ncitizens, without interference and excessive regulation from \nWashington. Governors have been asking for this authority since 1989, \nwhen Bill Clinton, then Arkansas' chief executive, signed a resolution \ncalling for a freeze on the enactment of further Medicaid mandates. By \nextending States' authority, allowing Governors the opportunity to find \ninnovative ways to provide for the unique needs of their respective \nStates, we can keep the program at a manageable 40 percent growth rate \nby 2002, rather than the 100-percent increase in spending now projected \nby CBO.\n\n  Certainly, under this new structure, the States will have certain \nrequirements that must be met. For example, they will be accountable \nfor how Federal dollars are spent. States will spend 85 percent of what \nthey are now spending on mandatory benefits for the three of the most \nvulnerable populations: low-income pregnant women and children, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. There will also be protection from nursing \nhome costs against impoverishing spouses living at home. Likewise, \nStates will be allowed to use Medicaid funds to see that children are \nimmunized.\n  We must remember that Medicaid was designed to be an equal \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States. However, the \nFederal Government in recent years has effected what can only be seen \nas a take-over. Toward this end, all three branches of the Federal \nGovernment have played critical roles. Congress and the courts have \nexpanded eligibility while the bureaucracy has paralyzed the States \nwith regulations. The time has come to release the choke hold.\n  Medicaid now consumes 20 percent of State budgets--20 percent. That \nmeans fewer dollars for education, for fighting crime, and rebuilding \ninfrastructure.\n  Since 1990, the number of Medicaid recipients have increased by \nnearly one-third, as the current law has created over 70 different ways \nfor people to become eligible for benefits. Promising more benefits for \nmore people plus using the political system to negotiate supply and \ndemand is a prescription for failure. The price for this now includes \nannual deficits of up to $200 billion and a second mortgage on the \nfuture which our children and grandchildren will be forced to pay.\n  Today we change these dynamics. Today business as usual is over.\n  The reconciliation package we offer allows us to meet the needs of \nlow-income individuals, while at the same time controlling costs, \nimproving the program, and working toward a balanced budget. Under our \nproposal, Medicaid spending continues to grow, but at a slower, more \npredictable rate. The money is given to the States with the flexibility \nto design effective and innovative programs--programs to meet the \nindividual needs of their low-income citizens.\n  States can cover individuals and families with income below 250 \npercent of the Federal poverty level--that's $31,475 for a family of \nthree.\n  What we get away from are the thousands of pages of Federal mandates \nthat stifle creativity and our States' ability to develop programs that \nare both efficient and effective. Under our proposal, we repeal all \nmandates. We allow States to standards and provider payment rates. And \nwe no longer require Federal waivers to implement many of the \ninnovative delivery systems that have proven to be so successful in the \nprivate sector. In fact, we encourage States to combine programs and \nexperiment. However, as a safeguard, we ask States to develop a State \nplan and to submit annual reports and independent evaluations as well \nas provisions for fighting fraud and abuse.\n  As under current law, the Federal Government will match State \nfunding, up to an aggregate cap. Under this proposal, total Federal \nMedicaid spending will continue to increase over the period 1996-2002. \nIn this period, the Federal Government will provide $776 billion to the \nStates to meet the needs of poor children, the elderly, and people who \nare disabled. This is the equivalent of half of the total of today's \nFederal budget.\n  Between 1995 and 2002, total Federal spending on Medicaid will still \ngrow by over 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, the States will make these reforms work. Federal \nfunding will continue to increase while we provide the States with \ncontrol over how these funds will be spent. After 30 years of Federal \ncontrol, it is time to put the State in charge. Capping Federal \nspending will allow the States to enforce fiscal discipline. They will \nclearly know that the deep pockets of the Federal Government are not \nbottomless.\n  With firm control over these funds, we will unleash the creativity of \nthe States in meeting the needs of the low-income citizens. The States \nwill be able to expand managed care without asking permission of the \nWashington bureaucracy. Coupled with the welfare reform package just \npassed, the States will be able to experiment with ways to move \nfamilies off welfare and into work. The States will be able to design \nhealth insurance coverage so that the loss of Medicaid will no longer \nbe a barrier to leaving welfare.\n  The States will plan, design, and implement Medicaid reform which \nwill meet their own unique needs in ways Washington has not even \nstarted to think about. Taxpayers and beneficiaries alike will benefit \nfrom Medicaid reform and from achieving a balanced budget.\n\n\n                               tax reform\n\n  These are important reforms. Without them, the Medicare trust fund \nwill become insolvent within a few years, and Medicaid will eat away at \nour children's future, forcing Federal and State governments to borrow \nmoney for generations yet unborn. According to University of California \neconomist Alan Auerbach, if current spending trends and benefit \nformulas continue, ``the tax burden would be very close to absorbing \nall the lifetime income of future workers.''\n  To escape from this, we must prepare to move quickly and successfully \nbeyond our first objective of passing the budget resolution to embrace \nwhat should be our second, adopting initiatives that create an \nenvironment for economic growth. The only way to break out of deficit \nspending, without cutting off essential services and forfeiting on the \ncontracts the Federal Government has made with our senior citizens, is \nto renew healthy economic growth--growth which is above the 2.3- or \n2.5-percent range currently projected by official forecasting agencies.\n  This environment will be created only as Government adopts real tax \nreform--reform that shifts the bias against savings and investment in \nthe current Tax Code to a system that encourages saving and investment \nover consumption. Among the means to tap into the consumption base are: \nThe flat tax, a national sales tax, or an expanded IRA.\n  While some have emphasized the differences between these three plans, \nthey are grounded in the same economic concept of taxation, and I am \npleased to see their growing acceptance among Americans. Ultimately \nsome kind of compromise, possibly including elements from all of them, \nshould be possible.\n\n  The current income tax system has not only undermined economic \ngrowth, it has also undermined the economic position of American \nfamilies. We must act to provide tax relief for families that are \nalready facing intense pressures on other fronts. It is my desire to \nprovide tax relief in the context of the current reconciliation \npackage, but I also believe we must not overlook the opportunity to \nprovide the additional tax relief in future tax reform, financed by \ncontinued restraint in Federal spending growth.\n\n[[Page S15611]]\n\n  The tax relief offered in this reconciliation package is very much in \nthe realm of current possibilities. We offer a $245 billion tax cut \nwhich goes into effect only when the CBO has certified that deficit \nreduction is being achieved. Despite what some may say for political \nreasons, this tax relief does not come at the expense of Medicare. As \nthe generally more liberal Washington Post admitted, ``The Democrats \nhave fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection because it is useful \npolitically.'' In an earlier editorial, the Post opined that,\n\n       The Democrats are engaged in demagoguery, big time. And \n     it's wrong. . . . [The Republicans] have a plan. Enough is \n     known about it to say it's credible; it's gutsy and in some \n     respects inventive--and it addresses a genuine problem that \n     is only going to get worse. What Democrats have [on the other \n     hand] is a lot of expostulation, TV ads and scare talk.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the Washington Post.\n  Under the bill we propose today, using Medicare savings for tax cuts \nis illegal. The law requires that money saved on the Medicare Program \nwill stay in the Medicare Program. These are trust funds, the assets of \nwhich may not be used for any other purpose. And to say otherwise, as \nthe Post points out, is little more than politically motivated scare \ntactics.\n  The fact is, our efforts preserve and strengthen the Medicare trust \nfund. This is a promise made and a promise kept. Likewise our efforts \nbring the Federal budget into balance and provide substantial tax \nrelief for middle-income Americans. Again, promises made and kept. I \ncan only guess that these scare tactics are being used by some because \nfor so long these individuals have gotten by politically by making \npromises without keeping them. Well, you cannot have it both ways. You \nare either working for the kinds of changes the American people want, \nor you are locked into business as usual. You are either working for \nreform, or you are an agent of big Government, runaway spending, and \npolitical gridlock.\n\n  Let this reconciliation package show Americans who stands where on \nthese important issues.\n  Our plan offers a $500-a-child tax credit, encourages savings and \ninvestment, and offers other incentives for economic growth. Our \nproposal to cut taxes by $245 billion, offers relief for our middle \nclass--with over 70 percent of the $245 billion going to families \nmaking less than $75,000 a year. These provisions mean more security \nfor our families, more jobs for Americans, and greater stability in our \ncommunities.\n  Of the $245 billion Senate relief package, a full $223 billion will \ngo to families. The remaining $22 billion will strengthen businesses \nand lead to increased employment opportunity. It will also improve \nAmerica's ability to compete in the global community, with other \nnations that provide their businesses with strong incentives to compete \nwith us.\n  The four pillars of our proposal are: First, a $500 child tax credit; \nsecond, restoration and strengthening of individual retirement \naccounts; third, relief from overbearing estate taxes on families and \nbusinesses; and, fourth, reduction of the top rate of capital gains on \nindividuals and corporations.\n  These measures meet our promise to the American people. They \nrepresent a bold beginning in our effort to break with the failed \npolicies of the past. The current tax system double-taxes savings, \nthwarts investment, hinders productivity, increases prices, stifles \nwages, and hurts exports. It is complex, controlled by special interest \ngroups, and places disincentives on work.\n  We move to correct these deficiencies, and because we have cut \nspending, our bill balances the budget while making room for tax \nrelief. Americans need relief. Our economy needs a shot in the arm. \nEven Bill Clinton has admitted as much. I call on him to join us in our \nefforts to unleash the potential our economy has to move us into a bold \nand exciting future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Delaware has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from New York \nyield? I have about three more pages. May I finish?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course. Could we then extend morning business until \n1:30?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--and I do not intend to \nobject--if we can have the morning business time, whatever morning \nbusiness there was, divided equally between the two sides, whatever \namount of time, since we are off the bill. If we could have whatever \namount of time to be divided equally, then I would not object. If we \nare not going to have that allocation of time, then I feel compelled to \nobject.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I make the suggestion that morning \nbusiness be continued to 1:30 and that the time be equally divided?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, that does not include the \nlast 10 minutes--just from the time we go to morning business, divided \nequally.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, as I was stating, that is what this \nreconciliation package is all about--the future.\n  As Lincoln said, ``The struggle of today is not altogether for \ntoday--it is for a vast future, also''--a future that I believe will be \nvery bright if we succeed in our endeavors here today.\n  Our objective is to strengthen the American Dream--in our homes, in \nour schools, in our communities, in our States, and all across the \nland. Some have said that the dream is dead, that our children cannot \nexpect to lead a better life than that led by their parents. I strongly \ndisagree. However, I do believe that in order to meet the domestic \nchallenges before us--as we look to put our house in order here at \nhome--as we seek to maintain influence and leadership abroad, that we \nmust reinvent America to reflect the profound changes that are taking \nplace throughout the world as well as here in the United States.\n  We must build on principles that are tried and proven and good. We \nknow what works. We know what's failed. And we cannot march boldly into \nthe future with blueprints prepared for the past. This reinventing of \nAmerica must be thorough, it must create a nation that is \ncompassionate, responsible, and economically viable from the houses in \nour neighborhoods to the Houses of Congress. It must encourage self-\nreliance, risk-taking, and the confidence that diligent labor will be \nrewarded with security and even greater opportunity for reward.\n  These are the principles that built America, and they are the \nprinciples that will see us into a bright and expansive new millennium.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, earlier in the day, this morning, I was \n\n[[Page S15612]]\n\nspeaking without notes. I stated that under the Republican budget plan \nthe national debt will increase by $700 billion in the next 7 years. I \nwould like now to correct that to be the precise number, which is $669 \nbillion. That is how much more we will borrow.\n  I surely cannot think of any figure more explicitly to state the \nirresponsibility of a $245 billion tax cut. We will borrow every penny \nof that tax cut. If that were not the last thing to say, it turns out \nthat the tax cut is a tax increase on average for taxpayers with income \nup to $30,000--half of all taxpayers--because of the reduction in the \nearned income tax credit. For the rest the bill reduces taxes. And we \nwill borrow every penny of the tax cut, and persons working, paying \ntaxes, and trying to get along will pay for every cent of the tax \nincrease.\n  Mr. President, there is no way to get rid of a $5 trillion debt. I \nhope we know. Once again, to say, if it were not for that Contract With \nAmerica, we would not be talking about a $245 billion tax cut on this \nfloor, in this Chamber. We know it. We all know it. And I need not \nrepeat it again.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a motion here in my hand. It \nis a motion to recommit with instructions. And I would like to say to \nevery one of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the first \namendment that we deal with today in the U.S. Senate--that we are \ndealing with today, the day that we meant for dealing with amendments \nof absolutely enormous importance to the future of our country--is \ngoing to be the Medicare amendment.\n  I do not care how many meetings are held in the majority leader's \noffice, I do not care how many long speeches are given, I do not care \nhow many morning businesses are taken, and I do not care even to the \nfact that no Democrat, other than the chairmen of the Budget Committee \nand the Finance Committee, has been able to say a word on this day, the \nday we meant to be devoting an hour to a series of extraordinarily \nimportant amendments on Medicare, EITC, Medicaid, and other matters, \nthis amendment is going to be the first amendment laid down. It will \nrecommit the Republican $270 billion cut in Medicare to the Finance \nCommittee for further work.\n  I just want my colleagues to be fully aware of that fact. That will \nbe the first amendment, the Medicare amendment. And it will come \nregardless of what tactics are used or whatever dilatory procedures are \nadopted.\n\n  I will say that the reason we on the Democratic side are laying this \nmotion down is that the Republicans are cutting three times as much out \nof Medicare as they need to do in order to make the hospital insurance \ntrust fund solvent to the year 2006. There is no need to do $270 \nbillion of cuts.\n  So between the $89 billion that the trustees of the trust fund say is \nneeded to make the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund solvent, \nwhich is what all the rhetoric is around here, to make the thing \nsolvent--they all say, the trustees, that is, $89 billion--and the \nmajority party taking $270 billion out of Medicare to do the work for \nwhich only $89 billion is required, therefore, there is a gap of $181 \nbillion, to which I would think an ordinary inquiring citizen would \nsay: What is this $181 billion for if all we need is $89 billion to \nmake the Medicare trust fund solvent? And the answer, of course, is oft \nproclaimed, oft denied on the other side but a matter of irrefutable \nfact, and that is that it is going to be used to give in part an \nenormous tax break to families and institutions of wealth, and that \nemanates from the fact that this was part of the contract. It had its \ngenesis when Newt Gingrich on a sunny day went with a band of very \ncommitted, newly elected House Members and in front of all kinds of \nAmerican flags pronounced the 10 commandments, of which the greatest \nwas a tax cut, the crown jewel was a tax cut.\n  That having been done, obviously no less could be done in this body \nand so the $245 billion, or $225 billion tax cut became the mantra. So \nthat tax cut has to be achieved. We do not have that kind of money \nlaying around, nor does the average American family, and therefore \nwhere do we get it? We go to Medicare and to Medicaid, and we cut them \negregiously in order to do that.\n  I have no idea of how I am going to explain the damage done to the \npeople of West Virginia, to the seniors of West Virginia, to the health \ninstitutions of West Virginia, to the veterans of West Virginia by this \nMedicare cut. And I will be talking at length about that at the time we \nactually do lay the amendment down. But the amendment is simply to say \non our side we will not accept a $270 billion cut when $89 billion will \ndo the job, stamped and approved by those whose responsibility it is to \ndo the job, the trustees of the hospital insurance trust fund, in order \nto not have to do the $270 billion cut which the majority party is \ndoing for the purpose of raising enough money to give a tax cut to \nthose who do not need it.\n  I find this extraordinary. I find it certainly worth the meager 1 \nhour that we are going to be able to have on each side to discuss the \nMedicare amendment. But the Medicare amendment there will be, and it \nwill be the first one and it will happen.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for 2 hours I have been on the floor of \nthe Senate and the one thing we did not hear, which is at the heart of \nthis whole program, is how our Republican friends possibly justify not \ntaking the recommendation of the trustees, which is the amount to \nensure solvency for Medicare is $89 billion, and for them to justify a \n$270 billion cut. For 2 hours we have waited to hear the reasons for \nthat. We have not heard it. There is silence on the other side for the \nreasons that the Senator from West Virginia will point out and the \nreasons why we will have an opportunity to vote.\n  The Republican proposal is to provide not just the $87 billion, not \njust solvency for the Medicare Program but lavish tax breaks for the \nwealthiest individuals. That is what this is about. The Republicans \nhave not made that case. They have not justified why that is necessary \nand what the impact is going to be on senior citizens. It will be \ndouble their deductible, double their copay, a raise in the premium, \nand raise the age eligibility from 65 to 67.\n  Have you heard that explained by our Republican colleagues? No, you \nhave not, Mr. President. And squeeze the elderly so they will no longer \nhave a choice of doctors. That is what this legislation is about. We \nwant answers. We want answers from those who are trying to jam this \nthrough the Senate of the United States.\n  Why should we accept it? We will have an opportunity to reject it, \nand I hope that the Senate will speak for the American people and \nseniors this afternoon.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to touch on portions of this \nreconciliation bill that deal very effectively with the changes in \nMedicare provisions that are very good nationally and provisions that \nare very good for rural America.\n  The bill will put the financial situation of the Medicare Program, \nparticularly the part A hospital trust fund, but also part B for \nphysician services, on a sounder, more sustainable footing. This will \nensure that current and future Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa and \n\n[[Page S15613]]\n\nelsewhere can continue to depend on the program.\n  In addition to putting the program in good shape financially so that \nit lasts into the future, for the baby boomers particularly, we also \ncreate a new reformed Medicare alongside this traditional Medicare \nProgram that we have known for the last 30 years.\n  The Medicare reforms in the Senate bill will increase substantially \nthe per capita payments that Medicare programs make to low-\nreimbursement States like my State of Iowa, and other rural States of \nour Nation.\n  This is a very important component of this Medicare reform. If we are \nable to retain this reform by getting it through the Senate, by getting \nit through conference with the House, it would be a great benefit to \nrural communities of my State and of the United States--all of them. \nThe critically important issue is whether Medicare's per capita payment \nwill be reformed. I have to emphasize that. Reform of Medicare's per \ncapita payment is the essential element of bringing fairness and \nsoundness to the system. The payment Medicare makes to health plans for \nthose who enroll is the core element in the new reform program.\n  Currently, those per capita payments vary greatly from one part of \nthe country to another. The per capita payments in the highest \nreimbursement areas are as much as 300 percent greater than the per \ncapita payments in the low-reimbursement areas.\n  I would now refer my colleagues to this map. Many of the counties on \nthis map are in darker colors. All of those with darker colors are way \nbelow the national average in per capita reimbursement for Medicare.\n  The red areas make up only 10 percent of the counties. Dade County, \nFL, counties in California, counties in the metropolitan area of the \nEast, and metropolitan counties of the South, particularly Texas and \nLouisiana. Those counties in red are the highest per capita \nreimbursement counties in the United States. The variation from the \ndark, low-reimbursement counties to the high-reimbursement counties, \ncan be as much as 300 percent from the county with the highest per \ncapita payment to the county with the lowest.\n  Now, remember that this map shows per capita reimbursement. So the \nrating of our counties from low-reimbursement to high-reimbursement \ndoes not depend in any way upon the numbers of Medicare beneficiaries \nin the area. There are differences in input prices around the country, \nof course. But those differences cannot account for the very \nsubstantial reimbursement differences between the low-cost areas, the \ndark areas, versus the red areas, the very high-cost reimbursement \nareas.\n  The differences then reflect the fact that providers in those high-\ncost counties, high-reimbursement counties, are getting more money for \neach beneficiary that passes through the system. The more you go \nthrough the system, the more services allowed, the more times you see \nthe doctor, the more times you go to the hospital, the more payment you \nget.\n  There is no rational justification for such gross payment disparities \nfrom one region to another under the present Medicare system. This bill \nreforms that. Furthermore, I might say, the citizens in the low-\nreimbursement areas pay the same payroll taxes and the same Medicare \npremiums and the same deductibles as their cocitizens in the higher \nreimbursement areas. This is a problem that we should fix and fix soon. \nWe have gone a long way toward fixing it in this bill. And if we can \nretain that through the House-Senate conference, we will have very good \nprovisions for most of the United States because most of the United \nStates is rural.\n  On the traditional Medicare side, the bill does call for a spending \nslowdown, but it contains several provisions which I helped get in this \nbill which will help sustain health care services in rural America. We \nreinstituted the Medicare-dependent hospital program, which will \nprovide additional reimbursement for Iowa's 30 small rural counties \nthat are very dependent on Medicare programs and in a lot of other \nStates as well.\n  We establish a critical access hospital program which will help the \nvery smallest hospitals in rural America, including Iowa, redefine \ntheir mission, receive better reimbursement and thereby continue to \nprovide services in their communities.\n  We increase next the bonus payment for physicians who work in \ncommunities where there is a physician shortage. We do that from a 10 \npercent to a 20 percent bonus.\n  Next, we included for the third time in legislation sent from the \nSenate to the House my legislation which would reimburse physicians' \nassistants and nurse practitioners at 85 percent of the physician's \nrate when they provide the same services. I hope and believe that the \nbonus payment and the physician's assistance, nurse practitioner \nlegislation will increase the availability of primary health care \nservices in rural America, including my State of Iowa.\n  Finally, we authorize a program of telemedicine grants which could be \nvery helpful in Iowa with our developing telemedicine services. And, of \ncourse, Medicare beneficiaries may continue to participate in the \ntraditional Medicare Program and continue to choose their own doctors \nif that is what they want to do. They are going to have a choice for \nthe first time, a choice of keeping exactly what the Government has \noffered for 30 years or a choice of choosing an HMO, a medical savings \naccount, or their traditional association or union plan that they had \nwhere they last worked when they retired.\n  So, Mr. President, if we can hold the line in discussions with the \nHouse on these provisions, this Medicare reform could be good for the \nUnited States but also very good for our low-reimbursement rural \ncounties.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left of the 10 minutes that I \nallotted myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to respond to a point made by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York earlier, Senator Moynihan, when he \nsaid you cannot balance the budget by cutting taxes. I do not respond \njust to what Senator Moynihan said; I respond to this point because it \nis made continually by people on the other side of the aisle.\n  First of all, it certainly is ironic to be getting lectures from the \nother side about how to balance the budget. The only alternative on \ntheir side was voted down yesterday 96 to 0. That was the President's \nbudget. And it would never balance. A chimpanzee with a typewriter will \nbang out by accident the entire Encyclopedia Britannica before the \nPresident's budget would be balanced.\n  The question is whether or not Republicans then can walk and chew gum \nat the same time. And, of course, we can. We can balance the budget and \nthen cut taxes at the same time. We must do this. We can do this with \nminimal risk because we use very conservative and very credible CBO \nestimates, unlike the President who has been afflicted, like some of \nhis predecessors, with the narcotic of optimism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of a Democratic \nleadership amendment that will be offered to save Medicare. I support \nit because it will save lives and save American seniors from \nbankruptcy.\n  The Republican budget reconciliation before us would cut Medicare by \n$270 billion. And it does so for one reason: to pay for tax breaks for \nthe wealthy.\n  In contrast, the Democratic amendment would eliminate all but $89 \nbillion of this Medicare cut. This would guarantee enough savings to \nkeep Medicare solvent, but we would eliminate the provisions which the \nRepublicans have proposed as a new tax cut on senior citizens.\n  We want to eliminate the Republican plan to double Medicare premiums. \nWe want to eliminate the Republican plan to double the out-of-pocket \ndeductibles for seniors. We want to eliminate the Republican plan to \nforce seniors who want to keep their own doctor to pay for higher \ncharges for Medicare care. We believe that the American senior citizens \nshould get to pick their own \n\n[[Page S15614]]\n\ndoctor and be able to have health care that they can afford and not \nhave these increased premiums and deductibles. And we can do it by \nfocusing on solvency and efficiency.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not about partisan politics; it is \nabout the men and women that I call the GI Joe generation. These are \nthe men and women like my uncles and my father, ordinary men, who \nduring World War II were called to do extraordinary things. They fought \nover there so we could be free here.\n  Those are the women in my community we call affectionately Rosie the \nRiveter, women who worked at Martin Marietta, in shipyards helping to \nkeep the homefront going while our men were overseas.\n  Those are our senior citizens of today, the men and women of the \nWorld War II generation. They helped save Western civilization. So now \nit is up to us to save their Medicare. It is the very least we can do, \nthat on the brink of a new century we give our honor and our respect to \nthose who saved us during this last century.\n  Mr. President, in 1965, a great Democratic President knew that one \nillness could devastate a family, and they organized to be able to pass \nMedicare. That stands today. We have to keep the ``care'' in Medicare.\n  The Republican plan will mean less access to health care, fewer \ndoctor visits, less necessary tests and less of a focus on prevention. \nThis is not what we should be doing. Yes, we all want to balance the \nbudget, but I believe we can save Medicare and focus on solvency.\n  Let us go after that waste, let us go after that fraud, let us be \nmore efficient, but let us also remember the GI generation. They fought \nto save us, and the very least we can do now is to fight to save their \nhealth care.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just 8 short months ago, when Democrats \ndefeated the balanced budget amendment, the minority leader challenged \nus by saying: ``The budget is not going to be balanced in 2002 unless \nthe responsible people in 1995 start to focus on their share of the \nwork.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I submit that responsible people in Congress \nhave focused on their work, and now it is up to the minority to show \nwhether their statements supporting a balanced budget were a conviction \nor an alibi.\n  The reconciliation bill we are debating not only makes sense, it \nmakes history. For most of us, a balanced Federal budget is a distant \nmemory. For decades, it has been an empty political promise, but now it \nis just one final vote away. All that remains is one final act of \ncourage and vision.\n  That courage will be tested in the Congress by some difficult choices \nthat we will have to make here in the next 3 days. That vision will be \nmeasured in the President, as he becomes either a partner in the \nprocess or a partisan opponent. If either he or we are unequal to this \ntask, the patience of the public will be exhausted. We will have \nsquandered a unique opportunity, and we will feed a dangerous \ndisillusionment with American politics.\n  I am confident that this chance will not be missed; that this new \nCongress will show a new determination. But this bill involves more \nthan fiscal restraint. It represents a radical shift of resources away \nfrom Government, directly to families. It contains the single-most \npractical, compassionate way to provide immediate help and support to \nchildren. That is a fact that Americans must understand and that \nopponents cannot be allowed to ignore, because this budget matches its \ncommitment to cuts with commitments to families. It reduces both the \nreach of Government and the level of taxes, and it embodies important \nvalues that cannot be represented in a balance sheet.\n  Let me take three provisions of this budget as examples--priorities \nthat I have championed for years. These are measures that would \ndirectly improve the lives of families and children in my State and \npeople around the country. We have proposed them again and again, only \nto see them ignored or defeated. Now they are one step short from \nreality.\n  First, this budget includes a $500 child tax credit. This sounds \nsomewhat abstract, so let me be specific. The reconciliation package \nwould provide nearly $600 million of tax relief to Indiana families. \nOver 1 million Indiana children would be eligible for the credit, and \nnearly 100,000 Hoosier taxpayers would have their entire tax liability \neliminated by this single measure alone.\n  Democrats in this debate have tried to draw attention to children, \nand that is precisely where our attention should be. But children are \nnot raised by bureaucrats, they are raised by parents. If the choice is \nbetween $600 million spent by Government in Indiana and $600 million \nspent by parents, there is no choice. Parents are more compassionate \nand more capable than any Government program can ever be.\n  In reality, nearly 90 percent of the child tax credit will go to \nfamilies making less than $75,000 a year. Over 50 million American \nchildren will be eligible. Cutting Government and cutting taxes are \npart of the same movement in America, the movement to limit our \nGovernment and empower our people. One idea implies and requires the \nother. When we reduce public spending, we should increase the resources \nto families to meet their own needs. The theory is simple: A dollar \nspent by families is more useful than a dollar spent by Government.\n  Second, this package also includes an adoption credit of $5,000. \nAlong with the child tax credit, these two provisions represent about \n60 percent of the entire tax package. There is no more compassionate \nact than to provide an abandoned or abused child with a loving family, \nand the number of children who need those families is rising sharply. \nYet, at the same time, the number of adoptions has dropped by nearly 50 \npercent over the last 25 years and, on any given day, 37,000 children \nare waiting to be adopted.\n  Thousands of families would be eager to adopt if it were not for the \nprohibitive cost, now about $14,000 on average. A $5,000 credit would \nmake this a reasonable option for more parents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Indiana has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes. Is that permitted?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I wonder whether \nmorning business can be extended, in which case it will not be a \nproblem. If we extend 2 minutes on both sides, that will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With unanimous consent, morning business would \nbe extended.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, I think probably we \nought to give 2 minutes here and 2 minutes over there to be fair, which \nis the way we have done it in the past. In addition, I want to be \ncareful we do not extend the time because we have been clearing that \nwith the managers of the bill. I do not think I can just willy-nilly \nallow the expansion of time. I think 2 minutes is appropriate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is 2 minutes will be extended to the \nSenator from Indiana and I will have 2 minutes on top of what I already \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the minority side is 4 minutes and \n6 seconds. That would extend the time to 6 minutes and 6 seconds. The \nmajority side would have 2 minutes.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, thousands of families would be eager to \nadopt were it not for the prohibitive cost, now about $14,000 on \naverage. A $5,000 credit would make this a reasonable option for more \nparents.\n  Encouraging adoption is one of the most effective ways to care for \nchildren in need and at risk. Abused and abandoned children require \nloving homes more than they require any amount of bureaucratic spending \nin the status quo bill presented by the Democrats.\n\n[[Page S15615]]\n\n  Third, this reconciliation bill includes medical savings accounts, an \nidea that I was the first to introduce in the Senate. These accounts \nwill give families independence and choice on health care, the opposite \nof the President's approach. It delivers security without bureaucracy, \nproviding families the resources to care for their own needs.\n  The centerpiece of this reconciliation bill is a balanced budget. In \nthe future, this will be recalled as our contribution to history. If we \nignore our budget crisis, the child born this year will pay $187,000 \nover his lifetime just for interest on the national debt.\n  The argument for a balanced budget comes down to something simple: It \nis one of our highest moral traditions for parents to sacrifice for the \nsake of their children. It is the depth of selfishness to call on \nchildren to sacrifice for the sake of their parents.\n  If we continue on our current path, we will violate a trust between \ngenerations and earn the contempt of the future.\n  There is no doubt we must balance the budget, but in passing this \nbill, we will accomplish even more, because this bill displays a \npassion for limited Government, yet it also displays compassion for \nAmerican families. It finally returns responsibility to the Federal \nbudget, yet it also helps return abused and abandoned children to \nadoptive families.\n  It will improve the long-term health of our economy, and yet it will \nalso deliver short-term help to families and to children, relief that \nwill be felt next year and every year beyond.\n  These are not sideshows or distractions. This plan includes real \nrelief that will be felt and appreciated by the American people, and \nthat relief is specifically directed toward families with children. \nThis is actual, meaningful compassion, not the synthetic, failed \ncompassion of Government programs.\n  Mr. President, we have come to the beginning of the end of deficit \nspending in America. We have come to this place because there is no \nalternative. The work before us is difficult. But it is nothing more \nthan most Americans expect.\n  We have come to a time that is unique--an authentic moment of \ndecision. It is a moment to act worthy of our words, and to keep faith \nwith the future.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I want to talk about an amendment we \nare going to have coming up on Medicare. Just for the record, let me \nbriefly respond to the Senator from Indiana. In all due respect, I do \nnot see this compassion. I see $35 billion of cuts in nutrition \nprograms.\n  I had an amendment on the floor of the Senate that asked my \ncolleagues to go on record saying that if, as a result of this \nreconciliation bill with its cuts disproportionately targeted on \nvulnerable children in America, there was more hunger and there was a \nsituation where more children went without medical coverage, that we \nwould revisit this question next year and take corrective action, and I \ncould not get that sense-of-the-Senate amendment adopted. I do not see \ntoo much compassion in that vote, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I hope we start this debate soon on the Medicare. I \nwant to start out by responding to my friend from Iowa. I just quote my \nfriend from Illinois, Senator Simon. He has said it once, twice, 10 \ntimes, that to say we are serious about deficit reduction and then to \nhave $245 billion of tax giveaways is like saying to somebody we are \ngoing to put you on a strict diet but first we are going to give you \ndessert. It is a huge contradiction. I do not find people in cafes in \nMinnesota saying to me: Senator Wellstone, we are serious about deficit \nreduction, but would you first give us more tax breaks? That is not \nwhat I hear from people. They know it is a huge contradiction and that \nyou being cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. It makes no \nsense.\n  Second point. Mr President, $89 billion is the figure for the trust \nfund. Instead, we have $270 billion. People in Minnesota know how to \nadd and subtract. What we have going on here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate today is no less than an effort to make Medicare the piggy bank \nfor tax cuts, or tax giveaways. That is bad enough. What makes it worse \nis it is tax giveaways in inverse relationship to those people who \nleast need the tax breaks. Mr. President, that is simply \nunconscionable.\n  The third point. This is a rush to recklessness. I was surprised to \nhear my colleague from Iowa talking about the benefits of this for \nrural Iowa or rural Minnesota. I say to my colleague from Iowa, \nunderstand that in your proposal you have reimbursement to hospitals, \nrural hospitals, 2.5 percent less than rate of medical inflation. I \ntell you right now that our hospitals and clinics in rural America, in \ngreater Minnesota, do not have the large profit margin; that is point \none. Point two, they have a disproportionate amount of their patient \nmix--60 percent, 70 percent.\n  What I am saying to people watching this debate is that, in rural \nAmerica, many of the people that come to our hospitals and clinics are \nelderly. Medicare is hugely important for them. That makes up a large \nshare of the payments that go to these hospitals. They do not have the \nprofit margin. They have a large percentage of the population that are \nelderly, who depend upon adequate Medicare reimbursement, and you have \nin your formula 25.5 percent less than the rate of inflation. In rural \nMinnesota and in North Dakota and in Kentucky and in rural Iowa, the \nrural heartland all across this country, the issue, Mr. President, is \nnot just whether we can afford a doctor, it is whether we can find a \ndoctor.\n  This is a rush to recklessness. This is a fast track to foolishness. \nAsk your providers, ask your nurses, ask your physician assistants, ask \nyour doctors, ask your elderly, ask their children, ask their \ngrandchildren. What you are about to do is very reckless with the lives \nof people.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you something. I just get more than a \nlittle bit angry when I see this stereotype and hear this stereotype \nabout the elderly. You would think that the elderly are a bunch of \n``greedy geezers'' that are traveling all over the country playing golf \nat the swankest golf courses there are. Mr. President, in my State of \nMinnesota, 70,000 seniors live below the Federal poverty line. In my \nState, of the 635,000 Medicare recipients, half of them have annual \nincomes under $20,000 a year. Mr. President, in my State of Minnesota, \nof the 635,000 Medicare beneficiaries, they are paying, on the average, \nover $2,000 out-of-pocket. Right now, for many seniors, catastrophic \nhealth care costs are a nightmare. They are terrified of prescription \ndrug costs.\n  Mr. President, what we have here is an effort to make Medicare the \npiggy bank for tax cuts--rather tax giveaways, which flow in the main \nto the highest income citizens of the United States of America. There \nis no standard of fairness behind this proposal. People will see \nthrough it.\n  The second thing that is so unfortunate, so unconscionable, so \nunthinking about this proposal, will be its impact on the people of \nthis country. Mr. President, $89 billion is not $270 billion. Please do \nnot tell senior citizens their premiums will not go up, their copays \nwill not go up, and in no way, shape, or form do you have to worry, and \nyour hospitals, clinics, and providers will all get adequate \nreimbursement, and eligibility will not change, and we will just take \n$270 billion out of this health care sector.\n  Mr. President, senior citizens do not believe it, they should not \nbelieve it, they will not believe it. That is why this amendment that \nwill be laid down by my colleague, the Senator from West Virginia, \ndeserves the full support of every Senator in this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15615-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the pending business is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 1357 is the pending business.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding that the ranking member, Senator \nExon, is now prepared to offer the Medicare amendment. We have not yet \nreached an overall agreement. So I cannot say it will not be second-\ndegreed, or whatever. At least we can start on that amendment. I guess \nit is a motion to recommit. I did not see the leader on the floor. I \nthink we can start on that. That would give us some time to start \ntalking back and forth.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time has \nbeen consumed thus far?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has used 1 hour 15 \nminutes, and the minority leader has used 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it would be our intention to devote an \nhour on this particular amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. On each side?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. An hour on this side, and whatever amount of time the \nmajority would care to use.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that we have an hour on each side \non the motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in view of the agreement just reached, we \nare prepared to offer the Medicare amendment. I hope that the chair \nwill recognize the Senator from West Virginia for whatever time he \nmight need. I remind him that we have an hour each, which can be \ndivided between the managers of this particular amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we will later debate what the Senator from \nMinnesota had to say. I have these figures, which show that about $477 \nmillion per year would go into Minnesota to help families with \nchildren. I assume those families with children would be happy to have \ntax relief.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to commit Senate bill 1357 to \nthe Committee on Finance with instructions to report the bill back to \nthe Senate within 3 days, not to include any day the Senate is not in \nsession, making changes in legislation within that committee's \njurisdiction to eliminate any reductions in Medicare beyond the $89 \nbillion necessary to maintain trust fund solvency through the year \n2006, and to reduce revenue reductions for upper-income taxpayers by \nthe amount necessary to ensure deficit neutrality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Was the Senator asking unanimous consent?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No. The Senator was laying down a motion, and the \nSenator wishes to speak on that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the motion to commit is as follows:\n\n                   Motion to Commit With Instructions\n\n       Mr. President, I move to commit the bill S. 1357 to the \n     Committee on Finance with instructions to report the bill \n     back to the Senate within 3 days not to include any day the \n     Senate is not in session making changes in legislation within \n     that Committee's jurisdiction to eliminate any reductions in \n     Medicare beyond the $89,000,000,000 necessary to maintain \n     trust fund solvency through the year 2006 and to reduce \n     revenue reductions for upper-income taxpayers by the amount \n     necessary to ensure deficit neutrality.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In about 2 hours, I guess, every U.S. Senator will \nbe asked to vote on the future of a program that makes the difference \nbetween security and insecurity, peace of mind and terror, health and \nillness, and sometimes, obviously, life or death for 30 million older \nAmericans--including 330,000 seniors from my own State of West \nVirginia.\n  We offer this amendment, Democrats, to give Senators one more chance \nto preserve Medicare, and stop the destruction of one of America's \nproudest, most enduring achievements.\n  We make a very straightforward proposition with our amendment to save \nMedicare.\n  This amendment calls for sending the Medicare part of this package \nback to the Senate Finance Committee, and says Medicare should not be \ncut beyond the $89 billion needed to keep the trust fund solvent for \nanother 10 years. That means we want to restore the $181 billion of \nunnecessary, dangerous Medicare cuts back to the trust fund, back to \nthe health care system that seniors depend on every single day of their \nlives.\n  This amendment is a final opportunity, quite frankly, for our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to defend the Medicare trust \nfund from a mind boggling raid that will cut health care benefits, \nincrease seniors' costs, and threaten the very existence of hospitals--\na raid that is designed purely and simply to pay for tax breaks tilted \nin favor of the most affluent, comfortable households in this land.\n\n  The reconciliation bill on the floor cuts Medicare by $270 billion \nover 7 years. We all know that now.\n  We have all been told that this will save Medicare, keep it solvent, \nand, indeed, make the program stronger. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. The \nprofessional experts in charge of keeping the books for Medicare say \nexactly $89 billion is needed to keep Medicare solvent for the same \nnumber of years.\n  Hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other health care providers in every \none of our States believe with absolute certainty that cuts of this \nsize will disintegrate the kind of health care coverage that 30 million \nAmerican senior citizens have counted on for over three decades.\n  When the average income of senior citizens is, in fact, $17,750 on a \nnational basis, and closer to $10,700 in my own State, and when they \npay 21 percent of their income for health expenses as it is now--that \nis, unless they are over 84, in which case the figure rises to 34 \npercent--no wonder they are incredulous, no wonder they are petrified \nto hear their Medicare is being used to pay for tax breaks, tax \ngiveaways to far, far wealthier Americans and every imaginable kind of \ncorporation.\n  I have no way that I can think of to explain to the 330,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my State why their Medicare deductibles will double, \ntheir premiums will skyrocket, and West Virginia hospitals are \nthreatened with the possibility of losing $25 million in 1996 and more \nthan $681 million over the next 7 years.\n  I keep saying I wish this were some kind of a dream. I keep expecting \nto wake up and find something different. I wish this were some kind of \na dream. But the threat is real. It is written into the pages of the \nbill before the Senate unless we send it back.\n  I can only report what I read in the budget package. Mr. President, \n$270 billion will be cut out of Medicare. That is fact. Mr. President, \n$225 billion will be given away in tax breaks and giveaways. That is \nfact. Then there is the $187 billion sliced out of Medicaid, subject to \nanother amendment leaving it in tatters as it is chopped into a block \ngrants which States are not ready, in fact, to handle, with virtually \nnone of the guarantees left for Americans hurting the most.\n  The response on the other side will be that we are exaggerating, that \nwe are trying to scare seniors, that we do not understand.\n  Mr. President, this budget is a scary budget. It is a very scary \nbudget. I am the very first to admit that I fear for my State. I fear \nfor 330,000 older West Virginians. I fear for the health care system in \nAmerica. I do not say that as a Democrat or as a Republican. I say that \nas a citizen of the State of West Virginia. I am afraid of the \nconsequences of what it is likely we are going to do here, and hence \nthis amendment.\n  When the very people who are trustees of Medicare say only $89 \nbillion is needed to keep the trust fund solvent for 10 years, it is \nfrightening to see a budget that sucks $270 billion out of the lifeline \nfor older Americans. That is what older Americans are now coming to \ntruly believe on their own, not because of what we say but because of \nwhat they are beginning to find out on their own. Their fear is genuine \nand justified.\n  Today, we offer one last chance to Senators to protect Medicare and \nolder Americans. Vote for this amendment to ensure the solvency of \nMedicare for another 10 years. There is plenty of time for a \nbipartisan, thoughtful effort \n\n[[Page S15617]]\n\nto plan Medicare's future for the 50 years beyond that period of time. \nVote for this amendment to protect Medicare from highway robbery, from \nbeing used to pay for tax breaks, to take money from seniors with an \naverage income of $17,500 and hand it over to Americans with incomes \nfrom $75,000 all the way up to millions. Vote for the right way to \nbalance the budget and for a balance in the Nation's priorities.\n  We offer this amendment to remind every Senator that he and she can \nrespond to the seniors, the families, and the health care providers of \nAmerica who are scared by rejecting the part of this budget that casts \na dangerous, deep, and dark shadow over Medicare--that is, unless this \namendment is passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if this Republican bill becomes law, it \nwill devastate senior citizens, working families, and children in every \ncommunity in America. It is a transparent scheme to take from the needy \nto give to the greedy. It makes a mockery of the family values the \nRepublican majority pretend to represent.\n  The Republican assault on Medicare is a frontal attack on the \nNation's elderly. Medicare is part of Social Security. It is a contract \nbetween the Government and the people that says, ``Pay into the trust \nfund during your working years, and we will guarantee good health care \nin your retirement years.''\n  It is wrong for the Republicans to break that contract. It is wrong \nfor Republicans to propose deep cuts in Medicare in excess of anything \nneeded to protect the trust fund. It is doubly wrong for the \nRepublicans to propose those deep cuts in Medicare in order to pay for \ntax breaks for the wealthy.\n  The cuts in Medicare are too harsh and too extreme. Mr. President, \n$280 billion over the next 7 years--premiums will double, deductibles \nwill double, the age of eligibility will be raised to 67, and senior \ncitizens will be squeezed hard to give up their own doctors and HMO's.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Senior \ncitizens' median income is only $17,750. Mr. President, 40 percent have \nincomes of less than $10,000. Because of gaps in Medicare, senior \ncitizens already pay too much for the health care they need. Yet the \nadditional premiums alone under the Republican plan will add $2,400 to \nthe health care of the average elderly over the next 7 years.\n  The Medicare trust fund trustees have stated clearly $89 billion is \nall that is needed to protect the trust fund for a decade--not $280 \nbillion. The Democratic alternative provides that amount. It will not \nraise premiums an additional dime. It will not raise deductibles a \ndime. It will give senior citizens real choices, not force them to give \nup their own doctor.\n  The Republican Medicare plan also deserves to be rejected because of \nthe lavish giveaways to special interest groups in the House and Senate \nproposals. Insurance companies got what they wanted--the opportunity to \nget their hands on Medicare and obtain billions of dollars in profits. \nThe American Medical Association got what it wanted--lower reduction in \ndoctors' fees and little on malpractice awards. The list goes on and \non.\n  Clinical labs no longer have to meet Federal standards to guarantee \nthe accuracy of tests. Federal standards to prevent the abuse of \npatients in nursing homes will be eliminated. Pharmaceutical firms will \nbe given the right to charge higher prices for their drugs.\n  Because of this unjust Republican plan, millions of elderly Americans \nwill be forced to go without the health care they need. Millions more \nwill have to choose between food on the table, adequate heat in the \nwinter, paying the rent, or paying for medical care.\n  Senior citizens have earned their Medicare benefits. They paid for \nthem and they deserve them. The Republican attacks on Medicare will \nmake life harder, sicker, and shorter for millions of elderly Americans \nwho built this country and made it great. They deserve better from \nCongress. Our Democratic alternative protects senior citizens and \npreserves Medicare, and that is just what the Rockefeller proposal \noffers.\n  I see my colleague and friend from North Dakota here. I will be \ninterested if he would tell us what his understanding of the \nimplications of this program would be to those in rural America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have been told by some that the $270 \nbillion reduction to Medicare is not a cut, that Medicare spending will \nstill increase under this budget reconciliation bill. That is true. \nBut, Mr. President, 200,000 new Americans every month become eligible \nfor Medicare. More Americans are becoming eligible for Medicare and \nhealth care costs are increasing.\n  We have determined what it will cost for the Medicare Program over \nthe next 7 years based on these facts. The plan is to cut $270 billion \nfrom that projection, so of course it is a cut. This plan will end up \noffering senior citizens this kind of Faustian bargain: We will offer \nyou a deal in which you get less health care and you pay more for it.\n  In our country, we have talked about labels recently. When you go to \nthe grocery store, there is a label on the food. Pick up a can of peas \nor a box of pasta, and the label says what is in it--how much sodium, \nhow much fat. You have to be honest and truthful about labels on a can \nof peas in a grocery store. No such requirement exists here in the \nCongress. You can label it whatever you want to label it and do it with \nimpunity.\n  This proposal is labeled ``A Proposal To Save Medicare.'' The very \npeople who opposed Medicare when it was created 30 years ago--97 \npercent of the present majority party voted against Medicare because \nthey said they did not believe in it--are now telling us they are the \nones who are going to save it.\n  If these folks were physicians in an emergency room and you came in \nwith an ingrown toenail, they would cut off your leg and then boast \nabout how your toe does not hurt anymore.\n  The fact is, you do not have to cut $270 billion to save Medicare. We \nshould make an adjustment in Medicare but it need only be about a $89 \nbillion adjustment. That is what the experts tell us is needed to \nextend the hospital insurance trust fund. So what is this debate all \nabout? It is about getting money from the Medicare Program, with \nsubstantial cuts, in order to provide tax relief to some other folks. \nThat is about pols and pals--politicians and their pals.\n  Who gets the tax cut? Well, first of all, let's consider who gets the \ntax increase? The Joint Tax Committee says 50 percent of the people in \nthis country are going to pay higher taxes as a result of \nreconciliation bill. Here's a multiple choice question--which people \nwill pay higher taxes, those with incomes in the lowest 50 percent or \nthose in the highest 50 percent? Guess what, the majority party has \nsaid to us that the lowest 50 percent of the income earners should pay \nhigher taxes, but the top 1 percent shall pay substantially lower \ntaxes.\n  Where does all that money come from, to provide for the tax break to \nthe upper income folks? Out of the $270 billion cut in the Medicare \nProgram.\n  As I have said repeatedly, this is all about choices and priorities. \nIf one thinks Medicare has not been worthwhile in freeing senior \ncitizens from the fear of getting sick and not having the money to \nattend to their health care needs, then just decide there should be no \nMedicare Program. I respect that. I do not agree, but I respect that.\n  But this is about choices. Those of us who believe there ought to be \na Medicare Program that senior citizens can rely on --and we are the \nones who started Medicare, still believe in it and believe it should be \nthere in the future--we say, send this legislation back, recommit it, \nand bring it back to the Senate floor with an adjustment in the tax cut \nand use that money to reduce the cuts to Medicare.\n  I had an amendment on the floor of the Senate 2 days ago that was \nvery simple. It said, let us at least limit the tax cut to those whose \nincomes are at or below $250,000 a year. Just limit the tax cut for at \nleast those who make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, \nand use the $50 billion in savings from that over 7 years to reduce \n\n[[Page S15618]]\n\nthe hit on Medicare--to reduce the hit on senior citizens.\n  Do you know what? We could not get that passed. It was a party-line \nvote. Every single Member of the majority party voted against that \nsimple amendment.\n  This debate is about choices and priorities. Our choices are to save \nMedicare for the long term. Our choice is not to provide tax cuts to \nthe richest Americans and send the bill for those tax cuts to some of \nthe most vulnerable Americans.\n  By far the majority of the senior citizens in North Dakota live on \nless than $15,000 a year in income. To say to those folks that we are \ngoing to take from your Medicare Program so we can offer tax cuts to \nthe richest Americans makes no sense at all. Those are priorities that \nare not in keeping with what the American people would like us to do.\n  We need to balance the budget. We need to agree on a sensible way to \ndo that. But we do not need to dismantle programs that work. We do not \nneed to injure the Medicare Program and place a higher burden on senior \ncitizens in order to provide a tax cut to the richest Americans. That \nis a terrible choice and I hope Members of both sides of the aisle will \nvote for this amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nKennedy, and others.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Hampshire \nor the Senator from Michigan--a number of questions have been raised on \nthis side. We have been listening for months now to the attack on an \n$89 billion cut as opposed to a $270 billion cut.\n  I raised the question, what has happened to the $181 billion? Is this \nreally going to a tax cut? What about the doubling of the deductible in \nthe premiums? Things of this sort.\n  I ask if any on the other side care to explain why they would vote \nagainst my amendment, if, in fact, they are going to? I would just be \ninterested if they have anything they choose to say?\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from----\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield on his time, I will be happy to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will not yield. Because I would like to hear the \nresponse from the majority party as to some of the reasons for their \ncertainty as to the need for the $270 billion cut which is causing so \nmuch consternation throughout the land.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from West Virginia is going to propound a \nquestion to myself and the Senator from Michigan----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator does not have to answer.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to respond to the question in the context \nof his timeframe. It seems rather unusual in speeches to be propounding \nquestions and not wish to seek response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No; the Senator is not going to engage in this kind \nof game. It is clear the majority does not want to answer some of these \nbasic questions. So at this point I will call on the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while we are waiting I would like to be \nadded as an additional cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There are Democratic Members on their way down here \nto speak. They have not gotten down here to speak, and I hope they \nrecognize they will have to get here very quickly. But I will yield \nmyself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, one of the things that most concerns \nme about all of this is the concept of senior citizens being able to \nkeep their own physician. And one of the things that most scares me, \nthat puts genuine fear in the heart not just of this Senator but of the \nseniors that I represent, is the fear they are going to lose their \nright to choose their own doctor.\n  I say this with a special feeling because, over the last couple of \nyears, when we were debating health care, that was one of the things \nthat was absolutely going to be able to happen. People are going to be \nable to have their own doctor. But there is this enormous movement in \nthe private sector to move people into health maintenance organizations \nto cut costs down.\n  I read this, this morning, in the newspaper, that Washington General \nHospital, now DC General, which is kind of the last resort for the \npeople of Washington DC, is thinking, now, of closing down, merging \nwith Howard University. That is happening now in the private sector. I \nhesitate to even imagine what happens if you take tens of millions of \ndollars away from them, or institutions like them, over the next number \nof years.\n  How many essential services in our city--I know in the city of \nChicago, I know either seven or eight emergency rooms of hospitals have \nclosed down under the current free-market system. And the exacerbation \nof all that, under these drastic Medicare cuts, is something which I \nthink is truly terrifying.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the Senator's understanding of the effect of \nthis particular provision in the Republican budget bill and the impact \non the people of West Virginia, in terms of the seniors there, their \nincomes, and what the Senator thinks would be the impact?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will answer the Senator from Massachusetts that \nfor the average senior in West Virginia, their income would be about \n$10,700 a year, and 21 percent of that they already spend on health \ncare. There is little left on the margin just to survive. If this \nhappens, the deductible will double, and the premiums will go up. All \nkinds of costs will increase, and services I believe, particularly in \nthe rural areas, will decrease.\n  I think that, No. 1, they are going to feel like they have been \nabandoned. Whether or not they will be is yet to be fully determined. \nBut they are going to believe they are going to be abandoned. Hospitals \nin rural areas are going to close down. They already are closing. That \nwill pick up.\n  So in a State which is 97 percent mountain and 3 percent flat, as the \nSenator knows, they are going to feel cut off from health care, and in \nmany cases they will be cut off from health care because they will have \nno acute care beds that will be available to them because of hospitals \nthat are closing down.\n  So expenses will go up. Their fear will skyrocket. Their hospitals \nwill begin to close down. Doctors are going to become much more \nreluctant to go into the rural areas of West Virginia because of the \ncuts in the graduate medical education. You are going to find the kinds \nof doctors who have traditionally gone into rural areas to service \nseniors are not going to be trained because they are no longer going to \nbe funded by the Republican cuts under Medicare because of the cuts in \ngraduate medical education.\n  So I do not know any way that they win. I can think of no way that \nthey win, and I can think of 10 ways they lose.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, if part B goes up, that is directly \ndeducted from your Social Security check. Do you anticipate that part B \npremiums will go up, and, therefore, the Social Security checks will be \naffected for those in West Virginia as well?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It is not necessary to anticipate it. It is a fact. \nThey will go up. They will double.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the impact on the Social Security check?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is just more money out of pocket. Of course, \nthe ironic thing there is that 40 percent of what it is that the \nmajority party is cutting out of Medicare--$100 billion--cannot even be \nused to help the trust fund, cannot even be used because it is from \npart B.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. He makes an excellent \npoint to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This comes right out of the Social Security checks. That is where it \nis coming from. It is not coming from some other place when an elderly \nperson gets that Social Security check. The amount that they pay in \nthat monthly premium is going to double under what the Republicans have \nbefore us.\n\n[[Page S15619]]\n\n  Mr. President, Halloween is just around the corner. It is trick-or-\ntreat time. This is a trick-or-treat bill. The trick is on American \nseniors, and the treats are the $245 billion tax cuts for the \nwealthiest in this country. That is what it is. They are saying we are \ntrying to scare our seniors. It is not a scare. It is an actual assault \non the seniors of this country so that we can treat the wealthiest.\n  What is this debate really about? Mr. President, here is what the \ndebate is about right here on this poster. This is what the debate is \nabout. Make no mistake about it. Notice the date on these words. \nOctober 24, 1995. That was yesterday. Last night in a speech to the \nAmerican Conservative Union here in Washington, here is what the \nmajority leader of the Senate said:\n\n       ``* * * I was there fighting the fight--voting against \n     Medicare--one of 12--because we knew it wouldn't work in \n     1965.\n\n  There you have it. The majority leader is saying he is proud of the \nfact that he voted against Medicare in 1965 because he says, ``We knew \nit wouldn't work.'' It will not work? Prior to 1965, only 46 percent of \nour elderly had health care. Today, 99 percent of our seniors have \nhealth care coverage. Tell me it has not worked. I want the majority \nleader to come out here on the Senate floor and tell the American \npublic that Medicare has been a failure, that it has not worked, that \nhe was right in 1965 when he voted against it. I wish he would tell me. \nI wish he would tell me. I wish he would tell me about my own family.\n  When my father was on Social Security and an ex-coal miner, we had no \nincome. All he had was a Social Security check. We lived in a small \ntown of 150 people. He had black lung disease. He was in his seventies. \nHe had no health care. We had no money. We had no life savings. We had \na little house and a half acre of property.\n  Every winter he would get sick and they would have to take him in to \nMercy Hospital in Des Moines, and, thank God, the Sisters of Mercy \nwould take care of him, and they would send him home. It happened like \nclockwork every year. That was the only health care he had when he was \nsick as a dog and they would have to rush him to the hospital. But \nbefore he died, Medicare came into existence in 1965. And the last 2 \nyears of his life was by far the best years he had in his later years \nbecause then he could get health care. He got it when he needed it, not \nlater on when he was so sick. But he got it up front, and he got it \nwith his head held high and not coming in the back door to get charity.\n  I often think that if my father had had Medicare during the 1950's \nand in the early 1960's, he would have lived longer and he would have \nbeen a lot healthier.\n  So the majority leader better not try to tell this Senator that \nMedicare was a mistake and that it has not worked. I have seen too many \nin my own family. I have seen too many elderly people in Iowa who, \nbefore 1965, did not have health care living in those small towns and \ncommunities. Their lives were made better and healthier, and their \nchildren's lives were made better because Medicare came in and provided \nhealth care for the elderly.\n  I delight in talking to young people about Medicare. They think it is \njust for the elderly. I do this a lot of times with college students. I \nalways ask them. I say, ``How many of you have grandparents that are on \nMedicare?'' Most of them raise their hands. I say, ``After you get out \nof school and you start earning money, for every $100 that you earn, \nhow much of that money is going to go into the Medicare trust fund to \npay for Medicare? Out of every $100 you earn, how much goes in so that \nyour grandparents get Medicare?'' I tell you, you should hear the \nanswers I get: $20 out of $100, $10 out of $100, and all kinds of wild \nguesses. When I tell them it is $1.45, for every $100 they earn, they \nspend $1.45 so their grandparents do not have to live with them, so \ntheir grandparents get quality, affordable health care, they are \namazed.\n  I asked them. ``Do you think it is worth it? Is it worth $1.45 out of \n$100 to put into the Medicare trust fund?'' When you put it that way, \nthey think it is a darned good deal.\n  So, yes. We have some problems with the Medicare trust fund, long \nterm, short term, and we can address those. The other side is always \ntalking about the trustees; how the trustees said it is broke and we \nhave to fix it. There is nothing in the trustees' report that says we \nhave to take $270 billion out of Medicare. That is what the Republicans \nwant to do to--give a $245 billion tax break for the wealthiest in our \ncountry.\n  What our amendment does is send the bill back to Finance, and come \nback with an $89 billion cut in Medicare to make it secure but to keep \nit and to save it for our elderly. Let us not have this trick-or-treat \nbill that the Republicans have brought out here to trick our elderly \nand to take away their hard-earned savings and put it in a $245 billion \ntax break for the wealthiest in our country. That is what this battle \nis about. Make no mistake about it.\n  I yield back my time. I thank the Senator for yielding me that time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 28\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the Senator from Michigan has 60 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Does the Senator from Michigan wish to allocate time \nto anyone?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time I yield myself such time as I may need, and \nI will be very brief. Then I will yield to other Members--the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who has been in the chair.\n  We have obviously been hearing a number of claims, accusations, and \nallegations both about the motives of the Republicans as well as the \nsubstance of the legislation before us. I know that other speakers will \nget into more detail in responding, but I will just point out a few \nthings.\n  The comments with respect to the condition of the part A trust fund \nare not just whimsical comments, they are inaccurate comments, and they \nare very important comments to America's seniors. They should know \ntoday that starting in 1996, for the first year the part A trust fund \nwill begin to run a deficit. We are no longer talking about problems \nthat are somewhere out in the future that we cannot visualize. We are \ntalking about concrete problems that are going to be before us in the \nvery immediate sense soon.\n  Just last year we heard from the entitlement commission, a bipartisan \ngroup of Members of Congress who reported to us that at the rate of \ngrowth in entitlement spending in this country in just 15 to 20 years, \nentitlement spending and interest on the Federal debt alone would \nexceed all Federal tax collections combined. These are not problems \nthat can be fixed by the old process of finding a few extra dollars and \nthrowing them into the Medicare trust fund. These are problems that can \nonly be fixed through substantive changes of the sort which we are \noffering here.\n  The Medicare Program is like a ship that is badly damaged. It is \nleaking water. There are two ways you can deal with the problem. You \ncan pour more water over the side and try to bail your way out, but \nthat will not solve the problem in a long-term sense. The alternative \nis to repair the damage. That is what we are trying to do because we do \nnot want to just guarantee that Medicare will be safe for an additional \n1 year or 2 years. We want to change the program to make it stronger, \nto protect it, to preserve it well into the future. We want to give \nseniors the right to choose a program that is best for them, and we \nwant to make sure that we do that in a way that is not just cover us \nfor the next election but, rather, in a way that truly protects seniors \nin the long-term sense.\n  And so at this time, I will yield the floor and grant whatever time \nhe may need to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Michigan. I \nwish to respond to some of the points made here by members of the other \nside who, I am sure, have done so with sincerity but who have been \ninaccurate to say the least.\n  Initially, let me state that the purpose of the Medicare reform which \nhas \n\n[[Page S15620]]\n\nbeen put into this bill is to significantly strengthen the program \nwhich has cared for our seniors well but which was designed in the \n1960's and which is not functioning well as we move into the year 2000. \nIt is like a 1960 automobile trying to drive on a turnpike in 1995. The \nfact is that the muffler has fallen off, the pistons are not working \nvery well, the chassis is out of line, and it needs to be fixed.\n  In fact, it needs to be significantly strengthened, and that is what \nwe have proposed. The basic thrust of the Republican plan is to give \nseniors essentially the same options which Members of Congress have.\n  Now, why is that so outrageous? We are saying to seniors, ``You shall \nhave choice. You shall have the ability to go into the marketplace, if \nyou wish, and choose other options than what you are presently supplied \nunder Medicare.'' We are not saying they have to do that. In fact, we \nare making it very clear, under the Senate plan, if a senior decides to \nstay with fee for service, which is what most seniors have today, which \nis where they go out and choose their doctor individually, they can \ncontinue in that framework, they can continue to do that. That is their \ndecision.\n  What we are saying, however, is if they should choose, they will have \nother choices. If they should choose, as like many people, their sons \nand daughters, who are in the workplace, to go with some group of \ndoctors who practice together in what is known as a PPO, they will have \nthat option. If they choose, as many of their sons and daughters do \ntoday who are in the workplace, to go with an HMO, where you have an \naffiliation of doctors and hospitals and delivery systems, they will \nhave that option.\n  There are a variety of other options which we cannot even anticipate \nbecause the marketplace has not created them yet that we will make \navailable to our seniors.\n  And in giving our seniors those choices, what else do we do? We also \nsay we are going to give you some economic benefit from being a \nthoughtful purchaser of your health care. Under the Senate plan, if a \nsenior chooses a plan which delivers the same or better care than they \nare presently getting from their fee-for-service plan but happens to \ncost less, we are going to allow the senior to keep that savings. We \nare going to create an incentive amongst seniors to look at other \noptions. We are not going to say they have to look at them. We are not \ngoing to say they even have to take them. We are simply going to say \nyou have that option.\n  So what is so dastardly about giving seniors the same option which \nMembers of Congress have? I do not understand it myself. But the other \nside is outraged for some reason. I think their outrage functions more \nfrom politics than from substance.\n  Let us talk a little bit about substance, about some of the points \nthat have been made by the other side. First, they say there is a $270 \nbillion cut. That is an interesting concept. Only in Washington would a \nprogram where you are going to increase spending by $346 billion over \nthe next 7 years be deemed a cut in spending.\n  This is the chart, ladies and gentlemen. Medicare spending goes up \n$349 billion--I was off by $3 billion; I apologize-- $349 billion over \nthe next 7 years. That is a cut in spending? It still remains, under \nthat spending increase, the fastest growing, most significant \nexpenditure in the Federal budget. In fact, if you compare the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare spending over the next 7 years to the rate of \nMedicare spending over the last 7 years, you would have to conclude \nthat over the last 7 years we ``savaged it,'' under the Democrat terms, \nbecause in the last 7 years it grew to $923 billion spent on Medicare, \nbut over the next 7 years we are going to spend $1.6 trillion on \nMedicare.\n  So clearly there is no cut here in spending on Medicare. In fact, per \nbeneficiary, spending on each beneficiary will go up by approximately \n$2,000 between this year and what would be spent on that beneficiary in \nthe year 2002.\n  We heard this equally rather interesting argument: Well, there are \ngoing to be more people in the system; therefore, more should be spent. \nActually, demographically, there will not be a significant increase in \nseniors going into the system until we hit the year 2007. So that is \nnot an accurate statement on its face.\n  We heard the statement of essentially, well, but really, to meet the \nobligations of Medicare we have to spend $8,700, or something like \nthat, per senior in the year 2002. What does that presume? It presumes \na rate of growth of Medicare which would be 10 percent per year for the \nnext 7 years--10 percent per year. If that is what my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle want for Medicare, they have just signed on to \na prescription which the Medicare trustees have said will lead to \nbankruptcy, because it is that 10 percent rate of growth that the \nMedicare trustees, three of whom happen to be members of this \nadministration, stated was totally unsustainable--totally \nunsustainable--and that if it is allowed to continue at that rate, if \nMedicare is allowed to continue to grow at an annual rate of 10 \npercent, the trust fund becomes bankrupt.\n  They gave us a rather definitive chart which reflects that, and that \nis this chart here. It is a plane crash, ladies and gentlemen. A 10-\npercent rate of growth leads to insolvency in the trust fund in the \nyear 2002. So when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, \n``But you are simply not increasing spending enough when you are \nincreasing spending by $2,000 per beneficiary over the next 7 years, \nyou have to increase it by another $2,000,'' what they are really \nsaying is we want insolvency of the trust fund.\n  We heard some other rather interesting comments, something about, \nwell, the trustees never said that there had to be anything like $270 \nbillion saved in order to accomplish the rescue of the Medicare trust \nfund. I think my colleague from Iowa said there is no place in the \ntrustees' report where that occurs; all we need is $89 billion.\n  I strongly suggest that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nread the trustees' report. I will read it for them. I have to put on my \nglasses, though.\n\n       The trust fund fails to meet the trustees' test of long-\n     range close actuarial balance by an extremely large margin. \n     To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the \n     first 25 years--\n\n  Which happens to be their minimum year----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sorry. I will not yield. The other side did not \nyield. I will not yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to clarify a point.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not yielding to the Senator from Iowa.\n       To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the \n     first 25 years under the intermediate assumptions, would \n     require an increase in the HI payroll tax of about 0.65 \n     percentage points per employee or employer each or a \n     comparable reduction in benefits.\n\n  What does that language mean in English if you convert it to numbers? \nThat means that the trustees are stating that under their most \nconservative approach, on an actuarial basis, which they did not even \nagree should occur because they think it is too short of a timeframe, \nit would take $386 billion--$386 billion--of adjustment over a 5-year \nperiod in order to accomplish actuarial solvency. So this $89 billion \nnumber is specious on its face.\n  And then we have heard, ``But the premiums of our seniors are going \nto double.'' That is a very interesting argument, because it just \nhappens to ignore one major point. This plan that the Republicans have \nput forward does not increase the burden of the seniors on the \npercentage of premium that they pay in the part B premium.\n  Under the part B premium--I think this should be explained for those \nwho may not be familiar with it; I know most in this room are--but \nunder the part B premium, the senior citizen pays 31 percent of the \ncost, the general taxpayers, specifically the senior's children and \ngrandchildren who are working, pay 69 percent of the cost.\n  Under the Republican proposal, the senior citizen will continue for \nthe next 7 years to pick up 31 percent of the cost of his or her part B \npremium, and his children or her children and his or her grandchildren \nwill continue to pay 69 percent of the cost of the part B premium.\n  We do not change that. Sure, it goes up. Health care costs go up. Of \ncourse it is going to go up. But as a percentage of the cost that is \nbeing borne between the senior citizen and their children who are \npaying the taxes, the subsidy, it will remain the same. Now, if \n\n[[Page S15621]]\n\nwe are to follow the logic of my colleagues from other side of the \naisle, what they are saying is that the subsidy that the senior \ncitizens' children should pay and their grandchildren should pay should \ngo up.\n  That is the only logical conclusion from what they are saying. They \nare essentially saying that the senior citizens should receive a \ngreater subsidy from their children and their grandchildren, so that \nthey will not be paying 31 percent of the cost of their part B premium, \nso that they may be paying 28 percent or 25 or 26 percent of that cost. \nWho is going to pick up the difference? The senior citizens' children \nand grandchildren.\n  Their commitment, their subsidy to that premium paid for by the \nchildren and grandchildren of seniors will go from 69 percent to 70 \npercent, 75 percent. I do not know where they are going to end that \nnumber. But essentially they are pandering, on that side of the aisle, \nto one constituency at the expense of another constituency.\n  It is basically generational politics that are being played. What we \nhave said in our bill is, ``Listen, there's a fair distribution of \nsubsidy between seniors and their children, the wage earners and the \npayers of their subsidy. Sixty-nine percent is paid for by their \nchildren; 31 percent by the seniors.'' We are saying we should continue \nit in that reference. We are not suggesting it be changed at all.\n  I think most seniors in this country would view that as a reasonable \napproach. I find very few seniors in this country who wish to pass on \nto their children either, one, a country that is bankrupt, two, a \nMedicare trust fund that is bankrupt, or, three, feel their children \nshould be hit with a further charge for bearing the cost of their \nhealth care.\n  What else do we say in this plan? We say, let us ask the wealthy \nsenior citizens to pay the whole cost or at least a larger percentage \nof the cost of the part B premium. You explain to me why a person who \nis working 40, 50, 60 hours a week on a computer assembly line in New \nHampshire or at a restaurant or at a garage, why that person should \nhave to subsidize the top 100 retirees from IBM last year. But that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  Under the present law, the top 100 retirees from IBM may make \n$150,000 a year when they retire. And they have a 69-percent subsidy of \ntheir part B premium paid for by John and Mary Jones who are working \nreal hard just to make ends meet and take care of their families. It is \nnot right.\n  We have corrected that in this bill. We have said if you have more \nthan $75,000 as income as an individual, more than $120,000 of income \nas a married couple, then you have to begin paying a higher percentage \nof your part B premium. In fact, if your incomes get into the real high \nlevels, $120,000, I think it is, for individuals and $150,000 or \n$160,000--I have forgotten the number for married folks--then you will \nnot get any more subsidy.\n  What is wrong with that policy, my friends? Talk about income \ntransfer from moderate income to wealthy, this part B premium, as it is \npresently structured, is the ultimate in the wrong way to approach \nincome transfer. So we corrected that.\n  This whole premium argument is really inaccurate, as I mentioned a \nnumber of other points they have made. And then I think the core issue \nhere becomes this question of solvency. How do you make the trust funds \nsolvent so that seniors will have it, so that their children will have \nit? And what we have proposed is to put in place a system which \ngenerates a marketplace competition atmosphere which will help control \nthe rate of growth of costs.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the trustees have made it very clear that a \n10-percent rate of growth of the Medicare trust fund leads to \nbankruptcy. It leads to this horrendous event. It seems that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side are willing to accept a 10-percent rate of \ngrowth. The trustees were not. I am not. Republicans on this side are \nnot.\n  So what we have proposed is to try to slow that rate of growth from \nthree times the rate of inflation to twice the rate of inflation. That \nstill is a very generous increase. As I mentioned, there is a $349 \nbillion increase in spending in the Medicare trust fund over the next 7 \nyears. It is not a dramatic reduction in the rate of growth. You are \nstill talking about a rate of growth which is twice the rate of \ninflation. In fact, if you compare it to what is happening in the \nprivate sector in health care, it happens to be six times the rate of \ngrowth of premium costs in the private sector today.\n  Last year, for example, the health care system which all of us here \nin the Congress benefit from had actually a drop in the rate of growth \nof our premium costs. Why? Because there was competition, because there \nwas choice. What we are suggesting is that seniors should have those \nsame types of choices that we as Members of Congress have, and as a \nresult we will hopefully see a significant drop in the rate of growth \nin premium costs.\n  What we are projecting is a drop of 30 percent. We are not even \nexpecting to get the same drop as in the Congress. But this is a \nreasonable drop. That is what this chart shows.\n  Instead of a 10-percent rate of growth, which my colleagues on the \nother side seem to be ready to endorse, which leads to bankruptcy, we \nare saying let us have a 6.4-percent rate of growth.\n  Ironically, the President, when he sent his budget up here in June--\nit was just a sheaf of papers that did not happen to make a lot of \nsense in other areas--the numbers in the Medicare area were not that \nfar from our number. In fact, they were a lot closer to our number than \nthey are to the 10-percent which my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle seem so enthused for because the administration understands that \nit cannot absorb a 10 percent rate of growth in the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  So we have put forward a plan which will lead to a slowing of the \nrate of growth of the Medicare trust fund to 6.5 percent approximately. \nAnd how do we do it? We do it by using the marketplace and by giving \nseniors more choices, more options, a stronger health care system, \nrather than a weaker health care system. From my standpoint, that is \nwhat reforming and improving and strengthening the Medicare system is \nall about. That is what this whole issue is all about.\n  We have heard a lot of misrepresentation on this by the other side of \nthe aisle already. We have only been at this for, what, about 45 \nminutes of debate from the other side of the aisle, and we have already \nheard about seven major misrepresentations, all of which I just noted.\n  I would hope, however, as we go into the rest of this debate, that we \nwill have some integrity in the discussion, we will get back to talking \nabout what we need to do in order to make the Medicare trust fund \nsolvent, and get off of this issue of trying to scare seniors through \npolitics, versus addressing the issue through substance.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his courtesy and for his time \nand would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just have to respond to my friend from \nNew Hampshire. He is absolutely wrong. Here is a statement of a \nmanaging trustee of the Social Security trustees. Let me just read this \nparagraph:\n\n       Simply said, no Member of Congress should vote for $270 \n     billion in Medicare cuts believing that reductions of this \n     size have been recommended by the Medicare trustees or that \n     such reductions are needed now to prevent an imminent funding \n     crisis. That would be factually incorrect.\n\n  So I say to my friend from New Hampshire, he is incorrect. The \ntrustees never said, and in fact here is a statement just to the \ncontrary, as the managing trustee said, it would be factually incorrect \nto say that $270 billion in cuts were recommended by the trustees. That \nwas never the case.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the manager for yielding the time. \nI \n\n[[Page S15622]]\n\nwas in the New Orleans Airport coming back from Washington one time \nduring the debate on health care 2 years ago. This elderly lady came up \nto me in the airport and said, ``Senator, are you all working on health \ncare in Washington?''\n  I said, ``Yes, ma'am, we sure are.''\n  She said, ``No matter what you do, please don't let the Federal \nGovernment take over my Medicare.''\n  This was a senior citizen who thought the Medicare Program was \nworking just fine. She thought it was the best thing she ever had. It \nwas taking care of her and taking care of her family. But it showed how \nconcerned they were about Congress messing with Medicare.\n  Today, Congress is messing with Medicare in a way that is not \nnecessary and is not essential.\n  Mr. President, 77 percent of the people in my State of Louisiana, who \nare on Medicare, earn less than $15,000 a year. Do we wonder why a lady \nwould come up to me in an airport and say, ``Please don't mess with \nMedicare''? Because if we destroy Medicare, where are these people \ngoing to go?\n  I understand that for some, earning $15,000 a year is something that \nthey do not even think exists, that nobody can be that poor. I say that \nbecause I noticed a quote in the paper this morning from one of our \ncolleagues in the other body which I think is just terrific and it says \nsomething about how some people think. A Congressman from North \nCarolina said:\n\n       When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to \n     $750,000 a year, that's middle class.\n\n  Middle class? It is not middle class in Louisiana. It is not middle \nclass for 100 percent of the people who are on Medicare in Louisiana \nwho earn less than $15,000 a year. I would agree with the Congressman \nif middle class is people earning up to $750,000, we do not even need \nMedicare. Let them go buy private insurance. Maybe let them buy a \nhospital if they earn that much money, or buy their own doctor.\n  But, Mr. President, seriously, we are talking about people who can \nleast afford to be left without some kind of security in their senior \nyears with Medicare.\n  Why is the Republican plan cutting $270 billion? Very simple, no \nmagic about it: They need it to pay for the tax cuts.\n  The House created this. It was created over there. It was conceived \nover there. It was born over there. They decided they wanted to put the \ncart before the horse:\n  ``We are going to decide if we want to cut taxes by over $300 \nbillion. You know what, we have to pay for it.''\n  ``How are we going to pay for it?''\n  ``Oh, I have an idea. Let's cut Medicare, let's cut Medicaid, let's \ncut earned income tax credit, let's cut welfare. By golly, that will do \nit.''\n  So, today we have $270 billion taken out of Medicare, not to fix \nMedicare. This is not reform of Medicare. It is the same old status \nquo. It just has less money in it, by $270 billion.\n  Is that needed? No. It is very clear that actuaries--these are the \nguys who wear green shades. They are not Democrats or Republicans, they \nare actuaries, CPA's. What do they say we need to do to fix Medicare? \nIt is very clear. The actuary for Health and Human Services says \nclearly you can fix Medicare to the year 2006 by reducing the spending \n$89 billion.\n  Guess what the Democratic package does? It reduces spending by $89 \nbillion, not $270 billion, because that is not needed. You wonder why \nthe people come up to us in airports and on Main Street and say, \n``Don't let Congress take over Medicare,'' because they are scared to \ndeath we might do exactly what this plan does: It rips it up, it cuts \nit up in an extreme manner and not to fix it. There is not a real \ninnovative idea in their plan, but there are a lot of cuts, and the \ncuts are more than are necessary to fix it.\n  That is clear; that is simple. Nonpolitical people have said it, and \nwe should get about the business of fixing it with $89 billion, which \nis difficult to do but must be done, and then I will suggest a \nbipartisan commission, with our colleagues on the Republican side \nworking with us to come up with a long-term fix. It ``ain't'' going to \nget done by themselves, and we are not going to be able to do it by \nourselves. Do the short-term fix, appoint a bipartisan commission and \nget the job done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield? We saw somebody stand up with a \nchart on the other side of the room and say, ``What cut? We are not \ncutting Medicare.'' Can the Senator respond to that?\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is $270 billion less money than they had last year. \nYou can call that whatever you want to call it, but if it looks like a \nduck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck \nwhere I come from. This is a duck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Louisiana was not \nreferring to me in his animal comparison.\n  I regret to say I support this amendment, not because I believe that \nit is wrong but because I believe Medicare does need to be reformed. I \ndo not believe, in fact, we need another bipartisan commission. We have \na bipartisan commission recommendation that lays out what needs to be \ndone long term with Medicare. Unfortunately, in the budget resolution, \nwe do not do that. Unfortunately, in this reconciliation agreement, we \ndo not do it.\n  What we have done is we have identified a short-term need, which is \nto come up with money to fund a series of tax breaks, and we are using, \namong other things, significant reductions in Medicare over the next 7 \nyears to do it. And worse, Mr. President, we leave the long-term \nproblem unchecked. If you doubt it, just look at the cost of mandated \nprograms this year versus the cost of mandated programs at the end of \n2002. It is one of the biggest reasons that I seriously doubt that this \nbody or the House is going to be able to hang in there and vote these \nkinds of cuts over the next 7 years.\n  At the end of this budget cycle, at the end of this 7-year period, we \nwill have 25 percent of our budget for appropriated items. That will be \n$400 billion this year for defense and nondefense, and anybody with \njust a rudimentary understanding of the budget would know it is \nunlikely that we are going to be able to get the job done.\n  First of all, Mr. President, it does, as many have already said, try \nto come up with savings in the short term in order to be able to fund \ntax breaks. It leaves the long-term problem unchecked. Do not waste \nanother million on a bipartisan commission. There is one that Jack \nDanforth and I did. It will not be pleasant when you look at the \nrecommendations. The long-term recommendations to phase in changes \ncontain many of the things that are asked for by the Republicans, only \neven more so, but over a long period of time, giving people a chance to \nplan.\n  One of the reasons that seniors are frightened by this whole debate \nis, as many people have already said, their incomes tend to be low. \nThey have a difficult time purchasing insurance and buying health care. \nIt tends to be a very high percentage of their disposable income, and \nthey are terrified that tomorrow they might receive some health care \nbill that they are unable to pay.\n  Second, as far as generational warfare, it is the concern of their \nchildren and of their grandchildren that they may get stuck with these \nbills as well. So this terror that seniors feel does not come as a \nconsequence of Democratic rhetoric, it comes as a consequence of an \nhonest evaluation of income and likely expenditures.\n  Third, I find objectionable the deals that were made with the AMA, \nparticularly on the House side, to get an agreement over there.\n  Fourth, it does not reform the system and really use the market and \nallow competition. Mr. President, $152 billion of the savings comes \nfrom cuts to providers; $71 billion in increased payments by \nbeneficiaries; $43 billion by reducing payments to HMO's; only $2 \nbillion come from increased use of competitive market forces.\n  Next, rather than taking a step toward universal coverage, which we \nought to be doing if we want to have a market economy in the late 20th \ncentury, when we say to businesses, ``Go out there and be competitive, \ntry to keep your costs under control and still have a civil society,'' \nwe have to have universal coverage.\n  Republicans now have reached a conclusion that they want to preserve \n\n[[Page S15623]]\n\nMedicare. I suspect Leader Dole will come and say that his remark last \nnight was taken out of context. If you want to preserve Medicare, that \nmeans you recognize at some point the market does not work. Well, it \ndoes not work for an awful lot of people--over a million in 1994 \nalone--who moved into the ranks of the uninsured.\n  We need a safety net that provides universal coverage. The problem, \nof course, is that to be able to do that, we are going to have to \ndramatically change the Medicare/Medicaid income tax deduction and the \nVA.\n  Next, I have heard it said that we want to give seniors exactly what \nFederal employees have. Please, let us not overpromise again. Our \nsalaries are $133,000 a year. Look at the comparisons. We pay $44 a \nmonth; seniors pay $46, and under the GOP plan, it goes to $89. We have \nunlimited hospital care; theirs is limited. Our prescription drugs are \ncovered; theirs are not covered. We have a deductible of $350; they are \nat $816. Here are more extensive services under preventive services, an \nout-of-pocket of $37.50. We do not want to say to seniors--and I have \nheard it said and I know the marketing is going on and this has been \ntested very well. Let us not overpromise here. If we say to seniors \nwhat we are doing in this proposal is giving you what Federal employees \nhave, there is going to come a substantial and a rude awakening.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I hope that in fact a majority does \nvote for this amendment. I hope we recommit this to the Budget \nCommittee and Finance Committee. I would love to participate now in a \nbipartisan effort to control the long-term cost of entitlement and \nmandated spending. I think we are extinguishing our capacity to invest \nin education, transportation, research, child care--those things you \nneed in an active economy.\n  Mr. President, most particularly, I hope there can be a bipartisan \nconsensus begin to emerge as a result of seeing the value of Medicare, \nthat we need a new safety net that says if you are a citizen or legal \nresident, you will know with certainty that you are going to be \ncovered.\n  This proposal takes us away from those goals rather than toward it. \nTherefore, I support the amendment offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia. I hope that a majority of Democrats and Republicans who \nunderstand the short- and long-term proposal will vote for this \namendment so we can, hopefully, reach some kind of bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 40 minutes left. \nThe Senator from West Virginia has 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on Monday, October 16, there was a very \ninteresting article that ran in the Wall Street Journal. At the \nappropriate time, I am going to ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The headline says: ``Clinton Recruits Campaign Team of `Nasty Boys' \nWith Reputation as Tough, Savvy Hired Guns.''\n  Then the lead paragraph says:\n\n       Gearing up for 1996, President Clinton is fielding a motley \n     crew of re-election strategists with reputations for \n     shrewdness and ruthless tactics. A mainstay on his team, New \n     Yorker Henry Sheinkopf, readily boasts, ``I subscribe to \n     terror.''\n\n  That is a very interesting statement, Mr. President. I have had it \nput on a chart--we are debating this whole thing with charts--``I \nsubscribe to terror.''\n  He goes on to say in the article:\n\n       Terror tends to work . . . because it is so easy to make \n     people hate.\n\n  Now, back to the article, quoting:\n\n       Mr. Sheinkopf doesn't deny the remarks, but says they were \n     taken out of context. He says he was addressing the strategy \n     for a noncandidate campaign . . .\n\n  A noncandidate campaign. That is very interesting because what we \nhave running on the airwaves today is a series of television ads that \nare terrorizing our senior citizens, and this is a noncandidate \ncampaign. Mr. Sheinkopf was the architect of this summer's \nunprecedented ad campaign on crime.\n  This is the next statement that I have here on a chart. He is part of \nthe group that wanted to start the Medicare ads early this summer. \nQuoting now:\n\n       The team wanted to attack the GOP with Medicare ads in \n     early September . . . they got the go ahead.\n\n  Again, he said, ``I subscribe to terror.'' That is the statement of \nthe President's strategist on noncandidate campaigns.\n  There is more in the article. I will quote a few before I turn \ndirectly to the Medicare debate. But this demonstrates what we are \nfaced with, as far as the ads currently running on television are \nconcerned. Quoting:\n\n       Already, friends of the administration peg these \n     mercenaries ``The Nasty Boys.'' Like Mr. Clinton, many of \n     them are accused of lacking an ideological rudder, allowing \n     them to roam from left to right on policies.\n\n  Elsewhere in the article, it says:\n\n       Elizabeth Holtzman will never forget when she first heard \n     about Mr. Sheinkopf. The former New York congresswoman was \n     running for Brooklyn district attorney in the 1980s when, she \n     says, her opponent fired off one of the ``nastiest, sexist \n     ads'' she had ever heard. . . . She found out the spot was \n     created by Mr. Sheinkopf.\n       Her reaction? She hired him for her next campaign.\n       ``He's very creative,'' Mrs. Holtzman says. And, like other \n     members of this media team, he'll bat for most anyone--as \n     long as they are paying clients.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I found this interesting because it \ndemonstrated what is happening to political debate in this country when \nwe are not debating the merits or demerits of the proposal before us. \nInstead, we are mounting 30-second spots to attack each other in the \nspirit of terror. That is not my word, but the word of the man whom the \nPresident of the United States has chosen to advise him on this \nparticular issue.\n  By contrast, Mr. President, I am aware of some focus groups that have \nbeen held in an attempt to understand this issue, where the Republican \nplan was described in as neutral a term as possible and the Democratic \nproposal is described in as neutral a term as possible; they were \npresented to a group of senior citizens in a focus group, with the \nfirst called the Smith plan and the second one called the Green plan. \nDiscussion was held, without any prejudice one way or the other. When \nit was over, they found that by about an 80 percent to 20 percent \nmargin, in virtually every section of the country where this attempt \nhas been made to find out people's reaction, the Smith plan out-polled \nthe Green plan. And only then was it unveiled to these people that they \nhad, in fact, by a vote of 4 to 1, subscribed to the Republican \nposition rather than the Democratic position on this issue.\n  I find this very encouraging for this reason, Mr. President. I go \nback to the debate in the last Congress over health care when the \nPresident unveiled his health care proposal. A very substantial \nmajority of Americans were in favor of it. We on this side of the aisle \nfelt very lonely in our opposition to it, but we were sustained by this \nknowledge: The more people that knew about the President's plan, the \nless they approved of it. The more the information got out, the more \nthe poll numbers fell. So that by the time we finally got to the \nresolution of that issue on this floor, they had switched completely. \nInstead of being 2 to 1 in favor of the President's plan, they were 2 \nto 1 in opposition to the President's plan.\n  Based on the research that has been done in this nonideological \nfashion, we find that the more people know the facts of the Republican \nproposal on Medicare, the more they support it. So that, over time, the \nAmerican people--as they did with President Clinton's plan--are going \nto move in the direction of supporting the Republican position.\n  Right now, if you look at the polls, they are virtually identical. If \nyou poll Americans, about 50-50 are saying we are for the Democrat \nposition or we are for the Republican position. That would bother me a \ngreat deal if I did not know that the more people know about the \nparticulars of our plan, the more they support it.\n  So I urge my fellow Republicans to stand firm with where we are, \nknowing that time is on our side, that facts are \n\n[[Page S15624]]\n\non our side, and do not be terrorized by the deliberate program of \nterror that is being mounted primarily out of the White House and from \nthe Democratic National Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 1995]\n\n  Clinton Recruits Campaign Team of ``Nasty Boys'' With Reputation as \n                        Tough, Savvy Hired Guns\n\n                         (By Michael K. Frisby)\n\n       Washington.--Gearing up for 1996, President Clinton is \n     fielding a motley crew of re-election strategists with \n     reputations for shrewdness and ruthless tactics. A mainstay \n     on his team, New Yorker Henry Sheinkopf, readily boasts, ``I \n     subscribe to terror.''\n       Already, friends of the administration peg these \n     mercenaries ``The Nasty Boys.'' Like Mr. Clinton, many of \n     them are accused of lacking an ideological rudder, allowing \n     them to roam from left to right on policies. Bill Lacy, a \n     strategist for GOP frontrunner Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, \n     says he expects ``a scorched earth campaign'' from this \n     group.\n       The Clinton-Gore re-election campaign will be headed by a \n     prominent Democrat, perhaps a cabinet member, who will set \n     the grand blueprint with the president. But every campaign \n     relies on its savvy strategists and creative media team to \n     fire up voters. And Mr. Clinton has loaded his campaign with \n     the most aggressive war counselors available.\n       Led by Dick Morris, of Connecticut, the president's media-\n     message team also includes the New York polling firm Penn & \n     Schoen Associates Inc. It's anchored by Washington veteran \n     Robert Squier, a firebrand himself, who plays a calming role \n     on this feisty group. ``We are putting together an exciting \n     creative team that can pick up where the strategic thinking \n     leaves off,'' Mr. Squier says.\n       It is Mr. Sheinkopf, a whiz at low-budget ads, who has \n     raised the most eyebrows. A year ago, he shared his trade \n     secrets at a convention of political consultants and talked \n     about using fear to win campaigns. Mr. Sheinkopf told the \n     gathering, ``Terror tends to work . . . because it is so easy \n     to make people hate.''\n       Mr. Sheinkopf doesn't deny the remarks, but says they are \n     often taken out of context. He says he was addressing the \n     strategy for a noncandidate campaign, such as a referendum \n     fight, in which the clients don't have much money. ``I'm \n     tough, but I'm not ruthless,'' he insists. ``I fight for my \n     clients.''\n       Elizabeth Holtzman will never forget when she first heard \n     about Mr. Sheinkopf. The former New York congresswoman was \n     running for Brooklyn district attorney in the 1980s when, she \n     says, her opponent fired off one of the ``nastiest, sexist \n     ads'' she had ever heard. ``The voice said, `She's a very \n     nice girl. I might like her for my daughter, but not district \n     attorney,''' Ms. Holtzman recalls. She found out the spot was \n     created by Mr. Sheinkopf.\n       Her reaction? She hired him for her next campaign.\n       ``He's very creative,'' Ms. Holtzman says. And, like other \n     members of this media team, he'll bat for most anyone--as \n     long as they are paying clients.\n       Mr. Sheinkopf's claim to fame is hot radio spots for \n     African-American candidates, many of whom are liberals. Yet, \n     he and his partner, Gerry Austin, in the wake of the riots \n     after the Rodney King case, worked on behalf of Los Angeles \n     police officers fighting a reform measure on the ballot. Mr. \n     Morris, a longtime associate of Mr. Clinton, has worked for \n     conservative Republicans, such as Mississippi Sen. Trent \n     Lott. Mark Penn, a partner in Penn & Shoen, worked for \n     maverick Ross Perot in 1992, and the firm does considerable \n     work for corporations.\n       Thus far, the consultants, with Mr. Morris calling the \n     shots, have helped bring Mr. Clinton back to life after last \n     fall's GOP sweep. ``They have presented a disciplined and \n     controlled message,'' said Democratic strategist Robert \n     Beckel. ``It has put the president back in the dance.''\n\n\n                          push for budget plan\n\n       Even Mr. Morris's critics tip their hats to his pushing the \n     president to offer up a balanced-budget plan last spring, a \n     move that embittered other Democrats. Mr. Morris argued it \n     would gain the president credibility on economic issues, \n     opening the door for him to now hammer the GOP for squeezing \n     Medicare and education funds without appearing to be a tax-\n     and-spend Democrat.\n       Mr. Sheinkopf was the architect of this summer's \n     unprecedented ad campaign--16 months before the election--\n     portraying Mr. Clinton as tough on crime. Using his \n     connections, the former New York City police officer lined up \n     cops around the country for the ads.\n       Inside the White House, the acceptance of Mr. Morris and \n     his crew is growing, but there are still spats. The team \n     wanted to attack the GOP with Medicare ads in early \n     September, but were blunted by Deputy Chief of Staff Harold \n     Ickes, who doesn't want to get caught short on campaign cash \n     next summer. By late September, however, the media team got \n     the go-ahead.\n       Aides say that while Mr. Clinton values his hired guns, the \n     president is comfortable with Mr. Ickes controlling the purse \n     strings and taking charge of relations with the Democratic \n     base--unions, liberals and minority voters.\n       The team may prepare one more media hit before January; it \n     is likely to be either a package on the budget battle or \n     about Mr. Clinton cherishing the same values as average \n     Americans.\n       Some Democrats privately raise concerns about whether this \n     crew is ready for prime time, however. Mr. Morris, for one, \n     is described by many as brilliant, but has his share of \n     bloopers. Last year, he produced an ad for Tennessee GOP \n     gubernatorial candidate Don Sundquist that people still talk \n     about. It was a high-tech TV spot with a car driving in a \n     video game, crashing into barriers with signs carrying the \n     theme that the candidate was against taxes.\n       ``It didn't have the desired effect,'' concedes Ray \n     Pohlman, the campaign manager. But in the next breath, he \n     says Mr. Morris is fabulous at deciphering polling data and \n     crafting a message. And Mr. Sundquist won the election.\n       The strategizing on the Clinton campaign goes right down to \n     bringing in an outside expert to do the video work. Mr. \n     Morris, who was responsible for hiring Mr. Sheinkopf, also \n     recruited Marius Penczner, who runs a video production house \n     in Memphis, Tenn. Mr. Penczner, whom Mr. Morris met on the \n     Sundquist campaign, is known more for country music videos \n     than political work. Mr. Clinton has marveled at the quality \n     of Mr. Penczner's Oval Office video shots, which are in most \n     of the president's TV spots.\n\n\n                           Controversial Poll\n\n       Mr. Morris also picked Penn & Schoen as the campaign \n     pollsters, virtually ousting old Clinton hand Stan Greenberg. \n     Their results, however, are sometimes controversial. Their \n     poll put then-Ohio Rep. David Mann up 28 points in his \n     Democratic primary fight against State Sen. William Bowen. A \n     short time later, fund-raising letters went to political \n     action committees, citing Mr. Mann's lead. He won the race, \n     but by two percentage points. ``We laughed at that poll,'' \n     recalls Mr. Bowen. ``It was just part of their tactical \n     strategy to show him way in front; that wasn't the case.''\n       The poll was five months before the election, and undecided \n     voters later turned against the incumbent, says Douglas \n     Schoen. ``We always thought it would be close,'' he says, \n     noting a poll closer to the election showed a tighter \n     contest.\n       The new Clinton campaign team raises concerns among \n     presidential scholars. While applauding their cleverness, \n     experts search for the intellectual thrust. Mr. Clinton likes \n     to be compared to President Truman, who overcame a hostile \n     Congress to win re-election. But Fred Greenstein, a Princeton \n     University historian, notes Truman's comeback was fueled by \n     the intellectual energy of Clark Clifford and others--not \n     image-makers. And that, he says, is missing from a Clinton \n     team searching for the best political answer.\n       ``Maybe you need someone with substantive fiber to give you \n     advice,'' Mr. Greenstein says.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say on behalf of my good friend, \nSenator Harkin, and myself, the Senator from Utah says the more people \nlearn about the plan--we just got there. There has not been one \nhearing. How many pages are there?\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are 2,000 pages.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 2,000 pages, and people do not know \nwhat is in here. We did not have experts come to committee. People in \nIowa, Minnesota, and across the country----\n  Mr. HARKIN. How many days of hearings have we had?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Not anything.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Zero. The American people have no idea what is in this.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The people do not know about this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, 23 years ago I came to the U.S. Senate \nas what we call a Southern conservative. There are not as many of us \nleft as I would like there to be, but throughout that time, Mr. \nPresident, I have frankly given my party some consternation by opposing \nsome things which I thought were too liberal, particularly when it came \nto what I thought was income redistribution.\n  I can recall opposing the CETA Program because I thought it was sort \nof a make work program that would take money and give it to poor \npeople, just sort of without working.\n  Now, Mr. President, in spite of the fact that I remained through all \nthose 23 years as a Southern conservative, I oppose strongly this \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, this program goes in the exact opposite direction \nbecause it is income redistribution from bottom to the top.\n  Mr. President, I will be leaving this institution in another year. I \nmust say that we are leaving, if this passes, we are leaving in its \nwake a real difficult situation for people of modest means in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S15625]]\n\n  While we are taking care of those who are better off--the tax credit \nfor children goes up to $110,000, people with those incomes--the top 1 \npercent, Mr. President, in this country, are going to get almost $5,000 \nper person.\n  Mr. President, what this does to poor people, what it does to people \nof modest means in my State--this is not scare tactics, Mr. President--\nwe are going to have 4,700 fewer people on Head Start, school loans are \ngoing to be restricted, summer jobs are eliminated by the thousands in \nmy State.\n  There will be 406,000 children in Louisiana whose nutrition is going \nto be cut because of this program. Mr. President, 60,000 people of \nmodest means in my State are going to have to pay more for housing.\n  Mr. President, going right down the line--look at Medicare. We will \nhave 17 million low and moderate-income people in this country who will \nhave an average tax increase of $352. The Medicare people who are \nhaving their Medicare cut, their average income is $17,750, while we \nare giving tax cuts to those of greater income.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is a blizzard of propaganda----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 3 minutes yielded to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I oppose this program because it is \nincome redistribution from the bottom to the top.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I must \noppose the Democrats' amendment for one simple reason: It does not \npreserve the Medicare Program for this generation, and, especially \nimportant, not for future generations. That was the conclusion that the \nFinance Committee came to when it voted down this amendment during our \ndeliberations.\n  My good friends and distinguished colleagues, Senators Moynihan and \nRockefeller, offered a similar amendment during the Finance Committee \nmarkup to save $89 billion from the Medicare Program over the next 7 \nyears. Frankly, it did not go far enough then and it does not go far \nenough now.\n  The Congressional Budget Office did a preliminary estimate of the \nMedicare trust fund effects of the Democrats' amendment to save $89 \nbillion from the Medicare Program. Remember, it is the CBO office that \nthe President himself said is the one that should be making these kind \nof determinations.\n  Here is what CBO's preliminary estimates showed would happen to the \nMedicare HI trust fund if only $89 billion is saved over the next 7 \nyears. The Medicare HI trust fund would only be solvent through the \nyear 2004. In other words, it would get us through the next election.\n  CBO further said that the Medicare HI trust fund would have a \nnegative balance of $8.4 billion in the year 2005. This would mean that \nMedicare could not pay its bills on time in the year 2005.\n  Even more alarming under the Democrats' proposal, CBO says that the \nMedicare trust fund could not even pay a full year's Medicare benefits \nstarting in the year 2001. Mr. President, that is only 6 years from \nnow.\n  In contrast, CBO says that our proposal meets the Medicare trustees. \nRemember, those trustees are primarily appointed by the President. It \nsays it meets the Medicare trustees' 10-year test of financial \nadequacy. In other words, Medicare has enough money in the HI trust \nfund at the end of every year--that is critically important--at the end \nof every year for the next 10 years, to pay the entire next year's \nMedicare benefit.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare HI trust fund has a $300 billion balance \nin the year 2005. The Medicare trust fund balance is increasing--would \nbe increasing instead of decreasing every year.\n  Using CBO's estimate through 2005, we went to the Office of the \nActuary to get their preliminary estimate of how long solvency would be \nextended under our proposal. The Medicare HI trust fund solvency will \nbe extended until about the year 2020 under the proposal. That is our \nestimate, in consultation with the Office of the Actuary. That is a \nquarter of a century from today.\n  What a contrast to what would happen under the proposal before when \nit would only be solvent to 2005.\n  Mr. President, $89 billion in Medicare savings just is not enough. \nEven the President earlier this year said that at least $127 billion in \nMedicare savings are necessary.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, a few words about the need for \nsavings to Medicare part B. Most attention has been focused on the need \nto restore solvency in the part A trust fund.\n  But part B spending is a big, big problem. According to Medicare \npublic trustees--again, appointed by President Clinton--the Medicare \npart B spending shows a rate of cost which is clearly unsustainable. \nMedicare part B spending was $2 billion in 1970. In 1995 the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates Medicare part B spending to be \nabout $66 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The time yielded to the Senator \nfrom Delaware has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator from Delaware an additional minute \nof time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that without \nsavings in the part B program we cannot say that we have effectively \ntackled the problem of fixing Medicare. Therefore, I oppose the \nDemocrats' amendment because we have already debated and voted down \nthis amendment in the Finance Committee. It does not go far enough to \nhelp the Medicare HI trust fund, and we do not want to do it in small \nsteps that will only cost more and create greater hardship. It appears \nto do nothing, to be candid, to slow Medicare part B spending, which is \na significant problem. For that reason, I must oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is left at \nthis point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 25 minutes. The \nSenator from West Virginia has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this whole debate baffles me. I think \nit really boils down to those who want the status quo and those who \nwant to confront the fiscal dilemma.\n  The entitlement commission was chaired by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska who is on the floor right now and that sets the predicate \nfor everything that has to be done. I commend the Senator for that \nwork. I wish a lot more was being said about it.\n  But, in essence, that report says that within 10 years all U.S. \nrevenue and wealth is exhausted by five programs: Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the interest on our debt. \nAnd then there is nothing left.\n  So it is entirely appropriate that the new majority confront these \nissues. In the discussion, with repeated frequency, the other side \ntries to link the tax reduction that we are proposing to Medicare. Over \nand over and over we hear that somehow, something is being taken away \nfrom Medicare to help a tax reduction.\n  The President, of course, has already admitted that he raised taxes \ntoo much in 1993. We are trying to help him fix it, even without the \nsupport of his colleagues here on the Senate floor.\n  But this is not a vacuum in which we are operating. What happens to \nthe $245 billion in tax reductions? First of all, the savings on \nMedicare by law stay in Medicare and extend the solvency, which is why \nwe have been given assurances that our Medicare proposal will assure \nsolvency for a quarter century, 25 years. Their suggestion gives us 24 \nmonths. Is America looking for a Band-Aid or a solution for these \nsenior citizens?\n  Let us step aside. Why are we coming forward with a tax reduction? I \nread here, from Llewellyn H. Rockwell, of the Ludwig Von Mises \nInstitute in Auburn, AL. He says:\n\n       Even as family income has declined since 1970, the Federal \n     Government's tax hike in real terms has increased more than \n     600 percent.\n\n  An average family, making $40,000 a year, with two children, is \nseeing half \n\n[[Page S15626]]\n\ntheir total income absorbed and taken away by a Government. In 1950, \nOzzie and Harriet, the quintessential family, sent 2 cents out of every \ndollar off to Washington. If Ozzie was here today, he would be sending \n24 cents to Washington.\n  The point is we have marginalized the average family. We have taken \nso much of their resource away from them that they are unable to \nfulfill their principal obligations to their children --to housing, to \nclothing, to education and health. So, it is important that there is a \ntax reduction. Their President has already acknowledged it. And we are \nfulfilling it.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of this tax relief will go to families with \nincomes under $75,000. This proposal alone, for this family that makes \n$40,000, the combination of the tax reduction and the balanced budget, \nwill put between 2,000 and 3,000 new dollars on the kitchen table of \nevery family home. That is an equivalent increase of their disposable \nincome of 10 to 20 percent, depending on the family. That relief is \nlong overdue.\n  We will lower their interest payments on their mortgage, probably \nabout $50,000, by $1,081. We will lower the interest expense on their \ncar loan by about $180 a year; on the student loan, by $220 a year; on \ntheir credit card. With the two children, they will get $500 for each \nchild.\n  This is just the beginning, and that is $2,500 to that average \nfamily. Given the fact we are taking half their income now, do we not \nthink it is about time that something got back to the average family? \nThis tax relief does not disappear. This goes to real working families, \nreal people who are having a hard time making ends meet. To extend \nsolvency and to help the middle-income family is entirely appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what I would like to do this afternoon, \nbriefly, is to address the so-called part B premium situation. It seems \nto me, in all of this political maneuvering around here, the Democratic \nParty has overlooked the unfairness that is occurring in the part B \npremium.\n  What is the part B premium? The part B premium is an insurance \nprogram that those on Medicare take out if they wish. When Medicare was \nset up, under the part B proposal the Federal Government was going to \npay half the cost of the premium, and the insured was going to pay the \nother half. But over the years that has deteriorated so now, currently, \nthe insured is paying 31.5 percent. Not 50 percent of the premium, but \n31.5 percent.\n  Do we change that? No, we do not change that at all. That remains \nconstant at 31.5. I do not know how anybody could complain about that. \nYou get 100 percent of the premium and you only pay 31.5 percent for \nit.\n  We then go on to say, wait a minute, this is costing the Federal \nGovernment a lot of money. It is costing the Federal Government $42 \nbillion a year to subsidize that part B premium, the other 69 percent. \nSo we say, is it not fair for the richer people to pay more of that \npremium? So that is what we provide. We provide for individuals with \n$50,000 of income--this is not some pauper, this is an individual with \n$50,000 of income--or a couple with $75,000 of income, that they will \nthen start paying more of that premium than 31.5 percent. Apparently \nthey do not think that is fair. I think it is eminently fair. Why \nshould some jewelry worker in the city of Providence have his or her \nwages deducted and go into the general Treasury and come out to pay \nsome wealthy person's premium under part B of Medicare?\n  But does that person at $50,000, or $75,000 a couple, have to pay all \nthe premium?\n  The answer is no, they do not. They just start paying more than the \n3l.5 percent. When do they start paying the full part of the premium? \nWhen the individual reaches $100,000 and the couple reaches $150,000.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very fair program. By the way, if the \nperson does not want that insurance, they do not have to take it. It is \nan optional program. I do not know. Apparently, over on the other side \nthey think it is wonderful that the Federal Government subsidizes these \ninsurance programs.\n  Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Redskins, is having 70 percent of \nhis doctors' bills paid for by some worker, somebody who cleans up the \nhalls or works in a restaurant. I do not think that is fair.\n  I think the program that the Republicans have submitted in connection \nwith Medicare is an eminently fair program, and, Mr. President, I urge \nits support in this Chamber.\n  I think there is no need for this recommittal motion whatsoever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island said that he thinks it \nis eminently fair. Let me try to just reduce it to the simplest, and I \nthink the most truthful assessment of what is fair and what is not \nfair. Most Americans, when they stop and look at what is about to \nhappen, are going to wind up asking if it is fair to take an assessment \nby the trustees of Medicare that says there is a $90 billion problem, \nand turn it, through political sophistry, into a $270 billion problem \nso that you can give a $245 billion tax cut. That is absolutely what \nthis comes down to.\n  This is a zero-sum game. This is a process of balancing the budget. \nAnd in their balanced budget, they are offering a $245 billion tax \nreduction to Americans. How do they get it? They do not pull it out of \nthe sky. It has to be balanced against other items in the budget. And \nin order to find the room to balance the budget and provide the $245 \nbillion tax cut, they give a $270 billion definition to a Medicare \nproblem that the trustees themselves call an $89 billion problem. It is \nthat simple. Take away the smoke, take away the mirrors, and take away \nthe rhetoric. You cannot balance the budget with a $245 billion tax \nbreak without finding the money somewhere. And they find the money by \ntaking it from seniors. Is that fair?\n  They say to Americans they are giving every American family a tax \nbreak for having children--the $500 credit. But analysis will show \nthat, too, is not only not fair, but it is not truthful because not \nevery American family will get the tax credit because not every \nAmerican family qualifies because of income to have an income tax \nreduction. Most American families pay their taxes--a large burden--\nmany, through the payroll tax. And because the tax credit is not \nrefundable to them at the lower end of the income scale, they will not \nget the benefit. So not only do you have a skewed tax relief, so to \nspeak, but you have a discrimination against the hard-working average \ntaxpayer of America.\n  But it is even worse than that, Mr. President. Because while they \ngive a tax break of about $5,000-plus to the person earning more than \n$350,000 a year, they raise the taxes on the person earning less than \n$30,000 a year.\n  That is an extraordinary definition of fairness. I do not know where \nyou get that definition of fairness. The Medicare cuts themselves are \ngoing to be devastating, devastating. There are more and more post-\nWorld War II baby boomers who are reaching the age of 65, and the \nnumber of people paying taxes to pay for them is diminishing. Today you \nhave an estimated four taxpayers supporting a Medicare part A \nbeneficiary, four people supporting one. But when the baby boomers \nretire between the years 2010 and 2015 you are going to go down to \nabout two people paying for each one of those on part A.\n  The result of that with these cuts is going to be that you are going \nto have an overall population increase of 2 percent, but are you are \ngoing to have a 30-percent increase of people on Medicare looking for \ntheir retirement benefits under Medicare? The problem is under the cuts \nand the reductions of \n\n[[Page S15627]]\n\nthe total pot that will be made available by the Republicans, you are \ngoing to be having people come in at a 30-percent increase saying, \n``Where are the benefits that I am due?'' And they are not going to \nhave them.\n  Mr. President, this is not fair. It is not sensible. And I hope that \nwe will adopt the amendment of the Democrats to have a fair \ndistribution of solving the problem.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare and Medicaid cuts proposed by the \nRepublicans hurt people and families.\n  The Republican cuts eliminate jobs, and these Democratic amendments \nprotect jobs.\n  Republican cuts affect the quality of care for nursing home patients, \nand these Democratic amendments maintain care--for seniors, for people \nwith disabilities, and for children while still containing costs.\n  These Democratic amendments scale back tax breaks for the wealthy to \nhelp people in my State and around the country who are struggling to \nmake ends meet.\n  My Republican colleagues are offering a $270 billion solution--at \nleast $160 billion more than is necessary to ensure the financial \nsolvency of Medicare.\n  We have been told by the Medicare trustees that there is a pending \nfinancial disaster that could result in the total collapse of the \nMedicare part A program unless changes are enacted.\n  According to the trustees, the magnitude of the crisis is around $89 \nbillion. The Republican solution is to make changes impacting both \nbeneficiaries and providers that would save $270 billion--three times \nthe amount necessary to fix the current financial crisis.\n  It is important that people across America recognize that Medicare is \nfaced with a short-term crisis that can be fixed without totally \ndismantling a program that has provided economic health security to \nmillions of retired Americans since its inception.\n  While I fully recognize that there is a financial crisis confronting \nMedicare, and believe it is probably somewhere beyond $89 billion, but \nsubstantially less than the Republican solution, the Gingrich solutions \nare anything but solutions.\n  The solutions being put forth fail once again to take into \nconsideration the changing composition of the over-65 population. For \nexample, do the solutions being proposed really fit the acute and long-\nterm care needs of current and future generations of retired Americans?\n  With more and more post World War II so-called baby boomers beginning \nto reach age 65, the number of workers paying taxes will continue to \ndecline, while the number of Medicare recipients continues to increase.\n  Today, an estimated four taxpayers support a Medicare part a \nbeneficiary. However, when the baby boomers retire between 2010 and \n2015, the estimated number of taxpayers paying for each Medicare part a \nbeneficiary will have dropped by two.\n  Thus we will have gone from a 4-to-1 ratio to a 2-to-1 ratio in just \na few years.\n  By 2008, our overall population will increase by 2 percent, but our \nretired population will increase by 30 percent.\n  The Medicare changes will, however, cause one additional problem--a \nreduction in health care employment and other jobs that indirectly \nbenefit from the health care sector.\n  Let us look at the impact on my State: Jim Howell of the Howell Group \nhas recently issued a study that shows that the proposed combined cuts \nin Medicare and Medicaid of $452 billion will conservatively result in \na $13 billion loss to the State over 7 years.\n  Massachusetts could lose 71,000--71,000--health sector jobs and the \nindirect employment impact could result in $165,000 lost jobs.\n  The hardest hit towns would be Boston, Brockton, Cambridge, Fall \nRiver, Farmingham, New Bedford, Salem, Springfield, and Worcester.\n  The proposed $1 billion cut in funds for graduate medical education \nwill have a devastating impact on institutions and it will hurt \nMassachusetts' knowledge-based economy by disrupting the network of \nmedical schools, research institutions, health care providers, and \nbiotech firms.\n  The proposed cuts would result in aggregate personal income losses in \nthe State of $2.1 billion.\n  The health of seniors and children, and the loss of jobs at a time \nwhen working families are struggling to make ends meet is just too high \na price to pay.\n  The problems for Massachusetts are intensified when we examine the \npotential impact of the proposed cuts in Medicaid--the health care \nprogram for poor children disabled persons, and seniors.\n  Under the Republican plan, Massachusetts would lose approximately \n$4.6 billion.\n  With regard to children, one out of every three low-income who is \ncurrently receiving health insurance coverage from Medicaid is in \njeopardy of losing their coverage.\n  For elderly persons in Massachusetts, the impact is more severe. \nCurrently, 75 percent of all patients in Massachusetts nursing homes \nare dependent upon Medicaid to help pay for the costs of nursing home \ncare.\n  Under the Republican plan, more than 25,000 seniors would lose their \nMedicaid eligibility by 2002.\n  I believe the Republican response to the Medicare crisis can best be \nsummed up as follows: it does not focus on the future of the overall \nprogram; it does not address the growing long-term care crisis facing \nAmericans of all ages but particularly elderly Americans; and it does \nnot address or take into consideration the impact such dramatic cuts \nwill have on employment in the health care sector, and on those \ncommunities who have become dependent upon this sector as a means of \nfighting or deterring rising unemployment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I yield to the Senator from \nTennessee 7 minutes.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 15 minutes-plus \nremaining, and the Senator from West Virginia has almost 7 minutes.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the motion. Why? \nBecause the plan we have on the table addresses three central issues.\n  First, it prevents bankruptcy of not just for part A, not just the \nhospital part of the trust fund, but it prevents the bankruptcy of the \nentire program.\n  Second, our plan, our underlying bill, increases spending, increases \nspending from $4,800 by nearly $2,000 per beneficiary to $6,700. That \nis an increase in spending.\n  And, third, our program improves Medicare as we know it today.\n  As has been pointed out by my colleagues before, we have a program \nthat is a good program. I say that as a physician who has taken care of \nthousands of Medicare patients. It is a good program. But it is an \nantiquated, out-of-date program that locks seniors' hands, that \ndeprives them of choice. We want to give them choice. We want to give \nthem the opportunities that you have, that I have, that most people, \nthe majority of people have who are less than 65 years of age today.\n  The Democratic motion ignores the fundamental problem. The problem is \ntwofold. It really has not been discussed very much over the last hour \nand a half.\n  The first part of the problem is that it is an outdated program. It \ndoes not meet the needs of our senior citizens today, or individuals \nwith disabilities, or why would 70 percent of them have to go outside \nand buy additional coverage for Medicare? Why is it that Medicare today \ndoes not cover prescription drugs?\n  As a heart surgeon, as a lung surgeon, as somebody, again, who has \ntaken care of so many Medicare patients, I can tell you our senior \ncitizens need help with their prescription drugs. Today, we deny \nchoice. We deny the right to choose to our senior citizens. Is that \nfair? Does the other side not want to offer the same choice that we \nhave to our seniors?\n  That is the first part of the problem. To me, that is what is most \nexciting about our solution that is in the underlying bill--is that we \nimprove the program.\n  Second, it is the program that has unsustained growth. The growth has \nbeen at about 10 percent a year. It is of the entire program. We talk a \nlot about the trust fund, part A. I think people \n\n[[Page S15628]]\n\nbroadly need to know that part A is one part of the problem. Part A is \nthe hospitals. Part B is the doctors. This particular proposal by the \nDemocrats today addresses the part A part of the trust fund without \naddressing the overall connection, without addressing the overall \nprogram.\n  That is really in spite of the fact that the trustee report says very \nspecifically--and, again, this is the trustee report, six trustees, \ntrustees of Medicare, three of whom are in the Clinton Cabinet, and \nthey say very clearly, ``We strongly recommend that the crisis''--we \ncannot just put another Band-Aid on this--``presented by the financial \ncondition of the Medicare trust funds''--funds, not just part A, funds, \nthe overall program--``be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \nbasis.''\n  We cannot just throw $89 billion at part A, one part of these trust \nfunds, and expect to solve the problem long term.\n  We address the program in a comprehensive way. We address part A, the \nhospitals; part B, physicians, the complex interaction that comes \nbetween the two. As a physician who works in a hospital and works in a \nclinic, I can tell you it is a complex interaction and you cannot \naddress just part A. If you squeeze part A, part B will balloon out.\n  The Democratic motion addresses only part A. And, again, if you go \nback to the trustee report, the trustees say it is not a problem just \nwith part A. It is both trust funds. ``Both the Hospital Insurance \nTrust Fund''--that is part A--``and the Supplemental Medical Insurance \nTrust Fund show alarming financial results.'' The part A ``trust fund \ncontinues to be severely out of financial balance and is projected to \nbe exhausted in about 7 years.''\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee just read the \nreport from the CBO that says maybe the $89 billion which is in this \nproposal by the Democrats today will extend that trust fund, just that \npart A, for 2 years, maybe 2 years. It does not address the underlying \nproblem.\n  Going back to the Medicare trustees report: ``The HI Trust Fund \ncontinues to be severely out of financial balance. * * * The SMI Trust \nFund''--part B, not addressed by this proposed amendment today--``shows \na rate of growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable.'' Clearly \nunsustainable.\n  My point is, we have a program here you cannot just address one part \nwithout addressing the overall program.\n  Let me go back to a chart that was shown earlier by my colleague from \nNew Hampshire that shows that we are going bankrupt in 7 years. In 7 \nshort years there will be no Medicare part A trust fund.\n  Again, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said that \nthe CBO's preliminary estimate shows what will happen to the Medicare \ntrust fund if only $89 billion is saved over the next 7 years. Their \nconclusion: The Medicare HI trust fund is solvent through the year \n2004.\n  So what we have done is taken this curve and shifted it 2 years, put \na Band-Aid on it without addressing the underlying problem--again, \nshort-term solutions. That seems to be so much the approach here.\n  We are addressing it long-term.\n  Let me see the next chart. Again, this is a chart that shows next \nyear, if we do nothing, we will begin deficit spending in the year \n1996. Again, what we do with the motion in the Chamber now is to shift \nthis curve out, not change the slope of the curve at all but shift the \ncurve out 2 years for some commission to decide in the future.\n  In summary, the problem today is an antiquated, outdated system which \nserves senior citizens well but not as well as the private system \nserves people under 64 years of age.\n  We address that problem. The proposal in the Chamber currently, which \nI oppose, by the Democrats does not address the overall antiquation of \nthe system.\n  Second, the Democratic proposal in the Chamber ignores this complex \nrelationship between A and B, touches just upon A.\n  And third, the Democratic proposal, as Senator Roth pointed out, the \nonly thing it does is move these problems out another 2 years beyond \nthe next election.\n  Ours is a long-term solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be necessarily brief, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I find it fascinating to hear none of my Republican \ncolleagues stand up and say the Medicare system is bad. They say things \nlike it is antiquated and outdated, but it serves the senior citizens \nwell. How in the heck can that be done? How can it be antiquated, \noutdated, and serve the senior citizens well?\n  The second thing I would like to say is in response to my friend from \nGeorgia talking about Ozzie and Harriet. Let me tell you how Ozzie and \nHarriet are going to work under this proposal. They are going to find \nout that their mother and their father on Medicare are going to pay \n$800 or $900 a year more come the year 2002. Then when grandmom and \ngrandpop come to Ozzie and Harriet, because they have the same middle-\nclass values as the Senator from Georgia and I do, and mom says, \n``Ozzie, I tell you what, these Republicans gave me a choice; I can pay \n$800 more or I can go into one of these HMO things, but I do not get to \nsee Dr. Jones anymore,'' do you think Ozzie is going to stand there and \nsay, ``Hey, Mom, tough.''\n  Ozzie is going to reach in his pocket, like all the Ozzies in this \nChamber, and say, ``Don't worry, mom. Even though I can't pay my taxes, \neven though I can't get my kid to school, I am going to increase my \ntaxes, in effect, 800 bucks to pay for you and 800 bucks to pay for dad \nbecause I know your median income is about $18,000, so I will take care \nof it for you.''\n  This is a tax increase for middle-class people who care about their \nparents.\n  And wait until we get to Medicaid, when Ozzie and Harriet get the \nphone call midyear and mom says, ``Hon, they tell me I got to come \nhome; it's June. I gotta come home from the nursing home.'' Watch what \nhappens then to decent, honorable, middle-class people who are being \ncrunched on the one hand by their children with the cost of a college \neducation and the cost of maintaining their standard of living, which \nis slipping from them, and on the other hand, having to pick up the \ncosts for mom and dad.\n  The last point I would like to make is one of the reasons to send \nthis bill back, and that is, fraud, although Senator Roth did much \nbetter than our House Members did. Everyone acknowledges there is about \n$34 billion a year in fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. This bill hardly \ntouches the problem. This is the case, I might add, because health care \nproviders do not like us dealing with fraud.\n  I have been working to combat health care fraud for over 3 years \nnow--ever since I first introduced a health care fraud bill in the U.S. \nSenate and held hearings on health care fraud in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I found in those hearings--and it has been reported elsewhere ever \nsince--that fraud in the entire health care sector accounts for up to \n10 percent of all health care spending.\n  The same, unfortunately, is true for Medicare.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that fraud in the Medicare \nProgram will total up to $18 billion this year alone. Medicaid fraud is \nanother $16 billion.\n  Now, the vast majority of doctors and other health care providers are \nhonest professionals. But, a few dishonest manipulators are ripping off \nthe taxpayers and threatening the integrity of Medicare and Medicaid. A \nfew cynical criminals are preying on those who need health care the \nmost.\n  Going after these crooks and thieves who are defrauding the system \nmust be our top priority. If this motion to commit is adopted--and I \nhope it will be--the first place we should try to find savings is in \nMedicare fraud.\n  Later in the debate, Mr. President, I will be joining Senator Harkin \nand Senator Graham in offering an amendment specifically on Medicare \nfraud--and I hope my colleagues will support that as well.\n  According to one estimate, for every dollar we spend fighting \nMedicare fraud, we save $10. One example of this: \n\n[[Page S15629]]\n\nin 1994, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the Justice Department \nrecovered almost $7 million in fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid \npayments--more than what it cost to run the entire Justice Department \noffice in that district.\n  This is an excellent return on our investment. So, before we raise \ncosts to senior citizens--before we impose draconian cuts on benefits--\nwe need to root the robbers out of Medicare.\n  Let me say up again that the Senate bill is much better than the \nHouse bill on this front. The House bill would make it much more \ndifficult to prosecute health care fraud.\n  The House bill would change the standard of proof in a civil fraud \ncase from ``knows or should know'' to ``deliberate ignorance'' or \n``reckless disregard.''\n  The House bill would change the standard for enforcing the Federal \nantikickback laws. The current standard prohibits kickbacks when one of \nthe purposes is ``to induce'' referrals. But, the House bill would \nprohibit kickbacks only ``for the significant purpose of inducing \nreferrals.''\n  Fortunately, these provisions are not in the Senate bill. But, let me \nmention one thing about the Senate bill that troubles me from the fraud \nperspective.\n  The Senate bill would repeal all Federal safety protections for \nseniors in nursing homes. Last week, in Delaware, I held a forum on \nMedicare fraud. At that forum, Federal prosecutors said that \nelimination of nursing home standards would create a significant \nproblem in both the investigation and prosecution of patient abuse.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I believe the antifraud provisions in the \nSenate bill could be--and should be--stronger.\n  We need to guarantee that there will be funding to fight fraud--so \nthat there are more investigators and prosecutors in the field to go \nafter the crooks.\n  We should collect the costs of our investigations from those who are \nfound guilty. And, we should require the guilty to pay restitution to \nthe victims.\n  We need to strengthen the penalties for those found guilty of health \ncare fraud--including increased fines for those who violate the \nantikickback laws.\n  And, we should provide rewards for consumers and patients who uncover \nfraud.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the motion to \ncommit--so that fraud can be made the top priority in achieving Senate \nsavings. And, I hope my colleagues will later adopt the Harkin-Graham-\nBiden antifraud amendment.\n  Now is not the time to make it easier for the crooks and con artists \nto get away with ripping off the American taxpayer. Instead, we need to \nrenew and strengthen our efforts to fight Medicare fraud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield my time. Fraud is a problem. This bill does not \naddress it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I have been in the Chamber for 5 hours, \nand what we have not heard from the other side is the justification for \na $245 billion tax cut for the wealthiest individuals, the wealthiest \ncorporations and an increase in the taxes on the working families.\n  The challenge of the Rockefeller amendment is to join with us, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, put aside the tax cuts for the \nwealthy, put aside the tax breaks for the large corporations, put aside \nthe tax increase on the working families, and join with us in taking \nthe recommendations of the trustees' report for $89 billion, work with \nus for a program that will mean no increase in premiums, no increase in \ncopays, no increase in deductibles, not lifting the age eligibility \nissue and assuring the senior citizens of a meaningful choice.\n  We can do that. We should do it. That is the challenge. That \neffectively is the challenge of the Rockefeller amendment, and I hope \nit will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of this \ndebate, all of this comes out of the Contract With America. All of the \n$270 billion cut in Medicare comes out of the desire to find the tax \nbreaks for wealthy families and corporations.\n  When you are looking for that kind of money in the budget that we now \nhave, you cannot look to the military. You cannot look to education. \nYou have to look to the places where the money is. That is in Medicare, \nthat is in Medicaid, to some degree in the earned income tax credit \nand, of course, to some degree in welfare.\n  So the Republicans have pounced upon Medicare, and they have decided \nnot to solve the Medicare problem but to bury Medicare with the idea of \nmaking absolutely certain that they could get the most amount of money \nfrom Medicare for the purposes of their tax breaks for the wealthy that \nthey possibly could.\n  This vote is about nothing else than that. If it is simply a matter \nof trying to solve the Medicare problem, then the Democratic solution \nin this amendment, which I hope people will support, is the answer: $89 \nbillion will do it. If it is tax breaks for the wealthy, and that is \nwhat you are after, then you will want to vote against this amendment \nbecause that is not what we on this side are trying to do.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand the genesis and the nature of \nwhat this whole argument has been about from the very beginning.\n  This is a historic vote. It is a defining moment. It is an extremely \ndangerous moment for the seniors of our country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has just under 8 \nminutes remaining. The Senator from West Virginia has 28 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes of that.\n  Mr. President, there is no question this is a defining moment. It is \na defining moment because today and tomorrow we are going to decide \nwhether we want to have a Medicare program for the senior citizens of \nthe United States or whether we want, under this amendment, to protect \none little part of it for a couple of years.\n  Which do the seniors really want? Do they want a Democratic proposal \nwhich essentially ignores more than half of the Medicare program, does \nnot even talk about it? It is in big trouble. And then it says we are \nonly going to reform the hospital program sufficiently to keep that \nfund solvent for how many years, I ask Dr. Frist?\n  Mr. FRIST. Two additional years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two additional years, two additional years.\n  Now, for all the talk on that side of the aisle, the truth of the \nmatter is, they do not really care about senior citizens. They would \nrather win this fight than protect the senior citizens. They are \ncrisscrossing America and using the airwaves to frighten them to death. \nAnd what is their proposal? Their proposal is to extend the trust fund \n2 years.\n  Now, let me suggest, nobody should believe with that dose of reality \nthat this is anything more than a political exercise. It has little or \nnothing to do with American senior citizens. It has to do with trying \nto win at the ballot box. And let me say to the seniors, once we have \nresolved this issue, you will find the reality and you will not be \nduped by the debates of today. Rather, you will be convinced by the \nreality of tomorrow, which means we are going to have a Medicare system \nthat is solvent, that we can afford, and that our young people who are \nhelping pay for it can be proud of.\n  Now, there is no question that once again it is proven that the other \nside of the aisle, the Democrats, would rather tax and spend than to \nreduce expenditures and cut the American people's \n\n[[Page S15630]]\n\ntaxes. For what else is this? If there are no tax cuts in this bill, \npart A of Medicare goes broke. Take them off the table and it goes \nbroke. That is not this Senator speaking. That is the trustees, four of \nwhom work for the President. Forget the tax cut, it goes broke. So what \nare they talking about? They are talking about a political issue, not \nthe reality of what we as leaders must do.\n  Frankly, there is no question that the trustees talked to us about \nboth parts of Medicare. Seniors, you understand very few of you go to \nhospitals every year, but a lot of you go to see your doctors. The \nhospital coverage is the part that will be protected for 2 additional \nyears, but the rest of the program will be, according to the Democratic \nversion, will be left in the doldrums.\n  The trustees told us both part A and part B are in serious, serious \ntrouble. And we have explained to everyone, we do not have to change \nthings a lot to make this a far better program for the future and give \nseniors a choice rather than have them rattled by the bureaucracy and \npaperwork that frustrates them more than the doctors that serve them.\n  If you have ever heard a senior complain, they say, ``Why do we have \nto fill out all these papers? We don't even understand them. We are \ngetting defrauded. We can never find out what it costs.'' That will all \nchange once we defeat this amendment today and move on with the \nRepublican agenda.\n  Let me make one last remark. We used to hear that it was the House \nplan that was going to give all these tax cuts to the rich. And we used \nto come down here and say, ``What plan are you talking about?'' They \nwould say, ``The House plan.'' They cannot talk about it anymore \nbecause right here before us is the Senate plan. And the Senate plan \ndoes not cut taxes for the rich as described on the floor of the Senate \nby the distinguished Democratic Senators. Let me say, once and for all, \n90 percent of the tax cut in this bill--not 60 percent, not 50 \npercent--90 percent will go to Americans with $100,000 in income or \nless. And that is not Domenici, that is the Joint Tax Committee--90 \npercent.\n  Now, they can get up and hypothetically say we are giving the rich \nback tax cuts. Ninety percent go to $100,000 earners and less. Are \nthose the rich people of America or are those the people with families \nthat need some help in raising their children? That is what this Senate \nbill is about. We have decided that our families raising children ought \nto get a better economic break because years ago we used to give them a \nbreak. We took it away.\n  In fact, I would close by saying a piece of this tax bill goes to \ncorrect what the Democrats did last time. They raised the marital \ndeduction. They made it cheaper to be unmarried than married with the \nsame income, another enticement not to get married, not to stay \ntogether and raise your kids because you get a break if you do not.\n  We have fixed that in this bill. Is that helping rich people of \nAmerica or is that helping thousands of Americans that would like the \nbenefit of not being treated inferior because they happen to file \njointly as husband and wife?\n  It seems to me we are on the right side of these issues. And all we \nare going to hear is political rhetoric, half-truths. And by the time \nwe are finished, and this program is implemented, I suggest it will be \nthose prophets of gloom who predict what is unpredictable--because it \nwill not happen--they will be the ones to suffer, not the Senators on \nthis side who are going to stand up and be counted today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time to accommodate my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I was told that the previous speaker just has \nindicated that it is his view that Democrats do not care about senior \ncitizens. If that is what he said, I am very disappointed. He knows \nbetter than that. In fact, the issues in this debate are about finding \nthe best approach for senior citizens, and finding a way to ensure that \nthe commitment we made three decades ago will remain for as many \ndecades as this country exists. These are the issues.\n  I think it is all too convenient--all too convenient--that at the \nvery time our Republican colleagues propose a $245 billion tax cut, it \njust so happens they also propose to cut Medicare $270 billion.\n  I know there are some who say it is sheer coincidence. I know there \nare some who say we could come up with the tax cut or the tax break \nrevenue in other ways. But I also know that there are not many pools \nout there that are big enough to accommodate a tax cut, a tax break of \nthat size. This is the biggest rollback in health benefits to senior \ncitizens in American history. This is the biggest financial transfer \nfrom low- and middle-income families to the upper-income brackets in \nAmerican history. So no one should be misled. This will be the most \nimportant vote we will cast during the budget debate.\n  So, Mr. President it is with a great deal of concern, grave concern, \nthat we offer this amendment this afternoon. There is no question about \nwhat this proposal in the reconciliation package means for senior \ncitizens. I do not think there is any doubt. Any analytical report will \nshow that this proposal will cause senior couples to pay more than \n$2,800 more in Medicare premiums and deductibles.\n  We know it will double premiums. We know it will double deductibles. \nWe know it will increase the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67. \nWe know that it eliminates protections for seniors by providing doctors \nand managed care plans with opportunities to charge seniors more than a \nMedicare-approved rate. We know all of that. There is no doubt about \nit. No dispute.\n  No one should be misled. This proposal is going to hurt. And if it \nwere in some way designed to really reform Medicare, and to bring the \ntrust fund into solvency in ways beyond what the Democrats have \noffered, I could understand it. If we were in a position where it was \nthis plan or bankruptcy, I could see that we might have to suck it in \nand do it.\n  But we know with certainty that is not the case. The actuaries and \nthe trustees have told us that we need $89 billion to keep the trust \nfund solvent into the year 2006. Not a penny more. In an analysis of \nthe House plan to cut $270 billion, the actuaries also indicated a \nsolvency date in 2006. Where does the extra money go?\n  Again, no one should be misled. This is not a question about \nsolvency. It is a question about where we go for revenue to pay for the \ntax cut that we have been debating now for several months.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, the damage done under this plan \nreaches beyond seniors. The problem with the health care provisions in \nthe reconciliation package is that 9 million people in rural America \ncould find their clinics closed when they need health care in the \nfuture. Under these proposals, we know the hurt will be widespread.\n  We know that in South Dakota 10 to 15 rural hospitals would likely \nclose.\n  We know that these proposals will undermine health care provided in \nrural America.\n  We know that huge cuts to teaching hospitals will decimate medical \nresearch and training programs.\n  We know that up to $100 billion is going to be cost-shifted on to \nthose with insurance in the private sector, according to the Lewin-VHI \nstudy.\n  We know all of these things, and more. So this is not just an issue \nfor senior citizens. This is an issue affecting rural America, and \nevery single person with private insurance in the country.\n  And so, Mr. President, I just hope before we cast this vote that no \none misunderstands our choices. If we choose to protect the trust fund \nby ensuring its solvency, to recognize the importance of this issue to \nsenior citizens and their families, to say no to tax breaks in areas \nwhere they are not necessary, and to say no to tax breaks to the \nwealthy, then the choice is very clear. Democrats have presented an \nalternative that makes sense, that ensures solvency, that assures, in \nthe long term, senior citizens are going to continue to get the best \ncare that we could possibly provide and that protects a commitment that \nis now more than 30 years old. We owe them that. We ought to adopt this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S15631]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time \nremains and who has time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-seven seconds to the Senator from New \nMexico; 28 seconds to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from West Virginia want to save his 28 \nseconds?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to finish wrapping up. There \nis a suggestion when we talk about how much is being reformed, how many \ndollars are going to be saved, nobody talks about how much we are going \nto spend. The senior citizens ought to know we are really not intent on \ndenying them money for health care. In fact, over 7 years on Medicare \nalone, we will spend $1.65 trillion. In the seventh year, we will spend \n$104 billion more than in the year it starts. It will go up to $104 \nbillion more, a total of $1.65 trillion, which we cannot hardly \nunderstand.\n  With that, I yield back any time I might have and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2949 to the Instructions of the Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2949 to the instructions to the motion to commit S. \n     1357 to the Finance Committee.\n       Strike all after ``Finance'' and insert the following: \n     ``With instructions to report the bill back to the Senate \n     forthwith to include the findings of the Trustees of the \n     Federal Insurance Trust Fund that, in order to save Medicare \n     and to keep the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund solvent for \n     future generations, Congress must address both the long-term \n     and short-term shortfalls in the Medicare program.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the underlying amendment that is before the \nbody suggests that this measure be returned to the committee and deal \nonly with the amount of money that would need to keep the fund from \ngoing bankrupt or being insolvent through the year 2006.\n  That figure is based on their intermediate projections. I as one am \nfamiliar, as I think most Members are familiar, with our process. We do \na conservative projection. We do an optimistic projection. We do an \nintermediate projection. I might remind Members that in Social Security \nprojections, for most of the years we have had those Social Security \nprojections, the optimistic projection has not proved to be correct. As \na matter of fact, the intermediate projection has not proved to be \ncorrect. As a matter of fact, the conservative projection has not \nproved to be correct. Through most of the years we have had those \nSocial Security projections, as a matter of fact, even the conservative \none proved to be far too optimistic.\n  None of us have a crystal ball, but I think it would be foolish in \nthe first order for us to assume that the $89 billion is going to be \nenough to keep this fund solvent through the year 2006. If history is \nto be the judge in looking at the projections we have had, it is quite \nclear that we may well see this fund go insolvent if the underlying \namendment is adopted.\n  I think men and women of honesty and fortitude who have discussed \nthis issue today can honestly disagree about the projections. It could \nbe the intermediate projection is just fine. It could be that the \nconservative projection is far too optimistic, as history as has shown. \nBut one thing I do know and one thing is incontrovertible. If you read \nthe report of the trustees--and let me remind the Members, the trustees \nare appointed by the President of the United States and all but one of \nthem are Democrats; that is, of the seven trustees, all seven have been \nappointed by the President and all but one of them are Democrats--they \nsay in their report that after the 10 years that is contemplated in the \nunderlying amendment that this fund goes belly up, even if you do the \n$89 billion with the intermediate projections.\n  They say, in the long run, it does not meet the 7-year solvency test \nand they say, moreover, it becomes much, much more difficult to meet \nit, as you have the baby boomers coming in after this 2006 period.\n  So the suggestion in the underlying amendment is that you should deal \nonly with the current crisis and close your eyes to the real insolvency \nthat is coming in Medicare. I believe Americans deserve better. \nFrankly, Mr. President, I think Americans expect better. If you go out \nto the working men and women of this country and you tell them that we \nare going to come up with a program that will let you pay taxes for \nanother 10 years, but at the end of 10 years, according to our \nintermediate projections, there will not be anything left for you to \ncollect on, I think they would be outraged.\n  Frankly, I think they deserve to be outraged. The proposal that is \nbefore the body says, ``Let us slip by for now, make working people pay \nanother 10 years and then have nothing for them when we get to the end \nof 2006.''\n  That is not Hank Brown projecting with regard to the Medicare trust \nfund. That is not a group of Republicans projecting. That is a report \nby Presidential appointees themselves, six of the seven who are \nDemocrats, all appointed by the President of the United States. That is \nnot a Republican projection; that, if you want one, is a Democratic \nprojection.\n  I think we need to do better than that. I think we need to say to the \nworking men and women of this country, ``We're not only going to take \nyour money for the next 10 years,'' which the current law does, ``but \nwe're going to make sure there is something there for you when we \nfinish.''\n  That is what this amendment does. This amendment makes it quite clear \nthat what we are to look at is not just the short term, but the long \nterm as well. I believe that is a proper focus. I believe it meets our \ncommitment.\n  We have a choice with this amendment. We can go with the short-term \noutlook that leaves the fund insolvent after 10 years, or we can go \nwith the long-term outlook that requires that this end up being solvent \nin the long run as well.\n  Mr. President, I suppose one of the saddest things to see, with \nrespect to Federal programs which we have put in place for working men \nand women, where they rely on the Federal Government themselves, is the \nGovernment being in a position where we cannot meet our \nobligations. This is by a Federal Government that, through ERISA, has \ncome forward and said, with regard to private pension plans, that you \nare required to make them financially sound, and we put in place very \ntough rules on the private sector that forces them to fund them, with \nextreme penalties on anyone who would not.\n\n  I do not think anyone would fail to be uncomfortable with the \nproposition that says in the private sector we are going to mandate \nthese to be actuarially sound, but in the public sector, trust us. Why \nwould people not want to trust us? For exactly the reason for the \nunderlying amendment. The amendment says we will fix it in the short \nterm and leave a problem for the long term. That is the difference in \nthe private sector. What we have done is impose on them burdens to be \nsound, to fund their obligations, and to face up to them. And in the \npublic sector what we have done with the underlying amendment is say we \nare only going to fix it up and get by, and at the end of 10 years, \nafter taking your money, there will not be a balance left there to help \nyou meet your obligations.\n  I believe we have to do better. We have had a lot of people quoted \nhere. Let me quote the President's nominees on this board. These are \nthe conclusions of the board of trustees:\n\n       Under the trustees' intermediate assumptions--\n\n  My own view is that the assumptions are far too optimistic.\n\n       Under the trustees' intermediate assumptions, the present \n     financing schedule for the HI program is sufficient to ensure \n     the payment of benefits only over the next 7 years. \n\n[[Page S15632]]\n\n      As a result, the HI trust fund does not meet the trustees' \n     short-range test of financial adequacy. Under the high-cost \n     alternative, the fund is projected to be exhausted in the \n     year 2001, approximately 6 years from present. Under the low-\n     cost alternative, the conservative one, the trust fund is \n     projected to be exhausted in the year 2006. Currently, about \n     four covered workers support each HI enrollee. This ratio \n     will begin to decline very rapidly in the next century. By \n     the middle of that century, only about two covered workers \n     will support each enrollee.\n\n  Let me pause here, Mr. President. I want to reiterate that because it \nunderlines the problem we have and the reason we should address it. \n``By the middle of the next century''--quoting the Democratic majority \non the board--``only about two covered workers will support each \nenrollee.''\n  Mr. President, that is our problem and that is what needs to be \naddressed long term.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator highlighted a critical point, which \nwas not made by the Senator or by anybody on our side, but made by the \ntrustees of the hospital insurance trust fund, three of whom are \nmembers of this administration--Secretary Rubin, Secretary Shalala, and \nSecretary Reich--which is that the trust fund is headed toward \ninsolvency, and that in order to correct the insolvency, there would \nhave to be a significant adjustment in the trust fund, either in the \nway of revenue or benefit costs.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado if he noted also on \npage 27 that they put a number on what that adjustment would have to \nbe. Their number, as I read it, is .65 percentage adjustment in payroll \nrates for employees and employers, which translates into $387 billion \nof adjustment which must occur over a 7-year period. This is the \ntrustees speaking, saying an adjustment must occur over a 7-year period \nin order to get actuarial solvency, under their intermediate \nassumptions--which you say are rather rosy--for a 25-year period, which \nthey consider to be a short time. They would rather it be for 75 years. \nThat means when the other side comes forward with a proposal that only \ndoes $89 billion, they are missing the mark, according to their own \ntrustees, by somewhere in the vicinity of $300 billion. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the distinguished Senator that I believe his \nanalysis is correct. It points out the enormous problem we have here. \nWe will have an absolutely catastrophic impact if we do not address it \nnow. The longer we wait, the more difficult the problem gets. I am \nreminded by staff that we need to make it clear in this amendment that \nwe are exempting part B of the Medicare.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2949, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of my \namendment that clarifies that aspect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2949), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       I modify the text of my amendment to read as follows: \n     ``with instructions to report the bill back to the Senate \n     forthwith providing that all savings to Part B of Medicare \n     made by the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 shall \n     be transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; to include the \n     findings of the trustees of the Federal Insurance Trust Fund \n     that, in order to save Medicare and to keep the Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund solvent for future generations, Congress \n     must address both the long-term and short-term shortfalls in \n     the Medicare program.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to continue, if I may, to make \navailable in the Record the exact words of the board of trustees. I \nthink they have credibility not only because this is a contentious \nissue between parties and they happen to be--six of them--Democratic \nmembers, all appointed by the President. I think that renders at \nleast--even though they are partisan in their majority, it brings \ncertain credibility to these deliberations. Frankly, I think that for \nmost Americans looking at this, that is the first question they will \nhave about this aspect of it.\n  Continuing on with this:\n\n       Not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the \n     HI program inadequate to offset the demographic change, but \n     under all sets of assumptions, the trust fund is projected to \n     become exhausted even before the major demographic shift \n     begins to occur.\n\n  What we are talking about here, Mr. President, is before you have \nthat adjustment from four workers down to two workers supporting the \npersons who receive the benefits--even before that demographic change \nbegins, you have problems with the solvency of the fund. The trustees \ngo on:\n\n       The trustees note that some steps have been taken to reduce \n     the rate of growth in payments to hospitals, including the \n     implementation of prospective payment systems for most \n     hospitals, and experience to date suggests that this \n     mechanism, together with provisions enacted by Congress, has \n     restrained the growth in hospital payments that improve the \n     efficiency of the hospital industry.\n\n  In their overview, they continue on, and I think this is more \nsignificant for our purposes:\n\n       Extension of this payment system to other providers of \n     hospital insurance services in further legislation limits \n     payment increases to all hospital insurance providers, could \n     postpone the depletion of the HI trust fund for about another \n     5 to 10 years. Much more substantial steps would be required, \n     however, to prevent trust fund depletion beyond 2010 when the \n     baby boom generation begins to reach age 65.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the nub of it. The trustees have put their \nfinger on it. They hit it exactly. You can do a quick fix for 5, 10 \nyears. That is, apparently, what is behind the thinking of the \nunderlying amendment. But in the Democratic trustees' own words:\n\n       Much more substantial steps would be required, however, to \n     prevent trust fund depletion beyond 2010 when the baby boom \n     generation begins to reach age 65. Under present law, as \n     shown by the projections in this report, the Hospital \n     Insurance program costs are expected to far exceed revenues \n     over the 75 year long-range period under any reasonable set \n     of assumptions.\n\n  Under any reasonable set of assumption, Mr. President. As a result, \nthe hospital insurance program is severely out of financial balance, \nand the trustees believe that the Congress must take timely action to \nestablish long-term financial stability for the program.\n  The President's own nominees are admonishing Congress to take timely \naction to establish long-term financial stability.\n  I have listened on this floor to Members stand up and say, ``Heavens, \nwe do not need to take long-term timely action. No, that is not what \nthe trustees said.'' Mr. President, it is in their report. It is in \nblack and white. It is on page 4.\n\n       The cost to the hospital insurance program is projected to \n     increase over 1.6 percent of gross domestic product in \n     calendar year 1994, to 4.4 percent of GDP in the year 2065. \n     This rapid growth is attributable primarily to anticipated \n     increases in hospital admissions and in the complexity of the \n     services provided, together with expected changes in \n     demographics.\n       With the magnitude of the projected actuary deficit in the \n     hospital insurance program and the high probability that the \n     hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in less than \n     10 years, the trustees urge the Congress to take additional \n     actions designed to control hospital insurance program costs \n     and to address the projected financial imbalance in both the \n     short range and the long range through specific program \n     legislation. As part of a broad-based health care reform, the \n     trustees believe that prompt, effective, and decisive action \n     is necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, how much more clearly can it be said? The President's \nown nominees, six of the seven of them Democrats, say it as clearly as \nis humanly possible: You have to take prompt, effective, and decisive \naction.\n  What is before the Senate is a suggestion we take a short-term view, \nthat we patch it up for 10 years and leave people who paid in all their \nlife without any coverage. That is not responsible. It does not conform \nwith the guidelines set forth by the President's own nominees.\n  They go on:\n\n       To facilitate this effort, the trustees further recommend \n     legislation to establish an advisory council for the Medicare \n     program. This action would help provide critical information \n     that will be needed by the administration and Congress as \n     they deliberate the future of the hospital insurance program.\n\n  Let me pause and simply mention this: The Republican leader himself \nasked the President--he was joined by the Speaker of the House--asked \nthe President to help set up a commission to work this through, as it \nwas done in Social Security, to come up with an answer in this area \nthat was bipartisan, that would lend integrity to the commitments we \nhave made to the men and women of this country who \n\n[[Page S15633]]\n\nhave paid into this program--some of them for almost all of their \nlives.\n  The President was unwilling to cooperate in that venture in a timely \nmanner to get an alternative before Congress.\n  Now, Mr. President, the reality is this: This should be a bipartisan \neffort. I do not believe that my Democratic colleagues want this fund \nto go bankrupt in the long run. The American public is wise enough to \nknow that many of the things each party says about the other are \nsomewhat taken with the heat of the moment and not necessarily meant \nseriously.\n  I do not believe Democrats, any more than Republicans, want this \nprogram to go belly up. I believe the vast majority of Americans, \nwhether Democrats or Republicans, would be shocked to know that this \nprogram will be out of funds in 10 years and we would not have taken \ncare of it.\n  I do not think anybody--Democrat, Republican, or independent--feels \nthat is responsible. I honestly believe that the people of this country \nexpect us to come up with the long-term answer. That is why this \namendment is offered. It talks about looking at the long run, not just \nthe short run.\n  Mr. President, that is the essence of what this debate is all about. \nMembers will have an option. They can vote ``no'' on this amendment and \nopt for a short-term solution only; or they can vote ``yes'' on this \nand help ensure that a long-term solution is in sight.\n  Mr. President, let me add a word of warning. The amounts of money in \nthis bill are estimated to be adequate with other changes that would be \nmade in the long run to help put us on sound footing and make it \nactuarily sound.\n  Mr. President, I must say, my own belief is that this does not go far \nenough. My own belief is that we should not be looking at the immediate \nprojection. My own belief is we should do much more than what is \nsuggested in this bill.\n  While we accept the immediate funds, and some would say what we need \nto do is have an $89 billion fix and others would say a fix in excess \nof $270 billion, my own estimate is that the problem is much greater \nthan that; that the projections are far too optimistic.\n  If we are to be responsible, we should not only do what is in this \nbill, we should set about seriously in an effort to make sure that we \nhave solved the problem for all time, that we have adopted the \nactuarial soundness principles that we impose on the private sector. We \nought to be willing to stand up and do as this Congress does--begin to \nlive by the same laws that we impose on others.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, no one is going to be fooled by this amendment. Our \nRepublican friends are scared of this vote. They do not want this vote \nto happen. It is Halloween and they are running scared. It is clear the \npeople who are running scared are the Republicans trying to cut the \nMedicare.\n  No one is fooled by this Halloween trick. The American people know \nwhat is at stake. Medicare is at stake and Democrats are trying to save \nit.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have been on the floor since the first hours, \nabout 10:30 this morning, when we began that debate. I have listened \nhour after hour after hour after hour how our Republican friends \njustify the measure before the U.S. Senate. They talked about the \ndifferent proposals of it. Why it was fair, why it was just, why it was \nequitable, how it was going to enhance health care for our senior \ncitizens.\n  That is what they have talked about. They would not talk about the \n$240 billion tax cut for the wealthiest individuals, for the \ncorporations, the tax increases on working families, the fact that they \nare raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67, the pressures that will \nbe on the senior citizens in reducing their options to be able to \nchoose their own doctors.\n  No, they did not address those particular issues. They did not \naddress those particular issues. They said what we have here makes \nsense. It makes sense for those who are interested in the balanced \nbudget. It makes sense for those who are interested in quality health \ncare.\n  Now, our Republican friends have come, on top of this amendment that \nwas offered by the Senator from West Virginia, and effectively \neliminated, emasculated in a way which would have, if it had been \naccepted, preserved what had been recommended by the trustees, the $89 \nbillion, and ensured there would be no increase in the copays and \ndeductible premiums for our seniors.\n  But, no, they would not give the Senate a chance to vote on that. \nInstead, they are here saying, instead of your amendment, why not just \nhave a study about the medium- and long-term interests of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  We are all for it. Why did you not do it when you had a chance? You \nhad the votes to do it. Why did you not do that earlier? You could have \nreported out some kind of measure in the meantime, but you did not do \nit.\n  All Members are concerned about what is going to happen after 10 \nyears of solvency for the Medicare system. Many of us believed that \nwhat you are concerned about and have offered recommendations and \nsuggestions, when you recognize that there is nothing in this \nlegislation that is going to do anything about providing preventive \nhealth care for our senior citizens. I am interested in that. What \nabout the 30 percent of overutilization in our hospitals because of \nMedicare entries into the hospitals? I am interested in that.\n  What are we doing to expand long-term care? Or home care for our \nseniors? I am interested in that. What are we doing about prescription \ndrugs so we can keep people out of the hospital and treat people in \ntheir homes and save billions of dollars? I am interested in that. Many \nof us are interested in that.\n  None of those issues was addressed by our Republican friends. No, \nnone of those issues that would have had an impact on the medium- and \nlong-term health care needs, none of those issues was addressed.\n  But, instead, after 5 hours of debate and justification of their own \nposition, they refused--absolutely refused--the effort of many of us \nwho want to try to protect Medicare, who want to defend Medicare. If \nthey are so correct, as we have been listening to them say for 5 hours, \nwhy will they not let us vote? Why will they not go and make the \nspeeches they have been making here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nback into the nursing homes, back in the senior citizens homes, back in \nthe plants and factories, and to the elderly people all over this \ncountry, if they believe that they are so right about it? If they think \nthe merits are on their side, why do they take this and defend it for 5 \nhours and then say, ``But we will not defend it any longer. We will not \ndefend it anymore. We will not defend it at all. We are going to try \nand emasculate what you are trying to do with regard to the protection \nof Medicare.''\n  You do not have to be around here a long time to understand what this \nis all about. You only have to be around here about 2 or 3 months to \nknow exactly what it is about, and that is you do not want to vote on \nit. You do not want to know about it.\n  You came up with this proposal without a hearing on the Medicare \ncuts. You refuse to listen to the elderly people about the impact it \nwas going to have on them. You jam this through the Finance Committee \nand the Budget Committee. And you say that it is justified to provide \n$240 billion to the wealthy individuals and corporations and increase \nthe taxes for working families.\n  You have done all that. You have it going your way, Senators. We have \na time limitation, restriction in terms of being able to take some days \nand provide some debate on this so the country can know what it is all \nabout. You have it going all your way. You can try to jam us because \nyou have the votes that way.\n  But, no, you refuse to even let us have a vote on accountability. \nCome on. Come on. Your program did not make any sense before and you \nare now demonstrating here on the floor of the U.S. Senate it does not \nmake any sense to you either, because you refuse to defend it. You \nrefuse to defend it.\n  We listened to all those speeches about how correct you were. Why \nwill you not let us have a vote on it? No. No, we are, instead, going \nto have a \n\n[[Page S15634]]\n\nvote on something else, a long-term study on it. We are interested in \nlong-term studies. We are interested in intermediate studies. What you \ndo not want to face is your $245 billion tax cut that is coming out of \nthe Medicare premiums, deductibles and copays for the seniors of the \ncountry--you do not, and refuse to let us have a vote on it.\n  Why? Why is it? Why have the Republicans not spoken about that? Why \ndid you not at least say, ``OK, we have addressed the short term and \nmedium term of the Medicare. Now we think it is right to get a tax cut \nfor the wealthiest individuals and we are proud to defend that \nposition.'' I have not heard that. I have not heard that speech. I do \nnot think we are going to hear it because it is indefensible, when you \nare looking at what they are attempting to do, and that is to undermine \nthe Medicare system which has been a compact with the seniors of this \ncountry since 1965.\n  You know, when I look at the conduct of our colleagues and friends I \ncan kind of understand why they do not want to vote on it. I was here \nin 1964 when the Medicare amendment was defeated. I was here 8 months \nlater, in 1965, when it passed. I was here when 19 Members who voted \n``no'' in the fall of 1964 voted ``yes'' in April of 1965. Do you know \nwhat had intervened? An election. An election intervened. Our \ncolleagues who were opposed to it then went back home and gave the same \nkinds of comments that were given, evidently, by the majority leader \nlast night, according to Tom Harkin, saying the majority leader was \nproud to oppose Medicare when it first came up and is still proud to \noppose it. Those were the speeches then.\n  And then they got a little awakening because the seniors knew what \nwas out there. The American people understood what was out there. Not \njust the elderly, but their sons and daughters had a fundamental \nrecognition that, when people grow older in our society, they have \nadditional kinds of health care needs and, by and large, their incomes \ngo down. That is what happens, not only industrial societies, but in \nother societies around the world. And, therefore, if we are going to be \na compassionate Nation and care about our seniors--the men and women \nwho fought in the wars, brought the country out of the Depression, \nsacrificed for their children, many of whom are sitting in the U.S. \nSenate--that there was going to be a compact. They were going to pay in \nand then they were going to be able to receive out.\n  The Democratic alternative is not perfect, but it provides for the \nfundamental integrity of the Social Security system for 10 years. That \nhas been testified to by the trustees themselves. But what we have not \ndone is included the tax goodies for wealthy individuals.\n  You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I am not surprised that you do \nnot want to vote on this turkey. I can understand that. Refuse? I would \ncertainly hope the leader would say, if we are not going to get the \nvote on this one, we are going to keep coming back and coming back and \ncoming back, every single time that we have in the 10 hours left, and \nwe are going to make every attempt to get a vote on it and let our \nRepublican friends pull every kind of trick in the book on it and let \nus take that issue all across this country and let you defend it. You \ncannot defend it. You cannot defend it.\n  You come up here and say, ``Let's get back to that trustees' report \nnow. Let's see what is going to happen in 10, 15, 20 years down \nthere.'' It is wonderful to hear all those voices now. We were \nattempting to deal with the medium- and long-term interests of this \nhealth care system in our country a year or so ago. It is wonderful \nsuddenly to find they are all interested in this now, really interested \nin long-term care.\n  Where are the initiatives in home care? Where is a single proposal \nfrom someone on the other side of the aisle on prescription drugs? That \nis a No. 1 problem for our seniors. Where is it? If you provide \nprescription drug assistance for our seniors you will probably do as \nmuch or more in terms of reducing long-term costs, because seniors will \nbe able to stay home instead of going to the hospitals in order to get \ntheir prescription drugs. And that is going to be true in a wide \nvariety of different areas. Sure we need some advice and counsel on \nthose.\n  What are we doing on home care, so we can give alternatives to our \nseniors whether they want to go into a nursing home or remain home and \nget some help and assistance? Where is the Senators' proposal on that? \nWhere are these proposals on it, to demonstrate that suddenly we are \ninterested in the long-term interests of our elderly people? Why do we \nnot keep them out of high-cost facilities? Where are your proposals on \nthat? Where are these proposals, that, suddenly we really care about \nthese long-term interests?\n  They are not there. They are not there because at the core of it, \nthis program on Medicare has not been a program that you supported over \nits history, and the record shows it. Suddenly, to find out that you \ncare about this after, in the House of Representatives, they used $80 \nbillion of part A for their tax program, and then a month later said, \n``Oh, my goodness, there is some difficulty in the insurance fund.'' \nAnd some said,\n  ``Don't you think we ought to go back and restore the $80 billion?''\n  ``Oh, no, we are going to need that for the tax cut, a tax cut which \nis even greater in the House of Representatives.''\n  The reason we are debating this is they had no opportunity to do it \nin the House of Representatives--none, closed down. Here we have 1 \nhour, and were thinking we were going to at least have a chance to get \nsome kind of result, at least get a chance so we can speak on these \nissues, to try to work out, in the time that is available, a series of \namendments which would be defining in terms of what this debate is all \nabout.\n  But we are even denied that opportunity, evidently. We are denied \nthat opportunity on the first amendment out; denied the chance to have \na rollcall vote on this issue.\n  So, Mr. President, I would have suggested to the minority leader and \nto our friends, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Exon, that if they have \nthat amendment and just use that as an add-on, as an add-on to this \namendment, to have the language included. I had it here a moment ago. \nIt is not the wording. Words can be worked out, that you send it back \nthe way we suggested that it be sent back with a report for the $89 \nbillion, and then we also include, if you want, recommendations in \nterms of meeting long-term care.\n  I do not understand why the Senator is so concerned about it, why \nthat route would not be acceptable. But, oh, no, you cannot have it \nthat way. We are not that concerned. We are not that concerned about \nmedium and long term. But the Senator is hoping the whole thing will go \ndown, that all of it will go down.\n  Do not fool us. We know what is going on around here. I do not know \nif the American people do. I hope that they have been watching--at \nleast today--this debate and discussion to try to find out who is \nattempting to defend the Medicare system, who believes in it, who, by \nhistory and tradition, is a party of defending it and supporting it. \nThey will know because they sure will not know it on the first \nproposition in defense of the majority leader's legislation that is \nbefore us.\n  So, Mr. President, everyone ought to have a very clear idea. I am \nsure the seniors do. There may be those around here who think they do \nnot just because they are challenged with various physical illnesses \nand have difficulty sometimes in being able to hear all of the \ndifferent words or read because their sight is facing difficulty, or \nunable to get around. They know when they are being fooled or when \nthere is an attempt to be made a fool of. They can look through.\n  If they take the time to read this debate over the time here today, \nthey will know who is on their side. It is not those who have \npromulgated this amendment, but it is those who have said, take back \nthe giveaways, take back those tax breaks to the wealthy individuals \nand corporations, take back that age restriction for an eligibility \nincrease, take back those additional taxes on working families. And let \nus get something out here that will assure our seniors that there will \nnot be increases in the copays and deductibles, and that they will have \nthe choice of their doctors.\n  We have asked to try to work that out together so we can have \nsomething \n\n[[Page S15635]]\n\nthat will deal with the economic challenges, but, most importantly, \nassure that our senior citizens are going to have their contract \nmaintained with the American people and with the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Minnesota. I am glad to divide up \nthe time.\n  How much time is on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 42 minutes and 45 \nseconds, and the majority has 39 minutes and 34 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be pleased to alternate, if my \ncolleagues want to do that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have taken more time than the other \nside. I will try to be brief so the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota can go ahead. I simply want to respond to the discussion with \nregard to taxes.\n  My amendment does not deal with the tax portion. Mr. President, I am \nfirmly committed to making sure the money in Medicare stays in \nMedicare, that none of it gets used for any other purposes. Frankly, \nthat is what is in the bill.\n  Let me suggest this. Sometimes people organize demonstrations and \nthey make the signs in advance, and it turns out the signs do not have \nanything to do with what the reality is. That is what has happened \nhere. They made up their signs about tax cuts for millionaires, and it \nturned out they no longer apply. What they have done is used the signs \nanyway.\n  Mr. President, the biggest portion of this bill deals with the child \ntax credit, and it makes clear that higher income people do not get it. \nThey not only do not get what everybody else gets, they do not get \nanything at all from the child tax credit. So the discussion about how \nyou are somehow helping the millionaires out is quite misplaced, at \nleast in this Member's view. What they have done basically is made up \ntheir signs in advance and have not been able to adjust them.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I really welcome this debate, and in \nthe spirit of debate, colleagues, I say to my colleague from Colorado \nthat the problem with the tax credit proposal is that it is not \nrefundable and that if you are a family with an income under $29,000 a \nyear, you are not going to receive it. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Where is the standard of fairness? In my State of Minnesota, we are \ntalking about a significant percentage of the population, families with \nincomes under $29,000 a year. If it is not a refundable credit, it does \nnot do any good at all for that family.\n  Mr. President, I just want to respond to a couple of comments by my \ncolleague that were made earlier. And in the main, what I would like to \nspeak to is this argument that somehow part of this debate is a scare \ntactic or this is an effort to ``terrorize senior citizens.''\n  Mr. President, I think that, as a matter of fact, that is a bit \ninsulting to senior citizens. It is a bit insulting to citizens in our \ncountry, period. People have their own wisdom.\n  I was in a debate the other day with several of my colleagues at U.S. \nNews and World Report. I said, forget all of this discussion about \nscare tactics. I wish we were talking about scare tactics so I would \nnot use it. People have their own intelligence. People can figure this \nout for themselves.\n  And, one more time, we have an amendment here that now is in the \nsecond degree. Why are my colleagues afraid to have an up-or-down vote \non this? We had the debate. Now the rubber meets the road.\n  We have been saying to you that $89 billion--which is what you needed \nfor the trust fund--what you are doing is cutting $270 billion for \nMedicare.\n  In addition, we have said, what is the meaning of $270 billion of \ncuts in Medicare juxtaposed with tax giveaways, in the main, and $245 \nbillion that goes to people with higher income?\n  You can vote that up or down, colleagues. It is time now to match \nyour votes with your rhetoric. Why are you afraid of an up-or-down \nvote?\n  Mr. President, the only people that are terrorized here right now are \nsome of my colleagues on the other side who are in terror that they \nmight have to vote what they have said they believe all along.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator agree with me that if our friends on \nother side of the aisle are really interested in reforming Medicare, \nthey would drop the tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, \ndrop that, and let us see if we cannot find some way of trying to deal \nwith this in a medium and long-term way?\n  Does the Senator believe, and is it the Senator's view, if they were \nprepared to do that, that this particular proposal would be the \ndifference?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts his question is right on the mark, because what people \nare saying in Minnesota and around the country is, please permit us to \nbe suspicious because you are cutting much more than is necessary for \nthe trust fund, and we think you are making Medicare the piggyback for \ntax cuts for wealthy people. And if, in fact, you would give up on \nthese tax giveaways--and we were not talking about the $245 billion--\nthen I think we can get down to a discussion where we can focus on what \nwe need to do, I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, for real \nreform.\n  Real reform, Mr. President, is universal coverage. Real reform is \nmaking sure that elderly people can afford prescription drug costs. \nReal reform is home-based care so that people can live at home in as \nnear a normal circumstance as possible, with dignity, and not have to \nbe institutionalized. Real reform is where there is a standard of \nfairness.\n  I tell you what is not real reform--reverse reform, where we cut $270 \nbillion from Medicare and at the same time we have a $245 billion tax \ngiveaway.\n  I have been in debates with colleagues, and they have said, I say to \nmy colleague from Massachusetts, over and over and over again, no, this \nis all for Medicare. This is what we need to do. This makes Medicare \nsolvent. This reforms Medicare. This is for the good. This amendment \nputs them to the test. If that is the case, then vote against this \namendment. Vote it up or down.\n  I find it just unbelievable that after all the speeches that have \nbeen given and after all the reassurances that have been given, my \ncolleagues are unwilling to vote on this. That is what the second-\ndegree amendment is all about. It is a huge dodge from a vote that \npeople should have the courage to make.\n  One more time, in my State of Minnesota, 50 percent of senior \ncitizens have incomes under $20,000 a year. In my State of Minnesota, \nmany of our elderly live in rural communities, and those hospitals and \nthose clinics have a huge percentage of their patient payment from \nMedicare and they do not have a profit margin. If you go ask those \nproviders--has anybody asked them? Anybody asked the clinics? Anybody \nasked the doctors? Anybody asked the nurses? Anybody asked the \nphysician's assistants much less the beneficiaries? They will tell you \nthat they cannot survive some of these reductions. They will not be \nthere to deliver health care.\n  So this is not about scare tactics, I say to my colleagues. This is \nabout some unpleasant realities. And one more time, we have in our \nState 635,000 Medicare beneficiaries. It will be about 685,000, or \n675,000, I believe, by 2002. Later on, we will talk about medical \nassistance. We have 425,000 beneficiaries of medical assistance. It \nwill go up to 535,000. And anybody who wants to look at the policy \ncarefully and understand its impact on citizens understands that the \nway you view health care is you look at the number of people who are \ngoing to be eligible, what the existing benefits are that people will \nneed to have for quality health care and what the medical inflation \nlevel is, and these reductions fall far short of that.\n  I say to my colleagues, you just do not have the credible argument. \nYou cannot cut $270 billion from Medicare at the same time you have \n$245 billion \n\n[[Page S15636]]\n\nof tax giveaways, mainly going to wealthy people. You cannot do it. It \nmakes no sense. And with this amendment, introduced by Senator \nRockefeller, we give you the chance to vote on what you say you believe \nin. We give you the chance for an up-or-down vote where you can match \nall of your speeches with your votes, where you can look the American \npeople in the eye and you can say we believe that all $270 billion is \nnecessary in order to, as you say, save Medicare.\n  I do not think you are saving Medicare. I think in the name of saving \nMedicare you are destroying part of Medicare. That is what this vote \nwould have been about. I think the only people who are terrorized are \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who are terrorized that they \nhave to vote what they have been talking about for the last 6 or 7 \nmonths.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Again for a question. If this is such a great deal for \nthe seniors, why do all of the seniors themselves and their principal \nrepresentatives, the American Association of Retired Persons, Council \nof Senior Citizens, National Committee to Preserve Social Security/\nMedicare testify in opposition to the plan? If this is such a great \ndeal--we listened to these Senators talk about it this morning for 5 \nhours--5 hours--and then the time came to call the roll. Oh, no, you \ncannot even have a vote on your amendment, even though we think it is \nso great. If it is so great, why will they not defend that back home to \ntheir seniors? Why will they not be able to go into their senior \ncitizens homes and be able to justify it?\n  They cannot do it. They cannot do it. And the proposal and the idea \nthat we want to look at medium or long term, they could have done that \nbefore. They could have reported out something with those kinds of \nprovisions. But no, suddenly when they are just about to call the roll, \nthey pull this amendment out and send it to the desk.\n  As we have said before, this is Halloween, and it is trick or treat \ntime. This amendment is a trick on the seniors of this country, and it \nshould not be accepted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond and then just simply \nyield the floor to some of my other colleagues who would like to speak.\n  First of all, let me just say to the Senator from Massachusetts and \nmy colleague from Iowa--if I could get their attention just for a \nmoment--it is very interesting; you asked the question, if this is so \ngood for senior citizens and represents such good reform, with all the \npromises that have been made, how come all of the organizations and all \nthe people who are going to be affected by this are opposed to it?\n  The answer is there is a huge disconnect between these proposals and \nthe lives of people back in the States. These proposals are very \nreckless with the lives of senior citizens. And it is the intelligence \nof senior citizens in Minnesota not because anybody is leading them \naround by their noses; it is their own intelligence and their own \ninsight which tells them that these proposals are not in their best \ninterests.\n  I have to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that \nyour refusal to vote on your own proposal does nothing to reassure \nthem. We have been hearing your speeches forever. We have been seeing \nyour ads on television. You have been telling the senior citizens this \nis going to be so great, and now you have a chance to vote what you say \nyou believe in, and all of a sudden, I say to my colleague from Iowa, \nwe see them just running away, running away.\n  That is my first point. My second point is that--I do not even \nremember my second point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question and then by \nthen I will get my second point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more \nminutes so I can come up with my second point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 more minutes off his side's \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I would love to do is simply say to my friend the \nreason he did not get to his second point is his first point was so \ngood. But I have to say that in listening to my colleagues--and I truly \nwas not going to participate in this particular amendment. I had come \nover here expecting a vote on it. What do I find? We are blocked from \nvoting. What is the other side afraid of if they are so excited about \ntheir plan? They are afraid to vote.\n  I will tell you why they are afraid. Because they know that the \nAmerican people are waking up and they understand now it only takes $89 \nbillion to keep Medicare solvent, and they are cutting $270 billion. We \nknow they need to cut that much to come up with what Newt Gingrich \ncalls the crown jewel of the contract, the tax breaks for the wealthy. \nAnd I say to my friend, because he has been working on these issues a \nlong time, in his hometown and his home State, do seniors understand \nwhy the Republicans want to give $5,500 a year back to people who earn \nover $350,000 while they destroy Medicare, Medicaid, student loans, and \nfor God sakes repeal nursing home standards? Do the people in his State \nunderstand that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nCalifornia, no. And I think this becomes an issue of Minnesota fairness \nand people just do not find it credible--$270 billion in cuts in \nMedicare but only $89 billion needed for the trust fund, and at the \nsame time $245 billion in tax cuts, disproportionately going to people \non the top. No, that violates the Minnesota standard of fairness.\n  My second point, which came to me, is that this whole business about \nsome sort of a study of what the consequences of all this will be, \nSenators, we have this that just came to us--2,000 pages. And my \ncolleague from Utah, whom I deeply respect, said the more people in the \ncountry get to know about our plan the better they like it. People do \nnot know what is in this plan.\n  I say to my colleague from California, I have said for the last month \nthis is a rush to recklessness, and it is because when you talk to the \npeople who live in the communities that are affected by this and \ndeliver the care to Medicare beneficiaries, they are saying this will \nnot work. There is a disconnect. Anyone can add numbers and subtract \nnumbers, but, for gosh sakes, colleagues, look at the connection \nbetween your numbers and people's lives.\n  We never had one hearing on your final set of proposals, not one \nhearing, not one expert flown in from anywhere in the country, much \nless the opportunity to take this back to our homes and ask the people \nwho are affected by this whether or not it will be beneficial to them. \nIf we had an up-or-down vote on this amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Then I think we would have had an opportunity for \neverybody to speak.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is an interesting----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the Senator time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from Massachusetts, I believe, is \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I guess it is my general impression \nthat the other side, the Republican party, does not want to vote on \nthis amendment which we started hours and hours ago. We have had all \nkinds of delaying tactics and we had second-degree and first-degree \namendments, talks about all kinds of time agreements, but not a vote, \nnot a vote.\n  I have not been on the floor. I have been working with our leader, \nbut I assume that this point had been made over and over again. One of \nthe things that I think seniors should be aware of is--which has not \nbeen talked about at all in the Republican amendment for Medicare, \nwhich cuts $270 billion out of Medicare--is something called the \n\n[[Page S15637]]\n\nBELT agreement. It is not GATT, it is not NATO, it does not have \nforces, but it has lethal effect, absolutely lethal effect. And it is \ntucked away inside the Republican Medicare plan. And BELT, because I \nknow you are anxious to find out, stands for the ``budget expenditure \nlimit tool.'' Interesting phraseology.\n  It is a budget gimmick that poses a very dangerous threat to our \nsenior citizens. And when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsay we are trying to scare senior citizens, one of the things that \ncomes back at me is, do our senior citizens even know the beginning of \nwhat they would be getting into if we ended up with the Republican \namendment to cut $270 billion and other matters, for example, the BELT \nagreement?\n  Now, let me tell you what the BELT agreement does. This is the \nRepublican device that will make automatic cuts in Medicare for years \nto come--for years to come--automatic cuts, no legislative authority, \nautomatic cuts. And what will the cuts be made for? They will be made \nfor the GOP tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  The budget gimmick is labeled, as I indicated, the ``budget \nexpenditure limit tool.'' And it is the Republican secret plan to make \nautomatic cuts in the traditional--now catch my words--fee-for-service \nMedicare Program. Now, remember what we have been hearing this \nafternoon at great length is that ``No, no, no, don't worry about these \nthings called HMO's. Don't worry about that, because 90 percent of \nseniors are already in the fee-for-service program. Of course they'll \nbe staying in the fee-for-service program.''\n  So all seniors are meant to relax when they hear that argument. But \nthey do not understand the BELT agreement, the BELT agreement, which is \nthe ``budget expenditure limit tool.'' And what it does is makes \nautomatic cuts in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare Program, \nwithout any action by Congress or the President, for the next 7 years \ninto the future.\n  Now, how would it work to hit seniors? First of all, it would put \nGOP, Republican, priorities ahead of seniors' health care needs in \nthree ways.\n  First, the BELT--this budget limitation tool for seniors on fee-for-\nservice Medicare, ordinary Medicare, 90 percent of seniors--it would \nset a fixed annual target on Medicare spending. Oh, we have not talked \nabout that this afternoon. We have not talked about a fee or an \nexpenditure limit on Medicare spending. I have not heard that from the \nother side this afternoon, because everything was geared to have \nseniors believe, so long as they were in the Medicare fee-for-service \nportion that they are now in, that life continues to be cheerful and \nwonderful and there is no worry. ``Don't worry about that, HMO's.'' But \nthey did not tell us about BELT.\n  So a fixed annual target is set on Medicare expenditures representing \nthe amount necessary to secure the funds that Republicans need for tax \ncuts for the wealthy. And it becomes an absolute limit on what Medicare \nwill contribute to seniors' health care. May I repeat that? It becomes \nan absolute limit, a ceiling, on what Medicare will contribute to \nMedicare regular enrollees, non-HMO seniors' health care.\n  Second, if Medicare's bill exceeds this limit, the BELT, which is the \nbudget expenditure limit tool, imposes automatic--what is my next \nword?--reductions, reductions, arbitrary in nature, in key Medicare \nspending in the following year, imposing cuts in Medicare; for example, \ninpatient hospital services, reductions in expenditure for inpatient \nhospital services, inpatient hospital services for seniors; home health \nservices, reductions; hospice care services, reductions; diagnostic \ntests, reductions; physician services and outpatient hospital services, \nreductions, Mr. President.\n  I am sorry, I am sorry, this is in the Republican plan. No, we have \nnot heard about it because we did not have much time. And, no, we did \nnot hear about it in the Finance Committee because we spent about a \ntotal of 10 minutes debating this entire thing--10 minutes per side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would be happy to, although I have my third \nDraconian measure that I would like to mention.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is startling news to this Senator. I am not on the \nFinance Committee.\n  Is the Senator saying that this BELT provision, which sounds to me \nlike the old sequestration, whereas, if you do not hit certain targets, \nthere is automatic across-the-board cuts, is that what is going to \nhappen, automatic, in all these services?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The word ``sequestration'' is the perfect word.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, what the Senator from West Virginia is talking \nabout, are these BELT provisions, are they in this 2,000-page \nreconciliation bill? Is that what the Senator is saying? They are in \nthis big thick bill someplace?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder what else is hidden in here. Two thousand pages, \nand we got it yesterday--2,000 pages. Who knows what is hidden in \nhere--2,000 pages. We have not had 1 day of hearings on it, not 1 day. \nAnd now the Senator from West Virginia has brought up something that \nthis Senator was totally unaware of, I will be frank to admit to \neveryone.\n  Why? We have not had a chance to look at this or have hearings and \nknow what is in it. What the Senator is saying is buried in these 2,000 \npages, which no one knows what is in there, is a provision that will \nallow for services to the elderly, in all the areas the Senator just \noutlined, to be automatically cut, automatically without any vote of \nthis body or of the Congress of the United States. I find that \nincredible. I almost cannot believe it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield to his incredulity and \nmine. I would add that under the Republican $270 billion cut, Medicare \nwill be squeezed in its growth rate at 4.9 percent per person. Now, you \ngo into the private market, private health insurance, that is going to \ngrow at 7.1 percent. But they are going to hold it down to 4.9 percent \nfor Medicare.\n  Now, this is for your Medicare. So what is going to happen? \nObviously, spending for Medicare, because you do not reduce the price \nof health services simply because you reduce the amount of money that \nyou are willing to pay, to make available to pay for them, the price \nwill continue to rise as it has in the past, but the amount of money \nwill be much less. So what, in fact, you have guaranteed is this BELT \nprocedure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not only that, if the Senator would yield further, not \nonly that, not only the price increase, but the number of elderly is \ngoing to increase. People are living longer. They are healthier so they \nare living longer. So you will have more people in that bracket in the \nfuture.\n  So the belt is going to tighten even harder and faster because of \nboth of those. I am just shocked about this. I am glad that the Senator \nbrought this up. I daresay, there are very few people who understand \nthis. We are indebted to the Senator from West Virginia for pointing \nthis out. I just still find this incredible that this would be buried \nin this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is the point, I say to my friend from Iowa. And \nwhat is absolutely incredible is I have sat here under limited time, to \nbe able to discuss any of this, this afternoon for hours, and I have \nheard all of this talk about this glorious--``All those seniors in the \nfee-for-service Medicare Program are going to be happy. We don't do \nanything. They are just there. They don't have to join the HMO's. They \nwill be in that 90 percent of happy folks that we are going to do \nnothing to cut their services and life will go on.'' But this BELT \nprocedure is reserved exclusively for them, I say to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  So they are going to cap this at 4.9 percent, even though the private \ncost of health care costs are going to be 7.1 percent. So it is \nautomatically guaranteed there is going to be a shortfall, at which \npoint the sequester falls in, the BELT falls in, the reductions are \nmade in inpatient hospital services, home health services, hospice \ncare, diagnostic tests, physician services--that means visiting a \ndoctor--and outpatient hospital services. That is the whole ball game \nin health care. There is not much else you can do.\n  I will say, I made a mistake, because the third part of this is that \nunder the plan, since the first-degree amendment of the Senator from \nColorado wiped out the $89 billion reduction in Medicare and supplanted \nit with a $270 billion Republican one, what I failed to say \n\n[[Page S15638]]\n\nwas that, in fact, they have been at least kind enough to say that the \nCongress could adjust this BELT or do something with this BELT \nprocedure, but only under a supermajority.\n  I am not sure what a supermajority is, but it has to be at least 60 \npercent. It is probably closer to 66\\1/3\\ percent, which means that the \nCongress would not do it, so the BELT would be in effect.\n  Of course, BELT threatens access to choice. It applies only to \nMedicare fee-for-service expenditures. It hits only seniors who want to \nkeep their current doctors. As a result, this budget gimmick will \ndiscourage doctors from accepting fee-for-service patients, senior \npatients, which, for reasons which we now understand much more clearly \nbecause of what is hidden in this Republican plan since obviously their \npayments will be cut, the physician payments will be cut, threatening \nthe access of seniors to doctors' offices of their choice.\n  If there is anything you can say to a senior that will justifiably \nterrify that senior, it is that you are going to take that senior's \ndoctor away.\n  All afternoon we have been hearing that is not going to happen, but \nit is the current beneficiaries who are going to be hit the hardest. I \njust would very much like for my colleagues to understand a new concept \ncalled BELT, budget expenditure limit tool, which automatically, if \ncosts go up too much--which, of course, they will--it automatically \nsequesters and then reduces virtually all health care services for \nseniors. Nobody in this building knows about it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Virtually nobody in the Finance Committee knew about \nit, because we only debated the thing for about 10 minutes. Now, the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from West Virginia know about it, and \nperhaps some others do, too.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course, I will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I want to thank the Senator for pointing this out. \nI daresay, not too many people know about this hidden in these 2,000 \npages. I just received a piece of paper on this which indicates that \nBELT applies only to Medicare fee for service. So it would hit only \nthose elderly who want to keep their current doctors; is that right?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct. The Senator is 100 percent correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Wait a minute. I had been led to believe by the other \nside that they want to give seniors choices, more choices; that they do \nnot want to shoehorn or force the elderly into managed care systems but \nleave them their choices and their options.\n  But now what this says is that this BELT, this thing which would have \nthese across-the-board cuts in all these areas, would apply only to fee \nfor service. Again, am I correct, I ask the Senator from West Virginia, \nin saying that with this BELT provision, it is just another way of \ntaking away more choice for the elderly?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is correct, but I will add a further \ndimension. It is another aspect in what it is that our Republican \ncolleagues have to do, driven by this Contract With America, in order--\nyou see, there is a reason for this. You do not do it because you want \nto do it, you do it because you have to get that tax-break money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am beginning to see.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is why you have to come up with gimmicks like \nthis which you do not talk about on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nbecause you do not want anybody to know about it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he will yield for \nanother question. Then in the substitute that was offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia earlier today, on which they will not allow \nus to vote, it looks like, that BELT provision is not in the substitute \nof the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is nothing--nothing--in the Democratic \namendment which has that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And one last question of the Senator from West Virginia, \nthen. The only reason he can discern for having this provision in there \nis only so the Republicans can get their $270 billion cut in Medicare \nto fund the $245 billion tax break; is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. To the Senator I say, you have to get your money \nsomehow. If you are going to cut to get all this tax-break money, you \nhave to go to where the money is. The money is in Medicare. The money \nis in Medicaid. There is some money in the earned income tax credit, \nwhich they call a welfare program, which is very interesting to me, \nbecause how come those same people then pay a personal income tax and \nSocial Security tax? I did not think people on welfare paid those \ntaxes.\n  It is just a very depressing aspect of how far they will go.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am going to ask the Senator to yield. Again, I hold up \nthis poster. I talked about it earlier. But just in light now of what I \nhave found out from the Senator from West Virginia of what is hidden in \nthis bill reminds me of what the majority leader said just last night, \nand I will quote again for the Record:\n\n       I was there fighting the fight--voting against Medicare--\n     one of 12--because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  That was the majority leader just last night.\n  So I guess I would say, who do you trust? I keep hearing from the \nother side that they want to save Medicare. From what the Senator from \nWest Virginia just pointed out on this BELT, it ought to be called the \n``knife,'' because it is really cutting Medicare. That is what they are \ndoing.\n  I thank the Senator. He has done a great service in bringing this to \nour attention.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I just simply say \nthat it is a shocking thing. It is a hidden thing. It is malicious to \nseniors, and it is particularly embarrassing, I think, in the context \nof fair debate, when people all afternoon have been talking about the \nfact that seniors on Medicare in the regular fee-for-service Medicare \nsystem, which is 90 percent of the system now, will continue to have \nthis wonderful existence, when they know perfectly well that what they \nare doing is they are capping expenditures. They are capping \nexpenditures several percentage points below what they know the cost of \nexpenditures will rise in health care and then guaranteeing, therefore, \nthe sequestering followed by the reduction in services on all fronts of \nhealth care for Medicare patients. Then the only way you can get out of \nit is through a supermajority, which I would assume is two-thirds of \nthe Congress, both the House and the Senate, which I think would be \nvery hard to do.\n  It is also interesting that--well, Medicare recipients on top of this \nwill pay more out-of-pocket expenses. In other words, there is going to \nbe $700 less per beneficiary in the year 2002. It is going to double \ndeductibles, raise premiums, raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67. \nThese are all very important, very troublesome problems. Private health \npremiums will be increased, as the minority leader indicated, by cost-\nshifting. Hospital closings will take place in States like West \nVirginia and, I assume, Iowa. I think most rural States.\n  Frankly, it is my judgment that doctors will be driven out of the \nprogram and will be turning away Medicare recipients.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield again on that point, I will \njust say, if you have fee for service and the doctor is taking fee for \nservice, and then you have this automatic provision to cut all these \nprovisions, then it would be very discouraging to doctors to take fee-\nfor-service elderly. Thus, once again, that would be lying--the \nintention of the Senators on the other side of the aisle that they want \nto provide more choices for seniors. They can say it all they want. You \ncan say the Moon is made out of cheese, but that does not make it so. \nThe facts are that this bill is going to push the seniors out of their \nfee for service.\n\n  If the Senator will yield further for a question, I want to ask the \nSenator what the Republicans are trying to do here with their $270 \nbillion cut--and now with this BELT gimmick that I never heard about \nbefore--how that would work for an elderly person who just wrote me \nthis letter from Iowa. A husband and wife--I will not use their names, \nbecause I do not have their permission yet. I will get in touch with \nthem to ask for permission. Their total income per year with Social \nSecurity, plus they have an old house rental, is \n\n[[Page S15639]]\n\n$20,000 or less. She adds up all of their health expenses and premiums, \nwhich totals $7,668 a year, out of a $20,000 income. She has diabetes \nand her husband has heart disease and a fractured hip socket. She had a \nstroke 3 months ago. She is talking about how wonderful Medicare has \nbeen for them. She said, ``People around here are worried that Congress \nis destroying the best programs in our country, which have made \npeople's lives so much better. My late grandparents lived in poverty \nreceiving $40 a month welfare. Could we live on that?''\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia, how could someone like this, \nmaking $20,000 a year--and I might add this: When I hear people on the \nother side of the aisle talk about the elderly, I swear all the elderly \nthey know live in Beverly Hills, or Palm Beach, or something like that, \nbecause in my State of Iowa, 80 percent of the senior citizens make \nless than $20,000 a year, and 50 percent of the elderly in Iowa have \nincomes of $10,000 a year or less. That is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a second? How much out-of-\npocket do they pay on health care expenses right now?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, right now about 21 percent of their income. So if \nthey have $20,000 a year, you can figure right away that 21 percent of \nthat--about $4,000 a year--is going for out-of-pocket expenses. One-\nfifth of their income is going out. Under the Republicans' proposal, \nthat will go up, over the next several years, to 31 or 32 percent. So \nit will be one-third of their income that would go out. Right now, for \nus who are working, it is around 7 percent, 8 percent of our total \nincome that goes for health care. So in Iowa, where we have 50 percent \nof our people making less than $10,000--and I have this letter which is \na heartbreaking letter, where she talks about how much they have to pay \nfor their premiums, what they have to pay for their deductibles and \ntheir prescription drugs. Their income is $20,000 a year, Mr. \nPresident, and they are paying $7,668 a year out-of-pocket. I ask the \nSenator from West Virginia, what hope would there be for this couple \nunder the Republican proposal, cutting $270 billion out of Medicare? \nWhat could you tell this couple when their premiums and deductibles are \ngoing to double, yet, their income is not going to go up?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Well, of course, Social Security will be cut, too, \nwill it not, under the Republican plan?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right. Not only that, but for some of the low-\nincome elderly in Iowa making less than $10,000 a year, they are \ncutting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program where they get a \nmeasly $80 or $100 a year to help out in that respect.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield, after a period of 7 \nyears, I believe it is, they are saying that you can no longer get \nMedicare when you are 65; you can only get it when you are 67.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is going to go up to 67, right. The Senator is \nabsolutely right.\n  If the Senator will yield further, the only thing I can come up \nwith--and I really do not know why they are doing what they are doing \non the other side of the aisle. I know they want to give tax breaks to \ntheir special interest friends. I understand that. That is what they \nwant to do. They made their agreements and their contract, and they \nwant to do that. But why do they believe they can take it out of the \nelderly? The only thing I can assume is that they think the elderly are \nso gullible that they are not going to pay attention. Maybe they are so \nbusy, like this couple, paying their bills and making ends meet that \nthey are not going to pay attention to what happens here. Maybe they \nfeel that. I hope not because, I am telling you, the elderly have to \nunderstand that this is going to hurt and hurt badly for the next 7 \nyears.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield, I think there is a very \ninteresting point that goes along with all of this. The majority \nparty--the Republican Party--has accused us of ``fear mongering,'' and \nscaring seniors. Yet, for a long period of time--and in telling the \ntruth, everybody is entitled to their own opinion but not their own \nfacts. We have been talking about some of the facts which the Senator \nand I have discussed this afternoon, a relatively new fact in that \n2,000 pages. But, hopefully, more people will know about that. What is \ninteresting is that the American Hospital Association really did not \nget very much--even though they are getting terrible cuts, they did not \nget involved too much in taking all of this on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan has 38 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, if this is a contest of volume and rhetoric \nand half truths, we are going to probably come in second best. I would \nlike to try to concentrate on some common sense and some truth about \nwhat we are trying to debate here on the floor.\n  We are really talking about a couple of major issues, and that is \nthat a lot of the debate is whether we are going to put a Band-Aid over \nthe Medicare Program and extend it for maybe 2 years into the future of \nsolvency, as the Democrats have proposed, and then be back here in \nanother year or two and debate this all over again, or we are going to \nlook at some real reform. We are going to talk about extending this \nprogram to 2012 and into the next generation, to make sure that we \nsecure, that we improve, and that we protect the Medicare system, not \nonly for those who depend on it today, but for the next generation as \nwell.\n  If we do not begin real basic reform--that is, to reduce the rate of \ngrowth in this program, and we are not talking about cuts, we are \ntalking about trying to put some common sense into this program and put \nout there a Medicare Program that not only provides good service but is \none that we can afford. If we do not, the alternatives are just a \ncouple. Either we can do as the Democrats have proposed, and that is \nextend the life of this program for just 2 years so we can come back \nhere and debate this all over again after the next election. Or we can \ndo nothing and we can let the trust fund go broke, as the trustees have \ntold us it will do, in the year 2002. Or the other option would be that \nwe can go back to the taxpayers with business as usual and say we need \nanother $388 billion to keep this program status quo--business as \nusual.\n  That is what the Democratic answer has been over the last 30 years. \nSeven times they have gone to the taxpayers and said, ``We need more \nmoney for this program,'' and raising taxes has always been the \nanswer--never real reform, never restructuring the program, never \ntrying to make it sound. Just more taxes. Throw more money at the \nproblem and get us by another couple of years; just limp into the next \ncentury, and we will come back and address the question then. Then the \nlinkage, the demagoging, of always $270 billion in reduced growth--not \nin cuts, but reduced growth--and they link this always to $245 billion \nin tax relief. They seem to have some kind of an objection to letting \nAmericans keep more of their own money.\n\n  If this were a repeat of the 1993 record increase in taxes they would \nbe down here in a second to vote to raise your taxes. But if there is \nany talk about tax relief for American families, hard-working families, \nthey just demagog this to death. They do not want you to keep any more \nof your money.\n  Somehow, somehow the thought and the notion in this Capital City has \nbeen that the money belongs to Washington. We are going to decide how \nmuch to dole back to you, the hard-working Americans.\n  Those who get up every morning, go to work and put in 40-plus hours a \nweek, husband and wife trying to take care of their family--they do not \nthink you can spend their money as wisely as they can in Washington. If \nthey allow you to keep this $245 billion over the next 7 years, you \nmight spend it foolishly--like on food, clothing, shelter, education \nfor your children. You might do something stupid with your money. So, \nsend it to Washington and they will make sure that it is spent more \nwisely.\n  And talk about the scare tactics. Fearmongering--they do not \nfearmonger. They are not throwing out scare tactics. For the last hour, \nwe have sat here and listened to nothing but scare tactics, that we are \nsomehow gutting this program, that there will \n\n[[Page S15640]]\n\nnot be a dime for Medicare, for our senior citizens over the next 7 \nyears or beyond.\n  If that is not a scare tactic, telling every senior citizen in \nAmerica if we do not buckle under and not give any tax relief or raise \ntaxes, that somehow all Medicare will disappear. My grandmother is one \nthat got one of these scare tactic letters from her Democratic \nCongressman in northern Minnesota. It said that somehow the Republicans \nare going to put you into the street because they are going to take \naway Medicare.\n  Now, for a 92-year-old bedridden woman to get a letter like this, if \nthis is not scare tactics, I do not know what is. To hear the rhetoric \nwe have heard and will continue to hear, if that is not scare tactics, \nwithout addressing the problem, if the problem is so bad, where have \nthe Democrats been over the last 30 years? How come all of a sudden we \nare on the brink of disaster, if they have all the answers today?\n  I do not know why a $500 per child tax credits somehow does not work \nin with their plan.\n  Another thing, the $270 billion in reforming Medicare. Now, if we do \nnot do this, again, the trustees are saying it will go broke, that \nsomehow Medicare--we know that over the next 7 years any savings in \nMedicare has to remain within the trust fund. There is a fire wall.\n  In fact, Republicans have an amendment, as our amendment notes, using \nMedicare savings for tax cuts would be illegal under the Finance \nCommittee bill. The Senate committee bill says it would be illegal to \nuse it for anything but Medicare.\n  There is no linkage. The only way we can have tax relief is if we \nreform it and balance the budget. If we can do that, then the benefits \nare going to be some tax relief for hard-working Americans who have \nbeen paying $245 billion--do you realize that is only 1.5 percent of \nour total expenditures over the next 7 years?\n  But it sounds like that if somehow we give this small tax relief to \nAmerican residents and hard-working middle-class families, that somehow \nthis whole country is going to unravel; if we take this $245 billion \nand shift it out of Washington and into the hands of families, that \nsomehow this whole country is going to collapse, because we have taken \nanother $245 billion from bureaucrats in Washington to spend as they \nwant.\n  So, again, one other thing I want to mention, if the Government is \ngoing to somehow pay for all of this, if we cannot afford it ourselves, \nhow can we afford to pay taxes to let the Government do it? We cannot.\n  If we cannot as a society, as individuals or as families, somehow \nafford this, is the Government automatically going to have enough money \nin Washington? They will tax it away. Washington does not create \nwealth. It collects it and redistributes it.\n  Is this good for seniors? Yes, Mr. President, it is good for seniors. \nIt will make sure that Medicare is protected and preserved.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I just have a few minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I think this is something that is so important that we \ncannot ignore it, and we have to make sure that Medicare is preserved \nand protected not for an additional 2 years but for the next \ngeneration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come to change the tone a little bit. I have been sitting here for \n5 hours and have heard nothing but negative, depressing kind of things.\n  I am excited about the opportunities that we have. I am excited about \nthe opportunities that we will have to do something that the people who \nhave been complaining here have not done for 30 years. We will have a \nchance to balance the budget. We have not done it for 26 years. We will \nhave a chance to do something about welfare. We have not done it for \nall these years. We will save Medicare. We have not had a plan to do \nthat. We will leave a little more money in the pockets of Americans.\n  Now, that is not a bad idea. That is a pretty positive kind of a \nthing, it seems to me.\n  Frankly, I get a little weary of the same folks that have been here, \nwho have brought us where we are, that we need changes, and they resist \nchanges, and expect something different to happen by doing the same \nthing. I do not understand that.\n  That is what we have heard all afternoon. Do not change anything. \nThings are not good, but do not change them.\n  Someone mentioned the difficulty in rural States. I come from a rural \nState. As a matter of fact, there are a number of things here that I \nthink will be greatly strengthened, including the health program in \nrural areas.\n  There are several specific things here that I want to mention. One is \nlimited service hospitals. We have, over time, developed hospitals. We \nwere encouraged over the years--properly--to develop full service \nhospitals in small towns. Quite a few of them sometimes were just 20 \nmiles apart.\n  In Wyoming, we had a hospital with 4 percent occupancy. It cannot \nexist at that. So it has to fail.\n  So we will change in this bill the qualifications of a hospital so \nthat you can have a limited service hospital, still be reimbursed by \nHCFA, the Federal Government for stabilizing facilities, for emergency \nfacilities, so you can move to the next hospital. It would be a great \nasset. You need something in a town but you will not be able to have a \nfull service hospital. That will be done here.\n  Medicare dependent hospitals--the 1993 budget let this program \nexpire. We are going to reinstate that. The purpose is to assist \nfacilities in high Medicare patient loads to continue.\n  The extension of the sole community hospital status, hospitals that \nhave less than 50 beds, 35 miles away from the nearest hospital, will \ncontinue. This is good stuff for rural America.\n  It levels HMO payments in Medicare. There is a great disparity now. \nWe settled that on the basis of fee-for-service as it existed. In Bronx \nCounty, New York, $678 can be paid per month for HMO's and Medicare; \nFall River County, South Dakota, on the other hand, gets $177. We will \nfix that. That is good for rural America.\n  Medicare bonus payments to physicians will be increased from 10 \npercent to 20 percent. We talk about bringing service providers into \nthe rural area. This will do that. Telemedicine grants--we have a great \nopportunity to increase services with telemedicine grants in rural \ncommunities.\n  I understand the marketing device, of being opposed--there are some \nvery positive things here, starting with the fact if you do not do \nsomething, it fails. Second, you can preserve it for 2 years or you can \npreserve it for longer than that, and we are going for the long haul.\n  There are positive things here. One of them is the help for rural \nareas, like my State of Wyoming. I am very pleased we are looking \nforward, in these next 2 days, to do some positive things. I hope we \nbegin to talk about the benefits that can accrue, benefits that will \naccrue, rather than seeking to worship the depressing scenario we have \nbeen going through for the last couple of hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my Democratic \ncolleagues in expressing deep disappointment and outrage at the way in \nwhich those on the other side of the aisle have chosen to handle this \ncritical issue.\n  Several weeks ago, I participated in hearings organized by Senators \nKennedy and Rockefeller because it was--and remains--my view that the \npublic ought to have the opportunity to review and understand what is \nbeing proposed by congressional Republicans with respect to the \nMedicare Program.\n  During these hearings, we heard testimony from the trustees of the \nMedicare Trust Fund. We believed it was important to hear from the \ntrustees in order to give them the opportunity to clarify any \nmisrepresentation of their annual report on the future solvency of the \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund and to get their analysis of the \nRepublican proposal to cut $270 billion from the Medicare Program.\n  What we found was that the Medicare trustees do not even suggest that \n$270 billion is required to address the problems of the trust fund. In \nfact, the \n\n[[Page S15641]]\n\ntrustees made it very clear that $89 billion over the 7 years is all \nthat is required to address short-term solvency issues of the Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund. In a recent letter to Republican leaders Dole and \nGingrich, Secretary Rubin specifically states, and I quote him:\n\n       No member of Congress should vote for $270 billion in \n     Medicare cuts believing that reductions of this size have \n     been recommended by the Medicare Trustees or that such \n     reductions are needed now to prevent an imminent funding \n     crisis.\n\n  The amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller gets right to the heart \nof this issue. Senator Rockefeller's amendment would recommit the \nMedicare portion of the reconciliation bill with instructions to the \nFinance Committee to eliminate cuts beyond the $89 billion that the \nMedicare actuaries certify is necessary to ensure solvency of the trust \nfund through 2006.\n  Now, we find out that we will not be permitted a straight up-or-down \nvote on this amendment. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, if you believe as you say you do, that a $270 billion cut is \nneeded to save the Medicare Program, then this vote should be simple \nand we should all have the opportunity to make our position clear on \nthis important matter.\n  The effort to prevent a clear, recorded vote on Senator Rockefeller's \nmotion is even more distressing in light of the absolute refusal of the \nRepublican leadership to hold the kind of open, public hearings that an \nissue of this magnitude requires. What they have done is spring the \nlegislation on us and then immediately move to mark it up and report it \nto the floor without any chance for careful examination or thought as \nto what its implications are for our senior citizens. They try to move \nit so fast that people cannot, in effect, identify what is being done.\n  The best description of what they are doing was given, in my \njudgment, by the Republican political analyst, Kevin Phillips, in a \nrecent radio interview where he was quoted as saying--now this is not \nme talking; this is the Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips. \nAnd he said, and I quote him:\n\n       This revolutionary ideology driving the new Republican \n     Medicare proposal is all so simple. Cut middle-class programs \n     as much as possible and give the money back to private-sector \n     business, finance and high-income taxpayers. Rhetoric about \n     the cuts being to save Medicare is politics, not underlying \n     GOP motivational reality. Remember, at the same time as the \n     Republicans propose to reduce Medicare spending by $270 \n     billion over seven years, they want to cut taxes for \n     corporations, investors and affluent families by $245 billion \n     over the same period. This is no coincidence.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, the Republican Medicare reform proposals \nare not about saving Medicare or about protecting senior citizens. They \nare not about true reform. To reform, by definition, means to make \nbetter or improve by removing faults. I submit that this entire \nreconciliation package is driven by an insatiable desire to give \nfurther large tax benefits to very wealthy people.\n  Mr. President, it would be truly irresponsible for the Congress to \napprove sweeping and drastic changes to the Medicare system without a \nthorough discussion of what those proposals mean to our Nation's health \ncare system, and to the people it serves. We have not been afforded the \nopportunity for such a discussion and I regret that we will also not be \nafforded the opportunity to have straight up-or-down vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment that has been offered by \nthe other side of the aisle is a statement that the Members on the \nother side of the aisle have lost their nerve. They have lost their \nnerve to really do something big about Medicare before it is too late.\n  We all know from the President's own people that Medicare will be \nbankrupt in the year 2002. This bill put forth by the majority party \nguarantees that Medicare will not be bankrupt by the year 2002.\n  The plan that is put before us addresses only the part A trust fund. \nWe all admit that there is a crisis in part A, because it is growing at \na very robust clip of 8.4 percent. But their plan does nothing to \naddress part B. Part B is growing, as we know, at 14.5 percent, an \nunsustainable rate. So I think we all have to question their logic, \nthat they raise a point about 8.4 percent being a crisis but will \nforget about the part of Medicare that is growing almost twice as fast, \nat 14.5 percent.\n  It is a simple fact, if we do not act now, there will not be a system \naround when baby boomers retire. The longer we put this off, the harder \nit will be to address. Just look at how difficult a time we are having \nto apply a stitch in time. The scare tactics being used now by the \nDemocrats, of course, will look like Halloween compared to what we will \nsee if we continue to put these reforms off until the years 1999, 2000, \n2001. Maybe they will not even be dealing with it in the year 2002.\n  Then I look at the recent discussion from the other side of the aisle \non the provisions dealing with what is called the BELT.\n  We have been fed a lot of horror stories by the other side. If I get \nany message from the seniors of America, it is this. They think the \ncost of medical care is too high and they blame us, because it is a \nGovernment program, for it being too high. They expect us to do \nsomething about the bills. They expect us to do something about the \ncost of Medicare. This provision only makes sure that Congress lives \nwithin its spending targets.\n  Ask any senior anywhere in America if they believe in a balanced \nbudget. They will tell you that they do believe in a balanced budget.\n  Ask them if they think there ought to be some limits on what is spent \non a Government program, health care or anyplace else, and they will \nsay, yes, there should be.\n  That provision is in the bill to guarantee that costs do not exceed \nspending targets.\n  The impression was left from the debate between my colleague from \nIowa and my colleague from West Virginia that this has never happened \nbefore. It did happen before. In 1987 there was a reduction of 2 \npercent, so do not say this is a provision that has never been applied \nbefore. It has been applied before. Do not say that this is a system \nCongress has no control over, because the law provides for a review by \nCongress. And if Congress wants to bite the bullet and take action \nbefore the President does, we can and we should and we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment Senator Frist, \nDr. Frist from Tennessee, for his leadership on this issue. I think he \nhas brought a great deal of experience and expertise on the entire \nhealth care issue. I compliment him for it.\n  I also wish to compliment the Senator from Colorado for this \namendment. The amendment that we have basically says this reports with \ninstructions back to the Finance Committee to make sure that we have a \nlockbox provision to make sure all the savings or changes that we have \nin part B go into the savings in part A so it will help make sure part \nA does not go bankrupt.\n  Our colleagues on the other side do not have that in their provision, \nbut I think it is a very good, solid provision. It is one the Finance \nCommittee adopted. This is kind of a second key on the lockbox to make \nsure that of any of the costs that would be incurred by beneficiaries, \nthat 100 percent of those costs go directly into the solvency of part \nA. I think that is an excellent amendment, so I compliment my colleague \nand I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Some people have alluded to the fact, well, we do not really have a \nproblem with Medicare. I beg to differ. The trustees report clearly \nstates we do. We have seen charts that next year under Medicare we \nstart paying out more money than we take in, and that over a 7-year \nperiod of time the trust fund is totally used up and then they cannot \npay the bills. That is not acceptable. That is not an alternative that \nis agreeable or acceptable to anyone.\n  Some say the $89 billion would solve the problem. It does not solve \nthe problem. It does not even come close to \n\n[[Page S15642]]\n\nsolving the problem. If we take the changes that we have proposed in \nthe Finance Committee, reiterated by the amendment that we have from \nthe Senator from Colorado, we are ensuring the trust fund. We are \nsaying we are going to make some changes in part B, as the trustees \nsaid we should, because the part B trust fund has problems, it is \nrunning out of money. We take those savings and use that to ensure the \nsolvency of part A. That makes sense.\n  We are going to keep part A solvent, not just for 2 years but, \nreally, for more than 10 years. I think that is an excellent step in \nthe right direction. What have we done in the past when we had a \nproblem under Medicare? In the past we have had problems. We have had \nreports from the trustees, as was alluded to by some of our colleagues, \nthat it is running out of money. What have we done? Every time in the \npast what we have done is we have increased payroll taxes and we have \nhad big, big increases in payroll taxes.\n  There are only two ways you can solve the Medicare trust fund \nproblem. You either increase the money going in--that is paid for by a \npayroll tax. Presently we are paying 1.45 percent; the employee pays \nthat. The employer matches that. So it is 2.9 percent of payroll going \nto fund Medicare. That is what we are doing today.\n  When we have had problems in the past, how have we financed it? We \nhave financed it with a big increase in payment, in taxes. That is what \nthe trustees said we are going to have to do. We are going to have to \nhave big payroll tax increases to solve the problems in the trust fund \nor we are going to have to reduce the rate of growth of expenditures.\n  We elected not to increase taxes. That is unheard of. Because I will \ntell you something--I want to put something in the Record. In the past, \nall Congress has ever done is increased payroll taxes. I just ask a \nquestion, does anyone know what the maximum tax rate is, if someone \npaid maximum taxes in Medicare in 1978, what the total tax was for them \nand their employer combined? It was $177.\n  Do you know what the maximum tax rate was in 1993? It rose a little \nbit. It went from $177 to $3,915. And today it is even more, because we \ntook the cap off. So it went from $177 to over $4,000 in a period of \n15, 17 years. There are unbelievable increases in premiums, and that is \nstill not enough. It is an unbelievable increase in taxes, and it is \nstill not enough.\n  So what did we do? We said, let us reduce the rate of growth in \nspending. Some people said, you are cutting $270 billion. We are \nspending, today, $178 billion in Medicare; in the year 2002 we are \ngoing to spend $286 billion. That is an increase. I am going to put \ninto the Record how much Medicare spending is increasing every year. \nMost people said 6.4 percent. I have said that. Actually, it averages \nout right at 7 percent. So I will put this into the Record.\n  It is interesting. I went back to see what the President's figures \nwere when he revised his budget on June 22, 1995, what the President's \nfigures were for Medicare. Guess what? He proposed changes. He uses \nOMB. He uses a different baseline, uses different growth rates, but the \ndifferences in outlays are minuscule.\n  In 1995, he estimates we are going to spend $4 billion less than what \nCBO does. He says 174. In 1996, we estimate we are going to spend 193 \nin our proposal; the President says we are going to spend 192--almost \nidentical. In 1997, we estimate we are going to spend $207 billion, a 7 \npercent increase. The President says we are going to spend $208 \nbillion. In 1998, there is only $3 billion difference. In 1999, the \nPresident said we should spend $5 billion more.\n  My point being there is very little difference in outlays estimation. \nGranted, the President is using OMB, he is using a rosier scenario, \nforecasting a lower growth rate in Medicare costs, but there is very \nlittle difference in outlays between what the President is estimating \nwe are going to spend in Medicare than what we estimate using the \nCongressional Budget Office. Why did we use the Congressional Budget \nOffice? Because that is what we agreed to use. That is what the \nPresident said he would use when he gave his State of the Union \nMessage. He said he was going to use the Congressional Budget Office. \nNow he is not doing it. Now he is not doing it. But we are.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the Medicare spending comparisons, both by this budget \nresolution that we have before us and by the President, and tell my \ncolleagues that over the 7 years, our plan says we should spend $l.655 \ntrillion, and the President, over that same period of time, spends \n$l.676 trillion, a minuscule difference in the total spending over that \nperiod of time, of $21 billion--the difference in outlays between the \nPresident's budget and our budget granted that he uses OMB and a rosy \nscenario.\n  Also, Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the growth rates of the maximum amount taxable \nfor Medicare, the tax rates, and the maximum amount paid, because it \nwill shock our colleagues to find out that in 1978 we were spending \ntotal taxes of $177, and today the maximum tax is over $4,000. That is \nstill not enough. That says we need to reduce the rate of growth in \nthis program, not increase taxes.\n  I compliment my colleagues for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                  MEDICARE SPENDING COMPARISONS

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\n[[Page S15643]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I too listened with great interest to \nsome of the rather vigorous debate, I believe is the phrase. It was \nrather strained a time or two, and almost a little bit hysterical, I \nthought a time or two also, just hearing snatches of it from those on \nthe other side of the aisle. It would, indeed, as my good old friend \nfrom Wyoming has indicated, make you weary. And indeed it will.\n  What will make you even more weary is to read once again, which has \nbeen alluded to many times in this debate, ``The Status of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Programs in the United States of America,'' this \nwonderful little yellow pamphlet which has been recommended to all \nAmericans for many months now. And I wish I could put it in more \nearthly vernacular, and I could ordinarily, but this forum does limit \none in that particular dependency, so let us just say that Social \nSecurity is going to go broke and Medicare is going to go broke. So if \nyou want to have another TV ad of somebody smashing into their oatmeal \nwith the pitch that the Republicans are doing something horrid, get a \nreal picture of someone who is watching Medicare go broke in the year \n2002, where you do not have a ``less'' benefit in the years out; you \nhave ``no'' benefit. Try that one on.\n  So too even with the hard work we have done here, be of stout heart. \nFor medicare will not go broke in the year 2002. It will now go broke \nin the year 2008. So gird your loins, cheer yourselves, and know that \nthe draconian activity we have undertaken here on our side of the \naisle--and we will do it, and we will do it by ourselves--will ``save'' \nit till then. And in a year we will tell the American people what we \ndid, and they will be very pleased. This is what we are about.\n  I have not heard a single recommendation from the other side of the \naisle that would do anything, and certainly $89 billion is not going to \ndo anything because they did not even talk about part B. How phony can \nyou get to come in and talk about you only need $89 billion to save \nMedicare, and leave off part B? How really phony can you get when you \nwant to know, ladies and gentleman of America, that part B premiums are \ntotally voluntary, they are not part of any Contract With America, and \nthey were not part of any contract with senior citizens. In every \nsense, it is an income transfer. It is a welfare program because right \nnow the senior citizen who has chosen to accept this is paying 30 \npercent of the premium, and the people who maintain this magnificent \nbuilding at night when we are not here are paying 70 percent of the \npremium. I hope somebody will figure that one out.\n  So I want to watch the votes. Again, how we are going to handle part \nB premiums when we have this peculiar situation, to say the least, \nwhere ``Joe Six-Pack'' is paying 70 percent of the premium for somebody \nwho is ``Mr. Megabucks.'' If you want to get into this business about \n``the little guy,'' let us get really into this one. This is about the \nlittle guy, the guy that does not have anything, and he or she is going \nto work every day to pay 70 percent of the premium for everybody in \nMedicare part B. That is absolutely absurd.\n  So I am anxious that we do cast some votes in that area. We will \nsmoke them out and see who really is for ``the little guy''.\n  Then, of course, we will see a unique and remarkable experience. We \nwill get there in conference. The President of the United States has \nsaid that Medicare will not be allowed to go up over 7.1 percent, and \nwe are saying we will not let it go up over 6.4 percent.\n  Does anybody in America believe we will not get there? There is not a \nsingle person on the other side of the aisle that does not know the \nPresident of the United States of America has already recommended that \nMedicare not be allowed to increase over 7.1 percent and not 10.5. We \nall know that. I hope the American people cut through the babble on \nthat one.\n  We all know the President of the United States has now said we will \nhave a 7-year budget instead of a 10-year budget. It is good that he is \ncalling it a 7-year budget because his 10-year budget thing was just a \nthing. It was not a budget. So we will address that.\n  Now he has admitted that he went too far in raising taxes. I saw a \nfellow get beat on that once in a campaign--two of them, in fact. Now, \nsurely, perhaps three.\n  So we are ready to go. We will go over the cliff together. We will \nnot get a single vote from the other side of the aisle. And between now \nand next October, next election season, we will describe to the \nAmerican people just exactly what we did, how we saved Medicare, how we \nbegan to get on track again all over the United States, and all over \nthe world with our work, with our debt limit, our deficit, our savings \nrate with all of the things that are critical to us, and be a solvent \ncountry.\n  But in the next few days, and weeks, we will be accused of being the \nparty that broke all the ketchup bottles over the heads of every child \nin the first grade, threw all the bed pans out of the nursing homes, \ndestroyed every possible facility that shelters the homeless, the aged, \nand the infirm. And be ready for that.\n  And the charge may be led by the AARP, which is a group of 33 million \nAmericans bound closely together by a love of airline discounts, \nautomobile discounts, and insurance discounts--one of the biggest \nbusinesses in America who even have a thing called ``tax advice'' for \ntheir members. And this is a group that has paid the IRS $135 million \nin back taxes. Boy, I would love to have them giving tax advice! They \nneed all the money they can to figure out how to get back $135 million. \nSo be ready for it. Dig in. We are going to have a lot of fun. And when \nit is all over, we will have the votes. And when it is really \ncompleted, the American people are going to be very excited and pleased \nmonths from now when they figure it all out as to what we did and what \nthey on the other side of the aisle did not do.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I give the Senator from Wyoming an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, will the Senator comment on--how much? I \nthink the Senator previously talked about, how much does the AARP have \nin investments?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. They are a ragged lot. They are just a tattered band of \nragamuffins. They have a building downtown here which could be \ndescribed as ``the Taj Mahal,'' and their lease rental there per year \nis $17 million--$17 million a year on a 20-year lease. They have $314 \nmillion in the bank in T bills. They get $106 million a year from \nPrudential Life Insurance, taking 3 percent of every premium. They get \npremiums and royalties from Scudder on investments, from New York Life, \nfrom the R.V. insurance. They are a big, big, big business, and they \nalso get $86 million from the U.S.A. to run some of their programs on \ntop of all that.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thought it was interesting that they have over $300 \nmillion in Treasury bills that they have invested.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is true. But they are just struggling along. And we \nwant to continue to send our $8 dues to them because my mail is running \n16 to 1 against the AARP, and most of it comes from their own members \nwho say, ``I am still going to pay the 8 bucks, but go hit `em a \nlick.'' And I am certainly going to be delighted to do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain on the Senator's side, no \ntime remaining on the other side.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would like to yield the remaining 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. He \nhas done a magnificent job in attempting to combat the demagoguery that \ncomes from nothing but partisan politics. And I have to tell you \nsomething. If it is not the drumbeat of the AARP, which is bad enough, \nscaring seniors, you cannot make a call into my office because they \nhave got these poor people absolutely frightened. And I wish to \napologize to the senior citizens for all \n\n[[Page S15644]]\n\nof the fright that they have gone through. I think it is a shame. I \nthink it is a shame that maybe we have not done a better job of getting \nthe message through. I think it is a shame that some people who call \nthemselves champions of the underprivileged have engaged in demagoguery \nthat has hit new heights.\n  Only in Washington can you spend $110 billion more for a program, \nwhich we will be doing in Medicare over the next 7 years, $110 billion \nmore, increasing expenditures at twice the rate of inflation, and call \nthat a cut. Only in Washington can you be taking the average recipient \nwho gets about $4,800 a year in benefits and almost increasing it by \n$2,000 so they will be getting $6,700 a year and call that a cut. Only \nin Washington can my colleagues on the other side demagog it and get up \nthere with the big voice: Oh, we are going to cut; we are going to \nkill, totally negate, forget what is going to take place and come forth \nwith not one constructive suggestion as it relates to how you are going \nto keep Medicare from going bankrupt.\n  They do not come forth and say anything. No, just spend it and spend \nit and bankrupt us in less than 7 years. There will not be any \nMedicare. Then what happens to the seniors? What do they say? They say \nyou are cutting so you can give taxes to the wealthy. Nonsense. Mr. \nPresident, 70 percent of any tax advantages are going to go to working \nfamilies in America; $141 billion out of the $224 billion that will be \ncoming in cuts go just for the $500 per child tax credit-- $141 \nbillion. That is about 60 percent.\n  We hear yelling and screaming about the families, when we do \nsomething for adoption, when we do something to take care of the \nmarriage penalty, when we do something to equalize and strengthen the \nfamily and give people IRAs, working families, middle class families, \nnot millionaires, not businesses, when we say, by the way, that those \npeople who have incomes of $150,000 should pay for their own health \ninsurance. A retired person with $150,000, by gosh, should pay for it, \nnot working middle-class families subsidizing the wealthy.\n  That is what we do here. We hear nothing but demagoguery. I cannot \nbelieve it. I wish to tell you something. You do a great disservice to \nthe American people with that kind of rhetoric. I think we will \ndemonstrate quite clearly that we are the party that is responsible.\n  Here is the President's status of Social Security and Medicare \nProgram, a summary. This comes out by the President, his commission. \nThree of his Cabinet officials are there. And I read the first page. It \nsays, ``The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be able to pay \nbenefits for only about 7 years and is severely out of financial \nbalance long range.''\n  What do our friends on the other side say about correcting that? \nNothing. And we come forth with a program. They have had months and \nmonths to work with us. Do they offer any constructive suggestions? No. \nThey demagog the issue. They say to people, they are going to cut your \nbenefits. That is not true. They say, they are going to cut your \nbenefits and give tax breaks to the wealthy. That is not true. They \nsay, they are going to give you less. And, indeed, we are increasing \nthat program again by $110 billion more.\n  Somehow we have to do a better job to get the message out. But that \ndoes not negate the negativism, the demagoguery, the sheer hypocrisy \nthat comes from the other side. I have to tell you something. I make no \napologies for branding their brand of legislative acumen in that manner \nbecause that is what it amounts to--sheer demagoguery.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There are 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have to yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just 25 seconds. Does anybody want 25 seconds on our \nside? Does the majority leader want 25 seconds?\n  Mr. DOLE. No. Keep counting.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me thank Senator Brown from Colorado for originally \ncoming to the floor with this second-degree amendment and helping us \nout. He did a very good job. And for those who spoke the last 2\\1/2\\ \nhours on our side, I think we have all done a good job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Washington?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, the majority leader yields to the \nSenator from Washington such time as he needs off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Madam President, we are at the beginning of a debate over the most \nimportant piece of legislation that this body has considered during the \ncourse of the last decade. We have before us a proposal which will lead \nthe United States to its first balanced budget in 26 years. Yes, Madam \nPresident, 26 years.\n  That proposal includes with it a plan to preserve, to protect, and to \nstrengthen Medicare to see to it that the Medicare trust fund or \nhospital insurance does not go bankrupt; fairly to distribute the costs \nof Medicare part B, fees for physicians and for medical care across the \ncourse of the population; to provide our seniors with a greater degree \nof choice than they have at the present time and the selection of the \nway in which they receive their health care, one which will allow the \nexpenses for Medicare to increase in each and every year during the \ntime during which we are balancing the budget; a plan, a budget which \nwill also ultimately include in it genuine welfare reform, reform of a \nsystem which has actually made worse the very conditions it was \ndesigned to alleviate in the first place, a welfare reform which will \nemphasize work, families, and hope for the future; and finally, but not \nat all incidentally, Madam President, tax relief for the hard-working \nAmerican families in the middle class, those who are working and \ncontributing to their society, those who are providing for their \nfamilies and for their future.\n  Madam President, in the almost 13 years during which I have served in \nthis body, we have never previously had an opportunity to do correctly \nand well any one of these things, much less all four of them together.\n  It is not as though we were presenting one alternative vision of the \nfuture and the opponents were presenting another valid, arguable vision \nof the future. We are presenting a plan, an idea, a course of action, \nand the other side is defending the status quo. They do not wish to \npropose an alternative.\n  The President of the United States has, in vague and general terms, \nproposed an alternative budget, a budget based not on projections made \nby our Congressional Budget Office, the office the President himself \nsaid should be the common ground of all proposals on future spending \nand tax policies. No, the President's proposal is based on his own \nfigures, taken almost out of thin air, but, nonetheless, it is a \nproposal, Madam President, a proposal which was rejected by a vote of 0 \nto 96 in this body earlier this week. The President's party in this \nbody does not propose to follow the course of action that the White \nHouse has outlined.\n  It simply proposes to vote no on all of the changes which we have \nadvanced in this reconciliation bill.\n  But perhaps most significant, I believe, in connection with this \ndebate is the estimate, the projection that our Congressional Budget \nOffice has made conditioned upon our adopting these spending reforms \nand passing a statute which will lead to a balanced budget even 7 years \nfrom now in the year 2002.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that if there is in law a \nrealistic and effective set of statutes, which it and independent \neconomists can say with a high degree of confidence will balance the \nbudget even after the turn of the century, then, in its view, the \n\n[[Page S15645]]\n\neconomy will grow sufficiently to provide an additional $170 billion in \nrevenue as a result of a growth of the economy itself and as a result \nof lower inflation and lower interest rates--$170 billion, Madam \nPresident, for the Government of the United States. But that figure is \nnot the total of the benefit to the people of the United States; it is \nonly the share of the Federal Government. The total benefit--roughly \nfour times that--will approach $1 trillion.\n  Where will the balance over that $170 billion be? It will be in the \npockets of the American people in the form of higher wages, in the form \nof lower interest payments on the homes that they purchase, in the form \nof better jobs because of greater opportunity that the society will \ncreate. That is the reward--the cautious and conservative reward--that \nthis country and its economy and its people can and will receive from a \nbalanced budget. That is an argument which has been almost totally \noverlooked in this debate over specific programs and precise benefits, \ntax breaks, and the like, that simply by engaging in this action we \nwill provide Americans with a brighter and a better economic future.\n  Of course, Madam President, that $170 billion of additional resources \nfor the Government of the United States represents, itself, the \noverwhelming bulk of the tax relief which is contained in this \nproposal, and is conditioned upon this proposal becoming law in a way \nthat will in fact balance the budget. When you add to that the closure \nof various corporate loopholes, the overwhelming majority of the tax \nreductions have as their source either those loophole closings or the \nfiscal dividend--the $170 billion dividend we get--simply because we \nwill have balanced the budget. And it is our firm view that that \ndividend ought to be returned to the American people in the form of \nlower taxes and not retained by the Government for its programs.\n  As I said, Madam President, we do not have an alternate vision; we \nhave an alternate set of criticisms. No, we cannot do this. No, we dare \nnot do that. No, we cannot reduce that program and, above all, we do \nnot dare reduce taxes on the American people. That alternative course \nof action is one which says, essentially, that the status quo is the \nbest we can do; that whatever we have done in the past, we ought to \ncontinue to do in the future; that we can afford to ignore almost \ncompletely, but not quite, all of the challenges and problems of the \nmost rapidly growing of our major entitlements--Medicare; that we can \nand should continue to say that the overwhelming bulk of the cost of \nMedicare should be paid by today's working people, even when that means \nthat hard-working, middle-income Americans are paying for more than \ntwo-thirds, almost three-quarters, of the health expenses of wealthy, \nretired Americans--millionaire retired Americans. No, we cannot make \nthese reforms. We should not make any changes. Everything that Congress \nhas done in the past, all of the programs it has passed in the past \nshould and must be continued.\n  Well, Madam President, I must say that the choices are relatively \neasy choices. With all of the difficulties and with all the changes in \ndirection, with all of the groups with genuine or imagined concerns, we \nhave a plan, we have a vision that will lead to a stronger America. Our \nopponents do not. It is time for us to move ahead, to do what we \ncommitted ourselves to do during the course of last year's election \ncampaigns--to pass this proposal, to settle our differences with the \nHouse, and then, from a position of strength, to persuade the President \nto keep the commitments that he has made at one time or another, which, \nof course, included all of these elements--a reform in our Medicare \nsystem, a balanced budget, changing welfare as we know it, and a tax \ncut for middle-income Americans.\n  Every one of these four elements in our program is something that the \nPresident of the United States has promised or committed to at some \ntime in the past and has since, to a greater or lesser degree, \nrepudiated. We want to keep our commitments; we want to keep his \ncommitments. The only way we can do so is by passing this \nreconciliation bill.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I yield myself such time as needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We have heard today a number of arguments made on each \nside relative to the topic of the tax cut provisions in this \nlegislation, and I think it is important for the American people to \nunderstand the clear distinction that exists on the two sides of the \naisle over the issue of taxes.\n  Today, the Republican tax cuts that are part of this legislation have \nbeen described as tax cuts for wealthy Americans. They have been \ndescribed as unfair. They have been described as unneeded. They have \nbeen described in a variety of other ways.\n  I think it is important before we analyze those tax cuts and who they \nreally benefit, to begin by just stepping back from today and looking \nat some of the things that have transpired here in Congress in recent \nyears. I find it interesting that the people who are on this floor \nattacking the tax cut provisions of this legislation are the very same \npeople who just in the last Congress voted to raise the taxes of \nworking Americans by $270 billion, the largest tax increase in history.\n  Indeed, it is very simple, I think, to differentiate between the \nparties and their positions on taxes. There is one party, the \nRepublican Party, that is presenting Americans today with middle-class \ntax cuts; there is another party that in the last Congress raised taxes \na record level of $270 billion.\n  I think that the opposition to the Republican tax cuts that are \nproposed in this legislation should not surprise anyone. It is coming \nfrom the people who already raised our taxes by a record amount, and \nwho would hate to see those taxes go down at all.\n  The fact of the matter is, Madam President, that taxes represent the \nhard work of people in this country who are out playing by the rules. \nIn my State of Michigan they are doing the things we need to keep our \neconomy strong. They are average men and women whose income, at least \nin my State, for a family is about $32,000. They work hard for those \ndollars.\n  Some time ago in the 1950's and 1960's, those average families in \nMichigan like my own sent $1 to Washington for every $50 they earned; \ntoday that average family in Michigan spends $1 in Washington for every \n$4 it earns.\n  In part, I came here to the U.S. Senate and ran for this office so \nthat families who are sending too many of their dollars to Washington \nwould get a chance to keep more of what they earn.\n  We talk a lot today, and we have seen charts in the Senate over the \nlast few months in which we talk about the problems of the so-called \nmiddle-class squeeze, the economic pressure on hard-working average \nmiddle-class families in our country to make ends meet.\n  We are often told it is so unfortunate today that it is now necessary \noften for two people in the household to work in order to be able to \nattain the same economic conditions that used to be available to \nmiddle-class families with only one person out there in the work force.\n  A lot of speculation goes on in the U.S. Senate as to why it is; why \nis that middle-class squeeze happening? Why is it that two people have \nto work to make ends meet?\n  A big part of the answer, Madam President, is the taxes have gone up \nso dramatically during the last 30 to 40 years in this country, and \ndramatically in just the last 2 years alone.\n  The fact is if the average family in Michigan was still sending $1 in \nWashington for every $50 it earned, the financial security of those \nfamilies would be a lot greater today. The combination of paying higher \ntaxes and paying higher interest rates on all the sorts of things that \npeople in my State have to pay interest on, whether it is a mortgage \nfor a home or interest on a car payment or interest with regard to \nconsumer items or interest on student loans, if those interest rates \nwere lower, people in my State would be better off as well. But they \nare not low.\n  One reason they are not low is because the Federal Government has not \n\n\n[[Page S15646]]\n\nbalanced its budget in the last quarter of a century. As we run up red \nink in Washington, as the Federal Government is forced to borrow money \nfrom lending institutions, from individuals, from whomever, we have \ndriven up interest rates.\n  The middle-class families find themselves in two separate ways \ndramatically affected by the policies here in Washington. On the one \nhand, it does not get to keep as many dollars as it earns because it \nhas to send more dollars to Washington in taxes; and then with those \nfewer dollars that remain it has to pay more in the way of interest \nbecause Government policies have helped to drive up interest rates, \nbecause we cannot live here in Washington within our means.\n  That is why in this legislation we are trying to correct the two \nproblems that afflict those middle-class families.\n  On the one hand, we are trying to give middle-class families the kind \nof Federal Government fiscal responsibility they have to exercise in \ntheir own homes. What we are trying to do is to bring about ultimately \nat the end of 7 years the balanced budget that has eluded us here in \nWashington for a quarter of a century.\n  As we bring down the deficit and as we maintain a balanced budget, \nand as we maintain a balanced budget after the year 2002, the impact of \nthat will be a dramatic effect on middle-class families, because as we \nbring down the deficit, as we recognize in our own CBO reports here, \ninterest rates that the Federal Government has to pay will go down.\n  That will save money for the Federal Government. It also will mean \nthat interest rates in the private sector go down. It means the \ninterest that people who are watching today and hearing all these \nfrightening stories, as they go out into the housing market, as they go \nout to buy a car for the family, as they go out to make other purchases \nthat are affected by interest rates, they will find their interest \nrates, just like the Federal Government interest rates that they have \nto pay, will be coming down, which will make items more affordable.\n  That is one reason we are trying to bring this budget into balance. \nAt the same time, we are trying to address the other problem that \naffects average American families, the problem of sending too many \ndollars to Washington. That, of course, leads us to the issue of our \ntax cut.\n  There have been many, many descriptions of the tax cut. The tax cut \nwas being described before it was ever even talked about in the Senate, \nbefore it was addressed, before anybody put a pen to paper to try to \ndraft a tax cut. It was always described the same way it is being \ndescribed today, as a tax cut principally desired by Republicans to be \ngiven to the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I was astonished when the other day in our Budget Committee meeting \nwhen we finally passed the reconciliation package to the floor, to hear \ntalk that over half--over half--of those benefits from the tax cut were \ngoing to go to the wealthiest families in America.\n  That was not the tax cut I had heard about. It was not the way I had \nseen it described. I had even read the Washington Post in which the \nWashington Post described the tax cut as ``family friendly.''\n  I went out and asked for statistics and I was presented with the \nJoint Committee on Taxation's specific results of their analysis. Here \nis what I found: In the first year of this tax cut, 90 percent of the \ntax cut goes to those making under $100,000 in the first year; 77 \npercent of the proposal's tax cuts go to those making under $75,000 in \nthat first year. Less than 1 percent of the proposal's tax cuts will go \nto those making over $200,000 in the first year. Over four-fifths, 84 \npercent of the proposal's tax cuts go to those making under $100,000 in \nthe first 5 years. And 70 percent of the proposal's tax cuts go to \nthose making under $75,000 in those first 5 years. Less than 6 percent \nof the proposal's tax cuts will go to those making over $200,000 in the \nfirst 5 years.\n  That is a completely different set of statistics than the ones \npresented to us at the Budget Committee. It is not the case that over \nhalf of the tax cuts are going to people making over $100,000, quite \nthe contrary.\n  This is a family friendly tax cut. It is designed to address the \nsecond problem I earlier mentioned, the problem that middle-class \nfamilies have had, the squeeze that has been put upon them because they \nhave had to send too many dollars to Washington.\n  I did not want to just leave it at the Joint Tax Committee's numbers. \nNow, we had competing sets of statistics so I thought the next and most \nimportant thing I could do would be to look at the specific components \nof the tax cut to see which of the two versions was accurate. What I \ndiscovered was that, of course, the Joint Tax Committee's version, \ntheir statistics, are right on the mark.\n  Let us tell the American people some of the things that comprise this \ntax bill.\n  First, it provides a $500 per child tax credit for American families. \nThat constitutes $141 billion of the $225 billion in tax relief under \nthis bill, over 62 percent.\n  Some say for some of those children, they are part of families that \nmake lots of money. That may be true. But, of course, this tax bill has \nbeen limited in its scope. Indeed, the $500 per child tax credit begins \nto be phased out, in the case of families with a single head of \nhousehold at $75,000, in the case of a couple at $110,000. So, unless \npeople between $100,000 and $110,000 have a vastly disproportionate \nnumber of children, the argument that many of the tax breaks from the \nfamily tax credit are going to go to wealthy people, as defined by some \npeople here in Washington, just is simply not the case. Of course it is \nnot the case.\n  Madam President, $141 billion, 62 percent of the tax cut, is the \nfamily tax credit, $500 per child, letting families keep $500 per child \nto spend, to try to make ends meet to provide those children with a \nbetter way of life.\n  Another important part of our tax credit in the family tax relief \nsection is an adoption credit. That accounts for almost $2 billion of \nthis tax cut. It is a nonrefundable tax credit allowing for the \nexclusion of up to $5,000 in adoption costs. The credit phases out. \nThis is important. It phases out between the taxable income levels of \n$60,000 and $100,000 for both individuals and couples. In other words, \nnot $1 of the adoption credit, the $2 billion of tax cuts that form the \nbasis for that tax relief, will go to anybody making more than \n$100,000. Indeed, again, it is aimed at helping people in this country, \nmiddle-income categories, to be able to expedite the adoption of \nchildren, to provide children with loving homes and a few of the \ndollars necessary to make it possible for those adoptions to be carried \nout in a way that provides children with a better chance for their \nfuture.\n  The next part of it, another family-related tax section, is $12.3 \nbillion to try to provide relief from the marriage penalty that we \nimpose under our Tax Code. Maybe some people who make more than \n$100,000 will benefit from the elimination of the marriage penalty, but \nI hardly think anybody wants to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand argue we should not eliminate this marriage penalty. It makes no \nsense for us to have ever done it in the first place.\n  Another part of our family tax relief is student loan interest \ndeduction. That is another $1 billion. Once again, it is limited in \nscope to people who have adjusted gross incomes of between $40,000 and \n$55,000 for singles and between $60,000 and $75,000 for married \ncouples. After that, this deduction is not available. Again, a \ndeduction aimed at helping people of moderate means to try to better \nand more easily finance college educations.\n  On and on I went through this tax program. What I discovered was that \nin almost every section, the entire focus has been to try to provide \nmiddle-class families with tax relief, to try to let people keep more \nof what they earned, to try to allow families in this country to offset \nsome of the hardships that come about when the Federal Government \nconsumes too many of their dollars.\n  That does not mean that every part of the bill primarily benefits \npeople of middle-income backgrounds. Yes, there are sections aimed at \ntrying to create growth in our economy, that disproportionately benefit \npeople and, to some extent corporations, people of greater means and \ncorporations. Interestingly, though, a very substantial percentage \n\n[[Page S15647]]\n\nof the benefits of those pro growth tax reductions and tax cuts go to \nthe benefit of average working families in this country because, as we \nunleash the benefits of some of these growth-oriented tax cuts, what \nwill it produce? It will produce more jobs, better paying jobs. As \ncompanies expand and grow, we will hire more people, we will provide \nmore opportunities for Americans.\n  Remember this, too, Madam President, a great number of the people who \nbenefit from capital gains tax cuts are families who are selling the \nfamily home, who are selling other capital assets, who own or are part \nof pension programs that invest in stocks and corporations and \nultimately realize capital gains.\n  Moreover--and I think it is important to note--this bill does not \nhave simply an up side for those in these wealthy categories or for \ncorporations, because we are also closing a substantial number of tax \nloopholes. In fact, the closing of loopholes largely offsets the tax \nadvantages that are provided to corporations and upper-income \nindividuals under this bill.\n  In short, we are paying for most of the benefits derived by those \nindividuals by the closing of these loopholes. In short, once again, \nthis tax cut bill is designed to aid families in the middle class above \nall other families in this country.\n  For those reasons, I intend to come to the floor again as may be \nnecessary to keep reminding our colleagues exactly who the \nbeneficiaries of this tax cut are. It is simply, as you analyze the \ndata as to where the tax cuts go and how specifically the tax cuts have \nbeen developed, you realize once again that the claims that our tax cut \nis designed to help so-called wealthy people simply miss the point. It \nis a tax bill designed to help middle-income families to address a \nproblem that has been growing in this country for the last 40 years, \nthe problem of the Federal Government getting too big, consuming too \nmany resources, making it much more difficult for average families to \nmake ends meet. By balancing the budget and thereby bringing down \ninterest rates, by giving families tax cuts, we can try to help \nalleviate the middle class squeeze. That is what we are trying to \naccomplish in no small measure with this legislation.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from Iowa such time as he may \nneed off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nMichigan for an outstanding review of all of the various profamily, \nprogrowth tax measures that are in this bill. This tax bill is a \nmemorial to the proposition that we believe taxpayers' money comes to \nthe Treasury for legitimate Government purposes, and the expenditure \nfor those purposes and not one more penny should come from the pockets \nof the taxpayers. When we give this tax cut this year, we are just \ngiving people back money that was ruthlessly taken from them in the \nlast Congress by the President's budget.\n  We give it back in the way of helping middle-class working families \nwho pay the bulk of the taxes in this country. We do it in a way that \nsays that the foundation of our society is families and that we want to \nencourage the family as an institution. That is why three-quarters of \nthe tax cuts in this bill go to families, primarily through the $500 \nper child tax credit. That is a tax credit that is off the bottom line \nof taxes otherwise owed to the Federal Treasury.\n  Whereas, the Senator from Michigan gave a very good explanation of \nwhat is in the tax provision, I want to speak about our efforts to \nbalance the budget, our efforts to reduce the role of Government in our \neconomy by reducing the size of the budget, by reducing the percentage \nof the budget to the gross national product over time, meaning a \nlessening of the amount of money that is run through the inefficient \noperation of the Federal budget, because we believe that the free \nmarket, the segment of the economy out there that comes from the \nprivate sector, the nonpublic part of our budget, is the most efficient \ndistributor of goods and services, where the jobs are created, where we \nhave efficiency within our economy.\n  Getting to a balanced budget sets a very, very good starting point \nfor the reduction of interest rates. And it is projected that interest \nrates will go down 1.5 to 2 percent if we pass this year a budget that \nwill balance by the year 2002. And we are gradually and responsibly \nreducing expenditures to get to that point that interest rates will go \ndown. In fact, we started to reduce Government expenditures with a \nrescissions bill of $14 billion for fiscal year 1995, just completed.\n  By reducing interest rates, we are setting the stage, then, for \ngrowing the economy, for creating jobs and expanding, as we must be. \nThere is so much of the job creation which comes from the private \nsector and the small business sector of the private sector that with \ninterest rates going down, it is really going to encourage small \nbusinesses to create more jobs. They are the engine. Small business is \nthe engine that drives our economy.\n  Getting to this point has been about a 10-month process. Remember, \njust 12 months ago there was a Republican program called the contract \nthat had 10 features in it that was in a sense a national program. When \nnormally we have 435 different races for Congress and campaigns for \nCongress, the Republican Party had one national campaign. And the \ncenterpiece of that national campaign was to deliver a balanced budget. \nTwelve months ago we may not have foreseen a Republican victory the \nsize that it was, we may not have foreseen the people's response to the \nprogram, but that program called for a balanced budget.\n  We took control of both Houses of Congress in January for the first \ntime in 40 years. In a sense, when we took over in January we \ntransformed our contract into New Year's resolutions with the American \npeople. We said that we are going to put this bloated Government on a \ndiet. Then for the last 10 months, we have been following a regime to \nachieve our resolution.\n  What happens in the Senate on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this \nweek, as far as delivering upon one of the major promises of the last \ncampaign--to balance the budget, to reduce taxes, and to reduce taxes \nthat are paid for by cutting spending--that is all of that 10 months of \nwork. Everything that the people have been expecting since they voted \n12 months ago for a new Congress is coming to an end on Wednesday, \nThursday, and Friday. What decides whether or not we are successful is \nif we have 50 votes to pass this reconciliation bill. We Republicans \nthen have been following a regime to achieve our resolution that we \nstarted on last January.\n  The other side of the aisle, meaning my Democratic friends, have been \ncarping with neither shame nor credibility. They have no credible \nalternatives. Oh, the President said in June, after 6 months of finally \nwaking up to what the people decided in the last election, that he was \nfor a balanced budget, not in 7 years as the Republicans planned but in \n10 years. But when the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, looks at the President's program to \nbalance a budget in 10 years, they do not find a budget balance in 10 \nyears. They still find $200 billion deficits as far as you can see into \nthe future.\n  That is no different than the President's program of 1993, which he \nclaims has reduced deficits more than in any other 3-year period than \nany other President ever had. But the point is the President's program \nof 1993 still saw beyond the year 1997 $200 billion deficits as far as \nthe eye can see. Two years later, in June 1995, the President says he \nis for a balanced budget by 2005. But when you score it the same way we \nscore our budgets, it is still the same old story--unbalanced budgets \nas far as you can see into the future.\n  Maybe I should not say the other side has no alternative, because the \nPresident did say the budget ought to be balanced. He did not send up a \nprogram to do it. He just said that is something that he is for. But \nnever before was he for a balanced budget. Then later on he said, well, \nmaybe it can be done in 9 years. Then I believe it was just last week, \nor near to now, he said he could agree with the Republicans, that it \nought to be done in 7 years and can be done in 7 years.\n\n[[Page S15648]]\n\n  But for the most part, all we have heard from the opposition is \nnaysayers. This diet that we Republicans want to put the Federal \nbureaucracy on, the other side has been saying no to, naysayers. It is \nkind of like those little voices that you hear in your head when each \nof us say that we ought to go on a diet, or we are going to go on a \ndiet. That little voice in our head says, ``I cannot do this. I cannot \ndo this.'' That little voice says, ``Let us wait until manana.'' Or it \nsays, ``I do not feel like doing anything today, do it tomorrow. Maybe \ntomorrow I will start, I will start my diet.'' Then you hear those \nlittle voices with millions of excuses why you cannot go on a diet.\n  The Republican program is putting the Federal bureaucracy and Federal \nprograms on a diet. It is being downsized. That is the essence of our \nreconciliation bill before us. The other side, without shame or \ncredibility, are naysayers to this process.\n  Madam President, sometimes to achieve the best results we ought to \ntune out those little voices, not listen to those little voices in our \nhead who say, ``I cannot do this,'' or, ``I will do it tomorrow,'' or \nany of those other million excuses that we hear. Tune out those little \nvoices.\n  So that is why I speak to my colleagues, particularly my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, because this is a very important debate \nabout turning things around and no longer business as usual when it \ncomes to the fiscal policy of the Federal Government because business \nas usual has been for 30 years, do not be concerned about a balanced \nbudget. Or maybe I can say the last 10 years, be concerned about a \nbalanced budget, but not really doing anything about it. That is \nbusiness as usual.\n  The people in the last election sent us a clear signal that they no \nlonger want business as usual in Washington. And the reconciliation \nbill up for debate on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for 20 hours of \ndebate in this body, and then hence to final passage, is our statement \nof no longer business as usual, that we are going to deliver on the \npromises of the last election. For once, Congress is going to perform \naccording to the rhetoric of the last campaign. Our performance will be \ncommensurate with what we said in the last election. And the essence of \nthat is our Government programs and our bureaucracy must go on a diet.\n\n  And so during this debate then, just tune out those little voices \nthat say, ``I can't do this. I can't go on a diet.'' Because we will. \nWe must. And we sense the responsibility not only because it \nphilosophically comports with what we feel Government must do, but it \nis also a behavioral change that comes from the large voice of the \nelectorate that spoke in the last election.\n  This very important debate can be summed up in just one word. That \none word is six letters, future, f-u-t-u-r-e. This budget plans for the \nfuture; this budget provides for the future; and by so doing gives our \nchildren and our grandchildren a future, the sort of future that we \nhave a responsibility to leave them. It is not a responsibility that we \njudge our own. It is a responsibility that we have inherited from past \ngenerations of Americans who have given my generation and younger \ngenerations a great country to live in, a better future than our \nancestors had and the generation that preceded it.\n  That would not be possible, Madam President, without providing a \nbalanced budget and the secure future that it allows. In effect, it is \na necessary forerunner to a guaranteed future as we know it and better \nfor our younger generations.\n  This budget provides a positive vision for our country's future, a \nfuture in which we have a balanced budget that will help increase \nproductivity, lower interest rates, create more jobs and, most \nimportantly, lessen the tax burden we are placing on today's children.\n  Let us be clear. We talk about fiscal policy. We talk about doing \neconomic good. We talk about a secure future in materialistic terms. \nBut this is not just a debate about material betterment. It is not a \ndebate about abstract fiscal policy or economic issues. This is more a \nmoral issue than anything else.\n  The Republican Party simply believes it is not right for our \ngeneration to live high on the hog and to pass the bills on to the next \ngeneration of young people. We are saying that finally Congress \nrealizes that is just not right. That is what we said in the last \nelection. We did not know when we said it that people would respond \npositively to it. But the voters did respond positively to it by the \nbiggest shakeup in Congress since the 1930 election. That 1930 election \nturned things around politically so much in Congress and Washington, \nDC, that there has not been a change from that direction until now.\n  Now, whether there was a whole new political environment ushered in \nby the election in 1994, I do not know for sure. I suppose the 1996 and \n1998 elections will answer that question for me. But I do know this, \nthat we got the message of the last election. We are responding to it. \nAnd we are passing a budget that is balanced based upon the fact that \nit is immoral for us to go in the hole, to deficit spend and not care \nwho pays the bill while we live good and live well.\n  While we are worried about what the 1996 election or the 1998 \nelection might mean for securing a long-term political change in \nWashington, DC, we have the responsibility to do what the voters asked \nus to do in the last election. So this budget states that we believe \nAmericans know how to spend their hard-earned dollars better than \nbureaucrats as we decrease the size of Government as a proportion of \nthe gross national product, as we reduce the number of Government \nemployees, as we reduce and eliminate deficits by the year 2002. We \nshow our faith in the American people by giving back to them $224 \nbillion of their hard-earned tax dollars for them to decide how to \nspend for their future because we believe it will be more efficiently \nspent by them than by Government.\n  Finally, this budget ensures that the future of our seniors and the \nbaby boomers who will soon be retiring is secure because we preserve \nMedicare in this budget and we ensure that it does not go bankrupt. \nRepublicans have offered a comprehensive vision of the future. We have \nkept the promise of the last election. If we pass this resolution in \nthe next 2 days, we have kept our New Year's resolution to the voters \nto put Government on a diet. We have not listened to those little \nvoices in the minds who say, ``I can't go on this diet. I can't do this \ntoday. I will do it tomorrow.'' We have listened to the loud voice of \nthe electorate.\n  Now, incredibly, I have heard the President claim that the Republican \nbalanced budget would mortgage our future--would mortgage our future. \nCan you imagine the nerve of the President saying the Republican \nbalanced budget will mortgage our future when we have been mortgaging \nour future for the last 30 years because it was 1969--not quite 30 \nyears, 26 years--since we have had a balanced budget. He did not say \nthat out of ignorance because the President is a very intelligent \nperson. I do not know really why he said it. I would like to know why. \nIt seems to me that it could be part of a program to muddy the waters.\n  It is clear to the people what is going on up here on the Hill \nbecause this budget, this reconciliation bill before us, does not \nmortgage the future. The failed policies of the big spenders have \nalready done that. We Republicans, with this balanced budget \nresolution, are successfully ridding ourselves of the deficit, the so-\ncalled mortgage that is on our future, so that we can have a bright \nfuture for our young people.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic side offers nothing for the future. It \nseems the White House is happy to have a growing deficit that continues \nto mortgage our future. The White House, by not cooperating with \nCongress to balance the budget, is sending a clear message that they \nwant in essence to take out a second mortgage to fund increased \nspending instead of doing the responsible thing of balancing the \nbudget.\n  The White House policy will have our children and grandchildren \ncontinuing to pay not only the first mortgage but the second mortgage.\n  I guess, Mr. President, the essence is that the other side of the \naisle has no New Year's resolution. They can only offer working \nfamilies more of the same. They do not even want to sit down at the \ntable with us to negotiate. Right after our summer recess in August, we \nreturned after Labor Day, the President was invited to the Hill--not to \nthe Hill, wherever the President \n\n[[Page S15649]]\n\nwants to sit down with Republican leadership to talk compromise, work \nout differences. The President then would have to put his wares on the \ntable for the whole world to see. Evidently, he was not ready to do \nthat. No response.\n  October 1 comes, the end of the fiscal year. We have to move forward. \nWe moved the time ahead to November the 13th, but we could not wait any \nlonger to fulfill the constitutional responsibilities that the Congress \nhas to provide a budget; and implicit in our Constitution, a balanced \nbudget, because we have had more balanced budgets in peacetime than we \nhave deficits throughout the history of our country.\n  Just last Thursday, the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority \nleader offered the President to sit down and talk. No response. So we \nmove forward. I think this can be resolved. But it cannot be resolved \nby the other side having no program and at the same time carping and \ncriticizing what the majority is doing. More of these same policies are \ngoing to bankrupt Medicare.\n  This bill before us solves that problem, as the trustees, the \nDemocrat trustees, asked us to do on April 2. Not the President's \nproposal, it is going to provide for more out-of-control spending, with \n$200 billion deficits that will destroy our children's futures because \nthat is what the President's 10-year balanced budget program--even \nthough he did not give us specifics--would provide. That is not my \ndetermination. That is the determination of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. And you know in this proposal it is going \nto still continue to give us more taxes, more taxes, and more taxes. \nAnd if there are not more taxes this day, because the President may not \nbe proposing to change tax policy--he did it with the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of the country in 1993--for the young people of \nAmerica it is going to mean into the next century tax increases of 80-\nsome percent because of irresponsible spending today.\n  So I think it is clear which New Year's resolution the American \npeople want us to keep. It is the one of promising a future for our \nyoung people, a future for our country, a future for the world, as this \nengine of the United States, this economic engine of the United States, \ndrives the rest of the world.\n  We have that opportunity to fulfill that promise for our future \ngenerations by adopting this resolution and to avoid being influenced \nby the carping from the other side of the aisle and from the White \nHouse that has no program to reach the goals that we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas and, following that 5 minutes, to the Senator \nfrom Alabama from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we have now been on this bill 6 hours--\nlet us see, I believe a little over 6 hours, 6 hours, 30 minutes, and \nwe have yet to vote. We only have 20 hours on the entire bill. And my \nquestion is this: This bill, which everybody on the other side of the \naisle is so proud of, why do you not want to let us offer the \namendments and let you defend it?\n  That is all we want. If you are so proud of that tax cut, let us \noffer an amendment to make that tax cut refundable for the people who \nreally need it. You call it a middle-class tax cut. That does not even \nstand the giggle test. A family with four children, making $20,000 a \nyear, probably pays no income tax. And they do not get the $500 per \nchild tax credit. They get nothing. The $500 credit is only available \nif you pay $500 in income tax.\n  Contrast that situation with this: A man and wife with one child, and \nthey pay, we will say, $500 in taxes. Under the Republican budget, they \nwill get that $500 back through the child tax credit. But if you happen \nto have a house full of kids, your dependent exemptions will probably \nresult in you paying no income taxes, so you will not be eligible for \nthe same credit wealthier families get. That is a middle-class tax cut? \nWe all know now that 49.5 percent of the people in this country make \nless than $30,000 a year. What do they get out of this middle-class tax \ncut? They get a tax increase, 50 percent of the people in this country \nare going to wind up paying more.\n  Now, I will never forget in 1981 when Ronald Reagan came to town on \nthe promise he was going to balance the budget, and I was hot for him. \nI am one of three Senators in the U.S. Senate--I want to cleanse my \nskirts--who voted for every one of President Reagan's spending cuts, \nbut I voted against that massive tax cut. If everybody had voted the \nway Fritz Hollings, Bill Bradley and Dale Bumpers voted, we would have \nhad a balanced budget. But, no, we had to give the store away. General \nElectric made----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No.\n  General Electric made $3.7 billion in 1983 and got a $700 million tax \ncut. That was all $3 trillion ago, $3 trillion from the promise of a \nbalanced budget. In only 8 years, our $1 trillion debt went to $3 \ntrillion. You talk about snake oil.\n  So what are we doing here? Are we going to pass an amendment that \nsays the tax cut cannot come out of the Social Security trust fund? If \nyou want to balance the budget, forget the tax cut. CBO says that \nwithout the tax cut we can balance the budget in the year 2001, a year \nearlier than under this budget. How is the tax cut being paid for? Out \nof Medicare, out of school lunches, out of Social Security, out of \nstudent loans, out of the earned income tax credit, out of agricultural \nprograms. It does not make any difference which spending cut you say is \nthe source of the tax cut. It does not matter.\n  What matters is that we are giving away $220 billion to $240 billion \nin taxes that ought to go on the deficit or, at a minimum, be placed \nback in those programs like school lunches and Head Start and student \nloans and things that give people at the bottom of the ladder a \nfighting chance to become somebody.\n  I got that chance when I went to one of the best law schools in the \ncountry on the GI bill, and I have been trying to pay it back ever \nsince by reaching from the top of the ladder down to people on the \nbottom rung and bringing them up, because I think that makes me better \nand it makes our country stronger.\n  I consider this 2,000-page monstrosity of a bill, that must weigh at \nleast 10 pounds, I consider it one of the worst disasters to befall \nthis institution called Congress. You think of it--penalizing the \nelderly, penalizing poor children, penalizing the most vulnerable among \nus while we give away 76 percent of the capital gains tax cut to the \nwealthiest people in America. Meanwhile, we continue to sell lands for \n$100 an acre when the mineral rights are worth thousands of dollars an \nacre. So the StillWater Mining Co. in Montana will pay $200,000 for a \nplot of land worth $38 billion in platinum and palladium. We are giving \naway taxpayers' property while we penalize the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the Senate will soon be faced with an up-\nor-down vote on proposals of mammoth proportions. These proposals will \ndirectly affect virtually every segment of the government and every \ncitizen of this country. For some, the consequences will be positive. \nFor the vast majority, however, the consequences will be bad--in some \ncases, like for the elderly, students, and working class, the effects \nwill be economically devastating.\n  While this package as written will significantly reduce the deficit, \nat least in the short term, there is considerable doubt as to whether \nor not it will ultimately balance the budget by 2002. Some of the \nsavings are artificial or even lose money despite producing CBO-scored \nsavings. As we all know, future congressional action is likely to \nreduce other savings currently assumed by this plan. A major portion of \nthe projected savings in this plan come from Medicare and Medicaid. \nWelfare reform, nutrition programs, the earned income tax credit, farm \nprograms, and student loans are other areas facing enormous cuts.\n  I am strongly in favor of deficit reduction and, ultimately, the \nelimination of the national debt. I have long supported a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. I supported \n\n[[Page S15650]]\n\nthe 1993 reconciliation bill which has already led to significant \nreductions in our annual deficits. But as with any omnibus legislation \nof this type, there is a right and wrong way to pursue the same goal. \nThemes and patterns emerge. Priorities and process do matter, and it \nappears that on balance, the priorities in the package before us are \nseriously misguided.\n  What our colleagues on the other side are attempting is to place a \nvastly disproportionate share of the pain which will inevitable result \nfrom cuts of this magnitude on those least able to absorb it--working \npeople, the elderly, students. There is a bitter flavor that this \npackage produces, and you do not have to bite off and chew on its \ndetails to taste its bitterness. Its basic ingredients were listed in \nthe blue-print the Senate passed several months ago, but as they have \nbeen mixed together and as they have simmered in the context of this \nreconciliation package, they have become dramatically more bitter.\n  The theme throughout is to benefit those who have already benefitted \ngreatly in this society, and to punish those who are simply trying to \nget by or to realize a share of the American dream.\n  I have several major concerns surrounding this legislation, but the \nmost disturbing are the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. The plan is to \ncut Medicare growth by $270 billion over 7 years. In addition to \nslowing the growth of spending from 10 percent a year to about 6.4 \npercent, it mandates a major restructuring of the program to supposedly \ngive Medicare enrollees a wide range of options to join private health \nplans. I am concerned that instead of options, however, senior citizens \nwill instead be faced with fewer alternatives, and will be forced into \ncertain plans because they have no choice.\n  It is my understanding that $89 billion in savings would rescue the \nMedicare Program, but we are considering a bill which cuts it by $270 \nbillion. The proposed $270 billion of savings is vastly more than is \nneeded to preserve the solvency of the program. Therefore, we need \nhonest answers as to why we are attempting to write into law a $270 \nbillion reduction.\n  The direction we are going will ultimately cause senior citizens to \nbe charged more for health care while receiving less in Medicare, all \nthe while financing a tax break for those in the upper income brackets.\n  A great portion of the savings in Medicare would result by raising \nthe part B premium. The premiums that our senior citizens pay would \nrise from the $46.10 per month to more than $90 by the Year 2002.\n  I have reservations and misgivings with regard to any Medicare reform \nthat threatens the access to, and quality of, health care for senior \ncitizens. Specifically, this bill would cut inpatient hospital service, \nhome health care services, extended care services, hospice care, \nphysicians services, outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, \nand other important services to our senior citizens.\n  In addition to reduction in services, the following immediate burdens \nwould be placed on our senior citizens: For Fiscal Year 1996, the \nmonthly premium would rise to $54. Participants in the part B program \nwould be required to pay the first $150 of expenses out-of-pocket \nrather than the current $100 deductible. This would rise by $10 \nannually through the year 2002. All these in combination with the \nproposal to raise the eligibility age to 67 leads me to believe that \nseniors are being singled out to bear the brunt of budget cuts.\n  We all realize that the Medicare Program cannot continue functioning \nindefinitely as it is now, but the cure is certainly not the Republican \nplan.\n  Not only do these proposals cut Medicare, but Medicaid is being \nreduced by $187 billion over the next 7 years. For the past 30 years, \nthe Medicaid Program has been America's health and long-term care \nsafety net. The Republican proposal is to repeal Medicaid, slash its \nFederal funding over the next 7 years by 20 percent, and to turn \nremaining Federal funds over to the States in the form of a block \ngrant. According to the American Health Care Association, in 1993, 43 \npercent of the cost of Medicaid payments was born by the States. Under \nthe block grant proposal, by 2002, the state share would be 56 \npercent--a 13-percent increase in just 7 short years. In a State like \nAlabama, which is habitually faced with budget proration, the effects \nof such additional burdens will be huge and devastating.\n  The National Association of Counties strongly opposes the block \ngranting of Medicaid and the loss of a Federal guarantee to benefits. \nIn a letter sent to my office yesterday, its executive director, Larry \nE. Naake, wrote,\n\n       We do not believe that states will find enough budgetary \n     efficiencies without reducing eligibility . . . Individuals \n     will continue to have health needs, regardless of the payor \n     source. That is why we have always supported the \n     intergovernmental nature of the Medicaid program and the \n     assurance that there is some minimum level of coverage \n     guaranteed to eligible individuals, regardless of the state \n     in which they reside.\n\n  The Democratic plan would reform Medicaid, not repeal it. It would \nrestrain the rate of growth in Federal Medicaid spending in a \nresponsible manner, not slash spending so much that huge cutbacks in \neligibility, benefits, and payments to providers are inevitable. It \nwould maintain a Federal fiscal partnership with the States for health \nand long-term care, not break the commitment to assist States and \nlocalities in paying for care to vulnerable Americans.\n  These proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funding would also have \na devastating impact on hospitals and health care systems since \nproviders will take the brunt of $270 billion Medicare reductions. \nAlabama would get $1.45 billion less in Federal Medicaid assistance \nover the next 7 years. Such a drastic cut will have a profound effect \non the ability of health care providers to meet the ever-increasing \nneeds of the community and will also increase costs for those with \nprivate insurance plans. On the other hand, the right kinds of \ndecisions could set the course for restructuring these programs in ways \nthat will enable providers to deliver quality care more efficiently.\n  These extreme cuts to Medicare also threaten health care for millions \nof people of all ages living in rural America. Medicare spending in \nrural communities will be cut by $57.9 billion over the next 7 years--a \n21-percent reduction by 2002. Since rural hospitals rely on Medicare \nfor a significant proportion of their revenue, they will be \nparticularly hard hit. Some will be forced to close altogether. \nHospitals in rural areas are few and far between. A hospital closing \naffects all rural residents in the vicinity, not just seniors on \nMedicare. Under the GOP plan, these Americans will be forced to drive \nfurther to the nearest hospital, putting lives at risk.\n  As an alternative to closing, rural hospitals could turn to local \nresidents to pay more for services or to pay higher taxes to subsidize \ntheir hospitals. So, taxpayers in rural America will be forced to pay \nmore in order to protect access to health care as well as the quality \nof their services. Seniors in rural areas already have a limited choice \nfor doctors and this plan will result in fewer doctors accepting \nMedicare patients or doctors charging seniors more.\n  Also with regard to rural America and agriculture, there are several \nprovisions which have potential hidden costs. The savings from the \nWetlands Reserve Program, for example, do not continue in the years \nbeyond 2002. CBO anticipates that in those years, the program would \nactually be more expensive under this legislation than under current \nlaw. In addition, the removal of the requirement to purchase crop \ninsurance will expose additional farmers to losses from poor weather, \nfloods, and other natural disasters. In the past, Congress has \nresponded to such events with supplemental appropriations for disaster \nrelief. The removal of the crop insurance requirement provides budget \nsavings for reconciliation but undermines a key element of last year's \ncrop insurance reforms, which were intended to end the temptation for \nCongress to pass costly disaster assistance bills. If our past \nexperience is any guide, the end result will be even higher Federal \nspending.\n  I am also deeply dismayed over the $10.8 billion cuts in student \nloans, most of which will come out of students' and parents' pockets \nthrough higher interest payments. Each school would be required to pay \na 0.85 percent fee on the amount of Federal loans made for students \nattending the school. This would \n\n[[Page S15651]]\n\nundoubtedly be passed on to the students in some form. It would cap the \ndirect lending program at 20 percent of student loan volume. Rather \nthan saving money, this change would only produce paper savings as a \nresult of new scoring rules adopted by the majority.\n  Mr. President, in this Nation, we have prided ourselves on the \nquality and accessibility of our system of higher education. Today, \nthrough student loans, Pell grants, work-study, and other programs, \nvirtually every person who wants to attend college is able to do so. We \nhave made the correct decision that economic circumstances should not \nprevent a bright, young mind from being able to obtain a college degree \nif that is what they want to pursue. Why on Earth would we want to \nretreat from that commitment by making higher education less accessible \nto millions of academically qualified students? The bottom line is that \nto the vast majority of families who depend on student loans to pay \ntuition, slashing student loans will mean the difference between \nenrolling their children in college and not sending them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to discuss my concerns over the \nchanges to the earned income tax credit, which former President Reagan \nonce described this way: ``The EITC is the best anti-poverty, the best \npro-family, the best job-creation measure to come out of Congress.'' \nRepublicans in the Senate as well have supported the EITC for many \nyears.\n  The plan before us dramatically increases taxes on the working poor \nby scaling back the EITC that so many Republicans have strongly \nsupported in the past. The plan increases taxes by $43 billion over the \nnext 7 years. This means an immediate $281 average tax increase on 17 \nmillion low-income American taxpayers. By the year 2005, 21 percent of \nall families currently eligible for the EITC would no longer be \neligible. While its supporters praise hard work and self-reliance, \ntheir plan will make life more difficult for millions working in \ndemanding, low-paying jobs.\n  In 1993, when the EITC was expanded, the Treasury Department \nestimated that approximately 374,700 Alabama families would qualify for \na financial break under the plan. Actually, almost 388,000 families \nultimately qualified under the EITC, a total of 22 percent of the \nentire returns filed. If this plan is adopted, these hundreds of \nthousands of families and millions of others across the country will \nsee this benefit evaporate. Approximately 17 million low-income working \nAmericans will see an immediate tax increase averaging $302; that tax \nincrease will grow to an average of $471 per year by 2005. Treasury \nSecretary Robert Rubin has stated: ``Low-income working families will \nsuffer if the Senate Finance Committee's cut to the earned income tax \ncredit becomes law. It is fundamentally unwise to raise income taxes on \nAmerica's working families while high-income taxpayers are receiving \nthe benefits of a tax cut.''\n  As I stated before, this reconciliation package's priorities are \nmisplaced, its effects unfair, and its assumptions dubious. In its \ncurrent form, it will and should be vetoed. We should and will be \nforced to start over after the veto. It would be to our benefit and the \nbenefit of the American people to return this legislative bitter pill \nback to its container now and come up with a plan that is equitable and \nthat gets the job done the right way.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to take a moment from our time, if I \nmight, to thank both my friend from Alabama and my friend from \nArkansas, who preceded the Senator from Alabama, for excellent remarks.\n  The Senator from Alabama is the former chief justice of that State. I \nhave served with the distinguished Senator from Arkansas since 1971 \nwhen we both were elected and began service to our States as Governors. \nThey are extremely talented and dedicated people. I want to thank them \nfor their excellent comments to try and recognize the serious problems \nwith this budget bill that I addressed at some length at the beginning \nof the morning, about 10:30 this morning.\n  To all I want to say that while I am disappointed that we have not \nhad a single vote yet, I advise all that some progress is being made, \nand I suspect that in the possibly not too distant future we may have \nsome kind of an announcement by the majority leader and the minority \nleader, or the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, who \nis on the floor, and we can maybe move more progressively ahead and \nstop the talking and start the voting.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, are we just open-ended on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is off the resolution, so the Senator \ncan yield time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Three minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the junior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nyielding. I wanted to ask a question of the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas when he was very eloquently expressing his position. He was \nunable to yield to me.\n  What I was going to ask him is, I heard him state several times on \nthe floor of this body the tax reductions that took place under the \nReagan administration. There is a fact that has to be stated at this \ntime, every time someone talks about that, and that is the total \nrevenues for marginal rates in 1980 amounted to $244 billion; in 1990, \nfrom the marginal rates that had been decreased, the total tax amounted \nto $466 billion. In other words, we almost doubled the revenue during \nthat 10-year period, and what happened during that period, as was \npointed out by the Senator from Arkansas, is that we had the most \nsignificant tax reductions during that period of time. In other words, \nwe increased revenue by reducing taxes, and that has gotten lost in \nthis debate somehow.\n  Then another observation I had after listening to the Senator from \nArkansas was that those same individuals who are fighting the tax \nreduction that we are proposing in this resolution are the same ones \nthat supported the largest tax increase in the history of America, as \nit was characterized by not a conservative Republican, Jim Inhofe, but \nby the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1993: The Clinton \ntax increase was the largest single tax increase in the history of \nAmerica or the history of public finance.\n  Who are the ones who voted for that? Those individuals who voted for \nthat tax increase were the big spenders as ranked by the National \nTaxpayers Union, National Tax Limitation Committee and all of the other \norganizations that ranked big spenders in Congress.\n  So you had the big spenders who were for a tax increase at that time. \nAll we are trying to do is say, ``Mr. President, you made a mistake \nback in 1993 by passing a big tax increase. We want to repeal some of \nthat tax increase.''\n  So the same individuals that are opposing our reduction in taxes now, \nto give some of the taxes back to individuals in America, are the ones \nwho were supporting a major tax increase.\n  The last thing I want to mention is that those individuals who in \n1993 supported the huge tax increases, a very large percentage of them \nare not around to vote today because those who came up for reelection \nduring the 1994 election, when that was the major issue in their \ncampaign, were defeated. We have shown that with charts on the floor \nmany times before.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nRockefeller motion and the amendment thereto be laid aside in the \nstatus quo and that I may be recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n[[Page S15652]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2950\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for beneficiary incentive programs)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2950.\n       At the end of chapter 6 of title VII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . BENEFICIARY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Program to Collect Information on Fraud and Abuse.--\n       (1) Establishment of program.--Not later than 3 months \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (hereinafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a program \n     under which the Secretary shall encourage individuals to \n     report to the Secretary information on individuals and \n     entities who are engaging or who have engaged in acts or \n     omissions which constitute grounds for the imposition of a \n     sanction under section 1128, section 1128A, or section 1128B \n     of the Social Security Act, or who have otherwise engaged in \n     fraud and abuse against the medicare program for which there \n     is a sanction provided under law. The program shall \n     discourage provision of, and not consider, information which \n     is frivolous or otherwise not relevant or material to the \n     imposition of such a sanction.\n       (2) Payment of portion of amounts collected.--If an \n     individual reports information to the Secretary under the \n     program established under paragraph (1) which serves as the \n     basis for the collection by the Secretary or the Attorney \n     General of any amount of at least $100 (other than any amount \n     paid as a penalty under section 1128B of the Social Security \n     Act), the Secretary may pay a portion of the amount collected \n     to the individual (under procedures similar to those \n     applicable under section 7623 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to payments to individuals providing information on \n     violations of such Code).\n       (b) Program to Collect Information on Program Efficiency.--\n       (1) Establishment of program.--Not later than 3 months \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall establish a program under which the Secretary shall \n     encourage individuals to submit to the Secretary suggestions \n     on methods to improve the efficiency of the medicare program.\n       (2) Payment of portion of program savings.--If an \n     individual submits a suggestion to the Secretary under the \n     program established under paragraph (1) which is adopted by \n     the Secretary and which results in savings to the program, \n     the Secretary may make a payment to the individual of such \n     amount as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on our time, I know a lot of Senators \nare in their offices and are wondering what we are doing. They have a \nright to wonder. I will explain that we had an understanding with the \nDemocratic leadership that we would set aside in a status quo the \nprevious motion to recommit and the amendment to it, leave it in a \nstatus quo format, and proceed to another amendment.\n  The other amendment is the amendment that Senator Abraham offered. It \nis being reviewed, but I believe we ought to proceed with it. Why are \nwe doing this? I think everyone knows that, since shortly before noon, \nwe have been working with the Democratic leadership, and they have been \nworking very hard, from what I can tell--and I truly believe that--to \nsee if we cannot narrow down the number of amendments and establish \nsome process which will be more orderly than just waiting until the end \nand having hundreds of amendments just offered. We are working on that, \nand we have not yet reached an agreement. We have agreed to take up the \nAbraham amendment in the normal course. We will take an hour, and that \nside can take what time they need. This will give us some time to \nfurther our negotiations, which will continue in a very lively manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the chairman of the Budget Committee answer a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. FORD. As I understand it, we have a motion before the Senate and \nthen we have a first-degree amendment. We do not have an amendment in \nthe second degree here; is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a motion to recommit.\n  Mr. FORD. And then we have an amendment in the first degree. We have \nused up all of the time allotted, unless we get unanimous consent on \nboth of those; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. We have set both of those aside in this agreement here, and \nwe have an amendment in the first degree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which is totally separate and distinct, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Now, this amendment has 2 hours. At the end of the 2-hour \nperiod, an amendment in the second degree, which would have an hour, \nwould be in order; is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Budget Committee chairman yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. EXON. If I have understood what you have said, this is a \nRepublican amendment, and 1 hour is allocated on that side and 1 hour \non this side. If this side of the aisle only uses 5, 10, 15, or 20 \nminutes, then we would only be charged with that on our total 10-hour \nallotment; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What would happen, Senator, is 1 hour and 10 minutes is \ncharged against the bill if you use 10 minutes and we start from that \npoint to allot time again; if you used an hour and we use 10 minutes, 1 \nhour and 10 minutes would be charged against the total hours of the \nbill and we start from that new point.\n  That is no different than it has been forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is divided equally in that case.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thereafter, the time is divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is allocated equally.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is a different way of saying what I said.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the question is, What happens if the \nDemocrats just take 10 minutes? They lose half of 50 minutes, which is \n25 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. So we are caught in the dilemma here now that if the \nRepublicans take a full hour and we do not take but say 10 minutes, \nthen we lose 25 minutes of which they could get on the next amendment.\n  It seems like there ought to be some other way. If we did not want to \nuse our time or the Republican side did not want to use their time, we \ncould save that for an amendment we would like. But the rules are the \nrules, and I understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe I ought to clarify it.\n  I think I expressed it my way but I would rather express it this way: \nIt has been the rule since we had reconciliation on the floor in the \nSenate that whatever amount of time is used on an amendment by both \nsides is charged equally to both sides.\n  Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I told that to the distinguished Senator yesterday. We \nwere discussing it. We are not changing a thing here. The shoe is on \nboth sides. Sometimes it works the other way. It has worked both ways \nin the times I have managed the bills.\n  It will come out all right in the end. You will have your amendments, \nfrom what I can tell. We can use more time this way.\n  Mr. EXON. If I might just add some editorial comment here, the \nproblem that we have is that at 9 o'clock this morning I was in the \nfirst meeting. We have been meeting and talking and advising and \ncajoling now going on almost 12 hours.\n  The point I make is that I think it is time we start voting. I simply \nsay that the delaying tactics thus far are just cutting down the time \nthat I think we would like to use on this side of the aisle on several \nvery key, very important amendments.\n  I am not saying that the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nMichigan is not an important one. It \n\n[[Page S15653]]\n\nprobably is. But compared with the many amendments we have ready to \noffer and want to vote on this side--another way of saying this, I am \nvery much disturbed by the fact we are continuing to use up the time.\n  We only have a total of 20 hours to debate the most far-reaching \nreconciliation bill, maybe the most far-reaching bill that has ever \nbeen presented to the U.S. Senate, when you consider all of its \nimplications.\n  I recognize we may be playing by the rules but the rules in this \nparticular instance might not be fair. I appeal once again as one who \nhas worked on this all day long, I wish we could start voting up or \ndown on the important amendments.\n  I do not believe that we should or could under the dictates of the \n20-hour maximum limit, that we should be taking an hour on each side to \ndebate the amendment that is being offered by the Senator from \nMichigan. It may be something, when I know more, that I will fully vote \nfor.\n  I think time is wasting and I wanted to make that point. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to say I think we have explained that we \nare using the time usefully. We are using the time usefully to try to \nmake a better arrangement for the rest of the bill. We ought to be \nthrough with that soon.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk \nwhich has been read.\n  Mr. President, the savings necessary to rescue the Medicare program \nfrom bankruptcy will not be found solely through eliminating waste, \nfraud and abuse. Nevertheless, I believe it is incumbent upon us to \ndiligently pursue and root out every vestige of inefficiency in the \nsystem.\n  Therefore, I am offering this amendment which I think will produce \nadditional vigilance in the ballots against Medicare waste and fraud. \nThis amendment calls on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nestablish programs that enlist Medicare beneficiaries in our efforts to \neliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare system.\n  These beneficiary incentive programs, as they would be called, would \ncome in two forms: One program would reward individuals who report \nfraudulent activities; the other program would reward individual \nbeneficiaries for suggestions they make which result in greater \nefficiency and overall savings to the program.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services would be responsible for \nsetting up each program and for providing financial remuneration to \nthose individuals reporting instances of tangible fraud and waste.\n  The Senate Finance Committee's reconciliation package currently does \nnot contain a beneficiary incentive program or provision. The amendment \nI offer would include in the Senate reconciliation bill language which \nis similar to that currently in the House proposal.\n  It is difficult to explain to Medicare beneficiaries why dramatic \nchanges in the program are necessary to keep it from going bankrupt \nwhen many of these same individuals have firsthand experience with \nwaste and fraud in the system.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in my own State we recently had an incident \nwhere a Congressman had a constituent come to him with an overcharging \nof something in the vicinity of $400,000 that was made in error. \nNevertheless, it has been paid.\n  Those kind of circumstances make at least my constituents who are \npart of the Medicare Program frustrated, angry, and especially \nconcerned when they hear about changes we are making in the program. \nThey do not want to see us just address the growth issues or just the \nsolvency issues. They also want us to address the problems they see \nevery day with fraud, waste, and abuse in the program.\n  That, in my judgment, has to be addressed in our bill. That is why I \noffered this amendment.\n  If our efforts at Medicare reform are to succeed we must demonstrate \nour seriousness about ending these abuses. I believe enlisting the aid \nof Medicare beneficiaries, showing our resolve to combat the problem \ncan prove to be a valuable asset in exposing and eliminating waste and \nfraud from the system.\n  Just to clarify, Mr. President, my amendment authorizes the Secretary \nof HHS to within 3 months establish two separate programs, one which \nwould basically be called a beneficiary incentive program designed to \nallow seniors to report fraud, waste and so on, and if the fraud is \nsignificant, allow the Secretary to provide a financial reward to the \nindividual who reports it.\n  The second program, also designed to allow Medicare beneficiaries to \nbenefit from ideas and suggestions in improving the program, would \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries awards for providing us with \nrecommendations specifically to the Secretary of HHS for improvements \nto the Medicare Program by way of promoting greater efficiency. Once \nagain, if the savings are significant, the Secretary of HHS may provide \na financial award to the individual whose recommendation was submitted.\n  Mr. President, we are addressing the growth of Medicare and its \nexpense in many different ways in this legislation. I think a key \ncomponent in the long-term control of those costs has to be ferreting \nout this abuse and waste.\n  I believe this amendment, as part of a package of similar reform, can \nmake a significant impact in reducing those kind of costs that stem \nfrom either inefficiencies in the program or fraud or mismanagement in \nthe program.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment tonight and I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, all day I have listened attentively to \nboth sides of this debate. Increasingly, I have grown deeply saddened \nbecause I see the polarization that is taking place between the two \nsides of the aisle. I tried to reflect on the profound impact this bill \nwill have on people, specifically, the 32 million people in the State \nof California.\n  In a sense, it is ironic that this bill is called a \n``reconciliation'' bill, for in reality, other than in Washington-\nspeak, it is far from a reconciliation that we have here on the floor \ntoday.\n  If one just looks at the size of the Medicaid and Medicare cuts, one \ncannot help but be staggered by what its impact will likely be. \nOverall, the $450 billion cut in Medicaid and Medicare, would affect my \nState of California to the tune of $54 billion in losses during the \nnext 7 years. That breaks down as $36 billion in Medicare cuts and $18 \nbillion in Medicaid cuts. Those cuts will have an enormous impact on \nthe people of California.\n  Let me give you an example of this bill's harsh consequences. In \nCalifornia, 15 percent of the current Medicare recipients are also \nreceiving Medicaid. That is 540,000 of the poorest seniors in the State \nof California. They need Medicaid to meet their Medicare premiums and \ncopayments. Premiums are being doubled and, under the bill, they will \nnot have the assistance of Medicaid. What is, obviously, the likely \nresult? Without Medicaid to assist these seniors meet their payments, \nmany will lose their benefits and be placed at higher risk.\n  Further, for people suffering with HIV/AIDS, Medicaid is the most \nimportant program in the Nation. With these Medicaid cuts, what \nhappens? It puts added stress on the public hospital, the county \nhospitals, in the State.\n  So let's turn and look and see what is happening to the county \nhospital. In the 58 counties of my State, county hospitals--like San \nFrancisco General in San Francisco or Martin Luther King, Jr., General \nin Los Angeles, will lose an estimated $150 million over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Now let's turn to the great teaching hospitals in my State. The \nUniversity of California system is a great system, probably the best in \nthe world, with five great, major teaching hospitals. They are \nprojected to lose $444 million over the next 7 years.\n  In a letter from the university system, they inform me that, for the \nfirst time in history, the University of California's teaching \nhospitals will go into deficit.\n  Great teaching hospitals going into deficit.\n  Public hospitals not being able to keep up.\n  Medicaid cuts that will prevent the poorest in our Nation from being \nable to use Medicare.\n  I really had to ask myself the question--is it really necessary to do \nit this way? This is where the bill becomes, I \n\n[[Page S15654]]\n\nmust honestly say, immoral. Because the answer to the question has to \nbe, no, it is not necessary.\n  When you add it all up, you know that these cuts are as deep as they \nare for one reason, and one reason alone--to provide an enormous tax \ncut in this bill, while the poor get hit hard by the changes in the \nearned income tax credit.\n  I am one Democrat who supports a cut in capital gains, but not on the \nbacks of poor people. It is simply not what we are supposed to do--\neither party, Republican or Democrat.\n  I have a basic philosophical belief. What Government should do is \nthose things that the private sector cannot do. So Medicare and \nMedicaid are an important part of that philosophy. To take these deep \ncuts at this time, all at once, without any hearings or full knowledge \nof how these cuts will fall?\n  What does happen to the five great teaching hospitals?\n  When do they have a chance to give testimony and indicate what they \ncan or what they cannot save? What does happen to 540,000 seniors who \ndepend upon Medicaid to make their Medicare premium and copayments? \nWhat happens to them? We have not discussed it. Nobody knows.\n  What happens to the county hospitals, already cut deeply, the major \nproviders of indigent care in many areas across California? The DSH \npayments are not going to be enough. What happens to the affected AIDS/\nHIV community, more dependent on Medicaid than any other single \nprogram?\n  These are questions that deserve a hearing. These are questions that \ndeserve the wisdom of both parties sitting down and working it out.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to see the Senator from Arizona in the \nchair, because we just had an example of where we can work together. He \nand I both know that the majority leader, and you as a major author, \ndid not have to compromise on the Jerusalem bill we recently considered \non the floor.\n  You had the votes to do it without it. And, yet, your feeling was--\nand I think correctly so--that it would be a better bill, with less \ndivisiveness, if we sat down and tried to work out our differences. \nAnd, Mr. President, you and I and others sat down at least twice and we \nworked out our differences and we were able to produce a bill that got \nall but five votes in this esteemed body.\n  I really think that is the way our people--those people who elected \nus--think that is what they elected us to do. They didn't elect us to \nbe so partisan that we drive a divisive wedge into two of the most \nimportant programs, Medicaid and Medicare, that touch human lives in \nthis country.\n  I will tell you honestly--God strike me dead if it is wrong--I do not \nknow how the State of California is going to cope with these cuts. They \nare deep, they are wide and they are enormous for a State that has a \ngrowing poor population, that is the site of 40 percent of all of the \nforeign born, that has more illegal immigrants in it than all the other \nStates, combined, and has probably the largest number of needy people.\n  We recently considered welfare reform on the Senate floor. I voted \nfor welfare reform, yet welfare reform is a $7 billion cut to \nCalifornia--no question--by any independent analyses. I voted for it \nbecause I felt there was a redeeming value in making the necessary \nchanges and moving off chronic dependency.\n  Yet, how can I vote for this budget bill and show up back in \nCalifornia when I know the reason the cuts are so deep is simply to \ngive a tax cut?\n  Who benefits?\n  My husband is a merchant banker. He deals in this kind of financial \narea. He would love to have a capital gains cut. He pays major income \ntaxes. They went up in 1993, just like 275,000 other families out of 13 \nmillion taxpayers in the State of California.\n  But does he want to get a capital gains cut under these conditions? \nAnybody can call him and he will say no. It is morally wrong. It is not \nright to do it this way. And that is the gut-level problem that I have \nwith this bill that so saddens me.\n  The Republican Party has been known as the party that is most \nconcerned about the national debt. True, we have a national debt of \n$4.9 trillion, which has developed, largely, over the past 25 years. \nBut this budget bill will add to the deficit over its 7 years. Under \nthis bill, the Nation's debt will increase by about $670 billion over \nthe next 7 years--about $245 billion more than if no tax cut is \nenacted. This is not fiscally responsible action.\n  Further, I recently learned that June O'Neill of the Congressional \nBudget Office reports that, if off-budget items, such as Social \nSecurity, where not incorporated into the deficit calculation, the \nbudget would show a $105 billion deficit in 2002 under the Republican \nleadership's plan, not the balanced budget they claim. Now is not the \ntime for an excessive, and misdirected, tax cut.\n  The current deficit is $160 billion and that is too high and needs to \nbe eliminated. But the deficit has been as high as $290 billion only a \nfew years ago. True, the deficit picks up in the outyears of this \ndecade. And true, Medicaid and Medicare are partially responsible for \nit and need to be changed.\n  I will support changes in these programs, like an age of eligibility \nchange. I will support means testing of premiums, not because I want \nto, but because I believe it has to be done.\n  But to take the cuts this way, for the purpose of being able to \nrationalize a tax cut directing billions to the investment banker types \nof this country, is absolutely wrong. It is morally wrong.\n  And to go back to California and tell senior citizens, some of whom, \nin my State are eating dog food--true story, eating dog food, and using \nMedicaid to pay their premiums, is something I cannot accept. The lower \nyou are on the economic ladder the more difficult it is.\n  I am sure I have exceeded my time. I apologize. I got a bit wound up. \nBut I think it suffices to say that I do not know how anyone can vote \nfor this bill and return to their people and say, ``You are not going \nto be hurt by it.'' I know I cannot.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague from \nthe State of California for a very excellent statement, and, as usual, \nshe puts it into perspective so we can all understand it. I think the \npersonal remark that she made with regard to her husband should set the \ntone of understanding that I think is very lacking on the budget \nreconciliation document that we have been addressing and that I \naddressed along similar lines this morning.\n  Mr. President, I would simply like to say that, subject to their \nrecognition by the Chair, I yield 10 minutes, first to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, and followed by that 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, several Members, Republicans and Democrats, have come \nto the floor and have decided to use the bipartisan Entitlement \nCommission--actually established by President Clinton last year--as \neither the basis for supporting the reconciliation agreement or the \nbasis for opposing it. My opposition I must say is reluctant. I would \nlove to be able to join with Senator Gregg, Senator Simpson, and others \nwho participated in this effort and understand that the severity of the \nlong-term problems with entitlements is not just Medicare and Medicaid, \nand other entitlements, but the big one, Social Security. The long-term \nproblem is not something that we can afford to put off. Every year that \nwe wait the problem gets worse.\n  All of us who look at the situation of retirement understand that the \nsooner you begin to plan the less you have to put away.\n  So those that say we will wait until 1997 to deal with Social \nSecurity are not doing beneficiaries any favor. The longer we wait the \nmore severe the problem is, and the more the severe the adjustments we \nhave to make. And we should recognize that when you are dealing with \nretirement or with health care, if there is a requirement to save money \nand accumulate reserves, as there is with our trust funds, that you \nhave to do it over a prolonged period of time.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation agreement does not solve that long- \n\n\n[[Page S15655]]\n\nterm problem. The appropriated accounts this year are about 26 percent \nof the whole budget at the end of the 7-year period. We are seeing a \ndecrease in the appropriated accounts--a continuation. I mean it is the \nmost dramatic chart that we have in the entitlement report. I commend \nit to colleagues who are interested in it, because when you get to the \nback and see what Senator Danforth, I, and Senator Simpson recommended \nyou can see that you are dealing with real tough choices.\n  So I am not objecting to making tough choices. I am not objecting to \nsaying that I will cast a vote for something that might be unpopular. I \nam not going to criticize the Republicans, for example, for choosing to \nincrease the eligibility age. I think it has to be increased. But what \nwe observe is a long-term problem. Again, when you say long-term \nproblem the presumption is that we can wait a long time before we deal \nwith it. You cannot because the longer you wait the more serious the \nissue becomes.\n  Mr. President, I want Members to understand that there are facts here \nin the Entitlement Commission report, as well as recommendations in the \nEntitlement Commission, that I believe need to be considered. I regret \nthe President did not take those recommendations and make it a part of \nhis budget. I think we would be in a different shape right now, if, in \nfact, the observations of the recommendations of the Entitlement \nCommission were accepted by the administration. But they were not. But \nthere is still bipartisan support for action, and a willingness to risk \npolitical careers using facts and using the truth, and hoping the \nAmerican people trust that we have to make change.\n  In short, Mr. President, the goal for us in this exercise cannot just \nbe to balance the budget because, if all we do is balance the budget, \nwe have other problems that will still need to be addressed. I have \nidentified a second one.\n  The second one is the growing cost of entitlements as a percent of \nour Federal budget. With all the rhetoric on both sides of the issue, \nthe amount of money that the Congress extracts from the U.S. economy \nhas remained relatively constant over the last 50 years. It went up \nduring World War II, and it went up during the Vietnam war, but it \nremained roughly 19 percent of GDP. It is unlikely that is going to \nchange. It is likely that is going to remain the same even with the \nproposal to reduce taxes that is in this piece of legislation. It \nreally does not make a dent in that. You are still going to be pulling \nabout 19 percent of GDP. That means the more that we allocate for \nmandated programs the less we have; not just for defense but for \nnondefense appropriations accounts. It severely restricts our ability \nto build roads, our ability to educate our people, to do training, and \nto do things that I think Republicans and Democrats can agree need to \noccur.\n  So not only do we need to balance the budget but we need to interrupt \nthis trend where America is moving in a direction which our Federal \nGovernment is moving in--a direction of becoming an ATM machine. Again, \ntime is not on our side. You may say, ``Oh, my gosh. I do not want to \nincrease the eligibility age because that will make me unpopular. I do \nnot want to deal with Social Security because it is too \ncontroversial.'' But we have to.\n  We have obligations on the table right now that we cannot meet. We \ncan meet them over the next 5 or 6 years. We are not going to be able \nto meet them long term.\n  The flaw in the Republican proposal, in my opinion, comes from the \nneed to satisfy a relatively small number of people that campaigned on \na promise to reduce taxes. It is the tax cut that makes it imperative \nto get more over the short term and less over the long term. That is \nwhy I think this thing may have run aground. But Americans should not \nsuffer under the illusion that is there is an absence of bipartisan \nwillingness to look at the future, and say, ``We are going to change \nour laws so as to change that future.'' Not only should we be moving \ntoward the balanced budget, but, second, we need to get consensus that \nwe are going to cap all entitlement programs at a fixed percent of our \nbudget--64 percent this year. I would be thrilled to get an agreement \non 70 percent instead of the 74 percent that it is going to be in the \nyear 2002.\n  Third, Mr. President, I have strong objections to this proposal \nbecause instead of building a new safety net for a changed economy, \nwhich I think we need, we are saying as businesses are downsized they \nbecome more productive, and more competitive. But as they do it \ndictates that we examine our safety net and build a different one. I \nthink on the top of the list, if you are trying to rebuild a safety \nnet, is to change the way we establish eligibility for health insurance \nin this country. And rather than saying we are going to just change \nMedicare and reform Medicare, we ought to be reforming Medicare, \nMedicaid, the income tax deduction, and the VA system--establishing a \nsimplified system of eligibility saying, if you are an American and a \nlegal resident, you are in but you have to participate personally in \ncontrols. We are not going to subsidize you, if you do not need to be. \nWe have to, rather than block granting for budgetary reasons, have a \nnew safety net.\n  If we want to remain an aggressive market economy where our \nbusinesses have an incentive to maintain their productive edge, we have \nto have a safety net that enables people when they find themselves out \nof work to still know that they have health insurance, and still know \nthat they are going to be able to pay the medical bills.\n  I was down in Texas over the weekend and discovered in the State of \nTexas, a relatively conservative State, that 50 percent of all babies \ndelivered in the State of Texas are paid for by Medicaid--Medicaid, Mr. \nPresident. This is supposed to be a poverty program, and it is supposed \nto be a minimal safety net.\n  The reason that it is increasingly being used by working people is \nthat we do not have a very good and a very flexible program. We are \nsaying, as many Republicans have come to the floor and said, there is \nsomething wrong when I have working people without insurance paying a \n2.9 percent payroll tax to fund health care programs for some that can \nafford to pay the bills. There is something wrong with that.\n  But to reconstruct the health care safety net, we cannot just adjust \nthe payment system in Medicare. We cannot just block grant Medicaid. We \nought to be saying let us re-establish a fundamentally different way of \nbecoming eligible for health care, and then let us make sure subsidies \ngo to those who need it, and make sure we provide people with the basis \nas well, as both Republicans and Democrats have talked about, and \naccumulating the resources to be able to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, if this proposal in addition to balancing the budget \nfixes the cost of entitlements, instead of the Republicans looking \nacross the aisle and saying we are in the majority, we have looked at \nthis Entitlement Commission report, we agree, we have to control the \ncost of entitlements, here is the proposal to fix it--if the \nRepublicans had said we now come to the table in an understanding that, \nas well as the market working right now to control the cost of health \ncare, there are some individuals that are not going to be able to \npurchase it, that is the basis for Republicans supporting Medicare.\n  We understand that after 65, a lot of people cannot afford to pay the \nbills because health care gets more expensive. Well, if it is true for \n75-year-old people, it is also true for 25-year-old people in the work \nforce. We ought not just be changing Medicare to save money. We ought \nto reform our health care system so that every single American knows \nwith certainty they are going to be covered.\n  If the Republican proposal did those three things at a minimum, then \nI would be standing here as a Democrat supporting it. I would love to \nbe able to get to that point. I know there are many people on the other \nside of the aisle very uncomfortable with the tax cuts, very \nuncomfortable in particular with the Joint Tax Committee that has \ndisclosed to Americans that every single person with a family income of \n$30,000 or under is going to have a tax increase. I know they are not \ncomfortable about that and would prefer to have it changed. I know they \nunderstand that the entitlements are a problem, that we have to do \nmore, not less, \n\n[[Page S15656]]\n\nif we expect to have the resources to invest in our future.\n  I know there is the basis to produce a bipartisan reconciliation bill \nthat we could send on to the President hopefully for his signature.\n  Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the direction we are \nheading. Unfortunately, we appear to be heading in a direction where we \nare going to sort of rigidly hold on, have a minimum amount of debate, \nlimit the number of amendments offered, pass legislation for the short \nterm and hope the people do not discover we left the long-term problem \nin place; that we have constructed a safety net that is not adequate \nfor the kind of market economy we face today and unfortunately will \nhave left our children, rather than blessed in the future, still cursed \nby an insufficient amount of investment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  I am just going to speak a very few moments on a subject that is and \nhas been very near and dear to my heart during my entire period, you \nmight say, in the field of public life. It relates to nursing home \nstandards, Mr. President.\n  The legislation that we are considering tonight in this Chamber--I do \nnot know how many thousands of pages, about 2,000, I think--includes \nwhat we might think of as just about everything, that nothing was \nforgotten, nothing was left out, nothing was omitted from the budget \nreconciliation bill that we are considering this Wednesday evening in \nthe Senate. But there is something very critical left out of the budget \nreconciliation brought to us by our friends from the other side of the \naisle. What was left out, what is notably absent is any Federal \nnational nursing home standards.\n  Mr. President, only this week, in Time magazine, we see a remarkable \narticle entitled ``Back to the Dark Ages,'' which predicts what is \ngoing to happen in the American nursing home to some 2 million \nresidents if we totally do away with Federal standards.\n  Mr. President, it was in 1987 when the late John Heinz, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, the former Senator from Maine, Senator Mitchell, and \nmany of us joined on this side of the aisle with our friends on the \nother side of the aisle to enact for the first time Federal standards \nfor nursing homes.\n  If I might, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the \nRecord this article from Time magazine.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Back to the Dark Ages\n\n                         (By Margaret Carlson)\n\n       Anyone pondering his or her sunset years will remember the \n     expose of the shocking conditions in nursing homes circa \n     1970. Woefully undertrained workers strapped patients to \n     hard-backed chairs, fed them cheap diets and kept them in a \n     whimpering state of sedation. There were tales of urine-\n     soaked hospital gowns and of false teeth collected at night \n     and thrown into a communal vessel that patients had to fish \n     through in the morning. All this and more was documented by \n     the National Academy of Sciences in 1986. The next year \n     Congress passed legislation to address decades of abuse of \n     the elderly by profiteering nursing-home operators.\n       But in the blink of an eye these days, a carefully built \n     construct of regulations can be blown away without so much as \n     a formal hearing. As part of a crusade to curb federal \n     authority, and with only a simple assertion that the \n     regulations are burdensome, two congressional committees have \n     sent to the floor for a vote this week legislation that would \n     repeal federal standards. There would be no protection \n     against patients being restrained, no standards on staffing \n     or when someone could be discharged after using up all his or \n     her money. Niceties like nurses would be optional, since \n     there is no requirement in the new legislation that a \n     licensed nurse be present. Instead there would be so-called \n     patient rights--to receive mail, keep personal belongings and \n     be free from abuse and forced labor--rights that may \n     duplicate, but do not exceed, the Geneva Conventions for \n     prisoners of war.\n       Republicans justify the changes by saying the states know \n     best how to run nursing homes. Of course, it was the failure \n     of state regulation that got the reforms passed in the first \n     place. It is unlikely that with $182 billion less in federal \n     Medicaid money over seven years the states will embrace high-\n     quality care. The market solution would be to replace that \n     nurse's aide at $10 an hour with an unskilled worker at $5 \n     and to substitute thin soup and macaroni for meat and \n     vegetables.\n       In fact, it turns out that being humane actually saves \n     money. Catherine Hawes of the nonprofit Research Triangle \n     Institute estimated that after the 1987 reform legislation \n     was passed, $2 billion was saved by 269 nursing homes from \n     fewer emergency hospitalizations, less malnutrition, a 30% \n     decrease in the use of catheters and a 25% reduction in the \n     use of restraints. Says Sarah Burger of the National Citizens \n     Coalition for Nursing Home Reform: ``Operators didn't know \n     until they were forced to stop doing it that the main cause \n     of incontinence and bedsores is being restrained and not \n     being able to get to the bathroom.'' But wholesale budget \n     slashing will no doubt pressure some facilities to cut \n     corners. Senator William Cohen of Maine, one of the few \n     Republicans to oppose the rollback, warns, ``If we weaken \n     federal enforcement, we will be sent back to the dark days of \n     substandard nursing homes, with millions of elderly at \n     risk.''\n       Republicans may have entered the slaphappy phase of their \n     revolution, killing regulations simply because they can. \n     Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for \n     regulatory relief, in part because it would allow \n     unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of \n     them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about \n     sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing \n     homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I shall read only one sentence. ``Indeed, the nursing home \nindustry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it \nwould allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all \nof them.''\n  Mr. President, that is going to be exactly the status of the \nresidents who are living today in the American nursing home.\n  First, I would like, if I might, to show our colleagues the projected \ngrowth in the nursing home population. Today, we have approximately 2 \nmillion residents in American nursing homes. By the year 2003, just a \nfew years from now, we are going to see 4.3 million American citizens \nresiding in American nursing homes. In fact, most of the people who \nreach the age of 65 are going to be in this category. They are going to \nbe living in a nursing home.\n  I can only imagine. If the 2 million nursing home residents in this \ncountry could be surveyed or polled on how they felt about removing all \nFederal nursing home standards, it does not take a great amount of \nimagination to know what the results would be. Of course, in \noverwhelming numbers, undoubtedly, they would vote to continue these \npresent Federal standards.\n  For example, the choice of a physician, the care and the treatment in \nchoosing a physician, the freedom from chemical and physical \nrestraints, is this something that our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle want to remove? Just last week in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, on a vote of 10 to 10, every Democrat voted for retention of \nthese Federal standards, every Republican except one, Senator Chafee of \nRhode Island, voted to eliminate all Federal standards in nursing \nhomes.\n  What about the issue, Mr. President, of privacy in receiving mail and \ncommunications? What about the confidentiality of medical records? What \nabout the protection from unwarranted transfer to another nursing home \nor discharge in the middle of the night from the particular nursing \nhome the resident finds himself or herself in?\n  Mr. President, another chart indicates something that I think is \nextremely dramatic and once again indicates the real need for us to \nretain at least the minimum of Federal standards for nursing homes. \nLook at the characteristics of the nursing home patient or resident \ntoday: 77 percent need help in dressing; 63 percent need help in \ntoileting; 91 percent need help in bathing; 66 percent have a mental \ndisorder. And there is one more figure that did not make it to the \nchart, Mr. President. That is that over 70 percent of the patients \ntoday residing in America's nursing homes have no relative and no \nadvocate out there on a daily basis visiting them or advocating their \ncause or trying to support bringing them a better quality of life.\n  Mr. President, there is also a letter being circulated dated October \n24 addressed to our colleague, Senator Dole, making one final plea to \nSenator Dole and all of us in this body to restore these meaningful \nnursing home standards. It is signed by the American Health Care \nAssociation, by the American Association of Homes and Services for the \nAging, by the Catholic Health Association, and down the line.\n\n[[Page S15657]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter all of us received in the \nSenate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As providers of long-term care services, \n     we are concerned that the current Finance Committee proposal \n     to impose a block grant financing mechanism for Medicaid \n     fails to ensure that adequate resources will be made \n     available to meet the needs of our nation's elderly, \n     disabled, and infirm. We fear that the proposed annual \n     increases in federal Medicaid funding for state programs will \n     be insufficient to meet the quality of care needed by \n     residents of long-term care facilities and subsequently \n     reduce access to services. Furthermore, the failure to meet \n     the resources needs anticipated in future years for these \n     services will negate the many advances made in this area as a \n     result of the enactment of the nursing home reform provisions \n     of OBRA '87.\n       We urge you to support the retention of federal oversight \n     of nursing home quality linked to a statutory provision \n     ensuring that adequate financial resources are made available \n     to meet prescribed levels of service. Although this linkage \n     can take several forms, the current formulation which backs \n     the nursing home reforms of OBRA '87 to a statutory direction \n     that payors of services (both federal and state) must ensure \n     the payment of adequate rates has proven a workable mechanism \n     and should not be repealed.\n       Federal nursing home reform standards, joined with existing \n     reimbursement standards have resulted in a steady improvement \n     in the quality of long-term care services. Without such a \n     linkage, this quality of care can not be sustained. It is our \n     sincere desire to move forward with the quality of care \n     provided in nursing homes, and recognize that the ability to \n     do so is dependent upon the provision of adequate financial \n     resources.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Health Care Association (AHCA)\n       American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging \n     (AAHA)\n       Catholic Health Association\n       InterHealth\n       Horizon CMS\n       Clinton Village Nursing Home, Oakland, California\n       Qualicare Nursing Home, Detroit, MI\n       Westmoreland Manor, Greensburg, PA\n       Services Employees International Union (SEIU)\n       American Federation of State, County, and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME)\n       United Auto Workers (UAW)\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Statement of Stewart Bainum, Jr., Submitted to the Senate Special \n                  Committee on Aging, October 26, 1995\n\n       As the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Manor Care, \n     Inc., I want to express our strong support for retention of \n     the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987 (OBRA '87). Manor Care \n     owns and operates 170 skilled nursing facilities in 28 \n     states, and provides care to over 20,000 residents.\n       The OBRA '87 reforms represent the most comprehensive \n     revision of nursing home regulations since the inception of \n     the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the sixties. As I \n     recall, the bill was over 1000 pages long, and addressed \n     critical areas of care, such as resident assessment and care \n     planning, nurse aide training and testing, resident rights, \n     nurse staffing ratios, and enforcement. The final product \n     reflected the agreement reached among 60 national \n     organizations, representing consumers, seniors, providers, \n     and state regulators. It was a painstaking process that \n     worked. In fact, OBRA might depict one of the finest \n     collaborative achievements ever in the history of health care \n     legislation.\n       Manor Care proudly supported OBRA in 1987 because the \n     legislation offered a valuable means of protecting and \n     promoting the quality of life for one of the most vulnerable \n     segments of our population. We must afford nursing home \n     residents an environment which is safe and ensures their \n     physical and mental well-being. OBRA '87 has been widely \n     successful in accomplishing this goal.\n       Manor Care pledges to continue to meet these federal \n     quality standards because they are reasonable, and have led \n     to significant improvements in the care delivered to our \n     residents. As a national company, we are supportive of the \n     uniformity and consistency these standards provide across the \n     states.\n       OBRA created a system of care delivery to help guarantee \n     the dignity and respect of institutionalized seniors. Do not \n     undo the valuable work that has been done. We ask that \n     Congress support retention of the Nursing Home Reform Act and \n     its standards. Stated most simply, it is the right thing to \n     do.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, these particular standards which have been \non the books now not even for quite a decade are already paying \ndividends. For example, if we would just look at an additional chart to \nsee what is happening in improved resident outcomes, the maintenance of \nthe ADL function, what it takes to daily exist, we see the pre-OBRA \nfunctional status in the purple, we see the red, the post-OBRA \nfunctional status showing a dramatic increase in the very basic quality \nof life because of these nursing home standards.\n  We look, Mr. President, and see what is happening in improved care \nfor the nursing home resident. ``Decreases in Problem Areas.'' Physical \nrestraints are going down; dehydration is going down; indwelling \nurinary catheters, 29 percent, going down.\n  What we are seeing here, Mr. President, are hard-won gains that we \nare about to eliminate in one fell swoop simply because this particular \nbudget reconciliation does not contain Federal nursing home standards \nto protect the American nursing home resident.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me ask, how would we vote in this body--\nwhen this issue comes before the Senate, how would we vote if we knew \nthat Monday our mother or our father or our son or our daughter or even \nourselves were about to enter a nursing home and become yet another \nstatistic? How would we vote, Mr. President?\n  I ask my colleagues to strongly consider the opportunity, when it \nbecomes available, to retain these basic nursing home standards and to \ncontinue them as a part of the law of this land and the basic \nprotections that we must not take away from these 2 million, and going \nto soon be 4 million, American citizens residing in our nursing homes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  How much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 48\\1/2\\ minutes, \nand the other side has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need to make a few \nbrief comments with regard to my amendment, which I would like to bring \nus back to for a moment.\n  First of all, the issue of fraud and abuse in Medicare is a problem \nthat has been widely recognized by Members of the Senate, and I would \nlike to call attention to several Members who have been actively \nengaged in trying to ferret out these problems so that we might address \nthem in ways such as the amendment I am presenting here tonight.\n  First, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Kyl and \nSenator McCain--Senator McCain in particular, who has worked in this \narea a lot, who has separate legislation, I know, on this topic; and \nhis leadership on this issue has helped to bring it to our attention.\n  More recently, I would also like to acknowledge, and then quote, from \na report, an ongoing, actual effort by Senator Cohen, who is also \nchairman of our Senate Special Committee on Aging, an investigative \nstaff report which he conducted and which was released July 7, 1994. It \nhas identified countless examples of Medicare fraud and abuse, the kind \nof abuse and fraud that, hopefully, this amendment which I have \npresented tonight can address.\n  Without going into all the details at this time--although I may from \ntime to time during the debate mention specific cases--let me just \nfocus on an area that was just touched on by the Senator from Arkansas; \nnamely, the area of nursing homes.\n  The investigative report revealed a considerable number of cases \ninvolving direct targeting of nursing home patients in which both the \nindustries that supply products and services to the homes and the \nowners and administrators of the homes are involved in fraudulent and \nabusive practices.\n\n       Nursing home owners have been convicted of charging \n     personal luxury items like swimming pools to Medicaid cost \n     reports. HCFA, the HHS [inspector general's office], and the \n     Minority committee staff are continuing to investigate \n     nursing homes * * * \n\nas was the case at the time this report was revealed.\n  Let me cite two specific cases.\n\n       A Minnesota speech therapist submitted false claims to \n     Medicare for services provided to nursing home residents. The \n     therapist also received Medicaid payments for speech therapy \n     he never actually performed--and the investigation revealed \n     that he had been paid for services ``rendered to patients'' \n     several days after they had died. He was also observed using \n     flash cards with a blind resident, and then billing for \n     reimbursement.\n\n  Another case:\n\n\n[[Page S15658]]\n\n       The owner of a Pennsylvania rehabilitation service was \n     indicted for allegedly operating a scheme to defraud Medicare \n     by submitting false claims for speech therapy provided to \n     patients in nursing homes. The owner allegedly told speech \n     therapists to recruit Medicare clients even though he knew \n     their therapy would not be covered under Medicare.\n       Before submitting the paperwork for reimbursement, the \n     speech therapists would rewrite their patient reports so that \n     they would appear to be medically necessary rehabilitation \n     services. The employees then allegedly falsified bills \n     submitted to Medicare, including certifications by doctors \n     that patients needed continued speech therapy, and also \n     falsified patients' medical records.\n\n  Mr. President, we can talk about the different problems in the \nnursing home issue, one many of us are concerned about. One of the \nreasons this amendment which I have offered tonight is before us is \nbecause it helps to address some of the problems that do go on in \nnursing homes.\n  I will cite other examples in other contexts in which Medicare fraud \nis running up the costs of Medicare, costs that we should address \nthrough this amendment that I am offering, as well as some of the other \nitems included in the reconciliation bill before us.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I would like to yield 10 minutes of our \nremaining time to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me thank my colleague from Michigan for yielding time \nand say that I rise in strong support of the Abraham amendment.\n  My friend from Michigan said a moment ago that he has many examples \nof constituents who have had firsthand experiences. My guess is that \nthere is not a Member of this body who could not say the same thing. As \nI travel the State of Ohio, I talk to people about the Medicare issue \nand what we need to do, the steps that we will have to take to preserve \nand protect and strengthen Medicare. And people will always talk to me \nabout the fraud, talk to me about abuse. Many times I travel the State. \nAnd they have specific examples. I suspect that every single Member of \nthis body could say the same thing.\n  I have had my staff go through some of the letters that we have \nreceived. Here are just a few of them, people who have written to us, \npeople who I have talked to personally, who have described specific \nincidents that they believe constitute fraud.\n  I think my colleague from Michigan is right on point, because I think \none of the things that we have to do is to enlist the public's help in \nthis effort to deal with the fraud and abuse. It has been my \nexperience, Mr. President, that the American people are generally \nright. And in this particular case, the American people, the people who \nare on Medicare, the children of people who are on Medicare who have \nbeen involved in maybe paying the bills or overseeing some of the \nfinances, they are not wrong. They are right. There is fraud. There is \nabuse. There are things that need to be done.\n  So I would like to congratulate my colleague from Michigan and give \nhim my full support for this particular amendment.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation bill that we are debating tonight \nand will be debating tomorrow, probably also into Friday, has great \nhistoric significance. It has many different parts to it, as has \nalready been pointed out tonight.\n  One of the provisions in this bill that my colleague from Michigan \nmentioned several hours ago when he was on the floor I would also like \nto briefly comment about, and that has to do with the tax credit, the \n$500 tax credit for those couples, those families, who have children. \nThere has been a lot of talk about what this might do to help stimulate \nthe economy, a lot of talk about what impact this has on this \nparticular bill.\n  But I think the main reason, Mr. President, for having this \nprovision, and why so many of us on this floor tonight insisted that \nthis provision be in the bill, is because it is a question of fairness, \nit is a question of equity.\n  If we look at the tax burden that our Government has placed on \nworking men and women and on their families, what we find is that that \nburden has really impacted how people live their lives today. Let me \ngive you a statistic. If you took a family with four children in 1960 \nand compared them with a family of four children in 1995, what you find \nwhen you strip away inflation is that the tax burden on that family has \ngone up in real dollars 220 percent--220 percent. So each one of us has \nconstituents back in our home States who are working second jobs, or \nthird jobs or where the spouse has taken a second job or maybe taken a \nfirst job, who would not do that but for the fact that this tax burden \nhas been imposed on them.\n  And so you have one of the spouses working one job full-time just to \npay the taxes, just to keep the family standard of living where they \nbelieve it should be and to help educate their children. That is the \nperverse impact that the Tax Code has had on families, and the fact \nthat the Tax Code has not, over the years since 1960, for example, kept \nup in any way, shape or form with inflation.\n  What this $500 tax credit does is helps to rectify that injustice and \nbring some equity to the tax system.\n  Mr. President, another major provision of this bill that we have in \nfront of us has to do with welfare. I believe that this bill is an \nessential step toward creating jobs and opportunity for the American \npeople, and I believe that the welfare provision goes a long way in \ndoing that.\n  This particular provision encourages the culture of work instead of \nthe culture of welfare. In the case of the welfare provision, again, \nthere has been a lot of talk about dollars and cents, and those \ncertainly are important. In the long run, I think this provision is \ngoing to save money, but that is really not the main reason it is in \nthis bill.\n  It is really not the most significant thing about this welfare \nprovision, because in this bill, we are changing the culture. In this \nbill, we are turning our back on the last 30 years where what we really \nhave been doing in this society--it has been unintended--but what we \nreally have been doing is keeping people alive. We have been feeding \npeople, we have been keeping them on welfare.\n  I guess we have done a pretty good job in that respect. But what we \nreally should be doing is what we are doing with this bill, and that \nis, moving from a system of welfare, whose goal is to maintain people, \nto a system of welfare whose goal is to help people realize the \nAmerican dream, to help them get themselves off welfare so they can \nfully participate in the great American dream.\n  Let me briefly discuss, if I can, Mr. President, how this bill does \nthis. This bill promotes work, not welfare. It proposes radical change \nbased on the principle that the only way to succeed in reforming \nwelfare is to get welfare out of Washington, DC. We are only going to \nchange welfare when we turn the power back to the local communities, we \nturn the money back to the local communities. Washington, DC, has \ndemonstrated for decades that it cannot reform welfare.\n  The innovation that has occurred in the welfare area in the attempt \nto get people to work has not occurred over the last few years in \nWashington. Where you see the innovation is in the 50 States. The \nStates have truly become the laboratories of democracy. And so what we \nhave seen in the last few years is Governors and State legislatures who \nhave had to petition Washington, have had to come hat in hand to \nWashington and deal with some unelected bureaucrat to ask permission to \nbe bold and innovative and to try a new program back in their home \nState.\n  What we are saying with this bill is enough is enough, we trust the \nStates. That is where the innovation has been. That is where the \nchanges are going to be made. Let us get the money out of Washington, \nget the power out of Washington.\n  Real change is only going to come, Mr. President, at the State level. \nAnd so the thrust of this bill is, as I said, to get the power and the \nmoney and the decisions out of Washington, DC.\n  It will take the States time to fix this broken system. I think we \nhave to be very realistic about this. Welfare did not become a wreck \novernight, and it is not going to be fixed overnight. In fact, it will \nnot get fixed at all if the power course stays here at the Federal \nlevel.\n  The welfare provisions contained in this bill will help accomplish \nthis historic transfer of power away from \n\n[[Page S15659]]\n\nWashington. It will transfer welfare responsibility to the States in \nthe form of block grants.\n  The bill would also establish a tough new uniform work requirement \nfor welfare. Next year, under this legislation, to continue receiving \nblock grant money, States will have to make sure that at least 25 \npercent of the people on welfare are working in return for the benefits \nthat they receive.\n  I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, that percentage will continue to rise \nevery year, and by the year 2000 at least 50 percent of those receiving \nwelfare will have to work.\n  The only long-term solution to welfare is work. This reconciliation \nbill recognizes this basic commonsense fact.\n  I am especially pleased by some of the improvements we were able to \nmake during floor consideration of the bill. We established, when we \nwere debating the welfare bill, a rainy-day fund to help cover economic \nemergencies, creating a grant fund of Federal money that will help tide \nStates over in the event of a recession.\n  We also made it easier to track deadbeat parents. We know that we \ncould reduce the welfare rolls by up to two-thirds if deadbeat parents \nwould just pay their child support. Years ago, I was a prosecutor in \nGreene County, Ohio, and I learned then firsthand how difficult it can \nbe to track down these deadbeat parents. You get banking information \nabout them on a yearly basis, you find out their assets, find out their \nlocation, just in time to discover they vanished once again.\n  This bill would provide this vital tracking information on a \nquarterly basis, once every 3 months, not once a year. It will be a big \nplus for our efforts to track down the deadbeats and, thus, reduce \nwelfare costs and, perhaps most important of all, we will give States \ncredit for helping people avoid falling into the welfare trap.\n  We have found that helping people before they get on welfare through \njob training, job search assistance, and similar measures is a cheaper \nand more effective way to help them than simply waiting for them to \nfall off the economic cliff and become full-fledged welfare clients.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support the idea that we \nhave to make welfare recipients work, but we need to make sure that \nmeeting the work requirement does not become an end in and of itself. \nThe goal, after all, is to help people avoid getting caught in the \nwelfare trap in the first place. This bill gives States credit toward \nthe work requirements for the efforts they make to help people stay off \nwelfare. It will help keep States focused on the real problem: Making \nsure fewer and fewer people need welfare in the first place.\n  With these changes and the underlying idea of promoting work and \ngetting welfare out of Washington, the Senate welfare reform package is \na major step toward breaking the cycle of welfare dependency once and \nfor all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to go next?\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 26 minutes on the minority side and \n30 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I defer to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. I \nalso am strongly in support of his amendment. I think, as he says, \neliminating fraud and abuse from the Medicare system certainly is not, \nin and of itself, going to cure the problem we are faced with. But it \nhas to be part of the package and it represents doing something. I \napplaud his efforts in that regard. I also applaud the comments just \nmade by the distinguished Senator from Ohio and his comments about the \nwelfare portion of the reconciliation package.\n  Mr. President, I speak from a little bit different perspective than \nmany of those who have spoken on the reconciliation package. I am a new \nMember to this body. I have not run for elected office before. I ran \nfor the U.S. Senate. I decided to run for this body because I felt--as \nI think a lot of other people in this country feel today--that our \ncountry is at a crossroads, that our chickens have come home to roost, \nand it is time to make some strong decisions, and they are going to \nhave to be made by people of courage and conviction. I felt that I \ncould play a small part in making the difference, in helping make that \nhappen.\n  It is all coming down now to these last few days, and that \nopportunity is going to be given to me, and it is going to be given to \neverybody in this body. Everything we have done in the last 10 days has \nled up to this time, has led up to this day of judgment. This is a day \nof judgment for ourselves as individuals. Some would say it is for our \nparty, but it is more importantly for us as a body and us as a nation. \nI think those difficult choices have to be made.\n  We are talking essentially here about change, Mr. President--change \nfrom the way that we have done things in the past. Change is always \nsomewhat painful. Change is never easy, but change we must have.\n  There are legitimate issues to be debated and discussed, without \nquestion. I think it is quite clear that there are basically two \ndifferent philosophies in this Chamber, as we approach these issues and \nproblems. One believes that the Government, by growing larger and \nspending more money, can solve these problems, in the face of all the \nevidence to the contrary. We, on the other hand, believe that \nGovernment ought to do those things that Government does best, that we \nshould shrink the size of the influence of the Federal Government on \npeople's lives, give more power back to the States, back to the \nlocalities, and leave more dollars in the pockets of people who earn \nthose dollars. It is a pretty simple proposition.\n  But there are legitimate issues. There is a legitimate issue as to \nhow far we should go with regard to Medicare. Should we apply a Band-\nAid? Sometimes a Band-Aid can work perfectly well for short periods of \ntime. But the question is whether or not we should apply that Band-Aid \nor do something more serious for the future. Although, surely, we agree \nthat something must be done.\n  There is legitimate debate as to what extent we should keep \ncentralized here, control of the welfare program, or to what extent we \nshould give those responsibilities back, closer to where the problem \nis. Although, surely, there can be no debate that we indeed have a \nfailed welfare system and that something must be done.\n  There is even a legitimate debate with regard to a balanced budget. A \nwhile back, some were thinking maybe we did not really need one. \nApparently, now we are all in agreement. We can debate those \npriorities, but, surely, we are all in agreement that we cannot \ncontinue down the road we are traveling on now, and that the next \ngeneration does not deserve it.\n  We can debate tax cuts. We can debate the effects of those tax cuts. \nBut, apparently, we even agree across party lines and with the White \nHouse with regard to the need for tax cuts--the President having \nacknowledged that tax cuts are indeed needed.\n  So these are legitimate items of debate, and I have been looking \nforward to a discussion of those issues. We are in the midst of it now. \nI think the discussion tonight has been good. I must say that, \nthroughout the day, it has not always reached a level that I would like \nto see reached in this Chamber. We have seen some mean-spiritedness, \nand we have seen some calls to fear. We have seen appeals to envy and \nappeals to greed. One Member, today, suggested that those who espouse \nour philosophy should be ashamed of ourselves. Another Member today, on \nthe other side, said that apparently the only elderly people we know \nare those who live in Beverly Hills, which would come as a real shock \nto my mama in Franklin, TN. But that was said today. It has been \nimplied that those on the other side of the aisle are the only ones who \nhave any concern, any care, any compassion because, indeed, they are \n\n[[Page S15660]]\n\nthe ones who are willing to send out more dollars from Washington to \nsolve those problems, as they have solved them in times past.\n  Mr. President, it has come now to a time where we must put \npartisanship aside. We can have legitimate debate on legitimate issues. \nI think the time is well past when we should be attacking other \npeople's motivations as we reach to solve these problems, because some \nof us must take note of the fact that some of the ones arguing and \nscreaming so loudly about these changes being made have been here for \nsome time and have witnessed this legislation that has come out of this \nbody and the other body, which has contributed to the problem over the \nlast 40 years--much more than it has contributed to the solution, it \nhas contributed to the policy of neglect and one that has, in every \nrespect, failed. It has operated under false assumptions and false \npolicies that must now be corrected. It is on our watch now--those who \nare coming in and who have been here a while. It is on our watch now, \nand we have to do something about what has been going on here for the \nlast 40 years.\n  We have a lot of talk about the blame and partisanship on this side \nof the aisle and the other side of the aisle. I suggest that there is \nenough blame to go around, Mr. President. But we are now cleaning up \nafter the act of the last few decades that was based on the proposition \nthat we can eradicate welfare in this country, that we can eradicate \npoverty by spending more dollars on it. We spent $5 trillion and got \nabout the same level of poverty, along with a lot of other socially \nundesirable results, which we surely must all agree on.\n  In 1965, the Ways and Means Committee estimated that the hospital \ninsurance part A Medicare would cost $9 billion to finance by 1990. In \n1990, hospital insurance actually cost $67 billion. That is quite a bit \nof disparity, even by congressional standards. Medicaid was intended to \ncost a billion dollars annually. Expenditures ballooned to $76 billion \nin 1992. In 1995, it went to $89 billion. That is just the Federal \nGovernment part alone. The States contributed $67 billion, in addition \nto that. False assumptions, which led to bad policies, which basically \nsaid, let us put this down and get to the next election and get an \nissue for the next election and on down as far as we can carry it, \nelection after election, and let somebody else take care of the \nconsequences. Well, we are now taking care of the consequences, we are \ntaking care of those estimates that turned out to be so wrong.\n  What has that wrought? It is certainly more than an academic \nexercise. It has wrought a Medicare trust fund that is virtually \nbankrupt, a welfare system that is morally bankrupt; it has wrought a \nfiscal situation that is going to bankrupt the next generation if we do \nnot do something about it. It has led us to a point where we have the \nlowest savings rate in the industrialized world. We have one of the \nlowest investment rates. We have a growth rate now that is about half \nof what it should be, about half of what it normally is coming out of a \nrecession. That has resulted in leaving a legacy to those who come \nafter us in a few short years of even higher and higher payroll taxes, \nof even higher interest rates, of not being able to compete in the \ninternational marketplace, and depending more and more on foreign \ndollars to subsidize our debt. That is what these miscalculations have \nwrought.\n  Yet, from everybody in this body, on both sides of the aisle, all you \nhear talk about is the ``working person,'' or the ``working family.'' \nEverybody is looking out for the working family. Everybody is taking \ncare of those workers, and talking about the people in the upper income \nlevels as if they were born that way and none of them ever worked. We \nknow who we are talking about.\n  What have we done for the working family? Those are the folks who put \nme where I am standing here today. Those are the folks that elected \nmost of us in this body. We ought to be looking out for them. But have \nwe been doing that? Do our actions belie the words ``looking out for \nthe working family''? We have seen income levels stagnate, and in \nlooking out for the working family we have seen among young working \npeople actually income levels decline in this country.\n  Among working people, we have seen greater and greater tax burdens \nlaid upon them, up to 220 percent. The Senator from Ohio a minute ago \nwas exactly right. The very people who benefit from this $500-per-child \ntax credit--that is what we have been doing for the working family. I \ncan hear working folks all across America saying, ``Please don't help \nus out anymore. We can't stand it.''\n  What is the solution to all of this? We have seen the President's \nfirst budget which gave $200 billion deficits as far as the eye could \nsee. Nobody took it seriously, and it did not get one vote in this \nChamber.\n  We saw the President's second so-called budget that created $245 \nbillion out of thin air by changing some assumptions. Nobody is taking \nthat seriously either. Apparently it did not get one vote in this \nChamber.\n  Apparently, the idea is not to come forth with any constructive idea \nat all, not to help contribute to the solution, but lay the wood on \nthose who are trying to solve the problem, and to keep on taxing and \nkeep on spending.\n  With regard to the Medicare solution, my friends on the other side \nare correct in claiming that their $90 billion solution would keep the \nMedicare trust fund solvent until 2006, but in 2010, the last year the \nRepublicans would keep the trust fund in the black, the Democrats would \nleave it in the red.\n  That date is important, because 2010 is the year the human wave of \nbaby boomers really hits--those baby boomer retirees. Everyone \nacknowledges that further changes in Medicare will undoubtedly need to \nbe made at that time. It is a different situation entirely. To meet it \non an equilibrium is what we are trying to do, or not to meet it \nalready $300 billion in arrears.\n  My time is running out. I want to address the tax component that we \nhave heard so much about. The claim, of course, that the problem here \nreally is that we want tax cuts for those who do not need them, and, \ntherefore, the Medicare problem would not be as big, I can only hope \nthe Washington Post--every knowledgeable observer, Mr. President, and \ntraditionally Democratic, have basically made the same statement. The \nWashington Post on September 25, 1995, said, ``The Democrats have \nfabricated the Medicare tax cut connection because it is useful \npolitically.''\n  Mr. President, this business about tax cuts for those who do not \nreally need them--I find it interesting, kind of parenthetically, and \nthis is historically espoused by those who want higher and higher \ntaxes. We just had the largest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry and now that is supposed to be locked in and not touched.\n  We meet every year, practically, in this body, and decide who does \nneed it, who deserves it. This group this year deserves a tax break. \nThis group this other year does not deserve a tax break. So we have a \ntax bill. We had a tax bill in 1969, in 1971, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981, \n1982, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1993--major tax bills. That does not include \nthe miscellaneous tax bills. And every time, we in this body decide who \nis deserving and who is not--passing judgment on our fellow citizens as \nto whose money we ought to take and who we ought to give a little back \nto, continuously focusing on the ``who,'' the ``who''--not the what.\n  In other words, who is going to be hit? Continuing to focus on how to \ndivide up the pie, not focusing on policies as to how to make the pie \nbigger.\n  My time, I am sure, is close to being expired, so I will address this \nin a little bit more detail at a later time.\n  In conclusion, I urge that we get down to serious business, that we \nput the details of this aside. It is painful. There are things in this \nbill of this magnitude that are going to pain us in various areas.\n  The bottom-line question is whether or not we will get this fiscal \nhouse in order. We take the first step, which is only a first step. If \nwe do everything we are talking about and go through all the pain, this \nis just the first step. We will have to continue to do it year after \nyear after year. I suggest we get used to it and get on with it.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes 50 seconds, and the \nother side has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order of their recognition by the Chair \nin this \n\n[[Page S15661]]\n\norder, I wish to allocate the time remaining with 8 minutes to the \nSenator from North Dakota, followed by 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, and then 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico. I yield \nmyself 3 minutes at this time.\n  All day long, Mr. President, we have had Republicans beating up on \nthe President of the United States. I simply say that today the \nPresident announced that the year-end budget deficit was 160-some \nbillions of dollars. That is the lowest deficit we have had for a long, \nlong time in the United States of America.\n  I simply say to those who have been in this body now not a full year, \nnone of them can hardly take any credit for the deficit going down \ndramatically under the leadership of the President of the United \nStates.\n  While we all tend to beat up on the President of the United States \nonce in a while, I think it is well to note that under his leadership \nand under his direction, under his determination, and in the policies \nthat he has fostered, he has put his political muscles where his mouth \nis, and the deficit has come down dramatically.\n  I simply say that the last time we had a deficit this low was way \nback in 1989 at $153 billion. The intervening years it has been $221 \nbillion, $270 billion, $290 billion, $255 billion, $203 billion, and so \nforth.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that once again the President of the \nUnited States should be saluted for at least bringing the deficit down \ninto the $160-billion range. I want to get that for the record because \nthere have been so many brick bats thrown at the President of the \nUnited States today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened in recent hours to \ndiscussions by people who talk about what has been going on around here \nfor the past 40 years in some disappointing way. Let me put in a good \nword for what has been going on in this country for the past 40 years.\n  I wonder how many people think that somebody would like to live \nelsewhere? Do you think that we have not progressed in this country in \n40 years? Do you think Medicare does not matter to people? Do you think \nthings are not better for a lot of Americans than they used to be? Do \nyou think in this century the fact that we decided to provide \nelectricity to the farms, that somehow that was not relevant? Created a \nSocial Security system; that did not matter? Marshaled the will and the \nstrength to beat back the forces of fascism and Nazism? Survived the \nDepression and created a period post-Second World War of unprecedented \ngrowth and opportunities?\n  I guess it is fine to talk about what has been going on the last 40 \nyears. I happen to think this is a pretty good place. I do not see \npeople rushing to leave. If they go, I do not know where they would go. \nWould they go to Tegucigalpa because the mail service is better? \nKrakow, because they have better roads? Budapest, because they have a \nbetter telephone system? I do not think so.\n  The fact is we ought to talk about what is right in this country for \na while. Some of the things that are right in this country are now to \nbe taken apart by 1,950 pages of legislation on which there has been no \nhearings, which we received yesterday afternoon about 4 o'clock, and on \nwhich we now have 10 hours of debate left.\n  It is a fairly disappointing thing to watch here in the Senate today. \nThis 1,950 pages contains substantial policy changes--Medicare \nespecially. Medicare matters to a lot of senior citizens. We offered an \namendment today about 8 hours ago. It is very simple. It does not take \n10 staff people to explain it to anybody here. It is not rocket \nscience. It is very simple. It says those who propose to reduce the \namount needed for Medicare by $270 billion--and that is what the \nproposal is--$270 billion less than is needed to fund Medicare in the \nnext years, we say to those who want to do it, look, you also want to \ngive a tax cut. We would like you to modify the tax cut and not provide \ntax relief to the upper income Americans, and use the savings from that \nlimitation to reduce the hit on Medicare so that we are reducing \nMedicare by about the $89 billion that the trustees say are necessary \nto make it solvent.\n  Shorthand--reduce the cut on Medicare to about $89 billion. That is \nall you need to cut in Medicare to make it solvent, and get the money \nfor that by eliminating the tax cut for the affluent Americans.\n  Very simple. It does not take 8 hours to figure out what you will do \nabout this. We do not need people sitting around with fingernail files \nand clippers and just ruminating about the world.\n  We have 20 hours on this bill. We offered this amendment 8 hours ago. \nDo Members know what we are talking about now? We are talking about an \namendment on Medicare fraud. This amendment ought to be accepted in a \nnanosecond. Want to talk about this forever? God bless you, come and \nget time next week and talk to the whole world for 40 hours until you \nare blue.\n  This amendment is fine. It is not controversial. Why are they talking \nabout it? Why are they eating up time on this clock? Because they do \nnot want to talk about our amendment. They certainly do not want to \nvote on our amendment. And it is not just this amendment. There are \nothers exactly like it.\n  We have family farmers out there who know that the farm bill is in \nthis piece of--reconciliation, this reconciliation bill. This budget \nbill has the farm bill in it.\n  We are supposed to write a farm bill this year. We did not. So what \ndo they do, they put whatever they have written in this. There are no \nhearings, nobody knows what is there, really. I mean, it is a real a \nslap in the face for family farmers. This will cut farm income in North \nDakota by 25 percent. The first time in history they throw a farm bill \nin a reconciliation bill --first time.\n  What else is here? Oh, a note to families in middle-income \ncircumstances that we want to make it tougher for you to send your kids \nto college because we cannot afford student financial aid. So we tell \nthe old folks we cannot afford Medicare. We can afford a tax cut for \nthe wealthy; cannot afford Medicare. We cannot afford student aid for \nmiddle-income families whose kids are about to go off to college, but \nwe can afford a tax cut for the affluent. We cannot afford Head Start \nfor 55,000 kids in the appropriations bill, but we can afford a tax cut \nfor the most affluent people in the country.\n  And people over there say, ``You are being too sharp in your \ncriticism. Class warfare.'' You bet it is class warfare. It is all \nhere, 1,950 pages of class warfare, in this bill. And do not take it \nfrom me, take it from your colleague, Senator Specter, who said it on \nthe floor yesterday. It took a little courage for him to say it, and I \nadmire him for saying it.\n\n       . . . the pain of the spending cuts goes to the elderly, \n     the young, and the infirm while allowing tax cuts for \n     corporate America and those in higher brackets.\n\n  You know what he said yesterday, and in your secret moments you know \nwhat he said was right. He said that if it were a secret ballot, 20 of \nyou on the other side of the aisle would vote against this because you \nknow it is the wrong priorities.\n  We have spent 8 hours and have not had a vote. We have several more \npeople who want to speak to the amendment on Medicaid fraud. I \ncompliment the Senator for offering it. I support it and think we ought \nto accept it in 4 minutes. But instead, we will take 2 hours on this, I \nsuppose, because the other side does not want to vote on an issue that \ndeals with hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicare for the elderly \njuxtaposed against tax cuts for some of the most affluent Americans.\n  I know there has been a lot of nonsense on this floor these days, but \nI just want one person to bring a chart to the floor that tells me this \nstatistic is wrong: on average, the 51 percent of American families \nwith incomes under $30,000 get a tax hike in these 2,000 pages. That is \na fact. It comes from the Joint Tax Committee. We do not run that. Half \nof the American families, on average, get a tax hike. Guess which \nhalf--the top half? Oh, no. The bottom half, the very folks the people \nwho are pushing this say they want to help. It is a curious way to help \npeople, in my judgment, with a tax hike.\n  Who gets the benefit? For everybody that finds a loaf someplace, \nsomebody else is getting it buttered. So who gets their bread buttered \nhere? The top 1 \n\n[[Page S15662]]\n\npercent, of course--big tax cuts. I want somebody to come to the floor \nin the next day or so, just to tell me this chart is wrong and tell me \nhow it is wrong. You know it is right. Senator Specter knew it was \nright yesterday when he spoke. And you can do all the high-wire acts \nand you can do all the half gainers and all the gyrations you want, \nbuild all the word castles in the sky forever, and it is not going to \nchange the central facts.\n  Old folks are going to pay more and get less health care. They are \ngoing to pay more for it and get less. Family farmers get the short end \nof the stick. Middle-income families are told college education is not \nso important for your kids. And young kids are told education is not a \nhigh priority for you--whether it is Head Start and dozens of other \nprograms.\n  So I just ask people around here, when are we going to vote on \nsomething we offered 8 hours ago? A simple proposition. I do not have \nto read it again. Everybody in here understands it and everybody here \nunderstands why we are not voting on it. We are going to have 40 or 50 \nvotes, I suppose, on this bill. But we are draining off all of this \ndebate time on a noncontroversial issue. I understand why, but it is \nnot right.\n  The rules provide 20 hours on this bill. We have limited time to deal \nwith things that literally affect people's lives more than almost any \nmeasure in the last 30, 40 years. And we are told we just cannot vote \non these issues up or down. We want to go talk about Medicare fraud.\n  I see Senators on the floor who have been working on this for a long \nwhile, and I commend them. I have worked on it. But I tell you, our \nconstituents would much sooner understand how this bill affects their \nlives in a real way than deal with this noncontroversial amendment, an \namendment we should have accepted 2 hours ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from North \nDakota for a brilliant statement. He has such a way with words, and I \ncongratulate him for putting the issue in context.\n  Mr. President, at the outset, I want to make it clear that I am one \nSenator who believes that major changes are critically needed if we are \nto bring the federal budget back under control. I also believe that \nmajor changes in our Tax Code are necessary to help generate new \neconomic growth and to create new jobs.\n  I do not think any of us should fear change. Indeed, change is \ncritically important if we are to succeed in meeting the challenges the \nfuture holds for us, for our children, and for future generations. The \nright kinds of changes can help create a climate that will produce the \nnew jobs and economic growth that all of us want to see. The right kind \nof changes can open up opportunity, and help make this an America that \nmakes use of all of the talents of all of its people, which benefits us \nall. The right kind of changes can help create a climate that will help \nAmericans provide for their families and give them what we have had--\nthe opportunity to live better than our parents did.\n  There is no argument but that change is needed. I strongly agree with \nthe statement made in a letter written by the Competitiveness Policy \nCouncil on October 12 when the council issued its report entitled \n``Lifting All Boats--Increasing the Payoff from Private Investment in \nthe U.S. Economy.'' The cover letter, talking about the report's \nconclusions, stated: ``many of the Federal laws and regulations that \ninfluence private investment decisions were developed before World War \nII, and are out of sync with current economic and financial market \nconditions.'' That is exactly right!\n  Another of the council's recently issued major reports, entitled \n``Saving More and Investing Better--A Strategy for Securing \nProsperity'' makes it very clear why we must change Federal budget and \ntax policies, and other Federal policies. That report found, among \nother things, that:\n\n       More Americans are employed, yet they are working longer \n     hours and for less pay;\n       Productivity growth has improved since 1990, yet it has not \n     translated into higher compensation for workers;\n       * * * public dissaving has been reduced by 2 percent of GDP \n     since 1992 through cuts in the Federal deficit, [yet] the net \n     national savings rate continues to fall * * * primarily due \n     to the downward trend in household saving, as Americans \n     currently consume 97 percent of their household income;\n       * * * private investment is growing yet the stock of \n     existing plant and equipment is flat; and\n       * * * improvements in product quality and delivery, lower \n     wages, corporate restructuring, the depreciating of the \n     dollar and government support have helped American goods and \n     services gain a greater share of world markets, yet the trade \n     deficit is reaching historic highs.\n\n  The council set out three goals--goals that I believe make a great \ndeal of sense--to deal with these and other problems raised by its \nreports:\n  First, doubling productivity growth to at least 2 per cent per year;\n  Second, achieving 3 percent annual GDP growth, in order to reemploy \nworkers made redundant through productivity improvements; and\n  Third, eliminating our current account deficit, in order to reduce \nU.S. reliance on foreign capital, and helping ensure that the other \ngoals can be sustained over the long run.\n  I think these are goals this Congress must pursue, both through the \nTax Code through Federal spending decisions, and through the other \nactions of the Federal Government. One critical question the Senate \nshould be asking is whether this reconciliation bill moves us toward \nthese goals or not. After all, restoring Federal budget discipline is \nnot just an accounting game. Changing Federal policies is not just \nabout making the numbers line up. The reason we are want to deal with \nthe deficit problem, the reason the right kinds of changes are so \nimportant, is what they will mean to the American people, to the kind \nof opportunities our children will enjoy, and to our collective future \nas a nation. Tragically, this reconciliation bill does not move us \ntoward these goals. It does not pursue the right changes. It is \ncontentious and controversial precisely because it is shortsighted. We \ncurrently enjoy solid economic growth and low unemployment. Yet \nAmericans are increasingly anxious about the future.\n  More and more Americans worry about whether they will be restructured \nout of their jobs. Americans entering the work force worry about \nwhether there are enough good jobs out there for them to find. And most \nAmericans increasingly worry about being priced out of the American \ndream.\n  Unfortunately, there is substantial cause for this anxiety and this \nworry. All too many Americans have been restructured into lower paying \njobs. Eighty percent of Americans are not seeing any real increase in \ntheir pay. Yet between 1989 and 1990:\n  The average price of a home increased from about $76,000 to almost \n$150,000, an increase of almost 100 percent;\n  The average price of a car went from about $7,000 to $16,000, an \nincrease of over 125 percent, and the number of weeks an American had \nto work to pay for the average car increased from about 18 weeks to \nover 24 weeks, an increase of about one-third;\n  The cost of a year's tuition at a publicly supported college \nincreased from $635 to $1,454, an increase of almost 130 percent, and a \nyear's tuition at a private college increased from an average of $3,498 \nto $8,772, an increase of 150 percent; and\n  Health care costs increased at close to or at double digit rates each \nyear.\n  We have a responsibility to do what we can to help address the causes \nof that anxiety. We have a responsibility to help ensure that the \nopportunity to achieve the American dream is open to every American--\nand that the dream is not priced out of reach for many Americans. We \nhave a responsibility to ensure that Government tax, spending, and \nregulatory policies do not undermine the opportunity for Americans to \nfind a good job, to keep a good job, to be able to provide for their \nfamilies, and to help their children get ready to succeed in an ever \nmore competitive world economy. We have a responsibility to adopt \npolicies that encourage, rather than discourage, the creation of the \nnew good jobs we so greatly need, and the kind of solid, sustainable \neconomic growth on which our individual and collective futures so \nfundamentally depend. We have a duty to ensure that Government policies \nhelp, rather than hinder, Americans who want \n\n[[Page S15663]]\n\nnothing more--and nothing less--than what we have all had: the \nopportunity to live better than our parents did.\n  We have to meet these responsibilities based on as complete an \nunderstanding as possible of the way our economy works now, and the way \nit is likely to work in the future, and not simply on the way it may \nhave worked in the past. We have to meet these responsibilities without \nfalling into the trap of doing the tax and budgetary policy equivalents \nof fighting the last war, instead of preparing for the next one.\n  Yet, that seems to be exactly what this reconciliation bill is all \nabout. It does not meet our responsibilities to our children and to our \nfuture. Its remedies are based on a foundation of myths, and a time \nthat has long since passed, instead of the economic realities that the \nAmerican people live every single day.\n  There is no question that our budgetary situation has changed \ndramatically since the Federal Government last balanced its budget in \n1969. In 1969, the national debt was $365 billion; now it is almost \n$4.9 trillion. In 1969, interest on the national debt cost only $12.7 \nbillion; this year, interest alone will consume over $230 billion--over \n$40 billion more than total Federal spending in 1969. And the future \nholds even greater problems. Last year, I served on the Bipartisan \nCommission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. Finding No. 1 of the \nCommission's interim report to the President made it abundantly clear \nwhat will happen if we do not address the critical budget problems \nfacing this country. The chart accompanying that finding was headlined, \n``Current Trends Are Not Sustainable''--a very understated way of \npointing to the very real crisis we face. If we do nothing, by the year \n2012, entitlement spending and interest expense consume every single \ndollar of Federal Revenue. If we do nothing, by 2030, Federal outlays \ncould consume 37 percent of the entire U.S. economy, up from 22 percent \ntoday. If we do nothing, by 2030, just paying the interest on the \nnational debt will take over $1 of every $10 our economy produces.\n  The Commission's reports are compelling evidence that we must act to \nget the Federal Government's fiscal house in order. They make it clear \nthat we cannot afford to act based on any political party's or interest \ngroup's budgetary mythology. They reinforced my conviction that an \namendment to our Constitution is good public policy.\n  That same objective--a balanced budget, restoration of fiscal \ndiscipline--is the stated objective of the reconciliation bill we are \nnow considering. But what kind of message is being sent, what are the \nAmerican people really being told, if the same bill that takes $893 \nbillion out of the spending side of the budget over the next 7 years \nalso takes $245 billion out of the revenue side of the budget. What \nkind of message is being sent if a bill that is supposed to lower \ndeficits actually increases them by $93 billion over the next 7 years \nin order to help finance tax cuts?\n  The reason greater fiscal discipline is important is that we owe more \nto our children than a legacy of debt. How is that consistent with \ngiving ourselves a tax cut now, thereby creating more debt for them to \nrepay?\n  The tax changes now contained in this bill are very substantial in \ncomparison to the deficits we face. They amount to 15 percent of the \n$1.6 trillion in deficits forecast for the next 7 years if we do not \nact to put our fiscal house in order. And they are an even larger \npercentage--38 percent--of the $638 billion in deficits forecast for \nthat period in the budget resolution we are now working under. That is \nwhy the tax cut provisions of this bill have such an impact on the \ndeficit reduction objective that both Democrats and Republicans want to \nachieve.\n  A tax cut right now is inconsistent with achieving real deficit \nreduction. And it is important to keep in mind that, even if the Senate \ndoes not act on these tax proposals, we would not be choosing to move \ntoward a balanced budget by increasing the burden on American \ntaxpayers. Whether these tax proposals become law or not, Federal \nrevenues are not growing faster than our economy. Federal taxes \nconsumed 19 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1994. \nThat is 1 percentage point less of GDP than Federal revenues accounted \nfor a quarter of a century earlier, when the Federal Government last \nbalanced its budget, back in 1969, by the way.\n  The rationale for tax cuts is that they will help promote savings, \neconomic growth, and the creation of the kind of new, well-paying jobs \nAmericans need. And it is true that $245 billion in tax cuts sounds \nlike a number large enough to provide a substantial opportunity for \nthose kinds of changes to happen. When compared to Federal revenues \nthat will total more than $11.3 trillion over the next 7 years, \nhowever, that figure shrinks dramatically. It amounts to a tax cut of \nonly about 2.1 percent. And, according to the Joint Tax Committee, it \namounts to a cut in average effective tax rates for American taxpayers \nof only eight-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Moreover, even this tax reduction is illusory for many Americans. The \nreconciliation bill, to cite one example, creates a student loan \ninterest tax credit, an idea I support. This tax credit puts \napproximately $1.5 billion in the hands of American taxpayers to help \npay student loan expenses. However, the reconciliation also contains \nprovisions designed to save $10.8 billion over that same 7-year period \nby making student loans more expensive. On a net basis, therefore, \nfamilies with students are likely to be worse off, not better off.\n  The bill also creates a $500 per child tax credit for families. But \nmany EITC families won't see much net relief, because once the EITC \ncuts are fully phased in, they will lose, on average, $457 in annual \ntax relief they are now receiving. For many of them, therefore, the \neffect of the tax provisions in this bill is simply to move their tax \nbenefits from one line of their tax returns to another line.\n  And even middle income Americans will not receive much relief from \nthe tax provisions in this reconciliation bill. Both the Joint Tax \nCommittee and the Treasury Department agree that Americans with annual \nincomes of $30,000 or less, which is over half of all Americans, will \nsee no net tax relief at all from this bill.\n  In the health care area, the bill calls for creating medical savings \naccounts, providing more favorable tax treatment for long-term care \ninsurance, and a number of other changes. The benefit to American \ntaxpayers of these changes amounts to approximately $12 billion. \nHowever, the bill also makes changes in Medicare and Medicaid that will \ntake $452 billion out of those two programs over the next 7 years. The \nchanges include doubling the Medicare part B premium, and the Medicare \npart B deductible. For most Medicare and virtually all Medicaid \nrecipients, the tax relief they will receive under this bill, \ntherefore, will probably not come close to covering their increased \nhealth care costs. And if, as many believe, one result of these \nMedicare and Medicaid changes is to put additional upward pressure on \nhealth insurance costs, than it is not just the elderly, the disabled, \nand the poor who will see their tax relief overwhelmed by increased \nhealth care costs, millions of other Americans who are not currently \nusing these two health care programs will also face that same reality.\n  Cutting taxes is the oldest political trump card, and it has not lost \nits power. And tax cuts are easy to understand. The temptation to \npromise the proverbial ``chicken in every pot,'' is too great for some \nto resist. But imposing new costs on American families while only \npartly offsetting these new costs with tax cuts does not represent real \ntax relief; instead, it is, at best, no more than a cynical shell game.\n  And the proposed tax cuts are far from the only problems with this \nbill. The bill makes student loans more expensive, adding an 85 basis \npoint fee to the cost of every loan, most, if not all, of which will be \npassed on to students. It adds 100 basis points, or one full percentage \npoint, to the cost of what are called PLUS loans, which could add up to \n$5,000 in student loan costs for American families who use that student \nloan program. It ends the interest free, 6-month grace period which is \ndesigned to provide an opportunity for students to find a job after \nthey complete their education, which adds another $700 to $2,500 in \ncosts to student loans. And it actually increases, rather than \ndecreases, the redtape and administrative costs associated with student \n\n\n[[Page S15664]]\n\nloans, by backing away from direct loans in favor of using the banks to \nmake student loans guaranteed by the Federal Government.\n  The net effect of all of these cuts is to price college out of reach \nfor more Americans. A study by two higher education economists--Michael \nMcPherson of Williams College and Morton Shapiro of the University of \nSouthern California concluded that each $250 increase in the cost of \ncollege will result in a 1-percent drop in the number of low-income \nstudents enrolling in college.\n  And low-income students will not be the only students affected by \nthese changes in student loans. Middle class American families with \nstudents in college or approaching college-age will also be affected--\nall too many people will be unable to meet the new, higher costs, which \nmeans that their children will have their opportunities diminished by \nthis bill, instead of expanded. We want a brighter future for our \nchildren, but if we are simply moving costs from the Federal balance \nsheet to the budgets of American families, we aren't helping them at \nall. That kind of approach does not meet our responsibility to American \nfamilies or to our children, and it does not meet our obligation to the \nfuture.\n  These kinds of changes may produce budget savings in the short run, \nbut they are not in the long-term interests of our country; this is not \nthe kind of legacy we want to leave our children. After all, our people \nare the most important asset our country has. If we are to compete \nsuccessfully in the future, if we are to generate the kind of economic \ngrowth we need, and if we want expanded, rather than diminished, \nopportunities for our children--and their children--we simply cannot \nskimp on essential investments in education.\n  We all know that education is the one of the most important \ndeterminants of the amount our children will earn in their lifetimes. \nIn this increasingly technological age, education is ever more \nimportant. How, therefore, does it make budget sense, or any other kind \nof sense, to cut our investment in education, when one of the top \npurposes of this bill is to improve the legacy we are leaving our \nchildren, and to create a brighter future for our children.\n  The bill's approach to health care is as shortsighted and misguided \nas its approach to education. Advocates of the bill's Medicare and \nMedicaid provision argue that the reconciliation bill does not ``cut'' \neither program; what is actually going on is simply a reduction in the \nrate of growth of these two programs from their current double digit \nincreases to a bit more than 4 percent annually. They also argue that \naction is required in order to keep the Medicare trust fund solvent.\n  If the only important thing is the narrow budget numbers themselves, \nthat argument is correct. If, however, the economic and health care \nrealities behind those numbers are also considered, the argument \ncollapses.\n  The truth is that this bill calls for reductions in Medicare of $270 \nbillion--three times what is needed to protect the trust fund. And the \ntruth is that the aggregate spending levels are not the whole story, \nbut only the beginning of the story. There are two factors driving up \nthe cost of Medicare and Medicaid, and health care costs generally: \ndemographic change, and cost inflation. The simple fact is that the \nnumber of older Americans is increasing far more rapidly than the \npopulation generally, and that the increases in the number of elderly \nAmericans will accelerate even further early in the next century when \nthe ``baby boomers'' begin to hit retirement age. This fact has \nprofound implications for Medicare, and also for Medicaid--because \nspending for older Americans takes 70 cents of every dollar spent on \nthat program. Both Medicare and Medicaid must increase substantially \njust to keep pace with the increasing number of Americans using those \nprograms.\n  Health care cost inflation is a perhaps even more important factor. \nMedicare and Medicaid inflation rates have been at double digit levels, \nor close to them, for a long time, and it is true that we have to get \nthat inflation under control. However, this bill has no real plan for \nreducing health care inflation. Instead, its impact will be to reduce \nthe quality of care and the health care choices available to millions \nof Americans. Under this bill hospitals and other health care providers \nwill see over $200 billion less in reimbursement for services provided \nto Medicare patients, which will literally drive some of them into \nbankruptcy, and cause others to reject Medicare patients; Medicare \npremiums will double, as will deductibles; the two-thirds of all \nnursing home residents who depend on Medicaid will be thrown into \njeopardy; and almost 9 million people, including almost 4\\1/2\\ million \nchildren, could be thrown off the Medicaid rolls.\n  Again, what seems to be happening is that costs are not being \neliminated by making the delivery of health care cheaper and more cost-\nefficient, but by simply transferring costs from the Federal budget to \nthe budgets of individual Americans. Medicare beneficiaries will not \nonly see higher costs from the Medicare Program directly, but higher \nprivate insurance costs, as so-called Medigap insurance, which involves \nhigher administrative costs and more inefficiency than Medicare--\nbecomes more expensive due to this bill. Medicaid recipients will also \nface higher costs--the average cost of a year in a nursing home is \n$38,000--for less health care. And every American will likely see \nhigher health insurance costs, as hospitals push costs formerly paid by \nMedicare and Medicaid over to privately insured patients. Lewin-VHI, an \nindependent research firm, found that the $452 billion in Medicare and \nMedicaid changes will force doctors and hospitals to raise their fees \nfor private patients by at least $90 billion.\n  Under this bill, Americans will get $245 billion in tax cuts, but if \neven half of the $452 billion in Medicare and Medicaid reductions show \nup in the budgets of individual Americans, then Americans are not \nbetter off at all. They deserve more than budgetary shell games. They \ndeserve real reform--we need real reform--but all this bill provides is \nthe rhetoric of reform, instead of the reality. The only reality it \nwill deliver is less care and higher costs for every American. It takes \na meat ax approach to health care system reform when a scalpel would do \na better job.\n  I have focused a lot on the impact this reconciliation bill will have \non all Americans, Mr. President, but I cannot conclude without \nexpressing my outrage and my dismay on how it treats the poorest \nAmericans. The proponents of this bill say it reforms welfare, that it \n``reforms'' the EITC, that it ``reforms'' health care for the poor, \nthat it ``reforms'' nutrition programs, and that it, along with the \nappropriations bills that encompass the rest of the program advocated \nby the other side of the aisle reform the rest of the social safety \nnet. But these reforms are even less real than the health care reforms. \nInstead, these proposals represent a shredding of the social safety \nnet. This reconciliation bill walks away from the working poor. It \nwalks away from the welfare recipients who want to work. It walks away \nfrom poor children who want the opportunity to escape their poverty.\n  It walks away from opportunity, from inclusion, and from making use \nof all of the talents of all of our people. It walks away from the \nproblems of our cities, and of economically distressed rural areas.\n  It calls for further reductions in welfare, even though welfare \nbenefits per beneficiary have been declining for years. It fails to \nrecognize the real problems involving child care, and access to jobs, \nand job training that have to be addressed in order to make real \nprogress in reducing our welfare rolls by bringing people into the \nworkforce. It ignores the fact that two-thirds of welfare recipients \nare children. It divides us from one another, viewing the poor as a \ncost to be cut, instead of as an asset to be developed. I could go on, \nand on, and on.\n  Considering the overall impact of the bill, one has to ask the \nquestion, ``What do the supporters of this bill have against poor \npeople?'' After all, Americans who make less than $20,000 get a tax \nincrease, instead of a tax cut, under this bill. Americans who make \nless than $30,000 get no tax cut at all. And the poorest 20 percent of \nAmerican families have to bear half of the total cuts in Federal \nspending. This reconciliation bill is so unbalanced that the \ndistributional impact is--or should be --a stunning embarrassment.\n  It is the long term that I believe must guide our deliberations. We \nmust \n\n[[Page S15665]]\n\ndeal with Federal budget problems, but our objective must be to deal \nwith our budget problems in a way that enhances our country's future, \nand our children's future. A bill that undermines education, that \nsimply transfers costs from the Federal Government's balance sheet to \nthe budgets of American families, and that needlessly jeopardizes, \ninstead of reforming, our health care system, cannot end the anxiety so \nmany Americans are experiencing.\n  How can making education more expensive that is already too expensive \nbe in our long-term national interest? How can cutting taxes by $245 \nbillion, at a time when we have $4.9 trillion in Federal debt \noutstanding, and at a time when we are experiencing nine-figure budget \ndeficits every year, be in our long-term national interest. And how \ndoes lowering taxes for some Americans while pushing more health care \ncosts, education costs, and so many other costs onto every American \nfamily help them better meet their own long-term objectives. Finally, \nhow is walking away from the poor--and particularly poor children--\nconsistent with either our own long-term interests or our own core \nvalues.\n  The answers are, of course, obvious. It cannot, it does not, and it \nis not. It does not meet the long-term needs of American families. It \ndoes not prepare our Nation or our children to meet the challenges the \nfuture holds. It does not include the kinds of reforms we need. All \nthis bill offers is diminished opportunities, a loss of \ncompetitiveness, and a continuation of the current anxieties that so \nplague the American people. When it inevitably fails, its only lasting \nresult will be to further increase the already pervasive cynicism that \nso poisons our public dialog.\n  We can and must do better. We have an obligation to our country, to \nAmerican families, to our children, and to their children to enact the \nkind of reforms that will help make our individual and collective \nfutures brighter. However, the only way for this Senate to do the right \nthing is to first defeat the wrong one. I therefore urge my colleagues \nto join me in opposing S. 1357, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois would answer a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Maybe I could have 5 minutes off the bill, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois is \na member of the Finance Committee. So she is familiar with some of \nthese items, obviously. But I heard her say that under the Republican \nmeasure the Medicare part B premiums are going to double. What is her \nsource of information for that? What is she basing that on?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I am going to have to find the record. But I would \nbe delighted to get back to my colleague with regard to the effect as \nto some of the recipients of Medicare. The premium will double, and \nthose are the numbers provided for us in committee. I would be \ndelighted to get the base information. I do not have it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois is objecting to the \naffluent testing of the part B premiums.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Objecting to the affluent testing? No. I would say \nto my colleague that the point I have been trying to make in this \nstatement today is that we are with this bill in all 20 instances \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul, taking from one pocket to put in another, \nand that, therefore, the notion that we are just restraining, \nrestoring, and saving the program becomes illusory given the overall \nimpact of the changes that are suggested in this reconciliation bill.\n  There do have to be changes. That is the main import of my statement \nas well. There have to be changes in the way that this program works. \nCertainly, affluent testing is one. Some parts of the affluent testing \nproposed in the Finance Committee are laudable and will help the \nprogram overall. But the overall impact on the way we treated the part \nB premiums will be to increase the cost on senior citizens and will \ndouble the costs in some instances.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me just say this. As the Senator knows, we both \nworked together in the Finance Committee on the Medicare matters. To \nsay that the Republicans are doubling the premiums on part B is an \ninaccurate statement, if I may say so to the Senator. We maintain the \npercentage that an individual pays under the part B premium at exactly \nthe same amount that is there now, the same amount that was there under \na Democratic administration and under us. It is 31.5 percent.\n  Now, if the predictions show that the costs of the premiums are going \nup, that has nothing to do with Republicans being in charge. That is a \nfact of costs of health care. But to say it is a Republican fault is a \ncharge that I think is a very unfortunate one to make.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from Illinois that what we have \ndone on the Medicare Program is justified. Have there been some \ndeductibles increased? Yes, there have. But the part B premium remains \nat exactly the same percentage that exists now. And if the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois objects to the affluence testing, \nthen she is on a different course than I am and I think most of the \nAmerican public.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would like to reclaim my time and to read to the \nSenator some numbers:\n\n       Under this plan, increased premiums alone will cost every \n     elderly couple an additional $2,800 over the next 7 years. By \n     the year 2000, premiums will double to more than $1,100 per \n     beneficiary per year. Upper income beneficiaries--\n\n  And this gets to the affluence testing that the Senator mentioned.\n\n     will pay even more. For some of them, the premiums will \n     triple.\n\n  It is documented. So maybe----\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Rhode Island \ncontrols the time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my time, Mr. President. I believe I am on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right. Now, I would just say this, that those \npremiums she is discussing would go up no matter which administration \nand under whose program you are talking about.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. But that does not make my statement in error, does \nit?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the premiums are going up--and who knows what the \ncosts are going to be out there because we do not set forth a dollar \namount, as the distinguished Senator knows. We stay at exactly the same \npercentage. And if health care costs should go down, then the premiums \nwill go down. If health care costs go up, then the premiums go up. To \nblame that on the Republicans and on our Medicare program is just a \ncharge that I believe is highly unfair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would like to claim my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe the previous agreement----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I have not yet yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island claimed time under the Republican side \non the bill and was recognized for 5 minutes. He has yielded back his \ntime.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, just as a point of clarification, I \nbelieve the Senator from Nebraska is not in the Chamber now, but he had \npreviously sought and obtained consent for the Senator from New Mexico \nto proceed at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from New Mexico allow me, because \nI think we got into a parliamentary pickle here for a second, and I \njust want 30 seconds.\n\n[[Page S15666]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would be glad to yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator.\n  Again, to Senator Chafee, the Office of Management called. Part B \nhere more than doubled. That is to be found on page 8 of the statement \nof policy. And I would like to provide that for the Senator. I did not \nmisspeak. We may have a different interpretation, but the statement \nthat I made was factual with regard to the impact on part B premiums. I \nyield the floor, and I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for just a few minutes \nabout the Republican tax plan, the plan which is before us. It is title \nXII of the bill. It begins on page 1463 and runs through page 1949. In \ncase some of my colleagues have not read all aspects of it, I have not \neither, but I do think I understand the main thrust of it. The main \nthrust of it is that it does place an additional burden on those who \nare least able to pay. In doing so, it provides tax breaks to those who \nare doing the best in our economy.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, which has been referred to many \ntimes here in this debate, has released some findings that I think all \nof us have to agree are accurate, and those findings are that people \nwho earn $30,000 a year or less will be shouldering a heavier tax \nburden once this bill becomes law. The new data are the result of the \neffort and the proposal to reduce by $43 billion the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. President, this chart here, I think, makes the point about as \nwell as anyone could. We have here the people who have $10,000 of \nincome or less. Their taxes will be expected by the year 2000 to rise \n9.6 percent. In the case of people with $20,000 of income, it is 2.2. \nIn the case of people with 30,000, it is a smaller percentage. But \neveryone in that entire range would see their taxes increased. At the \nsame time, those above $30,000 would see a decrease.\n  Mr. President, what we have, which is a fairly remarkable result, in \nmy opinion, is a bill that cuts Federal taxes, reduces Federal taxes by \n$245 billion and at the same time increases taxes on more than half of \nall Americans who pay tax.\n  Let me point to one other chart here which I think makes the point \nvery dramatically.\n  The Senator from North Dakota earlier was saying that the bottom 50 \npercent of all taxpayers are the ones who are going to see their taxes \ngo up. In my home State--and we have State-by-State breakdowns of \nthis--in my home State of New Mexico, it is not the bottom 50 percent \nwho are going to see their taxes increased; it is the bottom 70 \npercent. Because we are a low per capita income State, we have a \nsubstantial number of people who are in that income category that puts \nthem at $30,000 or less. So 70 percent of the taxpayers in my State \nwill in fact see their taxes rise under this bill according to the \nJoint Tax Committee.\n  What is most disturbing about this is that this is happening at a \npoint in American history where the average American worker is having a \ntougher time making ends meet. They are seeing their wages, the real \nspending power of their wages decline. Families are increasingly \nfinding themselves without adequate health care coverage or pension \noptions. It is a time when the stock market is at new highs, when \ncorporate profits have never been higher than they are at this time in \nour history.\n  In fact, talking about the stock market and corporate profits, there \nhave been many times in the last month or so when I wished I owned some \nstock. We own very little stock. And I am sure there are many working \nfamilies in this country who look at the rise in the stock market and \nwish they had a piece of that pie. But the reality is they do not.\n  What we are doing here is the rich are taking a bigger share of the \nNation's economic pie than ever before. We are proposing in this bill \nto reduce the burden on those who are relatively well off.\n  Some have recently argued that the $500 child tax credit is more than \nan adequate offset to those working poor who will be getting tax \nincreases. This is simply not true. Clearly, a family has to have \nsubstantial enough income on which to pay taxes for a $500 credit to \nmake a difference. More than a third of the Nation's children will not \nbenefit at all or will only receive partial credit from this proposal. \nIf we are serious about giving tax relief to the working poor, then the \nchild tax credit should be refundable or offset against payroll taxes, \nnot just against the income tax.\n  A working family in my State with two children and $15,000 adjusted \ngross income has no Federal tax liability and thus has no opportunity \nto receive any benefit from the child tax credit. This worker, however, \nhas a real increase in tax burden by the reduction in EITC that helps \nthe family keep working, not falling back into welfare programs. But \nthis same worker has payroll taxes of $1,148.00. If the child tax \ncredit were an offset against these taxes, then this might do some \ngood.\n  Mr. President, this Senate has been here before--in fact, 14 years \nago. In 1981, it was the passage of the Kemp-Roth bill which was a \nmajor cause of the deficit we are now struggling with. In 1983, 1985, \nand at other subsequent times, this Congress has quietly undone parts \nof Kemp-Roth, which cut taxes during a time when the Nation's financial \ncircumstances could not bear the pressure. But we have never \nrecovered--and that is why the budget balancing process today is so \nterribly difficult. It is very unwise to attempt to cut the programs \nthat we are cutting toward the noble cause of balancing the budget, and \nat the same time cut taxes for the wealthy. It was the wrong thing to \ndo in 1981, and it is the wrong thing to do today.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to promise tax relief, it needs to be \nequitable. We must go back to the drawing board and reverse these EITC \nreductions.\n  The Republican tax plan, as it now reads, benefits the wealthy at the \nexpense of the poor. We would be better off leaving the whole issue of \ntaxes to another day when we can afford it, and when it can be done \nfairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I would like to yield 10 \nminutes of our remaining time to the Senator from Maine, but before I \ndo I just want to recognize and commend the efforts of the Senator from \nMaine.\n  It was Senator Cohen who last year served as the ranking minority \nmember of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and it was his staff \nthat produced the document which I have read from several times tonight \npertaining to investigations of the kinds of Medicare fraud and abuse \nwhich the amendment I have brought this evening tries to address. It \nwas his fraud and abuse legislation, in fact, introduced earlier this \nyear, which served as the basis for the antifraud and abuse provisions \ncontained in the legislation before us. His earlier legislation had \nbipartisan support.\n  Provisions in the pending legislation are tough. They are \ncomprehensive and they are unprecedented in their effectiveness. I \nbelieve that this is the first time health care fraud and abuse \nprovisions have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as \ngenerating savings.\n  In fact, according to CBO, these provisions yield over $4 billion in \nsavings. So, I want to commend the Senator from Maine for these \nefforts. They are productive ones. And I applaud what he has done. And \nat this time I turn the floor over to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank my colleague and friend from Michigan. I want to \njoin in support of the amendment that he has offered to make what I \nbelieve to be very strong antifraud measures even stronger.\n  Mr. President, I have listened at length to the debate today, and I \nthink the American people are wondering, why are we here at this point \nin time debating this issue in the fashion that we are debating it?\n  We are here because there has been a lot of politics involved in the \nentire debate. Ever since the release of the trustees' report on the \nMedicare trust fund last spring, Republicans have said, ``We have to do \nsomething.'' I recall that Senator Dole, the majority leader, last \nspring urged that President \n\n[[Page S15667]]\n\nClinton try to put together some kind of a bipartisan commission or \ncommittee or group of Senators and House Members to see if we could not \nresolve this on a bipartisan basis.\n  There were no takers. There were no takers at that time. They simply \nsaid there is not a problem. ``There is no problem with Medicare, and \nyou Republicans are simply trying to blow it out of proportion.'' Well, \nthere is a problem. There is a problem that has to be fixed.\n  Let me say very candidly, as we talk about taxes, that I, for one--I \nmay be a minority of one--do not favor tax cuts at this time. I think \nthat we should be balancing the budget, period, at this time. But I \nthink we have to separate out the issue of the reformation of the \nMedicare fund itself.\n  I compare it to a situation of a home in Maine, by way of example. We \nare going into the winter season. We have a home that needs to be \nheated. And there is frost on the walls, and the inside of the walls, \nnot the outside. That is how cold it is. We have a home that is losing \nheat. We need to get heat into the home to keep people warm. The \nproblem is, you have several holes in the roof, and the windows are \nbroken, and we have an inefficient furnace in the basement.\n  Now, there are one or two ways that we can keep warm in that home. We \ncan try to buy more fuel. We do not have enough money, so we have to \nget a second or third job, assuming you can find a second or third job. \nAnd so we have to buy more fuel to put more fuel into the home to keep \nthe frost from freezing us inside. That is one way of doing it. That \nway would be to simply increase taxes. If you want the analogy to be \nmade properly, we just have more taxes to keep the system going at a \nrate of 10 percent growth. That is what we have to do, increase the \ntaxes.\n  I have not heard one single person on the other side call for a 44-\npercent increase in taxes, in the payroll tax of part A of the Medicare \ntrust fund. So we know that we would have to get more fuel oil or get a \nsecond or third job to buy more fuel oil to put oil in that house.\n  Or we could make the house more energy efficient. We could fix the \nholes in the roof. We could fix the windows that are broken. We could \nput a new furnace that is energy efficient in the basement and conserve \nenergy as opposed to allowing it to go out through the chimney and the \nholes in the roof and the windows.\n  That, basically, is what the Republicans have tried to do in terms of \nslowing down the growth of the Medicare fund as such to make it more \nefficient, to stop growing at a rate of 10 percent to 6.3 or 6.5. Now, \nPresident Clinton, to his credit, admitted that we have a problem, and \nhe suggested that we slow the growth down to 7.5 percent.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that there is room for agreement between our \ntwo parties, between the President and the Senate and the House. And \nright now, unfortunately, we are in a stage where we are setting the \nposture for a potential agreement sometime down the line.\n  But let us not make any mistake about it, we still need to reform the \nMedicare system. Part A and part B have to be reformed if we are going \nto ever stop the growth rate of 10 percent a year, which cannot be \nsustained under anyone's calculations without a major tax increase. And \nno one on that side of the aisle is talking about a major tax increase.\n  I would like to come back to a subject matter which I think has been \naddressed earlier but is of great importance to me because it deals, \nnot with Medicare, but Medicaid. One of the mistakes, I believe, that \nhas been made in the bill as reported out of the committee is that we \nare suddenly waiving many of the standards and regulations that have \nbeen hard fought in the field of nursing home care.\n  One of the first bills that I introduced back in 1973, in December \n1973, was the Nursing Home Patients' Bill of Rights. That came in the \nwake of a number of congressional investigations into absolutely \nintolerable conditions in nursing homes where patients were tied to \ntheir beds or wheelchairs, where they were medicated and overmedicated \nto the point where they were practically zombies, where a Senate aging \ncommittee called them warehouses for the dying.\n  As a result of the expose of the abuses that were taking place in the \nnursing home industry itself, we were able to, over a period of time, \nestablish nursing home patients' rights. Many of them have been put \ninto place by Executive order. Finally, under OBRA 87, the Omnibus \nReconciliation Act of 1987, we finally were able to put into law \nspecific regulations and standards about how these homes should be run \nand maintained.\n  We have, for all practical purposes, eliminated that under the bill. \nI hope that we can correct that. I believe that we can correct that, \nand we should correct it.\n  But tomorrow we are holding a hearing in the Aging Committee in which \nwe will again discuss the reasons why we need a continuation of the \nFederal standards and oversight and enforcement of nursing homes.\n  Let me give you just a couple examples.

They are \n     likely to find this is one area where uniform federal \n     standards make sense.\n       At issue is the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, the final \n     phase of which took effect just this past July. As part of \n     the move to turn Medicaid into block grants for the states, \n     Congress is trying to repeal the law and drastically reduce \n     funding of the nursing home enforcement system.\n       The 1987 law--which requires nursing homes that receive \n     Medicaid dollars to follow good nursing practices and protect \n     residents' rights--was the result of years of study, public \n     hearings and documentation of abuses, such as the use of \n     unnecessary physical restraints and excessive reliance on \n     drugs for behavior control.\n       The standards have been gradually phased into effect over \n     the past eight years. As of July 1, agencies such as the \n     Indiana State Department of Health have federal authority to \n     levy fines and ban admissions at homes that violate the \n     standards. As recent experience has shown, the law has \n     dramatically changed how officials police bad facilities.\n       For example: During the entire 11-year period from 1984 to \n     1995, Indiana assessed only 33 fines against nursing homes \n     for violating regulations. In the three months since July 1, \n     28 state fines have been levied, three homes barred from \n     accepting new residents pending resolution of problems and \n     four homes scrutinized by state monitors inside their \n     facilities. In addition, the federal government denied \n     Medicaid to 12 homes and issued 48 civil financial penalties.\n       If the proposed legislation passes, it is highly unlikely \n     states will replicate the federal law. In fact, they will be \n     under intense pressure from the nursing home industry to \n     deregulate facilities to compensate for Medicaid \n     reimbursement cuts. Beds for those who depend on Medicaid \n     will become sparse since long waiting lists are already \n     common.\n       Scott Severns, an Indianapolis attorney and president the \n     National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, \n     believes federal rules may actually save taxpayers' money \n     spent on the elderly. As a result of the '87 law, he notes, \n     hospitalizations of nursing home residents have dropped 25 \n     percent, which means less spent through Medicare.\n       ``Nursing home residents who are hospitalized for broken \n     bones, bedsores and infections from neglect cost far more \n     than residents who receive proper care,'' he says.\n       If Congress wants a compelling reason to preserve the \n     federal protection, it need look no further than Ritter \n     Health Care Center in Indianapolis.\n       Last month, state inspectors found Ritter residents tied \n     with gauze to rails and beds and smeared with food and body \n     wastes. Some were confined to rooms by greased door handles \n     because too few staff were available to supervise. One \n     resident on a liquid diet choked on a piece of food.\n       Ritter had been cited for numerous violations since 1993, \n     but never really punished. Thanks to the new federal tools, \n     the health department moved swiftly this time. The owners \n     have been fined and denied Medicaid eligibility. Tragically, \n     residents must now move elsewhere because of the facility's \n     failure to correct its problems.\n       That is how the federal law was designed to work. That is \n     how it is working in Indiana. At this point, it would be a \n     mistake to repeal what isn't broken.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 27, 1995]\n\n           Dropping Federal Regs Is an Invitation to Tragedy\n\n       Eight years ago, after 15 years of argument, Republicans \n     and Democrats in Congress got together to correct a public \n     embarrassment. They passed a law to stop nursing home \n     operators from abusing or neglecting the elderly.\n       They had ample incentive. Reports of residents lying in \n     excrement, dehydrated, malnourished or overmedicated were \n     commonplace. State regulation was a failure. Public outrage \n     was high.\n       It should be just as high now. The regulations created by \n     that law are about to be weakened or stripped away--victims \n     of a ideological crusade to curb federal authority, good or \n     bad.\n       Control would return to the state, despite their history of \n     failure.\n       Those pushing the new plan, House and Senate Republicans, \n     claim their legislation is not a repeal. They say the law is \n     ineffective. And they say it's hugely expensive.\n  All three claims are fiction.\n       Not a repeal? Under existing regulations violators are \n     subject to financial penalties, decertification, denial of \n     payments or takeover by temporary managers if they violate \n     health and safety standards. Proposed changes would weaken \n     enforcement by states that are vulnerable to powerful lobby \n     groups. The Senate wouldn't require inspections, nurse \n     staffing or protections against restraints or medication.\n       Not effective? A government study of 269 homes in 10 states \n     cited impressive results. The study found hospitalization of \n     nursing home residents down 25%, use of restraints down 25%, \n     and detection and punishment of abuses increasing.\n       Too expensive? Quite the contrary. A study of 9,000 Georgia \n     nursing-home residents reports a monthly $76,738 savings by \n     curtailing unnecessary drug therapy, thanks to the \n     regulations. And that's not an isolated case. The National \n     Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, a resident \n     advocacy group, says the changes saved billions in costs \n     attributed to poor treatment.\n       Even the American Health Care Association, representing \n     nursing home owners, says costs have not been a problem.\n       In fact, nursing home owners signed onto the legislation \n     when it passed in 1987. So did consumer groups. So did state \n     officials. So did the Institute of Medicine, research arm of \n     the National Academy of Sciences, whose 1986 report on \n     nursing home conditions led to the reform.\n       No credible evidence exists to justify reversing course. If \n     changes are necessary they should be based on the same kind \n     of thorough study and public hearings that produced the \n     original regulations.\n       Seniors are in nursing homes because of advanced age, \n     mental or physical disabilities, to recover from \n     hospitalization or because they have no one to care for them. \n     They are frail and vulnerable. They deserve all the \n     protection the public can provide.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 18, 1995]\n\n                      Keep Nursing Home Standards\n\n       In its ongoing effort to give more power to the states, \n     Congress wants to scrap Federal standards for quality of care \n     in nursing homes. Given past abuses that the standards were \n     designed to guard against, and the future need for even more \n     nursing homes, this is an invitation to trouble. There may \n     well be room to revise the Federal standards to make them \n     simpler and less costly. But with vast changes occurring in \n     the health-care system, the need for Federal standards to \n     insure minimal quality is greater than ever.\n       It was only about 20 years ago that a series of media \n     exposes, state government reports and legislative hearings \n     revealed widespread abuses in nursing homes, from unsanitary \n     conditions and malnutrition to overmedication, neglect and \n     sexual, and physical abuse. In 1987 Congress passed the \n     Nursing Home Reform Act, which set national standards for \n     staff training, individual assessments of patients and \n     protection of basic patient rights, including the right not \n     to be physically restrained, the right to voice grievances \n     and the right to be notified before transfer or discharge.\n       The law has begun to make a difference. In the mid-1980's, \n     about 40 percent of nursing home patients were physically \n     restrained; now, less than 20 percent are. Improved care has \n     also led to savings on medications and unnecessary \n     hospitalizations.\n       Now Congress is trying to reshape the health-care system by \n     sharply cutting Medicaid, which provides about 60 percent of \n     nursing home funding, and shifting the money to state control \n     through block grants. Congress wants to cut $182 billion out \n     of Medicaid over seven years, which would likely lead to \n     reduced reimbursement rates for nursing home services and \n     facilities.\n       Many states are insisting that, if they are to assume \n     control of a reduced pot of money, they must have the power \n     to set their own nursing home standards to eliminate needless \n     costs. House and Senate committees have separately passed \n     bills that would give states primary responsibility for \n     setting quality-of-care standards for nursing homes, with \n     Washington offering only general categories to be covered. \n     Nursing home providers could lean on states to cut back on \n     standards that they will not be able to live up to for lack \n     of funds.\n       Nearly two million people now reside in nursing homes. But \n     with an estimated 43 percent of people over 65 years of age \n     likely to spend some time in a nursing home, and an aging \n     baby-boomer population, the demand for these facilities will \n     only grow. To abandon national standards now may invite a \n     return to the nursing home disasters of the past.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. We have had over 50--at least 50--congressional hearings \nand reports over the years dealing with nursing homes, going back all \nthe way to 1965. This only starts in 1986. We have had many more since \nthat time.\n  But let me just cite you some examples of what is taking place, even \nas I speak.\n  Recently in Maryland, a resident expired due to strangulation from an \nopposing restraint because the resident was not properly wearing a \nrestraint.\n  In Ohio, we had a resident who died due to strangulation from a vest-\ntype restraint that was incorrectly applied.\n\n[[Page S15669]]\n\n  In Florida, we had a resident who was sexually assaulted by a nurse's \naid.\n  In Indiana, a resident was found with maggots in wounds.\n  In Ohio, a resident was being fed with a syringe and aspirated. The \nstaff was unaware what to do. The resident became cyanotic and was \nsubsequently hospitalized.\n  In Louisiana, we had a resident who was left unattended in a \ngeriwalker and fell. She hit her head and required hospitalization.\n  In Texas, a resident was force fed with a syringe and aspirated and \nwas hospitalized.\n  In Maine, we had a resident die of pressure sores.\n  In Indiana, a resident fell down the stairs and was killed.\n  In Indiana, a resident in respiratory distress was left unattended \nfor 7 hours. The resident died.\n  In North Carolina, a resident required thickening liquids to prevent \nchoking. It was not provided. The resident developed aspiration \npneumonia.\n  In Indiana, a resident was missing from the facility. He was found \ntwo blocks away.\n  I could go on for some length this evening, which I will not do. I \nsuggest we have to make modifications to this legislation to make sure \nthat we tell the States, ``No, we are not simply turning it all over to \nyou, that, because Medicaid has been turned over in the form of a block \ngrant as such, we still expect some standards and oversight and \nenforcement on the part of the Federal Government.''\n  This is not something that the States can say, ``Wait a minute. This \nis a Federal mandate here.'' We have $800 billion going to the States \nin the next 7 years, $800 billion. That gives us some right, it would \nseem to me, to say that there ought to be standards that have been set. \nThey ought to be enforced, and we ought to maintain a level of \noversight that will, in fact, make sure that we do not have a \nrepetition of some of the things that I have outlined here tonight. \nThese are just symptomatic; these are just a small sample.\n  I know my friend from New Mexico is sensitive to this. He served with \nme on the Aging Committee. The Presiding Officer sitting in the chair \nalso serves in that committee. And we will hear more about this. We \nneed to make sure that when you finally come to that position in life \nwhere you have to take a parent or a grandparent and turn them into the \narms of those who run our nursing homes--that is just the beginning--we \nhave to make sure that those facilities are well run, they are well \nmanaged, that the residents are properly cared for, so that the people \nwho have entrusted their loved ones into the hands of these individuals \nwho are running the nursing homes do, in fact, treat them with loving \ncare, and make sure that we are satisfied that that is so.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will not take the time this evening--I have, I \nthink, just a few moments remaining--other than to indicate that my \nfriend from New Mexico is aware of my concern about this. I know that \nhe and others are working along, hopefully, with others on both sides \nto make sure that this is corrected. I believe it is a deficiency. We \nneed to correct it. And it should be done, if not this evening, \ncertainly tomorrow before we proceed further. And I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I would like to commend the Senator from Maine for his words about a \nhidden part of this bill.\n  It is a very large bill, and in it is a repeal of Federal nursing \nhome standards. In the Budget Committee on which I serve, I raised this \nissue. I have spoken about this issue on the floor. It is truly music \nto my ears to hear you speak about this as eloquently as you have.\n  I am sure you are aware that Senator Pryor has put together an \namendment. I know he was looking forward to working with you on it, and \nI am a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  I happen to have had the sad circumstance of losing my mother a few \nyears ago, and she died in a nursing home. Even with the Federal \nstandards, I say to my friend, it is an awfully difficult situation. \nThe people are so vulnerable. They are as vulnerable, in many ways, as \nlittle babies. It just tears your heart out.\n  To think that we would allow 50 separate legislatures and 50 separate \nGovernors to say, ``Well, gee, maybe we don't have enough money in \nthis, maybe we do,'' I think is just too important.\n  I am so pleased to hear the Senator from Maine say that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, my chairman, is concerned about this matter. I hope we \ncan reach across the aisle and maybe restore those national standards.\n  I think it is something we did because there was a crying need. I \nagree that change is wonderful, but sometimes it does not make sense to \nchange something when we learned how rough it was out there in those \nnursing homes.\n  I want to thank my friend very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes off the bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Cohen for his statement tonight and his \nefforts in the past on the Aging Committee. He has done excellent work. \nEverybody knows the committee is a factfinding committee, but you have \nturned it into more than a factfinding committee because much \nlegislation has come from the hearings you held.\n  We had one in the recent past, which you actually brought forth, with \nreference to fraud, saving money, some abuses on the side of the SSI \nProgram, which were clearly brought out by your committee. I thank you \nfor that, and I can assure you we have your concerns under our serious \nconsideration, as we move through in an effort to get a good bill that \npasses the Senate and goes on its way to a conference in the House.\n  Let me also compliment Senator Abraham for this particular amendment \nthat we are now addressing. Actually, nothing bothers senior citizens \nmore than what they consider to be a rat's nest as they look at their \nbills and they look at the processes and they receive documentation on \nwhat they owe and what Medicare owes or what Medicaid owes--total \nconfusion.\n  Some of them try to find out if they have been gouged. Some try to \nfind out if they have been overcharged or even that they have been \ncharged for something they do not remember getting.\n  Frankly, it is so complicated that they give up. We are losing \nbecause of that. One of the most credible and reliable ways to control \ncosts is by having an informed patient concerned about costs. In fact, \nI think that everyone would agree that over the past 30 years, one of \nthe reasons that health care costs have spiraled is because we are \ndeveloping a culture where the recipient of the benefits pays so little \nor nothing that they never challenge the bills and, as a result, if it \ngoes unchallenged long enough, it gets pretty loose, to be kind of \nmodest in one statement.\n  This amendment says we want to take back the patient, the senior \ncitizen and make them part of the army that polices fraud and abuse. \nThis says if, in fact, the senior finds that they are going to share, \nby way of a portion of the recovery that is made, it will be an \nincentive to them.\n  This is new and different. Some might say it will not work but, \nfrankly, what we have been doing is not working. So it seems to this \nSenator that what we ought to do is adopt this amendment, make sure it \nbecomes part of the law, and as we move through our reform, give \nseniors more choice which is going to permit them to be more selective, \nmore concerned and to gain more from watching the bills. This ought to \nbecome part of the substantive law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Before the Senator puts in a quorum call, I hope he will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Without losing my right to the floor I will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This Senator came to the floor in good faith because I \nthought that when time was through, then there would be an opportunity \nfor \n\n[[Page S15670]]\n\nan amendment. I was going to offer a second-degree amendment. I wonder \nwhy that is not appropriate to do at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I humbly apologize. What is the \nSenator's question again? I was trying to get your question answered, \nbut I did not listen to you. So that is not very good.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My question was, I thought under the rules, after the \ntime on the amendment ran out, that it would be open for amendment. I \nhad a second-degree amendment I was going to offer. I was going to do \nit at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me tell you what I understood the \nsituation was, and we have the minority leader here. I think what we \nsaid is the Abraham amendment will be second-degreed, and you all can \namend it, but we would like to see the amendment before we agree to \nthat. I just got the amendment, and I would like very much just to look \nat it for a minute and get right back to you, during which time I will \nask for a quorum call. I reinstate my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me sort of outline here what we have \nagreed to do. I want to thank the Democratic leader and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and others who have been working on this, along with \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford.\n  As I understand it, we have laid aside the Rockefeller Medicare \namendment and the Brown amendment to Rockefeller. The Abraham amendment \nis pending, and that will be second-degreed by Senator Harkin. After \nthat debate, that will be laid aside, and then the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Bradley] will offer a motion to recommit EITC, and \nRepublicans will offer a first-degree amendment.\n  Following that, we will recess for the night, leaving approximately 8 \nhours remaining. Then tomorrow morning, the Senator from New Jersey \nwill have an additional 20 minutes or 30 minutes starting at 9 o'clock \non the EITC.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time is Senator Bradley getting? Is he getting \na special privilege or the regular time?\n  Mr. DOLE. The regular time. He will save 30 minutes of his allotted \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator should speak tonight. The whole \nworld will turn him on and turn the baseball game off.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the Senator will yield, I think the Senator is \nquoting me in my conversation with him, and he should attribute that to \nme.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was merely repeating what the Senator said.\n  Mr. DOLE. Anyway, there will be 30 minutes, and then after that, that \nwould be laid aside and then there would be a motion to recommit \nMedicaid, and there will be no first-degree amendments to that. That \nwill be followed by either an amendment or a motion on education, and \nthen a amendment or motion on deficit reduction, or an amendment or \nmotion on rural restoration.\n  That takes us to approximately 12:30, at which time we hope to be \nable to say that we have worked out some agreement, where they will \nhave either up or down votes on their first-degree amendments or \nmotions to recommit, and we will have up or down votes. There will not \nbe any second-degrees on, say, the Abraham amendment, or on the other \namendments, but vote on or in relation to, and motions to table. I \nthink that fairly well covers it. In other words, if we reach an \nagreement, Republicans may withdraw all second- and first-degree \namendments and have votes in relation to the major amendments. \nDemocrats will do the same on the amendments pending. That will take us \nto 12:30 p.m. tomorrow. Do I properly State the understanding, I ask \nthe Democratic leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that clearly articulates, I think, the \nagreement that we have. We will have a series of amendments tomorrow \nmorning. I urge all Democratic Senators to be on the floor to offer the \namendments and participate in the debate. We will continue to negotiate \nduring that time, with an expectation of having some final \nunderstanding of whether or not we can reach an agreement by tomorrow \nnoon. And then we will work from there.\n  Mr. DOLE. That would, in effect, take care of your so-called tier 1 \namendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I make that request. Is there any objection to my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it has been accepted, but might I ask \nboth leaders this. It is clear that if we do not have an agreement and \nall of the first-degree amendments that were offered by the Democrats \nthat have been set aside, we can offer our second-degrees to them, is \nthat understood?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is the understanding of the two leaders. Hopefully, we \ncan reach an agreement where they can get up or down votes or motions \nto table and we can have the same. If we cannot, we are back to square \none and we start voting.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I thank the minority leader and \nthose who worked with him, including Senator Exon and others. We \noffered you something a little different than that and, frankly, I \nthink this accommodates both, and we are very pleased you were able to \nhelp us work it out. I thank you very much.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished majority leader, \nwhen do we vote? Are all the votes going to be stacked? It appears to \nthis Senator that once you debate an amendment, you debate the second-\ndegree, you ought to vote on it and then we lose--maybe that is what \nyou want to do--but it seems to me that once an amendment is debated, \nif there is a second-degree amendment, that is debated and, at that \npoint, we ought to vote on it rather than keep stacking. I know you are \ntrying to work out an arrangement here, but something is going to be \nretroactive based on whatever the agreement might be.\n  I just hope that at some point we will get to where we can vote and \nget that part behind us. We understand probably the numbers of the \nvotes, but there might be a surprise or two in this.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not disagree with the Senator. But I think until we \nhave an agreement, it probably would not work, because we would be \nforced, in effect, to offer amendments and may not want to offer \namendments. We will keep that in mind. I think you are right, we ought \nto have the amendment and second degree, and then vote. I think while \nwe are trying to work this out--well, we should know by 1 o'clock \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In addition to that, Mr. President, I share with the \ndistinguished minority whip that it is our intention to try to utilize \nthe time we have and to avoid second-degrees, if it is at all possible, \nto allow us more opportunities to offer our amendments.\n  I ask the majority leader, we have shared the first and the second \ntier with the leader. I am wondering if you might have the list of \nRepublican amendments that you are planning to offer so that we might \nhave the evening to take a look at them. If that could be accommodated, \nthat would be helpful.\n  Mr. DOLE. The majority whip is working on a list and when it is \navailable, we can do that. I think the majority whip is working on that \nlist as I speak.\n  Is there any objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. That will be the last vote today. There will be no more \nvotes today or during the evening.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2957 to Amendment No. 2950\n\n (Purpose: To strengthen efforts to combat Medicare waste, fraud, and \n                                 abuse)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2957 to amendment No. 2950.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S15671]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is an amendment to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, and it \ndeals with waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system. I might just \nsay at the outset that while I have no real disagreements with the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan--it is not a bad \namendment--it just does not go very far. There is a lot more that I \nthink needs to be done in the whole area of waste, fraud, and abuse \nthan is encompassed either in the underlying bill or the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, for the last several years, I have been privileged to \nchair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education and Related Agencies.\n  In that capacity, at least once a year, I had a hearing on the issue \nof waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. Just about every year I asked \nthe GAO to do a study on one facet or another of the waste, abuse, or \nfraud in the Medicare System.\n  We have had several of those, and two or three inspector general \nreports on that subject also during that period of time.\n  It seems that every year we would uncover something and try to take \nsome action to stop it, and it would only pop up in another place and \nbe even worse.\n  I became convinced over the last couple of years that major changes \nhad to be made in the way we address the issue of waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, these GAO reports that we have had done are available \nto Senators. Here is one that we had on medical supplies that was done \nover the last year, issued in August 1995.\n  Let me say for the record what the GAO found in their study of the \npurchase of medical supplies. They went in and did a random sample of \nsupplies that were paid for by Medicare. They went behind the supplies \nto get an itemized list.\n  When they looked at it, the result was startling. The GAO found that \n89 percent of the claims should have been partially or totally denied; \n61 percent of the money paid out should never have been paid out.\n  That is a lot of money, Mr. President, because last year Medicare \npaid out about $6.8 billion for medical supplies. If that sample that \nGAO took was representative, and I believe it probably was, you are \ntalking somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 billion going for wasteful, \nduplicative, and fraudulent spending.\n  While we may not get all of that, we certainly ought to be able to \nget a good share of that money back for our taxpayers who are paying \nthis money in.\n  There are a lot of other programs. The computer system that HCFA \nused, for Health Care Financing Administration, the computers are \noutdated. It is as if we were all using manual typewriters, that is how \noutdated their hardware and software is. Here is another report we had \nfrom the GAO outlining that.\n  Very briefly, what the amendment I have offered does is add to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan. Basically, it \nstrengthens the sanctions against providers who rip-off Medicare. Those \nconvicted of health care fraud and felonies would be kicked out of \nMedicare. Maximum fines would be increased. What we also did, Mr. \nPresident, I think the heart and soul of the whole thing, is that we \nhave to go to competitive bidding.\n  We found, for example, that Medicare was paying up to 86 cents for a \nbandage that the Veterans Administration only pays 4 cents for. We \nfound in durable medical equipment that Medicare was paying up to \n$3,600 a year for an oxygen concentrator that only costs $1,000. The \nVeterans Administration was reimbursing at only about $1,200 a year--\none-third of what Medicare was reimbursing. Same for oxygen equipment \nand everything.\n  Time and again, we have found the Veterans Administration was \nsubstantially below what Medicare was paying for the same items. The \nreason for that is because the Veterans Administration competitively \nbids for durable medical equipment, services, and for supplies; \nMedicare does not.\n  Usually, when I tell audiences that, they cannot believe it. They \ncannot believe we would not do something so simple and straightforward \nand so market-oriented as to require competitive bidding for supplies, \nservices, and durable medical equipment.\n  This started when Medicare first came in 1965--a fee schedule was set \nup for the items, and it has rolled on year after year after year.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I say in all candor, those entities, \nthose companies involved in this, have had a sweetheart deal. They have \nopposed efforts in this Congress and in other Congresses to do away \nwith the fee schedule and go to competitive bidding. I can understand \nwhy--because they are really ripping off the system.\n  Mr. President, we had a study done on duplicative claims. Case after \ncase where a doctor put in for, say, two X rays; the GAO found out he \nshould have only been paid for one X ray. On and on.\n  Again, this is because GAO's computers could not pick it up. We had \ntestimony from one private insurance carrier who also did the billing \nfor Medicare. They had one set of computers and software for their \nprivate side of what they did; they had another set for what they did \nfor Medicare.\n  The examples were astounding about how for the same claims, covering \nthe same items, under the private side the computers and their programs \nwould pick up duplicative claims and spit those out so they would not \npay it. On the Medicare side, because of the old software and \ncomputers, they would not catch it and out would go the money for two X \nrays when only one was required.\n  So our amendment, the amendment I offered, requires competitive bid. \nThat, I believe--we can do anything we want to Medicare. Want to cut \nmoney, want to save money in Medicare you can do all you want to and \njimmy the system, but until we have competitive bidding we are really \nnot going to get to the bottom of the extensive amount of money that \ngoes out.\n  What are we talking about? GAO estimates that up to 10 percent of \nMedicare spending goes for waste, fraud, and abuse. You figure $170 \nbillion this year in Medicare, if we took 10 percent, that is $17 \nbillion a year. We are talking about 7 years here. Mr. President, $17 \nbillion a year for 7 years, and you have more than enough to take care \nof fixing up the Medicare system just by clamping down on waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  I realize we cannot get all of that but if we could just get half of \nit, if we could just get half of it, we would save our taxpayers and we \nwould save the beneficiaries from having to pay more money.\n  Our amendment provides for that competitive bidding. It would \nspecifically prohibit also Medicare payments for a number of items \nclearly not related to quality patient care.\n  For example, we found, Mr. President, that Medicare was paying for \ntickets to sporting events, personal use of automobiles, and we even \nfound that they were paying for travel to Italy to examine art to be \nput into a hospital. Medicare was picking that up. Our amendment \nexpressly prohibits that.\n  Another part of our amendment clamps down on improper payment for \nambulance services. Again, another GAO report that we had done shows \nthat ambulance services are charging the highest rate for ambulance \nservices even though they are not using all of the equipment or they \nare not using the more expensive ambulance services when they go out to \npick up a patient.\n  Also, our amendment, as I said, puts funds in there so they can get \nupdated computers, so they can stop the double billing.\n  GAO estimated that if this amendment, this part of the amendment that \nwe offered, to require Medicare to employ the commercial software that \nis available and to do it within 6 months--and GAO said they could do \nit within 6 months--that in the first year we could save $600 million \njust by employing this software.\n  Mr. President, our amendment would strengthen the criminal penalties \nand also provide rewards up to $10,000 to individuals who report \nviolations of the law which result in criminal convictions for health \ncare fraud.\n\n[[Page S15672]]\n\n  Our amendment also provides for uniform application process for \nhealth care providers seeking to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. \nRight now, there is just too much paperwork. Our amendment says one \nstandardized form for the submission of claims under Medicare and \nMedicaid. Again, Mr. President, that would save countless millions of \ndollars.\n  So, in sum, Mr. President, this amendment builds on what the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan does and what is in the \nbill. What is in the bill, and even with the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Michigan, really does not get to the real problem.\n  I repeat for emphasis' sake, the real problem in Medicare is lack of \ncompetitive billing. All of those who believe in the market system and \nwho believe the market system gets you the best services and the best \nprices, you ought to be for this amendment. We ought to, for once and \nfor all, require competitive bidding for Medicare just like we do the \nVeterans Administration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use to \nbriefly comment on the amendment before us, and then I will yield \nfurther time to other Members on our side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield 5 minutes to me first and then \nproceed?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In the short timeframe of this evening, not even an \nearly part of the day, because I did not keep tabs on all times, but \nSenators on the other side of the aisle--this evening it was Senator \nDorgan and my colleague, Senator Bingaman--took to the floor and talked \nabout the distribution of the tax cuts. And Senator Dorgan said nobody \nhas disavowed and disproved that 50 percent goes to the very wealthy \npeople.\n  Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that was first reported in \nthe Wall Street Journal article, and the Joint Tax Committee writes the \nchairman of the Finance Committee a letter on October 24. Let me read a \nparagraph.\n\n       No factual basis exists for the assertion (since retracted) \n     contained in the Wall Street Journal of last week asserting \n     that one-half of all households would experience a tax \n     increase under the Senate Finance Committee revenue \n     [package].\n\n  In other words, it was retracted by the Wall Street Journal but it \ncontinues to be used. And in this letter the Joint Tax Committee states \nthe following, and let me read it. Calendar year 1996, without EITC \nchanges.\n  Some will say wait, you have to have EITC in it. I will put it in. \nJust a minute.\n  For 1996, it says, ``Under $75,000 is 77 percent; under $100,000 is \n90 percent.'' In 1996, they confirm that the tax cut, that 77 percent \ngoes to people under $75,000 in earnings.\n  In the year 2000, because there are some changes--let us put it all \non the table--68 percent of the then-completed tax cuts go to $75,000 \nand under, and 83 percent to $100,000 and less.\n  Now, let us use EITC, since Chairman Roth asked them: Check about the \nEITC. So we make sure we got that. With the EITC tax changes, this \nconfirmation letter says the following. In 1996, the tax distribution \nis as follows: ``Under $75,000, 75 percent. Under $100,000, 89 \npercent.'' It has been changed by 1 percent, from 90 percent to 89 \npercent.\n  In the year 2000, with the EITC tax changes, 65 percent of the \ndistribution is wage earners under $75,000 and 81 percent under \n$100,000.\n  If you are talking about taxes, that is the authentic story, from the \nauthentic source. And this one, even the President has decided not to \ndo his own. Everybody uses the Joint Tax Committee. And they are saying \nthis.\n  So, when anyone comes down on the other side and says nobody has \ndisproved it, disavowed it, we are going to put the letter in the \nRecord.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record at this point, \nthe letter dated October 24, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of October 23, 1995, in which you asked me to address several \n     questions with respect to the revenue recommendations \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, October \n     19, 1995, and previously approved reforms to the Earned \n     Income Credit (``EIC''). The highlights of my response to \n     your questions are set forth immediately below. Detailed \n     answers to each of your questions are provided in the \n     supplemental submission which accompanies this letter.\n       No factual basis exists for the assertion (since retracted) \n     contained in the Wall Street Journal of last week asserting \n     that one-half of all households would experience a tax \n     increase under the Senate Finance Committee revenue \n     recommendations--even if one were to include the effects of \n     the EIC reforms previously approved by the Senate Finance \n     Committee.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation did not change its \n     distribution analysis of the Senate Finance Committee's \n     revenue recommendations. Our analysis of this set of \n     proposals indicates:\n\n              PERCENTAGE OF TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME CLASSES             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Percent      \n                                                   ---------------------\n                   Calendar year                      Under      Under  \n                                                     $75,000    $100,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996..............................................         77         90\n2000..............................................         68         83\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The distribution analysis does not change significantly if \n     one also includes the EIC reforms (including the EIC outlay \n     reductions) approved by the Senate Finance Committee in a \n     separate mark-up (as requested by Senator Moynihan):\n\n              PERCENTAGE OF TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME CLASSES             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Percent      \n                                                   ---------------------\n                   Calendar year                      Under      Under  \n                                                     $75,000    $100,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996..............................................         72         88\n2000..............................................         61         79\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       At Senator Nickles' request we also prepared an analysis of \n     the Senate Finance Committee's revenue recommendations, \n     including the effects of EIC reforms previously approved by \n     the Senate Finance Committee, but limited to the revenue \n     effects of the EIC reforms, i.e., excluding the outlay or \n     spending portion of the proposed EIC reforms. That analysis \n     indicates the following:\n\n              PERCENTAGE OF TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME CLASSES             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Percent      \n                                                   ---------------------\n                   Calendar year                      Under      Under  \n                                                     $75,000    $100,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996..............................................         75         89\n2000..............................................         65         81\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       With respect to the Senate Finance Committee's previously \n     approved EIC reforms, our analysis of the combined effects of \n     the Senate Finance Committee's EIC reforms, the $500 child \n     credit and marriage penalty relief for 1996 indicates that \n     less than 1.5 percent of all households will have in income \n     tax increase as a result of the EIC reforms. Other key points \n     to consider include: 3.6 million households without children \n     would no longer receive an EIC beginning in 1996. This reform \n     reinstates the pre-1993 policy of providing an EIC only to \n     families with children. Approximately 1.2 million households \n     will owe income taxes as a result of this change.\n       Of the remaining 14.7 million households with children who \n     would be eligible for the EIC, approximately 14 million would \n     not have an increase in their income taxes over current law. \n     Approximately 700,000 households would owe income taxes \n     because of the Senate Finance Committee's EIC anti-fraud and \n     illegal alien provisions and the affluence reforms that count \n     certain types of income in determining eligibility for the \n     EIC.\n       Families who are currently eligible for the maximum EIC \n     (families with children and having adjusted gross income \n     under $12,000) will receive an even larger EIC next year and \n     thereafter. For example: (i) The maximum EIC for a family \n     with one child will increase from $2,094 in 1995 to $2,156 in \n     1996. (ii) The maximum EIC for a family with two or more \n     children will increase from $3,110 in 1995 to $3,208 in 1996.\n       In addition, since these families would not owe any taxes \n     under the Senate Finance Committee's revenue recommendations, \n     the full amount of their EIC would represent an outlay \n     payment from the Federal government.\n       Families living at or near the poverty line (one-child \n     families with earnings under $12,500 and two-child families \n     with earnings under $15,500) would continue to receive an EIC \n     in excess of the family's Federal payroll taxes (employee and \n     employer shares).\n       Even after the Senate Finance Committee's EIC reforms, the \n     cost of the EIC would exceed $20 billion in 1996 and \n     thereafter.\n       The share of federal taxes paid by higher-income \n     individuals under the Senate Reconciliation bill would \n     actually increase as compared with Federal taxes paid under \n     current law.\n\n[[Page S15673]]\n\n       If you have any questions about this information, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth J.

Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may need \njust to make a couple of comments on the second-degree amendment to the \nfirst-degree amendment, and then I will yield the balance of time on \nthat point.\n  The Senator from Iowa commented that the first-degree amendment was a \ngood amendment, but not nearly adequate to deal with the issues of \nfraud and abuse in the Medicare system. I do not disagree with that \npoint. It was not intended to be the comprehensive solution to fraud \nand abuse problems with Medicare.\n  Indeed, we do not need that in my amendment because the \nreconciliation bill includes a whole variety of projects and sections \nwhich try to address these problems.\n  First, the Senate Republican proposal directs the Secretary of HHS, \nthrough the inspector general, and the Attorney General to establish a \njoint program to coordinate Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nefforts to combat health care fraud and abuse.\n  Second, our bill creates a new health care antifraud and abuse \naccount to cover the cost of this coordinated health care antifraud and \nabuse program between the inspector general at HHS, the FBI, State \nfraud control units, and Department of Justice prosecutors. All moneys \ncollected in the form of penalties, fines, forfeitures, and damages \nfrom health care fraud cases will be turned back over to the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund.\n  Third, the bill establishes new health care antifraud and abuse \nguidelines relating to safe harbors, interpretative rulings, and \nspecial fraud alerts. For instance, under this provision, any person \nmay request the HHS inspector general investigate and issue a special \nfraud alert informing the public about suspected fraudulent activities \nagainst Medicare or Medicaid.\n  Fourth, the bill strengthens current sanctions by requiring the \nSecretary of HHS to exclude from receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment \nindividuals and entities against whom there have been convictions for \nfraudulent activities.\n  Fifth, we create intermediate sanctions for the Secretary of HHS to \nuse against Medicare HMO's which fail to live up to contractual \nresponsibilities. Civil monetary penalties range from $10,000 to \n$100,000.\n  Sixth, our bill establishes a national health care fraud and abuse \ndata collection program and requires the information collected be made \navailable to Federal and State government agencies and health care \nplans.\n  Seventh, this proposal increases the amount of civil monetary \npenalties for current law, adds new offenses to those subject to civil \nmonetary penalties, and requires that all civil monetary penalties be \nused to reimburse the Medicare or Medicaid program and any remaining \ndollars be returned to the health care fraud account.\n  Eighth, for the first time, a health care fraud section is added to \nthe criminal code.\n  Ninth, this measure extends the authority of State health care fraud \ncontrol units by allowing the Units to investigate other Federal fraud \nabuses and allowing investigation and prosecution in the case of \npatient abuse in non-Medicaid board and care facilities.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the 10th reason the Senate Republican bill is \ntough on fraud and abuse is that it will clarify existing provisions of \nthe criminal antikickback law in the areas of discounting and managed \ncare related to Medicare choice plans. Direct the Secretary of HHS to \nstudy the benefits of volume and combination discounts to the Medicare \nProgram and develop regulations based on the findings of such a study.\n  And I just conclude my statement by saying we have worked hard \nalready in this legislation to address the areas of fraud and abuse in \nMedicare to try to save the taxpayers' dollars. I would just add this \npoint. As I inspected the things that we had already done, it struck me \nthe one missing ingredient, important missing ingredient was to provide \nan incentive whereby the Medicare beneficiaries themselves could help \nus to solve these problems in the years ahead and to provide an \nincentive for the Medicare beneficiaries to help us solve these \nproblems in the twin approaches which we have outlined in our \namendment.\n  That said, at this point----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield just to engage in a 2-minute \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I committed time at this point to other Members. Maybe \nthey would be able to yield at this point, but I have to, at this \npoint, yield my time to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Might I make an inquiry as to how much time we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to ask one very small thing.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator was very thoughtful. As I said, I do not \nreally have much argument with what is in the bill. I am not trying to \nundo what is in it, nor the Senator's amendment. But I still think the \nheart and soul of this is competitive bidding. I hope the Senator will \nthink about that. Maybe we might reach some agreement on this. But I \nthink the time is long past when we should put out competitive bidding \njust like they do in the Veterans Administration. I hope your side \nmight take a look at that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this point, I would like to yield 12 of our remaining \nminutes to the Senator from New Hampshire, to be followed by 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding this time. I think it is important at this juncture in the \ndebate, because so much has been discussed relative to the impacts of \nthe Medicare activity within this bill and all these numbers that have \nbeen put on the floor, to maybe go back and review where we are, \nespecially in the context of this amendment that has been brought \nforward by the Senator from Michigan, which is an excellent amendment, \nand the amendment which has been brought forward by the Senator from \nIowa, because the Senator from Iowa keeps referring to the fact that \nthe essence of cost control in Medicare should be competitive bidding.\n  If that is the Senator's position, and that is the position of the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle, then they should be embracing \nwith enthusiasm the proposal for strengthening Medicare which we have \nput forward in this bill because our proposal is competitive bidding. \nWhat we are saying to the senior citizens of this country is today you \nare locked into a single-source provider, or approach called fee for \nservice. But we are going to open the marketplace up to you. We are \ngoing to give you, the seniors of this country, choices--essentially \nthe same choices in concept that Members of Congress have. We are going \nto allow you to choose between groups of doctors practicing together in \nwhat is known as PPO's, and doctors practicing together with hospitals \nin what is known as HMO's, and groups of doctors and hospitals \npracticing together in all different kinds of imagination for which we \ndo not have names and titles for, euphemisms, initials, and titles for; \nmedical savings accounts, and your present fee-for-service proposal \nwhich you can participate in. We will not limit your ability to \nparticipate in that. But we will open the marketplace to competitive \nbidding for your dollars that you are spending on Medicare today and on \nyour health care.\n  That is the essence of our proposal. It is to bring the marketplace \ninto the Medicare system, something that has been ignored over the last \n20 years as we have seen Medicare evolve.\n  The impact of doing that is essentially what the Senator from Iowa \nhas mentioned. He thinks the impact of bringing competitive bidding \ninto a narrow band of purchasing activities on Medicare, the impact of \nbringing competitive bidding to the entire concept of health care and \nthe marketplace into the Medicare system, is to control the rate of \ngrowth of costs of the Medicare system. Why are we doing this? We are \ndoing it because if we do not control the rate of growth for the \nMedicare system we have been told by \n\n[[Page S15674]]\n\nthe Medicare trustees that the Medicare system will go bankrupt. \nUnfortunately, earlier today we heard about the fact that statements \nwere made on the other side of the aisle from some of the Members that \nwe, in controlling the rate of growth of the Medicare system, are \nundermining the Medicare system; the fact we are trying to keep the \nMedicare system from growing at the 10-percent rate of growth, which \nthe trustees have said is going to lead to bankruptcy, is being \nconstrued on that side of the aisle as somehow irresponsible.\n  I find it very difficult to follow the logic of that argument \nbecause, as the trustees have told us, a 10-percent rate of growth is \nnot sustainable, and will lead to bankruptcy. How can you come forward \non the floor of this Senate and say that, when we are trying to control \nthat rate of growth and allow a rate of growth which is sustainable \nwhich allows the trust fund to remain solvent, we are being \nirresponsible?\n  The irresponsibility lies with those who continue to allow the costs \nto escalate uncontrolled at a 10-percent rate of growth and, therefore, \nwould lead to bankruptcy of the system. The way we are planning to \ncontrol those costs is through competitive bidding, using the \nmarketplace, giving seniors options which they presently do not have, \nto go out and choose different forms of health care delivery; being \nabsolutely clear at the same time that, if they want to stay in the \nsystem they want today, if they want to stay in fee for service, they \ncan do that.\n  What has been the experience that leads us to believe that by giving \nseniors more choices we will end up being able to control the rate of \ngrowth in health care costs? It is what has happened in the private \nsector. The private sector, over the last 5 years especially, has seen \na major move of employee insured groups going from fee for service into \nsome sort of coordinated care delivery, some sort of fixed cost \ninsurance program. The experience has generated some fairly clear \nguideposts for us in the public sector as we attempt to give our \nseniors who are getting Medicare today the same type of options that \nthose of us in the Senate have, and that many people in the private \nsector have, which is the opportunity to choose different types of \nhealth care delivery services.\n  This chart that I have here reflects what has happened in the private \nsector as we have seen a movement of approximately 60 percent of the \npopulation from fee for service into different types of coordinated \ncare, or care with a fixed cost paid up front. This red line is the \nrate of inflation in health care costs. The blue bars indicate the rate \nof enrollment in managed care types of plans. As you see with the \nmanaged care enrollment going up, the rate of health care costs, \ninflation, has gone down. In fact, it has dropped by about 50 percent. \nIt has dropped so much that, for example, in the Federal employee plan, \nwhich is the plan that basically we are tracking at least in concept--\nnot specific but in concept--with what we are going to offer senior \ncitizens, last year the Federal employee plan had no health care \ninflation. This year it will have no health care inflation. Last year \nit actually had a drop in health care inflation. So there was actually \na negative increase in premium costs.\n  That is why we believe that when we give seniors the option to \nparticipate in a marketplace, why when we bring the marketplace forward \nto compete for the seniors' dollars, we will see the type of efficiency \nwhich is inherent in a capitalist system, in a marketplace system, in \nthe type of approach which the Senator from Iowa has said will work in \na narrow band. It will work in a broad band also.\n  Therefore, under our plan we are essentially going to be able to \naddress not just the narrow costs of how much a bandage costs but the \nbroad costs, the overall health care delivery system cost for our \nsenior citizens. That, of course, should be our goal. Why should it be \nour goal? Let us get back to why that should be our goal--controlling \nthe rate of growth of health care costs. Because, if we do not control \nthat rate of growth, once again it is important to emphasize the fact \nthat the hospital trust fund goes broke. It goes bankrupt.\n  Once again, I want to point out that I keep hearing this number on \nthe other side of the aisle that all we need is $89 billion to adjust \nthe Hospital Health Care Trust Fund. That number is simply not accurate \naccording to the trustees' report. The trustees' report was very \ndefinitive in stating that in order to get actuarial solvency of the \nhospital trust fund of the most minimal nature, the absolute bare \nminimum actuarial solvency, you need an adjustment that amounts to $387 \nbillion over 7 years, not $89 billion.\n  So by using the method of creating competition for seniors, we expect \nto be able to control the rate of growth of costs. And we are really \nnot controlling it all that much, quite honestly. We are talking about \nstill allowing the rate of growth of Medicare to be 6.5 percent, \nessentially the same rate of growth of health care that the President \nwanted. As pointed out earlier by Senator Nickles on this floor, the \nPresident's budget, as it was sent up, allowed for a rate of growth in \nMedicare which was essentially the same as our rate of growth in \nMedicare.\n  Why did the President send those numbers up? Because the President \nunderstands or at least his trustees understand that a rate of growth \nwhich we are presently suffering from--the 10-percent rate of growth--\nis unsustainable, and will lead to bankruptcy. You have to slow that \nrate of growth. But a 6.5-percent rate of growth is a huge--an \nabsolutely huge--infusion of money into the Medicare system. That \ninfusion of money--I will return to another chart which I had earlier--\nwhich represents $349 billion of new spending on Medicare over the next \n7 years will be the type of dollars necessary to generate competition \nin the marketplace for our senior citizens as they go out in the \nmarketplace and look for different types of health care to obtain.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 6 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am running out of time. I probably will not have time to \ntouch on it. But let me simply say in concluding on this point that the \nplan which we as Republicans have put forward is a plan which \nfundamentally strengthens the Medicare system.\n  It says to seniors that we are going to give you an opportunity to \nparticipate in similar programs that Members of Congress and Federal \nemployees have, the opportunity to go out in the marketplace and look \nat different health care plans and decide which one is best for you.\n  And remember, we also say in our plan that if you, the senior, happen \nto purchase a health care program which costs less than what it \npresently costs us as a Federal Government to pay for your fee-for-\nservice health care, we are going to let you keep the savings.\n  For example, in New England, for the average senior we are paying \nabout $5,000. To the extent that senior is able to go out and find a \nhealth care plan that has to supply the same basic benefits and will \nprobably supply many more--eyeglasses, some sort of drug benefit--to \nthe extent that senior gets that plan because the marketplace prices \nthat plan at a lower price, say they get it for $4,500 instead of \n$5,000, we are going to let the senior under our plan keep up to a \nminimum 75 percent of that $500 or possibly the whole $500, which is \nanother huge marketplace incentive to control costs because it makes \nseniors thoughtful and, yes, cost-conscious purchasers of their health \ncare.\n  It also creates in the marketplace a tremendous dynamic to compete \nfor those senior dollars, which is the whole theory behind what we \nthink is known as capitalism and what we think will generate, first, \nbetter and higher quality care and, second, care which will be more \ncost-effective and therefore will be affordable and therefore will \nguarantee the solvency of the trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight to debate this \nmost important provision of the Senate reconciliation bill that is \nbefore us and the Republican proposal that I am so proud to support \nbecause of the kind of elements that we have put before the American \npublic as truly positive change, while at the same time recognizing I \nthink some of the very real needs that many of our citizens have.\n\n[[Page S15675]]\n\n  The one that the Senator from New Hampshire has just addressed and \nthe one I will spend some time with this evening that I think is \ncritical for us to understand, of course, is Medicare and the changes \nwe are proposing to bring stability and strength to the system and the \nkind of choice and independence that the seniors of this country, who \nare the recipients, the beneficiaries of this program, have expected \nand deserve to expect from their Medicare program.\n  The Senator from Iowa this evening has introduced a competitive bid \nbill in the antifraud and abuse provision of Medicare reform, and for a \nfew moments this evening I think it would be very important to spend \nsome time with that and to understand it.\n  The Senator from Michigan has put forth an amendment that addresses \nmany of the provisions and adds to many of the provisions of the \nRepublican proposal as it relates to Medicare reform; that I think is a \ntremendously positive approach; that in combination with the 10 reforms \nalready in our legislation, when scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, represents a proposed savings to Medicare of $4.1 billion.\n  Now, I must say that I am told the amendment of the Senator from Iowa \nhas not been scored, and I wish he were in the Chamber so that I could \nseek that out with him, and if he returns I will ask him that question, \nbecause as we strive to balance the budget and keep ourselves on course \nas the American people have asked us to, it is important that \namendments that come to the floor, if they are credible, if they really \nwant to vote on them, ought to be scored. Ours has been, and it does \nrepresent a $4.1 billion savings.\n  What is significant about that is representative of what is going on \nin health care delivery today in this country and the fact that there \nare dedicated efforts at defrauding both the American taxpayer and the \nconsumer of Medicare benefits.\n  Senator Cohen was in the Chamber this afternoon or later this \nevening. He serves as the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging. I have the privilege of serving on that committee with him. Over \nthe last several years, both he and Senator Pryor, who chaired that \ncommittee before him, and I and others who have served on that \ncommittee have held a series of hearings to try to ferret out and \nunderstand the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse especially being \nperpetrated on the seniors of this country that would have the kind of \nimpact on Medicare that it currently has.\n  Let me give you a couple of figures, Mr. President. As much as 10 \npercent of U.S. health care spending or about $100 billion is lost each \nyear to health care fraud and abuse. That is a phenomenal figure. And \nyet we believe it is reasonably accurate. Over the last 5 years, \nestimated losses from these fraudulent activities have totaled $408 \nbillion.\n  Now, that is not the only program or benefit that would have gone to \nthe senior. That is tax money. That is the hard-working, tax-paying \nAmerican citizen's dollar that some charlatan is making off with \nbecause they have learned to game the system and because we have not \nbeen able to catch them in gaming the system, or at least we certainly \nhave not caught them at the level that I think all of our taxpayers \nwould want.\n  So the 10 provisions that are in our Medicare reform bill, that were \nspoken to earlier this evening, along with the additional provision in \nthe amendment from the Senator from Michigan, will register a savings \nof about $5 to $6 billion, and that is significant. That is big dollars \nwhere I come from, big dollars in anybody's estimation, and when it \ncomes to delivering health care needs to our seniors, those are truly \nimportant dollars.\n  One of the things that is most significant in all of this, while we \ncreate brand-new bureaucratic schemes to ferret out all of this, is the \nvery simple concept with which the Senator from Michigan has come \nforward. That is that individual Medicare beneficiaries report \nsuspected fraud and abuse and we create an incentive program to allow \nthem to do that.\n  Let me tell you why that is important. I think if every Senator would \nstop for just a moment, they could remember almost instantly that \nwithin the last several months they have had 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 letters \nfrom Medicare recipients in their State questioning whether their bill \nwas accurate, whether they had been bilked out of a service that was \nnot delivered and whether in fact their account had been charged.\n  Mr. President, less than 3 months ago, a former citizen from my \nState, who now lives in California, called my office one day. I had not \nheard from this man in years. He had happened to be from my hometown. \nHe is now retired and living in California, and he had major surgery, \nand he is on Medicare. For some reason, he thought something was wrong \nwith the billing; that he not only had been overcharged but there were \nfraudulent charges involved.\n  He sent me all of his material and said, ``Senator, I know I no \nlonger live in your State but we have known each other over the years. \nWould you look into it?''\n  Mr. President, we looked into it. It was thousands of dollars of \nbilling that he was questioning. Within a period of about a month, we \nhad discovered, in working with HCFA and working with Medicare, that \nthis was, in fact, fraudulent billing.\n  Now, that is only one example, and I have chosen not to use his name \ntonight because I did not ask his permission, but I have done that on \nmany occasions in working with my constituents, and I know nearly every \nSenator in the Senate has. We recognize without question that the \ncurrent structure of Medicare simply cannot get at the kind of waste, \nfraud, and abuse that is current and prevalent within the program, and \nin trying to secure it, trying to make it stable, being able to turn to \nour citizens and say to them that Medicare will be there in the out \nyears, strong and ready to serve them and their needs, we must get at \nthese programs. They must result in the kinds of savings, more \nimportantly, the kind of tightening up of it, that I think is so \ncritically necessary.\n  So the 10 provisions we have talked about, certainly the one that the \nSenator from Michigan has offered that creates the incentives for the \nbeneficiaries themselves to become involved, working with Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement units to combat especially the fraud \nsides of the program, are going to be increasingly valuable, and this \nis what I am proud to say we have offered. It has been scored. It saves \n$4.1 billion over the period of this legislation, and that is of \ncritical need to all of us.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how many minutes are remaining in my \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As we continue the debate over the next 12 to 14 hours, \nMr. President, I hope that those citizens of our country who are \nwatching will recognize the importance of what we do; and that is, for \nthe first time in my time in public service for the State of Idaho, \nthat this Congress will truly bring about a balanced budget proposal, \nand one that will set our Government in motion toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  This is exactly what the American people were asking for last \nNovember. They were asking us not only to change the way Government \nthinks and acts, most assuredly the way Congress thinks and acts, but \nto do the kinds of things that we are doing in the Medicare reform, to \nclean it up, to stabilize it, to give them choice, to give them the \nfreedom of not just fee for service, but the kinds of options that the \nprivate citizen of this country has, and to keep the program.\n  We know we can balance the budget and allow these programs to \ncontinue to serve the truly needy in our country and those that are \ndirect participants, like the Medicare beneficiaries, and to do so in a \nway that allows the program to remain strong and assures that in the \nlong term we will be able to have a balanced budget, turn to the \nAmerican people and say, ``We've done it. Your debt is now under \ncontrol.'' Let us then begin to work on debt structure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the \npending amendment aside.\n\n[[Page S15676]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] moves to \n     commit the bill S. 1357 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions that the Committee on Finance report the bill \n     back to the Senate within 3 days (not to include any day \n     the Senate is not in session) with identical language, \n     except that the Committee on Finance shall strike sections \n     7462, 7463, 7464, and 7465 of the bill. The Committee on \n     Finance shall also include provisions which offset the \n     revenue losses from the striking of such sections with an \n     elimination of corporate tax welfare provisions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \none-half hour.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I know that this debate is being held \nopposite the eighth inning of the World Series. And I will keep all \nMembers in the Senate guessing as to what the score is, so we can focus \non the issue before us, which is the earned-income tax credit.\n  Mr. President, the earned-income tax credit is a way to provide tax \nrelief to working Americans of modest income. It is the most \nsignificant tax relief provided to working Americans of modest income \nthat we have seen in the last 20 years. It has given many who are \nstriving to make a better life for themselves and their families under \nvery difficult circumstances the money they need to send their kids to \nparochial school, the money they need to maybe buy a little bigger \napartment, pay the utility bills. It gives them the money that allows \nthem to continue up the ladder of upward mobility.\n  Mr. President, the bill that we are considering now raises taxes on \nthose working Americans. It essentially defers the third year of the \ntax cut that was passed in 1993 for those working Americans. In 1981, \nwe passed a tax cut that benefited disproportionately the wealthy, and \nDemocrats constantly made the debate that we should defer the third \nyear of that tax cut because the wealthy did not need more tax relief.\n  We now have a proposal where the third year of a tax cut is about to \nbe provided to working Americans of modest income, and the Republicans \nare attempting to defer that tax cut for working Americans of modest \nincome.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this effort. I opposed it in the committee. I \nthink that it is shortsighted. I think that it is not progrowth. I \nthink it is not profamily. I think to raise taxes on families earning \nunder $28,000 a year in income is an antifamily, antigrowth measure.\n  Mr. President, in this bill, according to the Department of the \nTreasury, almost 50 percent of the tax breaks go to people making more \nthan $100,000 a year; at the same time, families with incomes below \n$30,000, which represent over 40 percent of the American families, face \na tax increase.\n  Now, Mr. President, if this were the only measure in this bill, this \ntax increase on working families, I would oppose it. If it were the \nonly measure in the bill, I would oppose it. But it is not the only \nmeasure in the bill. There are many other provisions that benefit many \nspecial interests, but there is one provision, in addition to this tax \nincrease on working Americans of modest income, that I think draws the \ndistinction between the parties very clearly, and that is the estate \ntax provision in this bill.\n  The estate tax is, of course, a tax assessed when one passes one's \nestate on to one's heirs. There is a $600,000 exemption, meaning that \nif you have an estate, when you pass away, if it is under $600,000 you \npay no estate tax. Every year only 1 percent of those who die pass on \nestates of more than $600,000. Only 0.2 percent of those who die in a \nyear pass on estates of more than $2 million.\n  Embodied in this bill that increases taxes on families working and \nearning under $30,000 a year, is a tax cut for estates of $5 million, a \ntax cut of $1.7 million on average. Let me repeat that. In this tax \nbill is a tax cut of $1.7 million for estates valued at $5 million.\n  Once again, Mr. President, the distinction is stark. While on the one \nhand, a $1.7 million tax cut is given to estates of $5 million, we have \na tax increase on families earning under $30,000. I personally cannot \nunderstand the politics of this. I do not understand the politics of \nwhy. I do not understand the politics of really to whose advantage it \nlies, except those who get the $1.7 million tax cut.\n  So, Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered says, ``Let's \nnot increase taxes through eliminating the earned-income tax \ncredit.'' I will get to that in a minute.\n\n  But the other thing that this tax cut does is, frankly, increase the \nnational debt. Let me repeat that. This tax cut increases the national \ndebt. This is a deficit reduction package. A deficit reduction package \nis for the purpose of reducing the national debt. This increases the \nnational debt.\n  Why? Because in the budget resolution, there is a provision that says \nif there is an economic benefit from all this budget cutting, then that \neconomic benefit, in its total amount, will be spent as a tax cut. That \nis what the budget resolution said.\n  The CBO says if we enact this budget with these budget cuts that it \nwill save about $170 billion that according to the budget resolution, \nover a period of 5 to 7 years, would be used for a tax cut.\n  But this tax cut costs $221 to $224 billion. So this tax cut adds \nabout $54 billion to the national debt over this period. There is no \ndisputing those numbers. There are no mysterious letters from the Joint \nTax Committee. There are no nuances on words, no playing on the \ndifference between income, Social Security, and excise. There is just a \nstark number, a $54 billion more increase of the national debt.\n  So it seems to me that on two grounds, this is not merited. First, \nbecause it gives it away to estates of $5 million a $1.7 million tax \ncut and raises taxes on families earning under $30,000.\n  In addition to that, it increases the national debt by $54 billion \nover the period of this bill. But that is not the worst when it comes \nto the question of the national debt, because immediately after the \nwindow of 7 years, there is an explosion of debt.\n  For example, the capital gains provision will cost about $40 billion \nin the first years, which is about $5 to $6 billion a year, but in the \nremaining years, it costs $30 billion. So it jumps from $10 billion, \n$11 billion, $12 billion a year. Or take the IRA proposal; the \nbackloaded IRA cost $7 million in the first 7 years, and $12 billion, a \nlittle less than $2 billion a year, and in the next 3 years costs $21 \nbillion, which is another $7 billion a year.\n  So talking about the budget deficit, this is an explosion of the \ndebt, an explosion of the debt in the outyears. On both those grounds, \nI strongly oppose these provisions.\n  The question is, is this a tax increase? We have a very skillful \nmaneuvering being exercised by the other side. The distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico reported his numbers that for people earning \nunder $75,000, 72 percent of the tax cut goes to people earning under \n$75,000 a year. True. But let us look a little deeper. The bulk of that \ngoes to people earning between $30,000 and $75,000. The tax increase on \nfamilies earning under $30,000 is still there.\n  In other words, what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said \ncan be true and still not refute the fact that there is a dramatic tax \nincrease on families earning under $30,000.\n  Then, of course, we have this famous joint tax study which concludes \nthat less than 1.5 percent of all households will have an income tax \nincrease as a result of EITC reforms. ``There it is,'' says the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and the Senator from Delaware, ``only 1.5 percent have \nan income tax increase.''\n  Maybe, but what about Social Security taxes? If you are earning \n$25,000 a year, the income tax is going to be a big problem; you are \ngoing to pay it. The big tax you pay is a Social Security tax, and the \nearned income credit is for the purpose of offsetting taxes and Social \nSecurity taxes. So everything that the Joint Tax Committee says in \ntheir letter can be true and a $20 billion increase in Social Security \ntaxes can still be valid.\n  So, Mr. President, anyway you cut this, this results in a tax \nincrease for families earning under $30,000 a year. In my State, which \nhas the second highest per capita income, that means about 13 percent \nof the families in my State will have a tax increase.\n\n[[Page S15677]]\n\n  I saw the distinguished Senator from New Mexico on the floor saying \n40 percent of the families in his State would have a tax increase \nbecause they earn under $30,000 a year. That is because their per \ncapita income is lower.\n  So, Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot about errors and yet in \nthe opponents' provision, only $1.6 billion deals with anything related \nto compliance. If they are so interested in fraud and error, why are \nthey not doing more to deal with compliance?\n  In the amendment I have suggested, I keep $1.6 billion in compliance \nmeasures. And then, of course, the other side will show a graph. ``This \nis a gigantic explosion of growth in this program, an explosion of \ngrowth.''\n  Mr. President, when you give somebody a tax cut, you lose revenue. In \n1993, we chose to give families earning under $30,000 a year a 3-year \ntax cut, which means that tax cut grows. So when you see the chart that \nthey might show that shows a figure with a line going up saying \n``Growth of EITC,'' translate in your mind: Increasing tax cut for \nfamilies earning under $30,000 a year. Yes, and if you do not want to \ngive them a tax cut, then you would support the Republican position. If \nyou believe they should have the third year of their tax cut, just as \nthe wealthy had the third year of their tax cut under the bill passed \nin 1981, then you would support the Democratic position. Do we want to \nraise taxes on working families or not? Which is the progrowth, \nprofamily policy? I do not think that there is much of an argument on \nthe other side.\n  They will say, ``Oh, no, we have a child credit.'' Bravo. Let me \ncompliment them. I wish they had supported my amendment in the Finance \nCommittee that would have stricken everything in this bill except the \nchild credit, the adoption credit, the student loan interest deduction. \nThey voted against it. Why? Because you want to have that other \nprovision in the bill, the estate tax provision.\n  Remember? A $5 million estate gets an average tax cut of $1.7 \nmillion. That is why you did not support the amendment and simply have \na tax cut for working families, because you wanted the tax cut for \nestates of $5 million. Strike it from the bill, show us that you want \nonly tax cuts for working families. If not, admit to what this game is \nall about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, you have heard a great deal of demagoging \nduring the past few days from the President, from congressional \nDemocrats, and from the Treasury Department, a lot of bogus claims \nabout our tax package. We are here this evening to bring you the truth \nabout the Republican tax package. The bottom line is this: American \nfamilies will be better off next year under our tax package than they \nare today. Our tax relief package is the biggest tax cut for middle-\nincome families in more than a decade.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with the President of the United States when \nhe says that the tax increase of 1993 was a mistake--the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country. I would hope that there would \nbe bipartisan support for our tax cut, in view of the President's \nmessage.\n  Under our reform, more than 98 percent of all U.S. households will \nreceive either a tax cut or no tax increase. And this includes our \nreforms to the earned income tax, the $500 per child credit, and the \nmarriage penalty relief in the Senate Republican bill. Those are the \nfacts.\n  I challenge the Administration and Congressional Democrats to prove \ntheir assertion that 51 percent of all taxpayers would receive a tax \nincrease under our bill. This assertion has no basis in fact, and it \nseriously strains the credibility of the Treasury Department. The Joint \nTax Committee analysis, released today, shows that the facts are on our \nside. Republicans are focusing the earned income credit on the working \npoor with children--the people for whom it was originally intended. We \ngive a tax cut to most families that pay income tax, and we preserve \nthe EIC for those who need it the most. The indisputable fact is that \nmore than 98 percent of all U.S. households will either receive a tax \ncut or have no tax increase with the Senate Republican bill.\n  The earned income credit program started in 1975 in an environment \nfocused on reforming welfare policies for families with dependent \nchildren. Senator Long was a driving force behind the establishment of \nthe earned income credit program, and this program provided cash \nassistance to working low-income families with children. The Finance \nCommittee report on the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 stated that the \nprogram should be of importance in inducing individuals with families \nreceiving Federal assistance to support themselves. There is no doubt \nthat since the inception of the earned income credit, its focus has \nbeen on hard-working, low-income families with children.\n  In 1993, the program strayed from its original intent of helping \nworking families with children, when President Clinton expanded the \nprogram to include childless, able-bodied working adults. My colleagues \nacross the aisle often point out that President Reagan supported the \nprogram. Yet, when President Reagan lauded the earned income credit, \nthe program only covered working parents of children and cost about $2 \nbillion in 1986.\n  Today, the program makes payments to childless adults, and its costs \nhave skyrocketed to over $20 billion. The reforms of the earned income \ncredit contained in the Republican Senate bill will return the program \nto its original goals, those lauded by Senator Long and President \nReagan, of a welfare program focused on low-income working families \nwith children.\n  My colleagues across the aisle should realize that this will help \nchildren. Under our bill, the earned income credit will be available \nonly to individuals who are eligible to work in the United States. \nIllegal aliens will no longer benefit at the expense of hard-working \ntaxpayers.\n  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, EIC is a cash transfer \nprogram, a welfare program, administered through the Tax Code, rather \nthan through a Federal agency like the Department of Labor. If Congress \nwere to reduce the amounts paid to food stamps, no one would say that \nCongress is raising taxes. Changes to the EIC are the same as changes \nto the Food Stamp Program. We are not raising taxes on EIC recipients.\n  The Democrats are arguing that changes to the EIC will raise people's \ntaxes. In response to these concerns, I have asked the Joint Committee \non Taxation to perform a detailed analysis of the Senate proposal to \nreform the EIC. This information is now available, and I released it \nearlier today to the public.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the changes in EIC is to focus the \nprogram on the working poor with children. We do make four policy \nchanges. We eliminate any EIC payment for individuals with no children. \nAs I indicated, this program was intended to help families with \nchildren, and that should continue to be the policy of this program. We \nalso prevent illegal aliens from obtaining this benefit. We also \nprovide that outside income should be considered in determining whether \nor not one is eligible for the EIC. Why is tax-free interest not \nconsidered in determining eligibility? Why is tax-free Social Security \nor pensions not considered in determining eligibility for the earned \nincome credit? Fourth, we take steps to eliminate the fraud and abuse \nin this program. Unfortunately, this program has had deplorable rates \nof fraud and abuse, as high as 30 to 40 percent a year. Recently, there \nhas been, hopefully, some improvement in that. But it is estimated that \nit could still be as high as 20 percent. People are outraged and \nshocked with the waste, fraud, and abuse in food stamps or AFDC, but \nthey only amount to 5 to 6 percent. In this program--the EIC--it \namounts to as high as 20 to 30 percent.\n  Now, some Democrats have claimed the EIC reform results in those in \nthe lower-income brackets--51 percent or less--paying higher taxes. \nThat is totally false, inaccurate, and misleading. As I mentioned, I \nrecently wrote the Joint Committee on Taxation to answer a number of \nquestions. I pointed out that on Thursday, October 19, 1995, an article \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Tax Analysis Now \n\n[[Page S15678]]\n\nShows GOP Package Would Mean Increase For Half the Payers.''\n  Is there any validity to the assertion that the Senate Finance \nCommittee revenue recommendations would result in a tax increase for \none-half of all households?\n  In responding to this question, please consider the impact of the \nearned income credit reforms approved by the Senate Finance Committee \nin a separate markup last September.\n  We received the answer, and the answer says, ``No factual basis \nexists for the assertion, since retracted, contained in the Wall Street \nJournal of last week asserting that one half of all households would \nexperience a tax increase under the Senate Finance Committee revenue \nrecommendations.''\n  Even if one were to include the effects of the EIC reforms previously \napproved by the Senate Finance Committee, our analysis indicates that \nless than 1.5 percent--let me repeat that, 1.5 percent--of all \nhouseholds would experience an income tax increase.\n  I think that shows the falseness of the claim that 50 percent of the \nAmerican families would suffer a tax increase because of this package \nwe are considering today.\n  Now, during the Senate Finance Committee's markup of revenue \nrecommendations on October 18-19, 1995, various assertions were made \nwith respect to the impact of the EIC reforms previously approved by \nthe committee.\n  I asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to address the following \nquestions: Would any households receiving an EIC today pay more income \ntaxes under the combined efforts of the Senate EIC reform, $500 per \nchild credit, and marriage penalty relief? If so, provide how many \nhouseholds will be impacted in this manner and explain why.\n  The answer is that, ``with respect to the Senate Finance Committee's \npreviously approved EIC reform, our analysis of the combined effects of \nthe Senate Finance Committee EIC reforms, the $500 child credit, and \nmarriage penalty relief for 1996 indicate that less than 1.5 percent of \nall households will have an income tax increase as a result of the EIC \nreforms.''\n  Would families with children who are currently eligible for the \nmaximum EIC--that is, families with earnings under $12,000 --continue \nto receive in future years at least as much EIC as they now receive?\n  Again, the answer is, ``families who are currently eligible for the \nmaximum EIC with children and having adjusted gross income under \n$12,000 will receive an even larger EIC next year and thereafter. For \nexample, the maximum EIC for a family with one child will increase from \n$2,094 in 1995 to $2,156 in 1996. The maximum EIC for a family with two \nor more children will increase from $3,110 in 1995 to $3,208 in 1996.''\n  This is illustrated here on the chart. It shows, for example, that a \nfamily with children that has income of $10,000 would receive this year \n$3,110; that would go up to $3,208 in 1996. The same is true for a \nfamily with children that has income of $15,000. This year they would \nget $2,360; that would rise to $2,488 in 1996. Not only would they \ncontinue to get EIC, but it would continue to increase.\n  Mr. President, let me just again emphasize that the claim that people \nwith incomes below $30,000 would have a tax increase is totally false. \nFirst, what the Democrats are doing is calling a reduced welfare check \na tax increase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Second, if someone receives a check from the Government for \n$50 in 1995, and then in 1996 under our reforms receives a check for \n$75, that is $25 higher. Republicans and most people would call that a \nbigger check from the Government. But the people on the other side of \nthe aisle call it a tax increase if the person was supposed to receive \na check for $100 in 1996.\n  What we are doing is slowing the rate of growth of this program. In \nthe last 10 years this program has grown something like 1,000 to 1,200 \npercent. The tax credit which was 14 percent plus 5 years ago is now 36 \npercent.\n  What we are trying to do is to slow down the rate of growth so that \nwe can balance the budget.\n  Now, I listened, Mr. President, with great interest to my Democratic \ncolleagues' description of what we are doing. People are saying that \nthey do not like the tax package. They make fun of the changes in the \nestate taxes. Just let me say, as I have gone around back home and \ntalked to the family farmer or to the owner of a family farm, as I talk \nto the owner of a small business, one of their greatest concerns is \nthat they are not going to be able to turn over that farm or that \nbusiness to their children.\n  What we are seeking to do in our changes in the estate taxes is to \nmake that possible, make it possible for the family farm to continue as \nit has in the past, or to make it possible for the entrepreneur who is \nsuccessful in creating a small business to leave it to his children.\n  We think our package is a humane package. We are proud of the fact \nthat it means tax cuts for the American people. We agree with President \nClinton when he says that the big tax increase of 1993 was too high.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at the outset of the comments of the \nSenator from Delaware, he talked about telling the truth versus bogus \nclaims. Then he refers to a Joint Taxation Committee study to try to \nrefute some comments made by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  If we want to talk about bogus claims, the Joint Taxation Committee--\nwhich I might add is chaired by the majority party --sends a statement \nsaying there is no linkage and no increase, but refers only to income \ntax.\n  Here you have another sleight-of-hand, bogus effort to avoid the \nreality, the same way the reality is being avoided right now with the \ndebate on the thousands of pages that takes place during the World \nSeries. It is a great way of avoiding accountability.\n  The fact is that the earned income tax credit is a credit not just \nagainst income tax but also against the payroll tax. The Joint Taxation \nCommittee says nothing about the payroll tax impact. So, in effect, it \nis another sleight of hand.\n  If you want to talk about bogus--you just heard the chairman of the \ncommittee say, Mr. President, that we are going to slow down the rate \nof growth of the program.\n  What is the program? The program is a tax cut for working poor--by \nhis own admission--when what he has come to the floor and said is we \nwill slow down the capacity of working poor Americans to participate \nbecause we are not going to give as much of a tax cut to them. It is \nthat simple. This is not complicated. We are going to slow down the \nrate of growth in the tax cut for working poor Americans, but we are \ngoing to increase the tax break for people who have it already in \nAmerica. That is what this is all about.\n\n  If you happen to have a $5 million estate, you are going to get a \n$1.7 million tax break. But if are a working poor person--and I have \n194,000 families in Massachusetts that will be affected by the cut in \nthis program, 194,000 families in Massachusetts are going to pay $370 \nmore in taxes because they want to slow down the rate of growth in the \nprogram. That may not be a lot to the person who has a $5 million \nestate, but let me tell you something, for somebody who is working, \nworking, working--which is what we all talk about here--to get off of \nwelfare and make it, $370 is a lot of money. People count those nickels \nand dimes when they are in that position. It is whether or not they are \nriding on the T.\n  There was a front-page story in the New York Times, I think last \nMonday. It talked about the impact of the earned income tax credit on \nworking people. Here was a woman in New York City who, because she got \nthe tax credit for working, was able to cut back on her apartment rent. \nShe went back and got rid of a $700 rent, went down to a $400 rent so \nshe could add it to the money that she got from the earned income tax \ncredit. Do you know what she did? She bought herself a 15-year-old car \nso she could drive outside of the area that is served by public \ntransportation so she could get a better job that earned more money. \nAnd that is exactly what she did. She broke out of \n\n[[Page S15679]]\n\npoverty by making hard choices because she had the earned income tax \ncredit.\n  Our friends are coming along here. They are giving people who earn \n$300,000 a very nice, fat break. And they are taking away from the \npeople who earn $30,000 or less.\n  There is no way for them to cut it any other way. Is there some fraud \nin the program? Yes, there is some fraud in the program. Can we cure \nthat without reducing the program for eligible people? Sure we could. \nBut that is not what they are choosing to do. They are going to throw \neverybody in the pot of fraud.\n  I keep hearing about illegal immigrants. That is a nice hot button in \nAmerica now. I do not know many people who think illegal immigrants \nought to be getting a lot. But that has now entered into this debate. \nThat is not what we are talking about here.\n  It just is beyond comprehension that in this country we are going to \nplay such games with definitions and reality when everybody understands \nwhat the reduction means.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I really hope we are going to have a better \nsense of fairness here than is being exhibited in this approach to \npeople who are working and trying to break out of the cycle of poverty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if I might just yield myself 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. The one question we asked of the Joint Tax Committee is:\n\n       Would families with children living below the poverty line \n     continue to receive an EIC in excess of the family's Federal \n     payroll taxes?\n\n  And the answer is that:\n\n       Families living at or near the poverty line, one-child \n     families with earnings under $12,500 and two-child families \n     with earnings under $15,500, would continue to receive an EIC \n     in excess of the family's Federal payroll taxes, including \n     both employee and employer shares.\n\n  So the answer is that EIC more than offsets the payroll and other \ntaxes of the family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield at that point for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The Senator said--would the Senator read again, once \nagain, what was it the Joint Tax Committee said about the various taxes \nthat were offset?\n  Mr. ROTH. The question was:\n\n       Would families with children living below the poverty line \n     continue to receive an EIC in excess of the family's Federal \n     payroll taxes?\n\n  And the answer is:\n\n       Families living at or near the poverty line, one-child \n     families with earnings under $12,500 and two-child families \n     with earnings under $15,000, would continue to receive an EIC \n     in excess of the family's Federal payroll taxes, employee-\n     employer shares.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, no one disputes what the Senator has just \nsaid. EIC is available for families under to $28,000. He is saying at \nthe same time this is nothing but a welfare program. He is saying, \nfine, we will keep the welfare part of this. But if you start to make \nit a little bit--sorry. We will not offset your payroll taxes.\n  I mean, that is not an answer to the problem that we posed. Yes, they \nposed it so that if you have poverty and you are right at the poverty \nlevel and you have family now, you have kids--not if you are single and \npoor, but if you have kids, then, yes, it will offset the Social \nSecurity earned income. Of course, you do not pay a whole lot of income \ntaxes in poverty. You pay virtually no income tax when you are in \npoverty.\n  So you only have Social Security. So the earned income would offset \nSocial Security in poverty. But not at $28,000. Not when the family \nstarts to make a little money. Not when they are making $20,000, \n$25,000, $28,000, $29,000. Not there, no, no, no. That way, you pay \nmore taxes. Welcome to the middle class, the Republican middle class.\n  You are middle class. You begin to make it? Pay more taxes. If you \nhave that estate of $5 million, you get a $1.7 million tax cut. That is \nthe story here. There is no other story. It has not been refuted. A 3-\nyear tax cut in 1993 for working families? Republicans say do not give \nthem that third year. Do not give them that third year of tax cut.\n  Pro-family? Pro-growth? Hardly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes and 8 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to answer my colleague from \nNew Jersey. He said, ``What about a family that makes $28,000.'' Under \ncurrent law they have a great big earned income tax credit of $116. \nBut, look out, they pay income taxes of $1,665.\n  Under our proposal they are going to get a $1,000 tax cut. Under the \nproposal of the Senator from New Jersey, they get $165. My figures \ncalculate they come out better by $835, under our proposal. And that is \nonly dealing with the tax credit for children. It does not include the \nfact we are reducing the marriage penalty, so that gives them another \n$100, I will just tell my colleague from Massachusetts said you did not \ncalculate the fact that you are offsetting payroll taxes.\n  My friend is wrong.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. He will not yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will he yield for a correction?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not. I want to answer a couple of allegations \nthat were made. When somebody said you did not refute it, I want to \nrefute a couple of them.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that the request should \nbe made through the Chair, when addressing another Member.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, a couple of statements were made that the \nRepublicans do not know that the EIC is used to offset payroll costs. \nThat is wrong. This program not only offsets income taxes and payroll \ntaxes, in most cases it offsets them and gives a check back.\n  In looking at incomes of less than $15,000--my colleague from New \nJersey is right--in most cases, income tax liability is zero. But this \nnot only offsets income tax, but it also offsets the so-called FICA, or \npayroll taxes.\n  Does it offset what an individual pays? That is 7.65 percent of their \npayroll. Yes, but it also offsets what the employer pays. That is 15.3 \npercent.\n  So not only does it offset all payroll taxes, but it offsets it them \nby 233 percent.\n  This is a program that is writing out checks. This is a program, Mr. \nPresident, that will cost $23 billion this year, $3 billion of it \noffsetting taxes, and $20 billion were cash payments--Uncle Sam writing \nchecks. This cash outlay program now exceeds the cost of Aid for \nFamilies with Dependent Children, a program that costs $18 billion. \nThis program costs $20 billion.\n  Families making $25,000 pay income taxes. For families that are \npaying income taxes, we give a tax cut. If they have children, we give \n$500 per child. That is pretty easy to figure. You have two children. \nThat is $1,000. If they have four, that is $2,000. So our tax cut is \nvery family friendly and very positive.\n  I want to mention some of the reforms that we make on EITC because \nthey are long overdue, and they are part of our overall budget plan. We \ndo have a budget. We have a budget that is balanced. President \nClinton's budget is not balanced. We had a vote on it, thanks to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania. His budget is not balanced. We use the \nCongressional Budget Office for estimating purposes. He said he was \ngoing to use the Congressional Budget Office, and they say at the end \nof 7 years his budget has a deficit of $210 billion. At the 7 years, \nour budget has a $13 billion surplus.\n  We will have a balanced budget. President Clinton does not have one, \ncertainly not by using the Congressional Budget Office. My colleagues \non the Democrat side do not have one. They disowned the President's \nbudget. They do not have their own budget. It is nonexistent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question \n\n[[Page S15680]]\n\njust so I understand the point he just made? It is an interesting \npoint. I am not too sure I was fully aware of it. What the Senator is \nsuggesting is that the earned income tax credit for low-income \nAmericans actually pays out money in excess of all their Federal tax \nobligations. Is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The new definition of what is a tax increase is when \nthe Federal Government does not pay out more money to you, and you \nalready do not pay, that is a tax increase. So if you are entitled to \nget more welfare--let us call it what it is. It is a welfare check. It \nis a check not to offset taxes, but it is a cash payment to families or \nto individuals. If you were expected to get more money, then by not \ngiving them more money, we are giving them a tax increase even though \nthey do not pay taxes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is an amazing statement. How can anyone call not \ngetting more money from the Federal Government when you pay no taxes a \ntax increase?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the statement.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would love the Senator from New Jersey--I know he is \na Rhodes scholar--but redefine for me, please, how someone who does not \npay taxes----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I say to my colleague that I have the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. On his time, I would love to have him answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I only have 6 minutes. I have several points that I want \nto make. The point being when someone says they are offsetting FICA, \nthe amount not only offsets FICA, but 200 percent, actually 235 percent \nof FICA, and that includes employer and employee. The employees \nactually only pay half of that amount. In reality, it is about four and \na half times what an employee pays on FICA.\n  The cost of this program is exploding--my colleague from New Jersey \nsaid he knows the Senator is going to stand up and show how this \nprogram has exploded. I grinned at him because I am. This program cost \nless than $2 billion in 1985; in 1986, less than $2 billion. Today the \nprogram costs $23 billion. That is 11 times what it cost in 1986.\n  This is an entitlement program. What is the definition of an \n``entitlement'' program? It is when you pass a law under which, if you \nmet certain criteria, you are going to get a check. That is what the \nEITC is. It is a cash payment program--$23 billion in payments.\n  Actually, I will give the exact figure. In 1995, the figure is $23.7 \nbillion, over $20 billion of it is a cash outlay with Uncle Sam writing \nchecks--not reducing somebody's cash income taxes and/or payroll taxes \non a monthly basis. It is Uncle Sam, in 99 percent of the cases, \nwriting a check once a year, a cash outlay program that I mentioned \nbefore which exceeds Aid for Families with Dependent Children. AFDC is \npaid out in a monthly basis to help low-income families. This is a \nlump-sum payment that is paid out at the end of the year at a cost of \n$20 billion.\n  This program was lauded by President Reagan and others when it was a \n$2 billion program and when the maximum benefits were $435. The maximum \nbenefit in 1985 was $550. By 1990, it had increased to $953. It was \nactually $1,500 in 1992, and President Clinton doubled it again. It \nwent up to $3,110.\n  So we are talking about a program, if you have two or more children, \nwhere your maximum benefit went from $500 to over $3,000.\n  Some people said these Republicans have just slashed this program, \nand people are going to receive less. I saw a program on CBS tonight, \nthey interviewed a woman who had a couple of kids. She had a couple of \njobs. I compliment her. They made her think that she was going to get \nless money than she got this year. The facts are, if she is getting \n$3,110 this year, next year she gets over $3,200, and the next year she \ngets over $3,300. Under our proposal the benefit rises from $3,110 to \n$3,888, an increase of over $700 in the next 7 years.\n  So we did not freeze this program. We did not cut it. We do say some \npeople should not be eligible because we found hundreds of thousands of \npeople that make over $30,000 a year who are qualifying for it. They \nshould not be. We found out that illegal aliens are receiving benefits, \nand they should not. So we eliminate them.\n  Frankly, we agree with Senator Russell Long that we should drop the \nbenefit for individuals without children. This program was always \nformulated with the idea of helping individuals and families with \nchildren.\n  We are reforming the system. We are trying to target the assistance \nto those people who really need it. But then we allow the system to \ngrow. That is my point. It really is bothersome to have individuals \nstand up and say, you are increasing somebody's taxes when I know what \nthe facts are. I will read the figures. If you have two or more \nchildren, the maximum benefit today is $3,110. The maximum benefit next \nyear is $3,208. The maximum benefit the next year is $3,312. And, \nagain, it increases over $100 per year to the maximum benefit. In the \nyear 2002, it is $3,888, a significant increase every single year. It \ngrows with inflation.\n  So how can people say, ``Well, you are increasing taxes''? It does \nnot make sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Has all time expired on our side on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will wait until my colleague from New Jersey \nconcludes. At that point in time, I will send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 5 minutes, 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the assertions by the other side that the \nchild credit is more generous than the earned income tax credit for \nfamilies with children at all income levels bewilders me. I have four \nkids. I make $15,000 a year. I have a very tiny income tax liability, \nvery tiny. The child credit is not refundable. I get no benefit at all \nfrom the child credit--zero. I lose about $3,500 in benefits with the \nloss in the EITC at $28,000.\n  The Senator picks the absolute perfect number. Why? Because the \nearned income tax credit loses its value the higher the income level. \nSo when it gets to $28,000, it is not worth anything. At that point, \nclearly the child credit is more valuable. That is not policy. That is \nmathematics.\n  Then the issue of--well, the chart that the Senator had with the \ngrowth of the EITC, it grows because we are giving them bigger tax \ncuts. That is why it grows. So you put that chart up, and you see the \nbars go higher and higher. That means a bigger tax cut for families \nearning under $28,000 a year. If you do not want a tax cut, then you \nwant to support the program that would curtail this. Deny the third \nyear of the tax cut. That is what you are saying essentially.\n  Basically, the tax cut for working families was put in in 1993. It \nwas phased in over 3 years and the other side is saying do not give the \nthird year.\n  That is why it grows. Once you get to the next year, it is flat \nbecause the tax cuts will have been provided. There will be no more tax \ncut in the fourth year. It is not some kind of conspiracy. It is \nmathematics. You give a bigger tax cut, you lose more revenue. We chose \nto give a big tax cut to offset Social Security, to offset income taxes \nfor working families. And you know what. There are a lot of provisions \nin the Tax Code that say you get a credit against income. They are \nlargely corporate. The other side is not calling that welfare. That is \nnot welfare. But somehow when it offsets the income of a working family \nwith kids, that is welfare.\n  Mr. President, it is beyond me; 78 percent of the earned income tax \ncredit goes to offset Social Security and income tax. The other portion \nis a refundable credit to those families making $13,000, $14,000 a year \nwho otherwise would not get anything.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. If you want \nto give those families something because they are working, but they do \nnot pay any income tax and they are at a low enough income, they do not \npay enough Social Security tax, you have to make it refundable and then \nyou have to appropriate the money.\n\n[[Page S15681]]\n\n  That is what we do here. And this vast amount of money that is \nappropriated, as the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma says, is \nappropriated because there is not a way to offset the Social Security \ntaxes. It is pretty simple. It is not complicated. And it boils down to \nwhether you want to give a break to families with children or whether \nyou do not.\n  There is the big deal about families that do not have children. We do \nnot want to give them anything. If you are making $16,000, $17,000 a \nyear, you do not have any kids, somehow or another you do not get \nanything here. Forget it. You are not worth it. You are struggling. You \nare working hard. But somehow you do not qualify for this. In fact, we \ndo not care about it. We do not care what your Social Security taxes \nare. Somehow you are a nonentity.\n  We do not think that. We think that if you earn under $28,000 a year, \nyou ought to get a break, particularly in a bill that gives $1.7 \nbillion in relief for estate taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2958\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself and \n     Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 2958 to the \n     instructions of the Bradley motion to commit S. 1357 to \n     Finance Committee:\n       Strike all after ``Finance'' and insert:\n       ``With instructions to report the bill back to the Senate \n     forthwith including a provision stating:\n       ``The maximum earned income credit for a family with one \n     child will increase from $2,094 in 1995 to $2,156 in 1996 and \n     the maximum earned income credit for a family with two or \n     more children will increase from $3,110 in 1995 to $3,208 in \n     1996.'';\n       ``And the effective date for section 7461, `Earned income \n     credit denied to individuals not authorized to be employed in \n     the US', shall be moved to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1994.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by myself \nand Senator Brown that tried to clarify a couple things.\n  One, we want to state very clearly exactly what we did in the bill \nand that is an increase in the earned income credit for individuals \nwith one child from $2,094 in 1995--that is present law--to $2,156 in \n1996.\n  That is an increase of about--whatever the difference is--$60 some-\nodd, and an income credit for a family of 2 from $3,110, to $3,208. \nThat is an increase of about $100--$98. So we make that very clear.\n  The second part of that is we say we want to deny benefits to illegal \naliens and make the effective date December 31, 1994. Some people are \nshocked to find out that they were eligible. I was surprised. But I \nlooked at a GAO report, and it said:\n\n       Illegal alien receipts. IRS expects more than 160,000 \n     illegal aliens received the EIC in 1994.\n\n  We ought to stop that. Right now it is legal.\n  It says:\n\n       The Internal Revenue Code does not prohibit illegal aliens \n     from receiving EIC if they meet prescribed eligibility \n     requirements.\n\n  Well, they should be, and so let us make that illegal. If they are \nhere illegally, why in the world should we be giving them a check, \nespecially a check if you are talking about to the tune of $3,000. So \nlet us tighten that up. That is a loophole that needs to be tightened. \nWe need to tighten up loopholes.\n  Senator Roth mentioned several. I compliment Senator Roth because he \nhas shown great courage and leadership in trying to tackle the fastest \ngrowing entitlement program in Government. No other program is growing \nas rapidly, as fast as the so-called EIC. No other program costs over \n10 times as much as it did 10 years ago and continues to explode. So it \nneeds to be reformed. And no other program that I know of has error \nrates and fraud rates at such astronomical levels as the EIC.\n  This is a GAO report that is dated March 1995: ``Earned Income Credit \nTargeting to the Working Poor.''\n  Well, we should target. I just read from a couple of their \nhighlights. It says the IRS did a study in 1994 on electronic returns \nonly. They said 29 percent of the returns received too much EIC, and 13 \npercent were judged to have received intentional errors. In other \nwords, that is fraud. It also mentioned, it says that the most recent \ntaxpayer compliance measured showed that about 42 percent of EIC \nrecipients received too large a credit and about 32 percent were not \nable to show that they were entitled to any credit. One out of three in \nthe comprehensive study were not able to show they were entitled to any \ncredit. And that is about 34 percent of the total EIC.\n  What other program has a 34 percent failure rate, or 30 some-odd-\npercent error rate? This program does. And part of it is because the \ncost has just exploded. You have a program that grows at 10 times the \nrate it was just a few years ago, and you have a program where the \nmaximum benefit is six times what it was 10 years ago, you realize you \nhave a program that is rife with fraud and needs to be reformed. It has \nnot been yet. The IRS is trying to tighten down around the edges, but \nthey have not been totally successful. They may have reduced it \nsomewhat, and I compliment them, but they have a long way to go if you \nhave an error rate of 30, 40 percent. And so we need to make some \nchanges. Senator Roth has made many of those changes.\n  We say that we must count almost all income. We find hundred of \nthousands of people who receive benefits that make a lot more than the \nincome eligibility called for, people making a lot more than $30,000, \nsome making more than $50,000. They have interest income that is tax \nfree. It does not count toward their income eligibility and therefore \nthey can continue receiving EIC benefits.\n  Mr. President, we need to make some reforms and we need to make clear \nthat we want to target these benefits to those people who are truly \nneedy. That is the kind of reforms that we are making today.\n\n  I want to answer my colleague from New Jersey. He said, what about \nthe--maybe I could get his attention. My friend from New Jersey asked \nabout a couple that made $15,000. Well, in 1995, they received an EIC \nof $2,360. In 1996, under our reform proposal, they are going to have \nan EIC of $2,488. That is a $128 increase.\n  Now, my colleague from New Jersey would like that increase to be \n$400, but we have it increased by $128. They have an increase. And, \nagain, they did not pay any income taxes. They are getting a return in \nexcess, or at least 100 percent of all their FICA taxes, including what \ntheir employer paid, and we are giving them $100 more than they had \nlast year. That is not a tax increase.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania said, ``Well, how in the world can you \ncall something a tax increase if you are giving somebody $3,000, and \nnext year you are going to give them $3,200? How can you call that a \ntax increase?''\n  Well, let us just take, for example, that you have a rich uncle. The \nrich uncle wants to encourage certain behavior, saying if you work a \nlittle bit, he is going to give you a bonus. If you work about $10,000 \nor $12,000 worth, he is going to give you a $3,000 bonus because he \nwants you to work. Is that not nice?\n  The uncle says, ``I'm going to give you $3,000. Next year I am \nplanning to give you $3,500.'' But your uncle's board of directors said \nyou cannot afford that, you are breaking the bank. So instead, they \ngave you $3,000 next year--actually $3,100 next year instead of giving \nyou $3,500. ``We cannot afford it. Let's give him $3,200. Let's keep it \nto a more moderate growth. Give him an increase, $100, but not $400 or \n$500. Don't do that; the program is growing too fast. But it is a \nbonus.''\n  It does not have anything to do with taxes. This is far in excess of \nany tax liability, either FICA or income tax. That recipient said, \n``You increased my tax base. I hoped I was going to get more money.'' I \ndo not think so.\n  This body is going to show, I believe, that we have the courage to \ncurtail the growth of Medicare, which is a very popular entitlement \nprogram. And we are going to have that program grow about 7 percent per \nyear. We have a program here that continues to grow. The total growth \nin the EIC program is \n\n[[Page S15682]]\n\ngoing to grow about 10 percent over the next few years. The out-of-\npocket costs in fiscal year 1995 are about $20 billion. It will be \nabout $23 billion in the year 2002. That is an increase of 15 percent \nin 7 years.\n  That is an increase in outlays, so the program grows. It does not \ngrow as fast as some people would like. President Clinton and others \nwould like it to grow up to $30 billion. Well, frankly, we cannot \nafford that. We can never balance the budget if we do not have the \ncourage to at least control the growth of entitlement programs. And \nthis is the fastest, most fraudulent entitlement program in Government.\n  We need to curtail its growth. That is what we are trying to do. We \nallow the EIC benefits to go up for individuals with two or more \nchildren. They do not grow as fast as some people would like. President \nClinton and others would like it to grow faster. We cannot afford it. \nSo we allow the benefit to go up by over $100 a year.\n  For individuals who have one child, we make no change. Individuals \nthat have one child get the exact same benefit as they get under \npresent law, under our proposal or President Clinton's proposal. We did \nnot make a change. We did eliminate the benefits for individuals \nwithout children.\n  And I think about that. I have kids that could qualify. Other people \ndo. We are expanding eligibility by several million people. How much \nmoney are we talking about? We are talking about $308, I think, this \nyear, giving that benefit to lots of people. And you say, ``Why do you \ncare about that? That is a small amount of money.''\n  Well, look at what this program cost a few years ago. The maximum \npayment on families with two or more children was $500 in 1985. Today, \n10 years later, it is $3,000. What is the benefit going to be for that \nindividual that happens to be $300 or $400 today? Ten years from now \nmaybe it is $3,000. We will have a program again that continues to \nescalate.\n  This program, Russell Long mentioned it. I have an article in which \nhe states this program should not have been expanded. Russell Long was \none of the fathers of this program. He said it should not have been \nexpanded for individuals without children.\n  I might mention in the 1993 tax bill, there was no Republican that \nvoted for it, and when it passed the Senate it did not have a benefit \nfor individuals without children. That was added on in the House. And, \nunfortunately, the Senate concurred with the House in conference. But \nit was not in the bill that passed in the Finance Committee in the \nSenate nor in the bill that passed on the floor of the Senate. It was \nadded in conference. That was a mistake. It was a massive expansion of \nentitlement, added entitlement to several million people.\n  So we changed that. We eliminate illegal aliens. And we say we should \ncount almost all income. You should count tax-exempt interest as far as \ndetermining who is eligible for this program. You should count other \nincome in determining who is eligible. We allow eligibility, and the \namount of income to determine eligibility, to increase.\n  Right now you qualify for this program if you have income up to \n$26,673. Some people say, ``You really cut that back.'' No. The facts \nare, under our proposal, by the year 2002 you can have income up to \n$29,200 and qualify.\n  Now, that does not grow quite as fast as President Clinton would like \nfor it to. He allows people to receive the benefit if they have income \nequal to $34,600. Let us think about that. Are we going to have Uncle \nSam writing checks--remember, 85 percent of this program is Uncle Sam \nwriting a check, not reducing anybody's taxes, but writing checks--for \nfamilies that have incomes less than $34,000. You are going to be \ntalking about a majority of American families. And old Uncle Sam is \ngoing to be paying people. So we use this income for a massive income \nredistribution program.\n  Contrast that to what we are trying to do on the Republican side. We \nare saying, ``No. We are going to give a tax cut for families, a tax \ncut for people who pay taxes,'' not just come up with schemes to have a \nnegative income tax and have Uncle Sam write big checks at the end of \nthe year. No. We are going to try to reduce all families paying taxes, \nreduce their taxes so they can take the tax reduction on a monthly \nbasis and keep more of their own money. That is what we are talking \nabout doing. That is what is fair.\n  Then my colleague from New Jersey, or one of my colleagues, was \ndenigrating the fact that we made some changes on the inheritance tax, \nsaid how terrible that was. Maybe they should come into my State and \ntalk to some of the members of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau or Farmers \nUnion or some of the wheat growers, because you have a situation where \ninflation has built up the value of some of these farms and ranches, \nestates, machine shops, whatever, to say they are worth something.\n  Uncle Sam comes in and says, ``We want to--'' Somebody dies. They \nwant to pass the property on to their family, and Uncle Sam says, \n``Well, we want 18 percent of it or we want 55 percent of it.'' That \nmakes it very difficult to pass on to succeeding generations.\n  So what did we do? Well, we said for a family estate, let us increase \nright now the exemption from $600,000 and increase that over 6 years to \n$750,000. We increased that amount $25,000 per year. And then we also \nsay if it is a family-held business, we want to encourage that. We \nhappen to be profamily, and we happen to be probusiness. We want to \nencourage family-owned corporations, whether it is a janitor service or \nwhether it is a car dealership or whether it is an insurance company. \nWe want to encourage family ownership, whether it is a farm or a ranch \nor a dairy operation. We want to encourage that.\n  We say, if they are going to pass the property on to their own heirs, \nthey should be able to have a better deal. So we raise that estate \nexemption up to $1.5 million. And we cut the rate down for those \nbetween $1.5 million and $5 million so they can keep it in the family \nand not have to sell it, not have to sell a family business just to pay \nan inheritance tax. I think that is a fair and a good idea.\n  I think that is profamily and that is going to encourage growth and \nencourage a father, instead of saying, ``Well, I might as well spend \nthe money because I cannot pass it on. I do not want to give it to \nUncle Sam,'' we want to encourage people to build up businesses, to \nexpand, to hire more people, to create more jobs, and give that to \ntheir children, and let their children build it up and be second, \nthird, fourth, fifth generations in some of these family-owned \noperations or businesses.\n  Now, we limit it really to the lower size family operations. We did \nnot help the people that have the very largest estates. But I think we \nwere very family friendly. And I think this entire tax bill is very \nfamily friendly. And again I want to compliment the chairman for \ncrafting, I think, a very good, targeted approach, one that has 70-\nsome-odd percent--three-fourths of this package is very family \nfriendly. If you look at the tax credits for children, you look at the \ngradual reductions in the marriage penalty, you look at the estate tax \nexemptions that we make for family-owned farms and ranches and \nbusinesses, this is a very family friendly tax bill, probably the most \nprofamily bill that Congress has ever seen.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to support it and to reject those who \nsay we should not make any reduction whatsoever in the growth of EIC, \nwhich is the fastest growing, most fraudulent program that we have in \nGovernment today.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to ruminate for a few minutes about \nthe Work Opportunities Tax Credit, now called the WOTC, which is the \nsubstitute for the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit, which expired at the end \nof last year.\n  Mr. President, the TJTC had some problems, but let me tell you, it \ngot the job done. It encouraged employers to put kids and young adults \nto work. Youth who probably would not have gotten their first job but \nfor TJTC.\n  I have a letter, Mr. President, from a good friend of mine in \nMontana. W.E. Hainline operates 4 B'S Restaurants across Montana and \nseveral other Western states. They serve good food and employ a lot of \nyoung adults.\n  Bill has had a lot of experience in the TJTC area. In fact, the 4 B'S \nis nationally recognized as a leader when it comes to hiring \ndisadvantaged and handicapped youth, many of whom had their first job \nwith 4 B's.\n  Bill can tell you about these kids and how they went on to other jobs \nand to success in many fields. In fact, that is what TJTC was about, \nand what we want to achieve with WOTC--we want to move kids off of the \nstreets, off of welfare and we want to keep them out of the criminal \njustice system.\n  Bill is concerned, as am I Mr. President, that the WOTC is currently \ncontained in the Reconciliation Bill before us, will not do the job. \nBill notes in his letter that WOTC:\n\n       As written, virtually eliminates most companies from \n     participating in [WOTC] by ignoring the youth group (18 to 24 \n     year olds) not located in an empowerment Zone.\n\n  Mr. President, I joined with Senator Moseley-Braun last week in an \namendment that would have expanded WOTC to create two new categories of \nyouths which employers could hire under WOTC: individuals 18 through 24 \nreceiving or living with families on food stamps; individuals 18 \nthrough 24 who are non-custodial parents of a child residing in a \nfamily receiving AFDC or successor programs; and individuals 18 through \n24 who are receiving Supplemental Security Income.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun and I are working with Joint Tax to find the \nmoney to include these youths in WOTC.\n  Mr. President, as always, Bill Hainline hits the nail on the head. I \nrequest that his letter to me be printed in the Record. Bill has the \ncredentials. He has used the TJTC program. He knows what it takes to \nmake it work. I would encourage my colleagues to read their letter and \nto heed what he has to say. Replacing TJTC with WOTC will accomplish \nlittle if employers, like Bill, do not utilize the WOTC program.\n  If that happens, kids are the big losers.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Restaurants, Inc.,\n\n                                   Missoula, MT, October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC:\n       I understand that the Senate Finance Committee is proposing \n     a new TJTC bill, which was similar to the one developed by \n     the House Ways and Means Committee.\n       Their bill, as written, virtually eliminates most companies \n     from participating in the new program by ignoring the youth \n     group (18 to 24 year olds) not located in an empowerment \n     zone, not to mention the increased retention period from 120 \n     hours to 500 hours.\n       Those two changes would preclude most Montana companies \n     from participating in the proposed program as there are no \n     designated empowerment zones in our state that I am aware of, \n     nor would the proposed tax incentive offset the expense of \n     tracking an eligible employee for 400 hours. After all, the \n     objective of the program is to give people on government \n     assistance, job training to take advantage of all employment \n     opportunities. Why should the initial employer train those \n     types of people for other employers to receive the tax \n     credit?\n       In my opinion, the proposed bill eliminates all employers, \n     not located in an empowerment zone, from participating in the \n     new program. The cost of identifying new hires eligible under \n     the remaining categories, and the expense of tracking those \n     eligible for 500 hours, would far exceed the tax benefits \n     proposed.\n       The only way our company could effectively participate in \n     the new program would be with the inclusion of 18 to 24 year \n     olds that were ``means tested'', and the retention period is \n     lowered to either 200 or 250 hours.\n       The above changes to the program would allow all Montana \n     employers to participate equally with large city employers \n     and insure that all people, with employment barriers, have an \n     equal opportunity to seek employment for any profession they \n     choose.\n       I would greatly appreciate you informing me if these \n     changes can be effected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    W.E.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to \nyesterday's summit meeting between President Clinton and Chinese \nPresident Jiang Zemin in New York.\n  Last summer, relations between the two countries fell rapidly and \nunexpectedly to their lowest point since the Tiananmen massacre, \nlargely over the visit of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to Cornell \nUniversity, his alma mater. Most of us in the Senate, myself included, \nsupported that visit as a private one for a distinguished alum. I \ncontinue to believe that the Chinese leadership in Beijing overreacted \nto the visit and allowed the bilateral relationship to unravel \nunnecessarily. I was sorry that Beijing chose to react to Lee's visit \nby withdrawing the Chinese ambassador to the United States, suspending \nongoing bilateral discussions on proliferation, canceling visits of \nUnited States officials to China and visits of Chinese officials to the \nUnited States, and by canceling bilateral discussions with Taiwan. But \nnow, after several months of discord, it appears we have the \nopportunity to bring some stability back to the relationship and I \nsupport the President's decision to hold this summit in New York.\n  I did not believe that this summit meeting would produce a \nsignificant breakthrough on any of the issues with which we continue to \ndisagree with Beijing, including Tibet, ballistic missile \nproliferation, nuclear testing, suppression of dissent in China, and \ntrade issues. It did not. Recent press reports state that Chinese \nleaders had demanded certain concessions from the United States, such \nas written assurances that members of Taiwan's top leadership will \nnever again be granted a visa to the United States or that the United \nStates will refrain from criticism of China's human rights record in \ninternational fora. The administration rightly gave no such assurances. \nThese are important policy issues, with significant domestic and \ninternational ramifications for both governments. Both governments seem \nconvinced that the other is being unreasonable and obstinate. It is \nunrealistic to expect any major accords could have come under current \ncircumstances.\n  This is an unfortunate state of affairs between two of the world's \nmost influential countries and hopefully a passing one. But for the \ntime being we must focus on keeping the relationship steady and \neffective. That is why a summit meeting between the two presidents was \nso important at this time. The United States raised all of the issues \nthat we believe to be important and let the Chinese leadership know our \ncommitment to them, and we should continue to do so. But it was also \nright to listen to President Jiang's concerns and to strive for mutual \nunderstanding, if not mutual agreement. Those who criticize our \nPresident for failing to win major concessions likely fail to recognize \nthe realities of the current relationship and the necessity of \nstrengthening contacts at all levels that will outlast this period and \ncarry forward a stronger relationship in the future. I commend the \nPresident for holding the summit yesterday and hope that this meeting \nwill mark the beginning of a more solid and productive period of United \nStates--China relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15683-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15683-S15684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before discussing today's bad news about \nthe Federal debt, how about another go, as the British put it, with our \npop quiz. Remember? One question, one answer.\n\n[[Page S15684]]\n\n  The question: How many millions of dollars does it take to add up a \ntrillion dollars? While you are thinking about it, bear in mind that it \nwas the U.S. Congress that ran up the Federal debt that is $27 billion \naway from $5 trillion.\n  To be exact, as of the close of business yesterday, October 24, the \ntotal federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $4,975,508,732,304.35. \nThis figure is approximately $27 billion away from $5 trillion. Another \ndepressing figure means that on a per capita basis, every man, woman, \nand child in America owes $18,887.12.\n  Mr. President, back to our pop quiz, how many million in a trillion: \nThere are a million million in a trillion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15683-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON BROWN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Donald \nS. Brown, who throughout his exceptional career dedicated himself to \npublic service. Mr. Brown has been a pioneer in the field of economic \ndevelopment. He worked tirelessly to help the poor around the world \nachieve a better way of life. He has also been instrumental in shaping \nthe agenda of both bilateral and multilateral development institutions, \nencouraging them to focus closely on the needs of the people.\n  For the last 12 years, Don Brown has served as the vice president of \nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development [IFAD], a \nspecialized agency of the United Nations in Rome. As the most senior \nAmerican in the organization, he has been an innovator of new and \ncreative ideas that IFAD has implemented effectively on the ground. He \nhas helped sharpen the focus of IFAD, which is the only international \nagency which devotes all of its resources to the rural poor. Most \nrecently he has worked diligently, with other senior IFAD officials, to \nstreamline IFAD, increase its efficiency, and reduce its administrative \ncosts. Don Brown has labored unselfishly to promote development and \nreduce poverty and has been an inspiration to all of us working for a \nbetter world.\n  Mr. Brown also ably served in the U.S. Government for over 20 years. \nHe willingly accepted very difficult assignments in various U.S. Agency \nfor International Development [U.S. AID] posts throughout Africa and \nthe Near East. During this time he held the position of mission \ndirector to Morocco and Zaire. In his last field assignment, Mr. Brown \nserved as the director of the U.S. AID Mission to Cairo, Egypt, one of \nAID's largest missions. Mr. Brown also served at AID headquarters in \nWashington as the Deputy Assistant Administrator of AID to help \nformulate U.S. development policy. He also was the Executive Director \nof the Commission on Security and Economic Assistance, established by \nthe Secretary of State.\n  Throughout his career, Don received numerous awards recognizing his \noutstanding achievements. His colleagues both within international \norganizations and the government found his sound advice and the many \ninsights gained from his rich experience invaluable to their work. We \nand they will always remember him as someone who was ever willing to \nlend a helping hand or a word of comfort. Mr. Brown is a thoughtful, \npragmatic, and dedicated individual who touched many of our lives and \nwho made an enormous contribution to the lives of many poor people \naround the world. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nDon Brown and in wishing him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15684-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15684-S15685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ISTOOK-McINTOSH AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the statement made \nyesterday by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, my old friend \nSenator Carl Levin. We came here to the Senate together. I have the \ngreatest admiration and personal regard for him.\n  I trust that my colleagues will listen very carefully to what I have \nto say about this issue--the so-called ``Istook-McIntosh'' amendment \nwhich may be included in the Treasury-Postal appropriations conference \nreport.\n  I ask for your close attention because I am certain that your offices \nare hearing about this language, just as the Senator from Michigan has \nbeen hearing about it. And, if the material coming across my desk is \nany guide at all, a clump of what you are hearing about it is plain \nhogwash, or more civilized, rubbish. I would surely include the \ncommentary of the New York Times within that description.\n  I have been in the negotiations concerning the Istook-McIntosh \nlanguage. I have been working side by side with my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Larry Craig. One could not ask for a better ally in this \nor any other cause. The Senator from Idaho brings many singular \nqualities to this work--a commitment to genuine reform, great realism \nabout what it is possible to achieve in legislating, and unflagging \nconsideration for the concerns of his colleagues--especially including \nme.\n  We know what this proposed amendment does, and what it does not do. \nAnd I can certainly assure my colleagues that much of the lobbying on \nthis amendment has been hysterical at the worst, misleading at best. It \nis no wonder that my friend, the Senator from Michigan, is agitated \nabout it, given the abjectly horrifying portrayal by those lobbying \nthis issue.\n  It almost tempts me to coin a new aphorism--``hell hath no fury like \nan individual whose access to Federal bucks has been conditioned in any \nway.'' Because that is what this issue is about--access to the Federal \nTreasury. It is not about ``free speech'' or the first amendment, or \nanything of the sort. Those are merely the terms which are being \napplied during the argument by those who wish to continue to ensure \nthemselves of continued delivery of Federal money.\n\n  Let me begin my description of this amendment by going back to first \nprinciples. I have a few views which might be termed eccentric or \nquaint or even naive in this era of behemoth government, and one of \nthem is that there are ``responsibilities'' which follow from being a \ncustodian of Federal money.\n  I know that is a strange and even bizarre thing in this day and age, \nto talk about ``responsibility'' instead purely of ``rights,'' or \npurely of ``victims.'' We are all experts on our own rights, but rarely \ndo we acknowledge that these rights confer responsibilities. And that \nis what this issue is about--the responsibilities of those who receive \nFederal money.\n  The Senator from Michigan is justly concerned about the influence of \nlobbyists over the public policy process. This concern animates his \nsincere desire to pass lobbying reform legislation--and he is \nproceeding remarkably toward that end.\n  I agree with that concern, and I would add to it by saying that the \nAmerican public knows that ``something is wrong'' with the process. \nThey know that the process itself interferes with good policy. They \nknow that the interests of the public at large are not served well when \nWashington has so contrived matters as to amplify the access and the \ninfluence of certain special interests, which comes effectively at the \nexpense of the interests of the whole.\n  The average person on the street would be scandalized to find out \nthat we, the Congress, have been blithely engaging for years in the \npractice of favoring political organizations with taxpayer-provided \nmoney.\n  I am not talking about simply the narrow practice of using Federal \ndollars to lobby. That is illegal already, as the Senator from Michigan \nhas so ably pointed out.\n  But I think we need to agree that it is wrong to be giving Federal \ndollars to political organizations, whether or not we ``mark'' those \nbills they receive and then say that only those dollars can't be used \nfor lobbying Congress.\n  Can you imagine the outcry, wailing and gnashing of teeth that would \nexist if the Federal Government were found to have channeled millions \nin grant money to the Christian Coalition? Or the Heritage foundation? \nIt wouldn't matter whether that money was used to hold seminars or to \nbuy stationery. The public would swiftly know that this was wrong, that \nGovernment should not be in the business of propping up the operations \nof political organizations.\n\n  And yet that is precisely what we in America have been doing. I found \nthis year that the AARP received $86 million in Federal grants--this, \nthe largest and most powerful lobbying organization in the country--the \nKing Kong of lobbying ``gorillas.''\n  At the time, I was criticized for ``singling out'' the AARP. I was \ntold that \n\n[[Page S15685]]\n\nthe only way ``to be fair'' was to deal with the problem as a whole, to \nput a stop to the practice across the board. That is what Congressmen \nIstook, McIntosh, and Ehrlich are attempting to do.\n  Let me repeat that I believe we should all agree on the basic premise \nfrom which we should be working; we should not be in the practice of \nfunding political organizations with Federal money.\n  Thus, I have been working with my colleagues on the House side to try \nto develop a reasonable and balanced test for eligibility for public \nfunds. Not to restrict anyone's rights of political expression--but \nrather, to specify minimum standards for the non-political, impartial \ndistribution of public monies. I believe that our final product will \ntry to set reasonable boundaries for the types of organizations which \nshould be receiving Federal money.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that this is not a novel concept. Already \nin the law there are restrictions on the amount of lobbying which can \nbe done by 501-C-3 organizations which take the 501-H election to \nidentify themselves as charities. In return for the benefit of tax \ndeductible contributions, these organizations agree to limit their \nlobbying expenses. They may spend 20 percent of their first $500,000 on \nlobbying, 15 percent of their next $500,000, 10 percent of their next \n$500,000, and 5 percent after that, on up to a global cap of $1 million \non lobbying.\n  Let me repeat for my colleagues: This formula is already in the law. \nNow. It is accepted by all as a reasonable and balanced limit upon the \npolitical activities of such organizations. No one construes this as an \nabridgement of first amendment rights. It is a consequence of our \nconsensus opinion that predominantly political organizations should not \nreceive certain Government benefits.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to go out in the land and talk to various \nindividuals about the 501-H spending formula. Not the ones ``beating \nthe drum'' about this legislation. But most others would agree that the \nformula is extremely lenient, very generous--some would say it is so \ngenerous as not to constitute a significant restriction at all.\n  I have been working with my House colleagues to develop reforms of \nthese boundaries to make certain that they work in practice in a way \nthat they have not always worked before this time.\n  The Senator from Michigan highlighted one particular feature of the \noriginally proposed Istook language, singling it out for criticism. \nThis concerns the application of the spending formula to non-Federal \nmoney. I listened carefully to that commentary, and I wonder whether or \nnot my old friend from Michigan and the rest of the Senate are aware of \nthe way in which the law already works in this area.\n  I have been distressed to see the howls and shrieks of outrage from \nGovernment grantees when we suggest that they should no longer be able \nto ``count'' the amount of their Federal grants in computing their \nlobbying expenses under the formula which I just outlined. This has \neven been a rallying cry against the principles in the grant reform \namendment--how outrageous, it is said, that there should be any \nrestriction on the use of private funds.\n  Let me try to calm the heaving bosoms out there by asking my \ncolleagues to think about this substantively for just a moment. First \nof all, the existing formula--already in the law--already applies to \nall 501-H groups even if they don't receive Federal money. So this \nsupposed restriction on the use of private funds already exists.\n  Furthermore, consider the paradox that results if we continue to \n``count'' the Federal money when computing allowed lobbying expenses. \nIf you have two organizations--each with the same amount of private \nsupport--then, under current law, the one that pulls down a Government \ngrant can spend more on lobbying than the one which doesn't. That is \nthe very essence of taxpayer-subsidized lobbying, which we all agree is \nwrong. It only makes sense for an organization's lobbying expenses to \nbe based on their degree of private support, not on the amount given to \nthem in Federal money.\n\n  I expect that this debate will heat up still further, and I expect \nthat hysteria and distortion will abound. I can see some of it already. \nI have read articles saying that somehow this legislation will stop \norganizations from being able to write editorials and to even make \ntheir opinions known. That is nonsense, unless somewhere in this \ncountry it costs you $1 million to write a letter to the editor.\n  I personally will have my old bald dome battered because I have \nstated all along that I would seek to protect the ``true'' charities \nfrom the scope of any legislation--the 501-C-3 organizations which we \nall care so much about--and should.\n  Well, the amendment which hopefully will shortly be presented as an \nIstook-Simpson compromise will indeed protect them. We will protect \nthem not by creating a blanket exemption for all charitable groups, but \nby leaving ``in place'' the spending restriction formulas that already \napply to charitable organizations.\n  I have also heard various muted and sometimes raucous imputations \nthat this amendment is somehow discriminatory, that it singles out a \nparticular ``type'' of recipient for restriction. It has been implied--\nalthough not overtly stated--that somehow we are working to exclude \nfor-profit lobbyists from this legislation, targeting the legislation \nonly against ``nonprofits.''\n  That is simply untrue. The Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich amendment does not \ndistinguish between for-profit and nonprofit entities. If a grant is \ngiven to a for-profit taxpaying organization, they are subject to the \nsame lobbying caps.\n  The language does not exclude ``contractors'' in any general way, \nalthough the language does not apply specifically to ``contracts.'' \nThere is a very good reason for this, and this is the ambiguity as to \nwhat constitutes a ``contract'' with the Federal Government. The \ninclusion of ``contracts'' in this legislation would mean that every \nHMO around the country which contracts to provide services under \nMedicare would be covered. That and similar consequences are the \nreasons that ``contracts'' are not included; it is not some sinister \nconspiracy to exclude or target any particular group. If opponents of \nthe legislation can figure out a way for us to responsibly include \n``contracts'' in the scope of this legislation without creating serious \nambiguities and contradictions, we would be most happy to work with \nthose suggestions.\n\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks, because there will be time \nto debate this later at length. But for the record today, I do not want \nto let the current characterization of this legislative language go \nunchallenged.\n  I want first and foremost to repeat my response to a central point \nmade by the opposition. Somehow the Istook language is said to be \nsinister because it applies the spending formula to the nonfederal, \nprivate money.\n  Of course it does. Which money is the existing 501-H spending cap \nformula supposed to apply to? The Federal money? That is supposed to be \nillegal, to use Federal money for lobbying. No, it has always been \nunderstood that those restrictions applied to the private support; \nthere is nothing novel or sinister of evil about that. The Proposed \nlanguage would simply make this explicit.\n  We are still working with House negotiators to try to craft a package \nwhich we believe will be worthy of Senate support. I trust that my \ncolleagues will study the details about the finished product rather \nthan to listen to the characterizations that have been made by those \nwho are lobbying against it.\n  This could be our best chance to effect true lobbying reform--and the \nbest measure of that is the degree to which this has agitated those \nlobbyists suckling at the Federal breast. We should be equally vigilant \nabout gifts from lobbyists, and gifts to lobbyists. This measure \nattempts to deal with the latter.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15684-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15685-S15686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1322.

A bill to provide for the repurchase of land acquired by the \nUnited States from Native American organizations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   Surplus Real Property Legislation\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce a measure that would \nauthorize the repurchase of surplus real property by native American \ntrust organizations.\n  This measure is unusual in that it not only serves the objective of \nrestoring to such organizations--real property that was acquired by the \nUnited States should such property be deemed to be surplus to the need \nof the federal government--but also provides for the repurchase of the \nproperty at today's fair market value, which will enable the United \nStates to recapture the original value of the property, as well as any \nassociated appreciation in value which has accrued since the time of \nacquisition.\n  Mr. President, this measure also authorizes the establishment of a \ntrust fund in the United States Treasury, in which would be deposited \nthat amount which represents the appreciated value of the reacquired \nproperty. For each property so repurchased by a Native American Trust \nOrganization--the amount associated with the appreciated value of such \nproperty--would be added to the corpus of the trust. In turn, the \nincome accruing on the investment of the trust corpus funds would be \nexpended for the purposes of health and education authorized under \nexisting federal law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1362. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Focus; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     Trading Privileges Legislation\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct \nthat the vessel Focus, U.S. Official Number 909293, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code.\n  The Focus was constructed in Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 1983 and is a \nsailing vessel presently used for recreational purposes. It is 47.8 \nfeet in length, 15.8 feet in breadth, has a depth of 6.5 feet, and is \nself-propelled.\n  The vessel is owned by John Passaloukas of Hilton Head Island, South \nCarolina. Mr. Passaloukas would like to utilize his vessel in the \ncoastwise trade and fisheries of the United States. However, because \nthe vessel was built in a foreign shipyard, it does not meet the \nrequirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United States. \nThe present owner purchased the Focus in a state of disrepair, after \nthe vessel had been neglected for ten years, and has totally \nrefurbished the vessel in U.S. shipyards. Coastwise documentation is \nmandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel for its intended \npurpose.\n  The owner of the Focus is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel for recreational and ecotourism \ncharters. His desired intentions for the vessel's use will not \nadversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If he is granted \nthis waiver, it is his intention to comply fully with U.S. \ndocumentation and \n\n[[Page S15687]]\n\nsafety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is \nto allow the Focus to engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries \nof the United States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 1363. A bill to terminate the agricultural price support and \nproduction adjustment programs for sugar on the date the President \ncertifies to Congress that a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has \nbeen entered into that prohibits all export subsidies for sugar, price \nsupport and production adjustment programs for sugar, and tariffs and \nother trade barriers on the importation of sugar, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                           sugar legislation\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nterminate U.S. agricultural price support and production adjustment \nprograms for sugar contingent upon a GATT agreement which would \neliminate export subsidies and price supports in other countries of the \nworld. While I firmly believe that the free market should be allowed to \nwork, it does not make sense to put our producers at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the world subsidized market.\n  I can't speak for the rest of the country, but Michigan sugar beet \nproducers are some of the most efficient producers in the world, yet \nwithout a U.S. sugar program they would most likely find it impossible \nto compete against less efficient foreign producers who are more highly \nsubsidized. Other countries subsidize their sugar at a level so high \nthat they are able to dump the excess sugar on the world market at a \nprice well below the world's cost of production. Unilateral elimination \nof our sugar program would put the best producers of sugar in the world \nat a competitive disadvantage to less efficient producers. This simply \ndoes not make sense.\n  We cannot give up the hope that the world will have a free sugar \nmarket. Through the GATT, we have begun and will continue to work \ndiligently toward that goal. I am hopeful that my legislation will \nprompt other Members of the House and Senate to contact the \nAdministration in favor of further GATT talks that would move us closer \nto a free world market for agriculture. Until this occurs, however, we \nmust carefully examine the consequences of the steps we take to reform \nor eliminate our support programs so that we do not put our producers \nin a position of weakness compared to other countries. Furthermore, we \ncannot simply assume other countries would follow our lead if we were \nto eliminate our sugar program. In fact, the result may be quite the \nopposite. Without a trade agreement, other countries would have greater \naccess to the U.S. market, helping to perpetuate these foreign \nsubsidies rather than encourage their elimination.\n  Mr. President, I assure you that during my tenure as a Member of this \nbody I will fight diligently on the side of free trade. Understanding \nthe importance of global free trade in a growing world market, I will \ncontinue to work to eliminate export subsidies and other price supports \nworldwide so that we may eventually achieve true free trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15686-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 612\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the name of the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] was added as a cosponsor of S. 612, a bill to \namend title 38, United States Code, to provide for a hospice care pilot \nprogram for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                                s. 1248\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the name of the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1248, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the alcohol fuels \ncredit to be allocated to patrons of a cooperative in certain cases.\n\n\n                                s. 1271\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1271 a bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982.\n\n\n                       senate joint resolution 22\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grams, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 22, a \njoint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to require a balanced budget.\n\n\n                         senate resolution 146\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of Senate \nResolution 146, a resolution designating the week beginning November \n19, 1995, and the week beginning on November 24, 1996, as ``National \nFamily Week,'' and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15687-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15687-S15699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        FORD AMENDMENT NO. 2948\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. FORD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (S. 1357) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 105 of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6  .

Mr. President, over the next few days, we will be debating \nthe logic of a $245 billion tax break that adds to the deficit and cuts \ndangerously deep into critical programs for middle-income Americans--\nfrom Medicare to education. My Republican colleagues will justify \nadding to the deficit and making those cuts by striking the familiar \nrefrain that these tax breaks will boost the economy.\n  But Mr. President, those tax breaks are not only jeopardizing \nimportant investments in our future economy like education and job \ntraining, they're jeopardizing critical infrastructure improvements \nthat mean much more to local economies than a tax break for America's \nwealthiest few.\n  One of those infrastructure projects is a bridge linking my home \nState of Kentucky with Indiana. Without a doubt, the Natcher Bridge \nwould mean much more to the local economies of Kentucky and Indiana \nthan this tax break. From the increased interstate commerce to making \nthe region more attractive to future businesses, industry, and tourism, \nthe Natcher Bridge is a long-term investment for every Kentuckian and \nHossier. But, unfortunately, it was sold down the river for a tax break \nfor a wealthy few.\n\n[[Page S15688]]\n\n  I have filed and had planned to offer an amendment to the Budget \nReconciliation bill authorizing funding for the Natcher Bridge \nconnecting Kentucky to Indiana. It would be offset by reducing the \nRepublicans' $500 per child tax credit from the proposed income cap of \n$110,000 to $100,000.\n  However, it's my understanding that the same Republicans who killed \nthis bridge project, will also raise a point of order against my \namendment. That means I would have to get a super majority for approval \nof my amendment. Without that huge road block, I think I could have \npersuaded my colleagues on the merits of finishing this project.\n  That's right. Not starting this project--but finishing this project.\n  It's a little bit like the young officer who pointed to the place on \nthe map he planned to have the troops cross the river. ``Excellent,'' \nremarked this superior, ``but your finger is not a bridge.'' Well \nneither are two piers sticking out of the Ohio River.\n  Nearly $56 million in State and Federal funds have been spent on this \nbridge so far. Along with that financial commitment you'll find the \ninitial stages of a new 7.4 mile, four-lane section of U.S. 60 that \nshould--and I stress should--connect with a 4.7 mile highway leading to \nthe bridge.\n  We began this bridge project back in 1988, because the current bridge \nwas deemed incapable of dealing with future capacity, fated to become \nfunctionally obsolete. Because of the serious capacity concerns, we had \nto find the quickest and most efficient way to allocate funds--a \ndemonstration project. Kentucky was very lucky to have Congressman \nWilliam Natcher working diligently to get yearly funding for the \nbridge.\n  In hindsight, it probably would have been better to get total funding \nfor the bridge in just 1 year. But at the time, that would have been \nover $80 million in Federal funds and Mr. Natcher just wasn't that way. \nHe didn't want to take any money away from other States, and leave them \nin a pinch. He just took what was essential to the bridge's progress \neach year.\n  With his passing, the job of securing funds became much harder, but \ncertainly not less worthy. Despite the fact that it was not included in \nthe House Transportation Appropriations bill last year, I was able to \nsecure the next installment. That's because my colleagues recognized at \nthe time that the Natcher Bridge was a critical link in our national \ninfrastructure.\n  That hasn't changed. And, ending this project now--with nearly $56 \nmillion already invested--would be a considerable waste of Federal and \nState funding, not to mention all but shutting the door to the \neconomically important I-64 corridor for these communities.\n  While I will not be offering this amendment today, I will be offering \nit in the future. Because the communities on either side of the river, \nand those businesses counting on that corridor for moving their goods \nsafely and efficiently, know that building this bridge should come \nbefore providing a tax break to those making $110,000.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        BROWN AMENDMENT NO. 2949\n\n  Mr. BROWN proposed an amendment to the motion to commit proposed by \nMr. Rockefeller to the bill S. 1357, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``Finance'' and insert the following: \n     ``With instructions to report the bill back to the Senate \n     forthwith to include the findings of the Trustees of the \n     Federal Insurance Trust Fund that, in order to save Medicare \n     and to keep the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund solvent for \n     future generations, Congress must address both the long-term \n     and short-term shortfalls in the Medicare program.''\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       ABRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 2950\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 6 of title VII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $3.6 billion on budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $3.4 billion in outlays. Current level is $2.2 billion \nabove the revenue \n\n[[Page S15700]]\n\nfloor in 1996 and $125.4 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 \nyears 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of \ncalculating the maximum deficit amount is $249 billion, $1.2 billion \nabove the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of $247.8 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated October 12, 1995, Congress cleared, and \nthe President signed the Agriculture Appropriations Act--Public Law \n104-37.

Mr. President, we have heard a lot of horror \nstories about how bad the welfare system is, how it discourages people \nfrom getting married, finding work, and taking responsibility for \nthemselves and their children. I would agree that the system needs an \noverhaul, and that is why I worked so hard on the Senate welfare reform \nbill we passed just last month. But I also believe that, within this \nbroken system, there are many places that have already begun to \nexperiment with innovative solutions to their welfare problems. And \nsome of these initiatives are working--they are getting people off of \nwelfare and into jobs.\n  One of the best examples of this success is what is happening right \nnow in my State of Louisiana. Since October 1990, the number of \nfamilies in Louisiana receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nhas dropped 20 percent. A report issued by the Public Welfare \nAssociation in 1994 ranked Louisiana last in the country in AFDC \ncaseload growth for 1989 through 1993. Last in the country. That is \ngood news.\n  And that is due in large part to Project Independence, our statewide \nprogram that moves families from welfare dependency to independence. \nProject Independence provides transportation and child care--absolutely \nessential elements in moving people from welfare to work. It helps \nparticipants build up self-esteem by showing them their own ability to \nsucceed in the work world. It also helps participants receive their \nGED's or high school diplomas, associate or 4-year degrees, or skill \ntraining, and builds their resumes through community service.\n  One Project Independence Program in particular, the Hamilton Terrace \nLearning Center in Shreveport, has been singled out for its outstanding \nsuccess. Tomorrow, Vice President Gore will name this second-chance \nhigh school a winner of an Innovations in American Government Award \nfrom the Ford Foundation and the John F. Kennedy School of Government \nat Harvard University. This prestigious award honors 15 initiatives \neach year that have developed effective, creative solutions to \nimportant social and economic problems. It carries with it a $100,000 \ngrant to disseminate information about Hamilton Terrace and encourage \nits replication.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit Hamilton Terrace twice and each \ntime, I was impressed by the dedication of the staff and the motivation \nof the students.\n  Hamilton Terrace Learning Center puts adult welfare recipients and \nstudents expelled from other local high schools in the same classes, \nwhere the adults convey a strong message to the teens on the importance \nof taking school seriously and avoiding some of the mistakes they made. \nAt the same time, the teens give the welfare mothers a fresh look back \nat their own behavior, and give them a better sense of the role they \ncan play in preventing their children from making the same mistakes. \nPutting these two groups together brings out a strong sense of \nresponsibility in both.\n  The curriculum combines traditional academic courses with vocational \ntraining in fields such as food service, travel and tourism, health \ncare, and child care. Classes are longer and about half the normal size \nto allow teachers time to get to know their students better. Lessons \nare tailored individually to each student's particular learning style. \nOn Fridays, students either spend their time in community service or in \ncounseling to work on specific academic concerns, and teachers meet for \ntraining and to work on solutions to problems they are facing in the \nclassroom.\n  And it is all work-oriented. A school-to-work coordinator works \nclosely with the Shreveport Chamber of Commerce to assist every student \nin planning a course of study that will result in a good job after \ngraduation. Every graduate is guaranteed a job or enrollment in post-\nsecondary training.\n  Their success has been outstanding. Of the school's 118 graduates \nfrom the \n\n[[Page S15701]]\n\nclass of 1994, 71 percent went on to college. Of the 58 graduates who \nwere on welfare, all but 7 are working or in college. At 21 percent, \nthe school's dropout rate is considerably lower than the State average \nof 51 percent--and that's particularly good if you consider that most \nstudents failed in the traditional system.\n  Hamilton Terrace's success is well-known across Louisiana, and I am \nproud that it will be recognized nationally as well. It is an \noutstanding example of the real successes that are going on all around \nus. I congratulate its principal, John Baldwin, and all of its staff \nand students for their good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15700-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15701-S15702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, several months ago, the Senate \npassed Senate Resolution 103, designating the week of October 15-21, \n1995, as National Character Counts Week. Across the country, hundreds \nof towns, cities, schools, and 60 national organizations ranging from \nthe YMCA to the Little League, encompassing about 35 million young \npeople and adults, celebrated this week.\n  As most in this chamber are aware, character counts advocates the \nteaching of the six pillars of character, six ethical values that \ntranscend political, cultural, religious, and socioeconomic \ndifferences: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, caring, \nfairness, and citizenship.\n  The character counts nationwide effort is one whose time has come. As \nexplained in the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development report, \n``Great Transitions,'' adolescents need help and support from not just \ntheir families and schools, but also the entire community. I agree with \nthe statement of Julius Richmond, professor of health policy at Harvard \nMedical School and surgeon general under President Carter, ``The \nschools go their way, the after-school programs go their way. . . . \nThis report really points out the importance of all community resources \ncoming together.''\n  The idea of a total community approach is an important one. This is \nwhy I am such an enthusiastic supporter of the character counts \nprograms across the State of New Mexico. By way of background, about a \nyear ago, I asked the Mayor of Albuquerque Martin Chavez (D), to join \nme in a bipartisan effort to establish a communitywide character counts \nprogram. We pursued this effort with the local churches, the entire \nAlbuquerque public school system, civic and social organizations, \nunions, the police department, parent groups, and the private sector. \nAs a result, Albuquerque became the first city in America to adopt a \ncitywide character counts program.\n  Several weeks ago, the spokesman for the national Character Counts \nCoalition, actor and producer Tom Selleck, joined me in Albuquerque to \nvisit schools participating in this community effort. I cannot begin to \nrelate the excitement of the students at the Osuna Elementary and the \nGarfield Middle Schools as the entire student body met in their \ngymnasiums to honor their character counts programs.\n  The schools were celebrating the word of the month, citizenship. The \nstudents were able to discuss what citizenship meant and why it was \nimportant, and the little ones loved to shout out the spelling of \n``citizenship'' or join in the singing of the theme song about \ncharacter. The character counts message is being delivered city-wide by \nmany different voices, and it is obvious the children and teachers are \nenthusiastic participants in this program.\n  After the successful startup of the Albuquerque character counts \nmodel, other New Mexico communities started similar programs. Roswell \ninvited other nearby towns to join them in the effort so that the \nprogram could be developed beyond the city's geographical boundaries, \nand this communitywide program has exceeded the expectation of the \nhundreds of organizations and individuals who have joined forces to \nsupport character counts. As an example, in honor of Character Counts \nWeek, at the annual high school football game, the entire halftime \nprogram was devoted to character counts. The event included all of the \nhigh schools and middle schools in the area.\n  The State of New Mexico received one of the Department of Education \ngrants for developing character education programs, a grants program \nthat we developed and passed on last year's Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. These funds will help many other New Mexico communities \nwho are initiating similar character education programs in their \nschools and youth organizations.\n  To emphasize that this issue is one of concern to millions of \nAmericans besides New Mexicans, I think it is noteworthy that after \nRoswell was featured on a nationally televised news story, my State \noffice has received more than 1,000 requests from all across the \ncountry for information about establishing a character counts program. \nThis is something new and vibrant--an approach that touches the lives \nof children and adults alike. It reaches out to encircle the youth with \nsimilar messages--that respect and responsibility and caring, for \nexample, are appropriate responses and actions.\n  The Albuquerque Public School District, consisting of 118 schools, \nhas now developed an extensive and remarkable program. As stated in \ntheir recent report:\n\n       What began in APS as a grass roots movement in schools \n     interested in promoting more productive behavior in their \n     students, has grown to be a focus area in the strategic \n     planning process for the district and a major educational \n     goal of the superintendent. . . . What followed was an \n     outpouring of interest and action as schools enthusiastically \n     integrated the pillars of character into their own curricula.\n\nI ask that the text of the APS report be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  As we read report after report about the state of America's children, \nand we know from talking with parents, teachers, and community leaders \nthat children need strong and compassionate support, I believe that the \ncharacter counts program is one effort that can help. As important, I \nbelieve the model established in cities across New Mexico is the right \napproach. It is an all-encompassing approach that does not start and \nstop with the ringing of a school bell, or last for a single hour in \nchurch or at a youth organization meeting. Instead, the communitywide \napproach really says that with a rather simple and single message, \neveryone cares, and that everyone in that city is willing to put time, \nmoney and energy behind its youth.\n  Mr. President, for the last 2 years we have passed a resolution in \nsupport of National Character Counts Week. I know I speak for the other \nnine Senators of the Senate character counts group when I say that our \nlegislative efforts are a support mechanism for the really important \ngrass roots efforts we see across this country. The reason character \ncounts programs are developing in schools and communities across \nAmerica is because there is a genuine quest for resolving the problems \nof our young citizens. This program is an approach where everyone, \nyoung and old, can be part of a larger effort to make their towns and \ncities better places to work and live. It seems to me that this \napproach is well worth the effort, and I offer my congratulations to \nthe thousands of committed citizens who are working together and \nbuilding a program not only for the good of the present, but also for \nthe next, generation of Americans.\n  The report follows:\n\n                         APS Curriculum Support\n\n       The Albuquerque Public School District opened the 1995-96 \n     school year with renewed dedication to the principles of \n     character education as exemplified in the Character Counts! \n     philosophy. What began in APS as a grass roots movement in \n     schools interested in promoting more productive behavior in \n     their students has grown to be a focus area in the strategic \n     planning process for the district and a major educational \n     goal of the Superintendent. When the Board of Education for \n     the Albuquerque Public Schools endorsed the pillars of \n     character as named in the Josephson Foundation's Aspen \n     Declaration, it wisely left the implementation of this \n     philosophy up to the teachers and principals of the 188 \n     schools in the district. What followed was an outpouring of \n     interest and action as schools enthusiastically integrated \n     the pillars of character: trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, citizenship, caring, and fairness, into their \n     own curricula.\n       For 1995-96 APS has adopted a goal for character education, \n     stating, ``The Albuquerque Public Schools will provide \n     learners of all ages the knowledge and ethical foundation \n     needed to become productive citizens in our community.'' \n     Objectives to meet this goal are:\n       The Albuquerque Public Schools has endorsed and will \n     support the Character \n\n[[Page S15702]]\n\n     Counts! program as a way to develop character based on the \n     six core ethical values.\n       The Albuquerque Public Schools will continue collaborations \n     with community entities to reach agreements about the role of \n     each in promoting ethical behavior among young people and \n     adults in various aspects of life.\n       The Albuquerque Public Schools commit to creating models of \n     ethical behavior among all adults who serve students and \n     schools.\n       The APS Core Curriculum will continue to give explicit \n     attention to character development as an ongoing part of \n     school instruction. Materials, teaching methods, \n     partnerships, and services for school programs shall be \n     selected by APS, in part, for their capacity to support the \n     development of character among youth and adults.\n       The Albuquerque Public Schools will provide training to \n     enable schools and other administrative units to implement \n     the principles of character education.\n       All schools will examine school curriculum, classroom \n     practices, and extra curricular activities to identify and \n     extend opportunities for developing character.\n       APS School to Work initiatives will integrate character \n     education with the employability skills necessary to prepare \n     students to enter the workplace.\n       The emphasis on character education in the public schools \n     has been met with immediate and enthusiastic support in the \n     business and volunteer community in Albuquerque. Members of \n     the Leadership Council formed to support Character Counts! \n     include representatives from financial institutions, non-\n     profit youth agencies, Sandia National Laboratory, the NAACP, \n     the NM Bar Foundation, the Chamber of Commerce, the City of \n     Albuquerque, the Albuquerque Teachers Federation, and others. \n     This coalition was formed to support the Character Counts \n     initiative financially, and by giving parents in the work \n     force the same message given to their children in schools. \n     The marketing committee from this council planned and \n     implemented a Character Counts rally in Albuquerque's Civic \n     Plaza. Character Counts day at the New Mexico State Fair, and \n     numerous other events to support the program. Citizens of \n     Albuquerque read the Character Counts message on billboards, \n     on soft drink cans, and in city utility bills.\n       As schools begin conversations based on character \n     education, they enjoy the freedom to plan learning activities \n     tailored for their own students, staff, and communities. \n     District support for these ventures in the first year \n     included a training session given by Michael Josephson, \n     founder of Character Counts, for representatives of each \n     geographical cluster of schools. There teachers, parents, and \n     administrators will act as trainers and facilitators for the \n     rest of the school district and community. Other support \n     activities included the development of a bibliography for \n     Character Counts based on the six pillars, a parent manual \n     for use in schools, and a manual for administrators \n     interested in initiating a program in their own schools.\n       Second year support activities include the distribution of \n     a commitment form for schools to indicate their plans for \n     character education to district administrators, followed by a \n     starter kit to be distributed to interested teachers and \n     students. Other administrative units in the public schools \n     have developed their own plans for character education, \n     including a program for school bus behavior and safety. \n     Join-A-School business partnerships in 1995-96 will focus \n     on respect, responsibility, and trustworthiness as \n     demonstrated in school-to-work training.\n       Much of the growth in the second year of Character Counts \n     involvement will be supported by a grant through the New \n     Mexico State Department of Education and the U.S. Department \n     of Education. The New Mexico Character Education Pilot \n     Project will allow the school district to continue its formal \n     plans to provide extended training in character education, \n     further develop a marketing component, involve parents and \n     community members as active partners in character education, \n     mentor a Native American school/community in character \n     education, and develop a clearinghouse for information \n     related to character education.\n       The true joy in the growing involvement of APS schools in \n     character education is found not in administrative structure \n     and planning, but in the classrooms and school programs \n     developed to support Character Counts. Examples of student \n     participation include school Character Counts kickoffs like \n     the one at Cochiti Elementary School where staff and students \n     celebrated the word of the month with original songs, raps, \n     and poetry, all focused on ``Respect.'' At this school, \n     student-authored slogans are announced daily and posted in \n     the cafeteria to remind everyone to be respectful to self and \n     to others. At Sombra del Monte Elementary School, teachers \n     and parents performed skits demonstrating ``respect'' to the \n     delight of their students. Students at Chelwood launched \n     their program as they released balloons, each representing a \n     pillar of Character Counts. The students attached cards to \n     the balloons, asking the finder to return the card to the \n     school. Children at Wherry Elementary School sang a rap they \n     composed about character and children performed examples of \n     ``do's'' and ``don'ts'' of good character at an all school \n     assembly. Middle school activities include rewarding students \n     at Madison Middle School for demonstrating behavior related \n     to the six pillars by presenting coupons good for redemption \n     at local businesses, and holding a Jog-A-Thon to kickoff \n     activities at Grant Middle School. McKinley Middle School \n     hosted a breakfast for its school bus drivers to begin their \n     pilot project integrating school bus safety and the concepts \n     of Character Counts. Eldorado High School students are \n     reminded of Character Counts with the printing of the six \n     pillars above all school doorways.\n       While APS is presently caught up in the launching of the \n     Character Counts! philosophy, members of the district know \n     that the true test of the value of this initiative will lie \n     far down the road for our young students. The participants in \n     Character Counts in the Albuquerque Public Schools believe \n     the true value in this program will be measured in succeeding \n     years, when student learning and behavior reflects not only \n     the enthusiasm of launching a worthwhile program, but \n     demonstrates the internalization of the six pillars of \n     Character Counts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15701-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15702-S15703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto speak on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  In their budget reconciliation package, Republican budget planners \nhave mandated the oil exploration and drilling of the fragile coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This 125-mile stretch is \nthe last protected area of the 1,100-mile Alaskan coastline. It is home \nto many precious species including caribou, polar bears, golden eagles, \nand grizzly bears.\n  We have all seen the devastation wreaked by the drilling of the North \nSlope of Alaska and Prudhoe Bay. Before oil was discovered in the North \nSlope, it was part of the largest intact wilderness in the United \nStates. The oil development of the North Slope has resulted in hundreds \nof open waste pits containing millions of gallons of oil industry waste \nand the destruction of thousands of acres of wildlife habitat. There is \nno reason to believe that the drilling of the coastal plain would \nproduce any less devastating effects. The damage caused by the \nconstruction of oil rigs, roads, and pipelines and the inevitable oil \nand chemical spills are simply not worth the assumed revenues of this \nshort term private gain induced pillaging.\n  As stewards of our few remaining wildlife refuges, I believe that we \nhave an obligation to protect them and the animals that seek shelter \nwithin them.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that an editorial by Jessica Mathews, which \nappeared in the Washington Post on October 23, 1995, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 23, 1995]\n\n                        Lusting After Black Gold\n\n                          (By Jessica Mathews)\n\n       Alaskans think they have a terrible financial problem. To \n     solve it they propose to ruin the last protected fragment of \n     the arctic coastal plain--part of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)--by opening it to oil drilling.\n       Here's the problem. Alaska has no state income tax, no \n     sales tax and the lowest fuel taxes in the nation. It has the \n     highest per-capita income from the federal government of any \n     state. State spending is twice the national average. And it \n     has an $18 billion savings account, the Permanent Fund, that \n     provides an annual Christmas-in-September check of a little \n     less than $1,000 for every man, woman and child. You might \n     think of it as Saudi Alaska.\n       Here's the bad news. The North Slope oil revenues that \n     underwrite this easy living are drying up, and the state now \n     has a half-billion-dollar deficit that's heading skyward.\n       One can still think offhand of about 49 governors who would \n     love to have a fiscal problem like Alaska's. Solutions leap \n     to the mind. Impose a small sales tax. Raise the fuel tax a \n     bit. Cut the most egregious spending frills. Use some of the \n     income from the oil-funded savings account for the purpose \n     for which it was created instead of as a universal bonus \n     entitlement. Alaskans have a different answer. Drill ANWR--\n     and hope that puts off the day of reckoning for a few more \n     years.\n       In an unguarded moment of honesty, Alaska's congressional \n     delegation--Sens. Ted Stevens (R) and Frank Murkowski (R) and \n     Rep. Don Young (R)--made the linkage explicit in a recent \n     letter to constituents. The relevant passage says, in full: \n     ``Oil revenue funds about 85 percent of the state's budget, \n     but Prudhoe Bay is in decline. The administration is \n     threatening to veto legislation to open the coastal plain.''\n       The other arguments for drilling in the refuge range from \n     flimsy to specious. For years, a favorite has been that it \n     would enhance national security by reducing the country's oil \n     import dependence. That won't wash anymore since Congress and \n     the administration have agreed to lift the 22-year-old ban on \n     exporting Alaskan oil. If we need to reduce oil imports, why \n     export our own?\n       The best came Presidents Reagan and Bush could make for \n     opening ANWR was that \n\n[[Page S15703]]\n\n     chances were one in two that its production would rise in a \n     few years to 4 percent of U.S. oil use, dropping to one \n     percent five years later and less thereafter. Not \n     surprisingly, Congress didn't find that a compelling reason \n     to make an irreversible sacrifice of the wilderness. If in \n     some presently unimaginable future the nation absolutely \n     required ANWR's oil it would still be there for the taking.\n       Since then, the U.S. Geological Survey has slashed the \n     expected find by more than half. An offshore well drilled in \n     one of the most promising areas was a bust. Another hit oil \n     but not in developable quantity, though the company, Atlantic \n     Richfield, is still enthusiastic.\n       Meanwhile, the expected market in which ANWR oil would have \n     to compete, has turned from tight to squishy. Projected oil \n     prices for the year 2000 are down from $38 to $19 per barrel. \n     That turns the industry's five-year-old projection, which it \n     is now shamelessly recycling, of 700,000 jobs created \n     nationwide, from highly unlikely to laughable.\n       The last-resort claim is that drilling won't make much \n     difference to this narrow plain that is the biologically \n     crucial part--the birthing, denning, feeding and nursery \n     ground--of a much larger, fragle and unique arctic ecosystem. \n     But no matter how environmentally sensitive the effort, 400 \n     miles of roads, 11 production facilities, four airstrips, two \n     ports, massive gravel mining and housing for several \n     thousand, plus associated emissions and toxic wastes are not \n     what most peole expect of wilderness. Neither will the plants \n     and animals.\n       What's left? A short-term fix that might or might not \n     prolong the oil-welfare state. Not much there to arouse \n     support, even in Washington. So the state's powerful \n     congressional delegation, whose members chair both the House \n     and Senate Natural Resources Committees, came up with a \n     sweetener. They propose to give half of the hoped-for leasing \n     revenue to Washington, which helps make the numbers work in \n     the Republicans' deficit-reduction plan. If Congress counts \n     on the money, however, it is playing a chump's game. The \n     state has promised to sue for any split less than the 90 \n     percent it believes is guaranteed by its Statehood Act.\n       Alaska's congressmen want the name of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge changed to the Arctic Oil Reserve. It's \n     revealing that what's gone is not just wildlife, but the \n     national interest as well. Until Congress acts, they \n     unilaterally have adopted a new acronym, AOR. If the ANWR \n     proposal does pass, the delegation has a lot more to follow, \n     including develop in the Tongass National Forest and turning \n     back 70 million acres of federal lands to the state.\n       Instead, Congress should give the ANWR proposal the \n     treatment it deserves. In the spirit of adopting new acronyms \n     it could send along a message as well: GRA. Get Real, Alaska. \n     The rest of us would trade for your troubles. Face the real \n     choices now--ANWR isn't the answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15702-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MENTALLY DISABLED VETERANS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on September 26, during the \nSenate debate on H.R. 2099, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, I offered \nan amendment to strike a provision in the bill which would discontinue \ndisability compensation payments to certain mentally disabled veterans \nwhen their savings reach $25,000. Unfortunately, my amendment was not \nadopted. I continue to believe strongly that this provision should not \nbe enacted and urge the conferees on H.R. 2099 to drop it.\n  Mr. President, as I noted in that debate, this provision \ndiscriminates against a small group of veterans: those who are mentally \ndisabled. It does terrible harm to these veterans. One proponent of the \nprovision expressed the view that the provision does not affect the \nstandard of living or the condition of any veteran. I disagree.\n  Mr. President, let me describe the situation of a veteran who called \nmy office to explain how this provision affects her. She is from New \nMexico. She receives VA compensation for a mental disorder that \nresulted from her military service. At times over the years, her \ndisability has been particularly bad and she has been rated incompetent \nby VA. Right now, she is doing better and is not rated incompetent. \nHowever, she never knows when things will turn bad again and she will \nagain be at risk of being rated incompetent.\n  Because of this risk, she told committee staff that, if this \nprovision is enacted, she will not go to the VA hospital for treatment \nbecause she is afraid they will determine her condition is worse and \nthey will recommend she be rated incompetent. If that happened, she \nwould lose her compensation. Then she would lose her house because she \ncould not make the mortgage payments. That is what she said. So, she \nwill not seek treatment.\n  Mr. President, I understood that this bill would take away disability \ncompensation from incompetent veterans whose estates exceed $25,000, \nand I have opposed it as rank discrimination against a small group of \nveterans who are unable to protect themselves. Until this veteran \ncalled, however, I had not focused on how this provision would inhibit \nthe very people we are trying to help from seeking medical treatment. I \nam convinced that this woman's condition will be affected by this \nprovision. She is so afraid of this provision she will not seek the \nhelp she needs--help she has earned--help she is entitled to. That is \nwhat this provision does to mentally disabled veterans. That is why it \nshould be dropped in the conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15703-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15703-S15704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VETERANS HEALTH CARE ELIGIBILITY REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand that the House \nBudget Reconciliation bill incorporates the provisions of the \n``Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1995,'' a draft bill \nwhich addresses some of the critical problems faced both by veterans \nseeking health care and by the VA in providing health care services. I \napplaud the sponsors of the bill for their efforts to help the VA \nfulfill its lofty purpose: to take care of those who have served their \ncountry with pride and honor.\n  The House bill would enable the VA to provide its services more \nefficiently and in the most appropriate setting, assuring our Nation's \nveterans that they could receive the care they need. Specifically, it \nwould ensure that VA health care providers are granted the freedom to \ntreat veterans on an outpatient basis when appropriate and would \nbroaden the VA's authority to contract for outpatient services. In \nother words, the VA at long last could pursue methods of treatment \nbased on medical and economic common sense, benefiting veterans and \nproviders alike.\n  Let me highlight some of the key provisions of this innovative \nlegislation which is of major importance to America's veterans. It \nwould:\n  Enable VA, within appropriations, to provide all needed hospital care \nand medical services to eligible veterans, including preventive and \nhome health care;\n  Call for VA to manage the provision of care and services through \nenrollment or registration, based on a system of priorities;\n  Assign priority for enrollment in the following order: First, \nveterans 30 percent or more service-connected disabled, second, former \nPOW's and veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 10 or 20 \npercent, third, veterans receiving aid and attendance or housebound \nbenefits and otherwise eligible veterans who suffer from a catastrophic \ndisability, fourth, veterans unable to defray the cost of medical \nservices, and fifth, all others;\n  Give VA discretion to determine how an enrollment system would \noperate and authority to set additional priorities within the above \npriority groups; and\n  Protect specialized VA programs, such as those for veterans with \nspinal cord injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  Mr. President, I want to stress that this legislation not only enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support in the House, but that it is very much in the \nspirit of the Senate Appropriations Committee report issued last month \non the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill under the \naegis of my distinguished colleagues Senators Bond and Mikulski.\n  This report noted the committee had included a provision ``enabling \nVA to treat veterans eligible for hospital care or medical service in \nthe most efficient manner,'' adding that the Committee supported the \nVA's efforts ``to shift as much of its inpatient workload to ambulatory \ncare settings as possible, to make better use of its resources.'' This \nis precisely what the House bill seeks to accomplish.\n  I also want to underscore that this legislation has won widespread \nsupport from numerous veterans service organizations [VSO's], experts \non veterans health care, and the VA.\n  There have, however, been widely differing estimates from the VA and \nCBO on how the bill will affect demand for VA services and what impact \nif any it \n\n[[Page S15704]]\n\nwill have on the VA budget, even though the bill specifies that it is \nto be implemented within appropriations. While the VA contends the \nHouse proposal is budget neutral and that it would make available as \nmuch as $268 million within 2 years to expand VA outpatient services, \nCBO estimates that any savings will be offset by over $3 billion in \ncosts incurred as a result of increased demand for VA outpatient care. \nA number of VSO's have joined the VA in taking sharp issue with the CBO \ncost analysis.\n  Mr. President, it seems that proposals which satisfy so many needs of \nboth patients and their health care providers deserve our deepest \ncommitment and support, but at the same time we need to fully explore \nthe consequences of such reforms. We need to change the way veterans \nreceive their health care. That much is clear from how eager both sides \nof the equation--patients and providers--are to make the same changes. \nBut we also need to ask ourselves: ``What are the costs if any?''; \nCould these reforms cause other unintended problems in the future?; \nWill the proposed reforms alleviate problems plaguing the VA health \ncare system?; and Will cuts in Medicare and Medicaid lead to increased \ndemand for VA services so that the need for eligibility reform becomes \neven more pressing? We need answers to each of these pivotal questions \nbefore we can proceed.\n  I strongly believe that the provisions in the House bill or some \nvariant of these provisions could at the very least provide a vital \nfirst step to achieve long-overdue eligibility reform, and to do so in \na responsible manner. However, we first need to sit down and get all \nthe facts out on the table so we can come up with clear answers to \ncomplex questions.\n  In anticipation of the possibility that the provisions of the House \nveterans bill will not be included in the final Senate/House version of \nthe budget reconciliation package, I propose that the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs conduct hearings to solicit the views of those who \nwould be affected by such reforms and those who have thoroughly \ninvestigated their future effects on veterans' health care and their \nbudgetary impact. I would welcome the chance for the committee to hear \nfrom representatives from the VA, VSO's, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and anyone else who could bring crucial insights to the forum. \nWe need to include all viewpoints, to look critically at all data, and \nto listen to all voices before we can move forward responsibly. We need \nto institute eligibility reform but we need to carefully craft reform \nto ensure that it improves the quality of VA health care, makes it more \nuser friendly, and increases its cost effectiveness.\n  I have requested that my distinguished colleague Chairman Simpson \nhold hearings on this topic when feasible and, if he concurs, look \nforward to working closely with him on preparations for the \nhearings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15703-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ELECTION OF JOHN J. SWEENEY AS PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for the past three months, two of \nthe nation's foremost labor leaders, John J. Sweeney and Thomas R. \nDonahue, have campaigned for the presidency of the AFL-CIO. This \nafternoon in New York City at the AFL-CIO's biennial convention, the \ndelegates chose Mr. Sweeney. I rise to congratulate him, and Thomas \nDonahue as well, for their dedication, service, and not least, their \ncivilities.\n  Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Donahue remain strong and united in their pledge \nto lead the labor community into the next century. Both are sons of \nIrish working class families from the Bronx--home of another great \nlabor leader, the legendary George Meany. As friends and allies in the \nlabor movement for over 35 years, Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Donahue have vied \nfor the presidency with energy, but without bitterness. There is much \nwe in political life can learn from such earnest and talented men. \nVictory need not mean vanquishing the opponent. Good ideas are not the \nprovince of any one faction. These are the lessons John Sweeney and Tom \nDonahue have taught us all.\n  There is more to these men than their recent contest. There is much \ntestimony given to the value of work and the dignity that comes from \nhaving a job. John Sweeney and Tom Donahue, and the millions they \nrepresent, embody those values even as they advance them.\n  It is prophetic that John Sweeney, born in St. Joseph's parish in the \nBronx--named for the patron saint of working men and women--has been \nchosen to lead the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO. The son of a bus \ndriver, he learned the value of a job and the dignity of hard work from \nhis father. Mr. Sweeney first joined a union as a part-time grave \ndigger while attending Iona College in New Rochelle, New York, and \nbegan his trade union career in 1950 with the International Ladies' \nGarment Workers Union. Later, in 1961, he joined Local 32B of the \nService Employees International Union (SEIU), and eventually rose \nthrough the ranks to become the SEIU's President in June of 1980. \nToday, this union, representing doormen, elevator operators, \ncustodians, all manner of workers, is 1.1 million members strong.\n  Tom Donahue, another Bronx native, has had an equally long and \ndistinguished career in the labor movement. He has served most recently \nas the Acting President of the AFL-CIO after Lane Kirkland stepped down \nin August of 1994. Mr. Donahue began his career at the AFL-CIO as \nExecutive Assistant to George Meany, and was later elected to serve as \nSecretary-Treasurer, a post he held for many years. I am indebted to \nhim for advice, and counsel throughout my near two decades on the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  While there could only be one winner today, the election is not so \nmuch a victory for John Sweeney, but for the labor movement as a whole. \nLet there be no question that Mr. Sweeney has his work cut out for him, \nas they would say in the ``ICG'', for this is a critical time in \nlabor's history. But his record as an organizer of workers promises \ngreat things. And may I say that it is a tribute to New York and to the \nBronx especially that in these turbulent times for labor, the \nmembership of the AFL-CIO has once again entrusted its leadership to a \nNew Yorker. I wish my friend John Sweeney great things as he embarks on \nthe newest phase of his remarkable career.\n  The origins of today's AFL-CIO go back to 1881, or some will argue \n1886. Which is to say, in the first century of the American nation. \nThey have sustained their principles and organization into what is now \nthe third century of our nation. It has been a remarkable and eventful \njourney and it is only begun. I stand with them in solidarity and joy \nfor this fine moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/25/senate-section/article/S15704-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ``AMERICA, I LOVE YOU SO''\n\n Mr. REID.
