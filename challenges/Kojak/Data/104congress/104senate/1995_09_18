Mr. President, I would like to speak this morning \nrelative to an incident that occurred last Tuesday, and I think, if I \nrecall correctly, the senior Senator from West Virginia also had such \nan incident which, to me, amounted to a certain invasion of privacy.\n  Last Tuesday, Mr. President, I was leaving my home to walk to my car \nand, as I rounded the corner, a neighbor asked me why someone was \nvideotaping our block. I smiled at her and said, ``Well, I have no \nidea.'' As I came around the corner, I was confronted by a news crew \nfrom an organization called ``A Current Affair.'' As I attempted to \nwalk toward my car, I found that there was a request for an interview. \nI said, ``We have a number of votes and I am sorry, but I have to go to \nwork.'' As I proceeded to walk toward my car, I was confronted not only \nwith the microphone and a cameraman, but somebody carrying the cord and \na couple of other people and, I assume, a director.\n  I said, ``I am sorry, but if you want an interview I would be happy \nto accommodate you at my office.''\n  Well, as I began to get closer and closer to the car, I finally \nbecame aware that there was a question that was forthcoming, and it \nwas, ``Why have you voted against the highway bill?'' I said, ``You \nhave the wrong Senator. I have no jurisdiction over highways. You must \nwant somebody else.'' I was thinking of Trent Lott who lives next door. \nBut clearly they were not after Trent Lott; they were after me.\n  The next question was, ``Senator, why did you vote against the \nhighway funding legislation and vote for logging roads?'' I responded \nby saying, ``You really do not know anything about logging roads,'' and \nI went to my car and I closed the door and they said, ``Well, you have \nsome stock in one of the logging companies in Alaska.'' I responded by \nsaying, ``No, I do not have that stock,'' closed the door and backed \nout.\n  Then I found that later on in the day this organization from ``A \nCurrent Affair'' had contacted my stockbroker after we had released a \npublic statement, and I will have that printed in the Record, relative \nto the disposal of some of my holdings in natural resource stocks.\n  They had the gall to suggest that perhaps my broker had predated or \nbackdated the letter, indicating the actual date on which I sold my \nstock.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are all victims of living in a glasshouse in \nour particular business, but I find this kind of activity a personal \naffront to my own integrity and my own personal affairs. \n\n[[Page S 13678]]\n\n  Nevertheless, I think that we are all subject to this kind of \nharassment from time to time, but I did want the Record to note the \ncircumstances surrounding this particular event.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, of allegations concerning private \nholdings that I have had in various resource companies that I have held \nfor a number of years--some for as many as 40 years have been held in \nmy family--and criticism associated with that, when I first came to \nthis body I declared all my personal holdings.\n  There was criticism from some that I should sell those holdings \nbecause I did have small amounts in organizations such as Chevron \nCorp., James River, Louisiana Pacific, RTZ, Champion International.\n  Then I moved the shares into a blind trust, Mr. President, and moved \nmy assets into a blind trust. Then I was criticized for hiding my \nassets.\n  Again, after a short period of time, having placed my assets in a \nblind trust, I released them and have publicly disclosed all of them \never since.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I have absolutely nothing to hide \nabout my personal investments. I try to invest in my home State of \nAlaska, developing resources and creating jobs. I think that is \nprobably the best evidence of my commitment to my State of Alaska.\n  All my interests are disclosed publicly, and the fact that a producer \nfrom ``A Current Affair'' thinks they bear some kind of additional \npublic disclosure, why, they are certainly welcome to that conclusion.\n  The bottom line, evidently, Mr. President, is that ``A Current \nAffair'' intends to do some kind of expose on logging in my State. I \nhave had my press secretary cooperating with them, giving them the \nnames of knowledgeable people in Alaska and Sitka, Ketchikan that they \ncan contact with regard to the specifics of any question regarding \nlogging in our State on public lands.\n  Mr. President, for the Record I supply a statement from my broker to \nbe printed in the Record dated July 20, 1995, verifying the following \nsecurities were sold on July 17, 1995, covering Champion International, \nChevron Corp., James River, Louisiana Pacific, and RTZ. The value of \nthose stocks at the time they were sold was $57,272.89.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record that \nthese stock holdings were sold 4 days prior to the introduction of \nlegislation covering the Southeast Alaska Jobs and Community Protection \nAct which proposes to expand the timber harvest in the Tongass National \nForest. These were done prior to any substantive action occurring on \nthe opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil exploration \ndevelopment or before my committee, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, subsequently took up the debate on the mining reform \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Legg Mason Wood Walker, Inc.,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 20, 1995.\n     Re Account number, name of Frank H.

Frank \n     Murkowski today released proof that as he announced more than \n     a month ago, that he had sold all of his stock in natural \n     resouce firms before introducing forestry-related legislation \n     concerning the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska.\n       Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee, July 17 sold all of his stock holdings \n     in five companies that deal with natural resource issues: one \n     energy company, three timber-related companies, (only one \n     having operations in Alaska) and one mining company. The sale \n     came four days before Murkowski introduced the Southeast \n     Alaska Jobs and Community Protection Act and before any \n     substantive action occurred on either opening of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration/development or \n     before his committee substantively took up debate of mining \n     reform legislation.\n       ``I've never been asked before in a cordial fashion whether \n     I sold my stock in all these companies. Since I have now been \n     asked, the answer is yes I did months ago to prevent \n     ridiculous media speculation from interferring with \n     substantive debate over a number of vital national resource \n     policy issues,'' said Murkowski.\n       ``Normally I would follow proper Senate procedures and not \n     unveil my stock transactions, until my annual May financial \n     disclosure statement. But given the level of unresearched and \n     incorrect media reports this summer, it probably is better to \n     release this information now,'' said Murkowski, who added \n     that these sales in no way lessen his commitment to invest in \n     Alaska-related firms whenever possible.\n       ``My goal still is to invest in companies that provide jobs \n     and make investments in Alaska. That is what I can do as an \n     individual to help Alaska's economy and the creation of jobs \n     which always has been my guiding investment principle,'' said \n     Murkowski.\n       Murkowski has responded repeatedly through his press office \n     to a producer from the program A Current Affair giving them \n     the appropriate contacts in Alaska so they can gain factual \n     comments on the Tongass. The Senator announced in Sitka Aug. \n     12 and Ketchikan Aug. 13 that he had disposed of some stock. \n     Today, Murkowski released to the public the same information \n     he gave to the program to confirm that the sales took place \n     before he introduced the Tongass legislation.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. To make a long story short, Mr. President, I no longer \nhold any resource development-type stocks in my personal portfolio and \nfeel that I have acted appropriately with regard to full disclosure on \nmy personal assets. I believe that there is no conflict of any kind \nother than the effort to proceed with responsible development in my \nState of Alaska relative to jobs, the economy, and the economic \ncontribution Alaska can make as a resource-rich State to our overall \neconomy in this Nation.\n  I am proud of my personal efforts to abide by the Senate rules and \nthe rules of disclosure. Again, I somewhat resent being ambushed on my \nway to work last Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded. I will speak as in morning business for 4 or 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13677-5", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13678-S13679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REIMBURSING MEMBERS' COSTS AT CHARITABLE EVENTS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, sometimes this body resembles, at least \nto me, perhaps ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.'' Let me share \nan example from Alaska relating to Senate passage of new restrictions \non the acceptance of gifts by Senators, which was recently adopted by \nthis body.\n  In crafting this new rule, we were certainly shooting at the Senate's \npast practices, where some Members inappropriately did accept gifts \nfrom lobbyists. Unfortunately, the target that we actually hit with our \nshots were the charities that had committed absolutely no wrongdoings, \nunless trying to raise money from time to time for the needy is now, \nsomehow, inappropriate in this body.\n  First, let me make it clear that I fully support the new rule \nlimiting gifts to Senators from any one source to $100 and making all \ngifts over $10--whether they be lunch or a fruit basket--count against \nthe limit. Through that limit, the Senate has gone a long way to end \nthe public perception that lawmakers give special favors to those who \ntake us to lunch or take us to dinner or whatever.\n  But the new rule contains a glaring inconsistency and a level of \nhypocrisy that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. The chief problem is \nthat under the measure we now have adopted, private parties would not \nbe able to reimburse Members for the costs of transportation and \nlodging to a charitable event. But Senators still would be permitted to \nbe privately reimbursed if \n\n[[Page S 13679]]\nthey travel to a fundraising event, in Hollywood or San Francisco or \nFlorida, for another Senator, and they could receive reimbursement for \nlodging--a clear inconsistency. We cannot do it for charity; but we can \ndo it for politics.\n  Some suggest that politics is our business and that is why we should \nbe allowed to continue to do it. But charity is also a worthy cause. \nEvery Senator has, at one time or another, made a campaign appearance \nfor his party or another member of his party. But the Senate now has \ncreated a system where politicians can travel all over this country \nattending political fundraisers and be reimbursed for travel and \nlodging but cannot be reimbursed for participating in charity events. \nThis means the Senator can accept travel, lodging and dinner in some \nplush spot, elbow to elbow, on occasion, perhaps, with lobbyists, if he \nor she is raising money for a political group but cannot be reimbursed \nfor participation in a charity event.\n  The source of funds for both charity and political events is often \nthe same, donations of lobbyists and political action committees. The \nirony is that inside the beltway, charities still will be able to \nencourage the participation of business executives with the presence of \nSenators as a lure, but the charities in the distant States such as \nmine, in Alaska, will be shut out of the means to raise funds for \nworthy causes such as breast cancer detection screening.\n  Last year my wife, Nancy, and I were the honorary chairs of a charity \nfishing tournament held outside Ketchikan, AK. The tournament raised \n$150,000 for the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Fairbanks. Money for \nthe center was used to pay for a new mammography machine. The center, \nfounded in 1976 by my wife and a group of Fairbanks women, provides \nfree or reduced-cost breast cancer examination for about 2,200 women a \nyear on average. Over the years, women from 81 Alaska villages have \nbenefited from these tests.\n  This year, we proceeded with a second event at a place called \nWaterfall, near Ketchikan. We raised approximately $210,000 and were \nable to give the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska $200,000 to \nallow them to order a mobile mammogram unit, which will be traversing \nthe highways of Alaska next spring. It will be able to be utilized on \nthe ferry systems and by barge systems and will be brought into the \nremote villages. This is a van, equipped with a mammography machine. It \nwill also be able to be transported by the Air National Guard into some \nof the 220 rural villages in my State.\n  This unit is going to be vital to preserve the health of Alaska's \nwomen, including many Native women. I might add, the State's breast \ncancer mortality is the second highest in the Nation. One in eight \nAlaska women will develop breast cancer, with about 50 a year dying \nfrom that disease. Breast cancer screening can reduce this rate by some \n30 percent.\n  My clear preference would have been to allow Senators to continue to \ncome to this charity event, events approved previously by the Senate \nEthics Committee to guarantee that they were legitimate charities. It \nseems to me, when Congress attacks charity events while leaving big \nloopholes for political travel, it simply puts us all in the bull's \neye, furthering the public's growing skepticism toward public \nofficials.\n  The gift rule and related lobbying reform legislation that the Senate \nhas approved overall are certainly good steps to restore public \nconfidence in the Senate and Congress. But why shoot down legitimate \ncharities? Mr. President, that is just what we have done.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me this extra time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13678-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FAYE BROWN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commend and \ncongratulate Faye Brown, who will be retiring from the bankruptcy \nadministrator's office in Birmingham at the end of this month. She has \nbeen a fixture at the bankruptcy court and administrator's office for \nmany years.\n  Faye graduated from Dale County High School in Ozark, AL; in 1950 and \nattended Howard College, now Samford University, graduating in 1954. \nFrom 1966 to 1971, she served as the personal secretary to Judge Robert \nS. Vance. In 1972, she was appointed deputy clerk for the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  From 1979 to 1985, Faye was the secretary to Judge Stephen B. \nColeman, Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the \nNorthern District of Alabama. In 1985, after Judge Coleman's \nretirement, she became the asset closing clerk for the bankruptcy \nclerk's office, serving there for the next 7 years. In 1992, she \nobtained her current position and the one from which she is retiring \nthis month, that of bankruptcy analyst.\n  Faye Brown has done an outstanding job over the many years of her \ncareer. In many ways, she is the institutional memory of her office, \nand knows the in's and out's of the bankruptcy court as well as anyone, \nand her expertise and dedication will be sorely missed. I congratulate \nher for a job well done and wish her all the best for a long, healthy, \nand happy retirement. It is surely well-earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13679-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POW-MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, on Friday, I joined with the Members of \nthis body, and with all the citizens of our Nation, in commemorating \nthe American service members who are missing in action and whose fates \nyet remain unknown.\n  Our Nation honored those who are missing, both for their service and \nfor their sacrifice.\n  We acknowledged the shared loss inflicted upon all of us when young \nmen and women are sent to war and do not return to us. We expressed our \nunderstanding of the terrible frustration, and, yes, even the anger, \nenergized in us by the fact that the fates of those American service \nmembers remain unknown.\n  We restated our sacred obligation to take every reasonable step to \nobtain the fullest possible accounting for those still missing.\n  We endorsed anew our national commitment to recover and identify the \nremains of the honored dead.\n  Yes, it is so important to honor our missing service members. And it \nis necessary to ever remember our obligations, both to them and to \ntheir families.\n  Yet it is also important to acknowledge that there are practical and \nrealistic limits to what can ever be learned. There are mysteries that \nwill remain forever unsolved in this world.\n  We do our Nation's service members no justice if we fail to take \nevery single reasonable step to recover them when they are lost from \nour midst. But we do them no honor--yes, we even dishonor them--if we \nare to allow their loss to become an albatross forever about the necks \nof our caring countrymen.\n  Mr. President, Friday our Nation paused to commemorate our missing in \naction, including members of my own family in World War II. Today, and \nevery day, we must remember their service and their sacrifice. And \ntoday, and every day, our Nation can continue to honor them by ensuring \nthat America remains wholly committed, at home and abroad, to the \nfreedoms they fought to preserve forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13679-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a valued member of \nmy staff whose length of service to me \n\n[[Page S 13680]]\nand the people of Kansas is nothing short of remarkable. Ruth Ann \nKomarek has just completed her 30th year of working for me. That is \nthree, zero, Mr. President.\n  A native of Ellinwood, KS, Ruth Ann came to my office from the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation in 1965, while I was still serving in \nthe House of Representatives. She made the transition with me to the \nSenate in 1968, and she has been hard at work ever since.\n  Ruth Ann serves as my office manager and supervisor of my mail \noperation, a mammoth task to say the least. Virtually every letter, \nfax, postcard, and package that comes into my office passes through her \nhands. That represents thousands upon thousands of pieces of \ncorrespondence every week. She gets each one where it needs to go and \ntries to make sure that every Kansan who writes to me gets a timely \nresponse.\n  Ruth Ann also spends a lot of time keeping the rest of the staff--\nespecially the interns--in line. New staffers learn that her gruff \nexterior hides a heart of gold and a great sense of humor, but after \nshe has laid down the law and made them earn their way.\n  I am proud to recognize Ruth Ann Komarek for all her hard work for \nme, the Senate, and for Kansas. I look forward to her continued service \nin the coming years.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Judd Gregg, for the Medicare \nImprovement and Choice Care Provision Act which he introduced last \nweek.\n  The Medicare Program has received a great deal of attention in the \nlast year, particularly since early April when the Medicare trustees \nreport stated that the Medicare Program will become insolvent in just 7 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gregg and all Republicans took this report \nvery seriously. But, as anyone who has worked on this issue knows, to \nensure the solvency of this program is going to require a great deal of \ncommitment on the part of Congress and the administration.\n  Our goal is very simple--to preserve, strengthen, and protect the \nMedicare Program. Today 37 million disabled and elderly Americans rely \non Medicare for their health care. For their sake and for the millions \nof Americans who will rely on this program in the future, we need to \ntake action.\n  And that is exactly what Senator Gregg has done. The bill that he has \nintroduced not only preserves and protects the current Medicare \nProgram, it also strengthens the program to move it successfully into \nthe 21st century.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have said many times in this Chamber, the United \nStates has the best health care system in the world. There is no other \nnation that compares to the quality of care delivered by our providers, \nour technology, and our innovation. Although Medicare has provided \ninvaluable health care services to millions and millions of Americans, \nin some areas it has not kept pace with many of the advances in health \ncare delivery enjoyed by the private sector.\n  The bill introduced by Senator Gregg restructures Medicare so that \nits beneficiaries receive the same range of choices and possibilities \nthat those with private insurance receive today. At the same time, it \nleaves traditional Medicare completely in place for those Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are happy with the care and services they receive \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gregg deserves a great deal of credit for the \nleadership he has demonstrated on this very complex issue. As Congress \nis about to begin a very serious debate on Medicare reform in the \ncoming weeks, the work of Senator Gregg will no doubt be an invaluable \nbenefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13679-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this bill proposes fiscal year 1996 \nfunding for the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and expenses \nand payments of the farm credit system. As reported, the bill \nrecommends total new budget authority for this new fiscal year of $63.8 \nbillion. This is $5.2 billion less than the fiscal year 1995 level. It \nis $2.6 billion less than the President's fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest. But it is $1.2 billion more than the level recommended in bill \npassed by the House of Representatives.\n  One interesting thing to observe about this bill is that over 63 \npercent of the funds proposed to be appropriated in this legislation \nfor the Department of Agriculture will go to funding the Nation's \ndomestic food assistance programs. I can recall, when I was first \nhonored by being given the opportunity of chairing this subcommittee in \n1981, the majority of the funds appropriated to the Department of \nAgriculture for its activities went to funding support activities for \nproduction agriculture-- reimbursements to the Commodity Credit \nCorporation, for example, for net realized losses; funds for \nagriculture research; for soil and water conservation; for rural \ndevelopment. And included in these activities were, of course, the food \nand nutrition programs such as the Food Stamp Program, Women, Infants, \nand Children Program; the School Lunch Programs, elderly feeding \nprograms, commodity distribution programs, a wide variety of domestic \nfood assistance programs.\n  But, today, we have seen a trend which has now reached a point where \nthe clear majority of the funding required by the Department of \nAgriculture is for the food and nutrition programs rather than for \ntraditional agriculture programs. So, as we discuss and consider any \namendments that Senators will offer to this bill, we must keep in mind \nthat we are doing our part in this bill to meet the challenge of \ndeficit reduction, in trying to control the growth of spending at the \nFederal level.\n  We have $5.2 billion proposed in this bill, less than the amount of \nbudget authority in this fiscal year. I think it is a clear \nillustration of the commitment of this subcommittee to fulfill the \ncommitment that we have all made in the budget resolution to get better \ncontrol over our spending practices at the Federal level and to meet \nthe challenge of balancing the budget under the plan to do so over the \nnext 7 years.\n  To compare the 63 percent level of funding of domestic food programs \nin this bill with previous years, in this fiscal year those funds total \n58 percent of the budget authority in this bill. Including \ncongressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending \nactions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $13.310 \nbillion in budget authority and $13.608 billion in outlays for fiscal \nyear 1996. These amounts are consistent with the subcommittee's \ndiscretionary spending allocations.\n  As a result of these constraints of allocation and the budget \nresolution assumptions and directions, few funding increases are \nrecommended in this bill for any programs and activities under the \njurisdiction of the subcommittee. Most programs are funded at or below \nthis current fiscal year level.\n  There is one significant program increase provided in this bill, a \n$260 million increase for the WIC Program, the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program. This is the same as contained in the bill passed by \nthe House. This increase is necessary if we are going to maintain the \n1995 WIC caseload levels during the next year.\n  Other discretionary spending increases include an additional $17.9 \nmillion for rural housing rental assistance to meet the estimated costs \nof contract renewal and servicing requirements; an increase of $42.9 \nmillion to continue the efforts of the Food Safety and Inspection \nService to assure the safety of our Nation's food supply; a $5.1 \nmillion net increase in rural housing loan program authorizations; a \n$50 million increase in farm operating loans; and a $33 million \nincrease for the food donations program on Indian reservations. Except \nfor rural housing, all of these increases fall well below the increased \nlevels requested by the President in the \n\n[[Page S 13691]]\nbudget submission we received this year.\n  There are funds in the bill for agriculture research and extension \nprograms. In my judgment, the $1 billion--a little over $1 billion--\nappropriated for these activities are funds well invested. We are \nconfronted right now with a real challenge in the production \nagriculture area because of increased competition from overseas, \nproducers in the international marketplace.\n  We are confronted with new challenges of pest management, of trying \nto improve yields while at the same time preserving in a more \naggressive way our soil and water resources. To accomplish all of that, \nand to still make it possible for farmers to operate profitably, we \nhave to invest in upgrading and maintaining our modern technological \nadvantage.\n  That is the key to the future productivity of our Nation's farmers. \nThat is the key to the realization of the expectations of the American \npeople to have an adequate supply of reasonably priced food and \nconsumer products. So that is why this part of the bill, in my view, is \nso important.\n  I wish we had the ability under the constraints of the budget and our \nallocation to appropriate more money for these purposes. Much of this \nresearch is done in Agriculture Research Service facilities throughout \nthe country. These are Department of Agriculture-operated research \nfacilities such as here in the Washington area, in Beltsville, MD, and \nthroughout the country. Other research is done through the Cooperative \nState Research, Education, and Extension Service account that is funded \nin this bill, where funds are made available to university and college-\nresearch facilities and other sponsoring entities, where funds are \nmatched by the Federal Government to help pay the costs of important \nresearch in the agriculture food production and related areas of \nconcern.\n  So although the $1.025 billion for agriculture research and extension \nprogram activity is $22 million less than this current year's level and \n$17 million less than the President's request, it is $30 million more \nthan recommended in the House-passed bill. So, in conference we will \nhave a challenge to negotiate what we hope will be an increase in the \nallocation of funds for these purposes.\n  For extension activities, the bill provides $2 million less than the \ncurrent year's level. But that level of funding is still $24 million \nover the House bill level.\n  For farm credit programs, the bill provides $3.2 billion in loan \nlevels, which is an increase of $174 million from the House-recommended \nlevel.\n  The bill also recommends funding for a new Rural Community \nAdvancement Program. We have recommended the consolidation of funding \nfor seven rural development grant and loan programs under one account, \nconsistent with the Senate Agriculture Committee's actions on these \nprograms.\n  Senators will remember that we have just completed authorizing a \nreorganization of the Department of Agriculture. This has principally \nbeen driven by the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] who, as the ranking Republican member of the Agriculture \nCommittee a few years ago, strongly urged our committee to pressure the \nadministration to embark upon a reorganization program. As a matter of \nfact, current law authorized many of the steps that were urged to be \ntaken by Senator Lugar, and others, in this area.\n  But the administration wanted the Congress involved because obviously \nthere were controversies. There were differences of opinion about how \nfar to go, how much to change, which offices to close, how to \nconsolidate regional offices, and where the new offices would be \nrelocated--a wide range of controversial and political hot potato-type \nissues which the Senate Agriculture Committee worked on very hard.\n  Senator Leahy was chairman when our effort began and now, under the \nchairmanship of Senator Lugar with Senator Leahy as ranking member, we \nare monitoring. We are monitoring the reorganization effort to ensure \nthat, first of all, it is consistent with the new authorities for \nreorganization granted by the Congress to the President and the \nadministration and that it also is undertaken in a way that makes the \nDepartment more efficient and saves money and cuts down the costs that \nare unnecessary--in many areas, where there has been duplication and \noverlapping--unnecessary expenditures of funds.\n  So this bill we are presenting today carries forward some of the \nprinciples contained in the Department of Agriculture Reorganization \nAct and emphasizes consolidation for the purpose of improving delivery \nof services as well as the efficiency of the Department of Agriculture.\n  So we spell out in this bill the consolidation of funding for some of \nthese programs so that our bill will reflect the changes and the \nefforts that have been made or proposed by both the administration and \nthe Congress.\n  The administration proposed to consolidate a number of programs that \nwe disagreed with them about--their total number was 12 programs--into \nsomething called the rural performance partnership initiative. But our \nproposal consolidates only 7 programs, and represents a reduction of \n15.9 percent from the current appropriations level versus the House \nbill, which proposes a 17.7-percent reduction.\n\n  One thing that we were concerned about--I will have to be candid with \nSenators--is that the administration was suggesting almost a block-\ngrant-type approach to the administration, that they could then \nallocate to State administrators and give them a wide range of \ndiscretion without oversight authority in the Congress for how these \nprograms were to be administered.\n  I think it would be an abrogation of congressional responsibility if \nwe went along with that recommendation as I understood it. We are for \ngiving more flexibility to managers and administration officials, but \nwe are not prepared at this point to just simply send a lump sum \nappropriation to the Department of Agriculture and say, ``Why don't you \nuse this any way you think is appropriate.''\n  We are here in a representative capacity for the States, and on the \nHouse side for individual citizens, and we have a role to play in this. \nWe are taking that role very seriously. So in our oversight hearings \nand in the hearings we had in the beginning of this year, where \nadministration officials came to testify about their proposals and how \nthe funds that we would appropriate would be needed, we questioned them \nvery carefully about their intentions in using these funds and how they \nwould shift funds from one activity to another based on local \nsituations.\n  So what I am saying is that we are in favor of consolidation, we are \nin favor of giving managers more authority than they may have been \ngiven in the past in the strict categories of funding, but we are not \nwilling to turn loose completely of our responsibilities to monitor \ncarefully the administration of these programs and the expenditure of \nthese funds for rural development activities. Rural water and sewer \nsystem projects and loans to help build infrastructure facilities in \nareas that are economically disadvantaged are all a part of this \neffort. Housing programs, which have been given less than the funds we \nthink are needed by the other body, are also very important.\n  There are a lot of unmet needs in many parts of the country in this \narea of concern. In my State of Mississippi, we hope to continue to \nhave a very aggressive effort by the Federal agencies in that State to \nhelp improve the economic opportunities of those who live in the small \ntowns and rural communities, opportunities for jobs, opportunities to \nenjoy a standard of living that will be attractive rather than so \nunattractive that people are forced to move into the cities. We think \nthat is bad public policy, to see the rural communities deteriorate to \nsuch a point where they are uninhabitable and folks do not want to live \nthere anymore.\n  That is a real problem we face, and we are trying to do something \nabout that in the way we are funding programs in this legislation. \nStates have responsibilities, too. Of course, the private sector does. \nBut we have in this bill some special efforts that we hope will provide \nincentives for economic activity in rural areas and small towns. We are \ngoing to continue to monitor the administration's activities to be sure \nthey are working.\n  For discretionary conservation programs, the bill recommends $6 \nmillion \n\n[[Page S 13692]]\nmore than the House level. It also provides $2.9 billion in total rural \nhousing loan authorizations. This is $457 million more than the House \nlevel and $146 million more than the President's request. So we are \ncommitted in this legislation to doing something about rural housing.\n  The other agencies that are funded in this bill, as I mentioned at \nthe outset, include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Food \nand Drug Administration, and expenses of the Farm Credit \nAdministration.\n  We trust that the funds proposed to be appropriated for these \nagencies meet the needs of these agencies. There is always a request \nfor more funding than we are able to provide because we are cutting \nspending, and we have to remind those who come to testify before our \ncommittee that this applies to everybody. There is very little \nopportunity to provide increases. I have highlighted some of the \nincreases. But it is very rare to see any account in this bill that is \nfunded above the current level of funding. However, the bill does allow \nincreases in funding for some FDA activities, food and drug activities, \nsupported by the authorized Prescription Drug Act, and mammography \nfacilities inspection user fee collections.\n  This, incidentally, is the same amount as recommended by the other \nbody.\n  The bill also provides a $1 billion Food Stamp Program reserve which \nwas not recommended by the House. The administration strongly urged the \ninclusion of a reserve, and traditionally there has been a reserve to \nallow for unforeseen activities, economic problems, natural disasters \nwhich would cause an emergency need for food stamps that might run the \nprogram above the expected level of funding. The administration wanted \nus to appropriate $2.5 billion, but we think the amount we have in the \nbill will be sufficient to protect the continuation of benefits in the \nevent of any unexpected rise in program participation levels.\n  In addition, the bill provides $20.5 million above the House level \nfor the Consolidated Farm Service Agency as well as $10 million for \nInfoShare. This is the Department's project to integrate its \ninformation systems, to improve service delivery to those who depend \nupon farm and rural service agency activities.\n  Most of the money in this bill--80 percent--is required to be \nappropriated under the mandates of Federal law. Only 20 percent of the \ntotal amount funded in this bill is discretionary. And so when Senators \nare looking at this bill and they are saying, well, we can add money or \nwe can take money out, you are only going to be able to suggest \namendments to 20 percent of the total $63.8 billion contained in this \nbill. The other funds that are appropriated are required to be spent by \nlaw. We do not have any choice. That is why it is important for us to \ncontinue our efforts on the second track of changing the law in many \nareas so that the future requirements for funding will be less than \nthey are today in those areas in which Congress decides to make \nchanges. If we are going to get to that balanced budget figure in 7 \nyears, we are going to have to make changes not only in the \nappropriations of funds as these bills come up but, more importantly, \nin the requirements of law that force Congress to spend money every \nyear. So this bill contains 80 percent mandatory expenditures.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, almost all agriculture and rural \ndevelopment programs have been reduced below current levels to meet the \nsubcommittee's lower discretionary spending allocations. Further cuts \nin spending limitations have been necessary to offset the few increases \nthat are provided in the bill.\n  Mr. President, it has been a distinct pleasure and privilege for me \nto continue to have the honor of working with the distinguished ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Bumpers of Arkansas.\n  He is my neighbor. He is my friend. He has been my colleague now in \nthe Senate for 16 years. I have been here 16 years. I think he was \nelected to the Senate the same year I was elected to the House.\n  So we have been here for long enough, I suppose, to know the accounts \nand to know and understand the needs of our States. And this bill \nreflects a consensus of Republican and Democratic interests as \nrepresented on our subcommittee. And I believe that the bill represents \na balanced and responsible level of funding recommendations within the \nlimited resources available to this subcommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I know there may be \nsome differences of opinion on specific items in the bill. But if there \nare, I hope Senators will bring them up. If they have amendments, we \nwill be glad to consider them. We hope to be able to complete action on \nthis bill tomorrow. And under the unanimous-consent agreement, there \nwill not be any votes on any amendments today before the hour of 5:15 \np.m.\n  I also want to thank all the members of the subcommittee who have \nhelped us develop this legislation. We had a lot of hearings. We had an \nopportunity to look at the President's budget request. Other requests \nthat Members have suggested we considered. We have tried to be fair \nwith everybody. And I hope that Senators will agree and also agree that \nthis bill does recommend an investment of funds and an allocation of \navailable resources that will help sustain our effort to continue to be \nthe most productive agriculture economy in the world. We have a lot at \nstake in maintaining this ability, not only to feed and clothe our own \ncitizens here in the United States, but to use this great resource as \nan economic benefit to create jobs through the sale of agriculture \ncommodities and foodstuffs throughout the world.\n  We are the largest economic exporter of food commodities in the \nworld. This year we are going to bring into our economy a total of \nabout $50 billion that would represent the value of exports that have \nbeen generated by our farm and food industries. So there is a \ntremendous amount depending upon the support activities that we have \nfunded in this bill. So I hope Senators will support the legislation. \nAnd we would appreciate it very much, if you do have amendments, to \nplease bring them to the floor and let us debate them today, complete \nour debate on as many as we can so we can pass the bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, I want to thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, chairman of this \nsubcommittee, for his very kind and generous remarks directed toward \nme. And I would like to reciprocate by saying that this committee has \nalways been marked by a lot of conciliation and cooperation. I chaired \nthe subcommittee for a couple of years. I did my very best to \ncollaborate and cooperate with Senator Cochran when he was ranking \nmember. And we have had that kind of relationship. And I think the \nSenate would be well served if every committee chairman and ranking \nmember could stand on the floor and honestly say that they have had \nfine cooperation with each other.\n  That is not to say that Senator Cochran and I have agreed on every \njot and tittle in the bill. We have not. But considering the \nlimitations under which he has been laboring, namely, what we call the \n602(b) allocation, I think he has performed an outstanding--an \noutstanding--job of cutting this budget dramatically in accordance with \nthe 602(b) allocation and yet funding programs that both he and I \nbelieve are absolutely critical to rural development and agriculture in \nthis country.\n  Some $40.2 billion, or 63 percent, of the total funds in this bill go \nto funding the Nation's domestic food assistance programs: food stamps, \nnational school lunch program, elderly feeding programs, supplemental \nfeeding programs for women, infants and children, usually described as \nthe WIC program. Everybody believes--it is a strange thing--I must say \nthis, some of the social programs which have fallen into disrepute \naround here and everybody wants to cut has not been true of the WIC \nprogram. Everybody knows that if a poor pregnant woman does not get a \ndecent protein diet, the child is going to be brain deficient. And \neverybody knows that for virtually pennies that can be curbed and \neliminated. And the WIC program is designed to make sure that poor \npregnant women get a decent diet because we all benefit from that. \n\n[[Page S 13693]]\n\n  I might digress just a moment to say, Mr. President, that everybody \nin this world was not so favored as I was. I chose my parents very \nwell. A lot of people have not had that opportunity. And so this idea \nof, ``Smell me, why can't everybody be rich and beautiful like me?'' \nhas come into too much vogue in the U.S. Congress.\n  There are an awful lot of people who never had a chance from day one. \nAnd some of these programs that everybody thinks were put in over the \npast years, starting with Franklin Roosevelt, were done just on a whim \nand caprice or to get votes--there is enough of that to make that \ncharacterization credible--but people should realize that these \nprograms were designed to fulfill a purpose. Why does anybody think we \nhave Social Security?\n  Incidentally, now I am not here just to deliver a moral sermonette \nthis morning, but just to make a few points I do not think hurts \noccasionally. Why do you think we have Social Security? I am not going \nto belabor the point. Everybody knows why we have Social Security. It \nis because parents were oftentimes sort of thrown on the mercy of \nsociety because their children either would not or could not take care \nof them.\n  So Franklin Roosevelt very wisely decided everybody is entitled to a \nlittle dignity in their old age. And that is the reason it is easily \nthe most popular social program that has ever been developed in this \ncountry. And now it is not particularly a social program because it is \nself-funding.\n  And why is it we have food stamps, which is within the jurisdiction \nof this committee? We have food stamps because we made a conscious \ndecision in about 1972 that we did not want any child in this country \ngoing hungry.\n  I just returned from a trip abroad which included Mongolia. I notice \nthat the First Lady visited Mongolia about a week after some of us were \nthere. You always learn more on those trips than you think you are \ngoing to. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, which is struggling to \ndemocratize, which needs our help, has 4,000 children under 10 years of \nage on the streets. And they die in the wintertime. Strangely enough, \nthat city's motto is ``The coldest capital in the world.'' They need a \nnew PR agent. I cannot imagine anybody wanting to visit a city because \nit is the coldest city in the world as a capital city.\n  But my wife Betty, who has spent her life in children's programs, got \nextremely concerned about that when we got there and discovered that. \nAnd she went to some of the facilities where they care for children. \nAnd she said these children--they have a central heating system there, \nwhich serves virtually the whole city. Can you imagine--can you imagine \nbeing dependent on one gigantic pipe to heat an entire city? Well, \nanyway, these children live in those pipes in the wintertime, but even \nso they die in great numbers. They are cast out by their families, \nabandoned by their families through no fault of their own.\n  In this country, we decided in 1972 that we did not want street \nchildren, we did not want any child to suffer from lack of food. So \nthat is the reason we have food stamps.\n  I use those illustrations simply because they are two of the most \npowerful I can think of. But back to the WIC Program, we have fully \nfunded WIC, as long as I can remember in this committee, whether the \nRepublicans or the Democrats are in charge. The Senator from \nMississippi has very consciously and nobly made sure that that program \nwas fully funded in this budget.\n  Mr. President, while we have an awful lot of money in this budget, \nthe amount that the chairman and the committee has to deal with is very \nsmall by comparison. Out of $60 billion plus in the bill, virtually all \nof it is entitlements, such as food stamps--$28 billion this year, with \na $1 billion reserve. The President wanted a $2.5 billion reserve. That \nsimply is not possible within the framework of the amount of money with \nwhich we had to deal. Of the $60 billion plus this committee deals \nwith, only $13.6 billion is available to us in outlays; that is, the \nmoney that will actually be spent in 1996. So we met our allocation. We \ncut in places where it hurts.\n  The President says he will veto the House bill, for reasons I am not \ngoing to belabor here. I do not believe the President will veto this \nbill, though he has voiced some concerns.\n  So, Mr. President, having said all of those things, I would be remiss \nif I did not say there is one thing that still troubles me about the \nbill and the only really serious disagreement--and this is a friendly \ndisagreement with my distinguished chairman--and that is the Market \nPromotion Program.\n  Both the House and Senate have funded the Market Promotion Program, I \nbelieve, at $110 million. The House put $110 million in, and that is \nwhat the Senate bill has. Senator Bryan and I will attempt to strike \nthat from this bill at some point during the deliberation on it.\n  Again, I am not going to belabor that except simply to say I have \nalways--no, not always, I think I may have supported this once or \ntwice--but for the past 3 or 4 years, I have been very much opposed to \nthe Market Promotion Program because it gives money to the biggest \ncorporations in America to help them sell not wheat, not corn abroad--\nwe have $2 billion in export incentives now, this is only $110 million. \nThis helps McDonald's, for example, introduce the Big Mac around the \nworld.\n  I do not know what McDonald's sales are. My guess would be somewhere \nbetween $10 billion and $15 billion a year. My question is, why on \nEarth should we be subsidizing McDonald's? Why should we be subsidizing \nGallo Wine, another company not exactly a pauper? There are literally \nhundreds of corporations on the list, and virtually every one of them \nare quite able to do these things on their own.\n  I just simply cannot support that. Last year, we got beat badly. I \nthink we got 36 votes last year--37. We only got 37 votes last year to \nkill this program. So it seems to me well and healthy. The phones are \nringing off the wall now by the companies who enjoy the few million \nbucks they get out of that program every year.\n  It is an amazing thing, is it not, how everybody knows exactly when \nthese appropriations bills are coming up. This morning, I watched an ad \nby the Boeing Corp. It shows all these children in the classroom \ntalking about how wonderful space is, shown intermittently with people \nspace walking. It just so happens that the space station is on the \nagenda this week. So all these ads start flooding television, and I \nknow that my efforts to kill the space station are probably dead on \narrival.\n  When I think about how we had to labor over this bill to provide \nmoney for wastewater and drinking water for rural areas, and as we cut \neducation unbelievably, and as we cut welfare unbelievably, as we are \nnow proposing to cut the earned income tax credit, which I think is one \nof the best programs to deal with welfare we have ever invented, and \nthen I see us headed toward a $94 billion--$94 billion--to throw \nsomething into space that we might use to go to Mars. Forget all that \nmedical science research. The Russians have had space stations up for \n20 years. If they have gotten anything out of it, they have very \ncarefully guarded it. Nobody knows what it is.\n  We have been sending shuttles up for as long as I can remember now, \nand what have we gotten out of it? I noticed this week they developed \nsome tools that they say will work to put the space station together.\n  I do not want to do the space station debate here. I am simply saying \nthat the deficit is the No. 1 problem in the country, and everybody \nwants to do something about it, including yours truly. I have been \nstanding back there at my desk since I have been in the Senate saying \nthat. It is a question of priorities. We do not need the space station; \nwe need to educate our children. We do not need the Market Promotion \nProgram; we need to build water and sewer facilities for our rural \npeople under the heading of rural development. We need it for Head \nStart.\n  This morning when I went downstairs, Betty was sitting with a man who \nused to be the dean of the department of public health at Harvard, \nHoward Hyatt. Over the years, because of Betty's activities in the \nimmunization programs and the peace movement, she got to know Dr. \nHyatt. He is secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. So \nI got a chance to visit with him for about 30 minutes before I came to \nwork. \n\n[[Page S 13694]]\n\n  He says the American Academy of Arts and Sciences have a lot of \nprojects going, but one of their new ones is literacy. That does not \nsound very sexy; everybody talks about literacy. But what they want to \ndo, of course, is to develop a program, as they are doing in a pilot \nprogram in Boston right now, to try to develop early intervention, \nwhich is the key to everything. If a child cannot read, the child has \nnot a dog's chance.\n  So I told him I would try to help. That is what Head Start is all \nabout, early intervention, teaching children to read.\n  Mr. President, one of the things trendy in this country is everybody \nwants to jump on agriculture. You read all those stories lately about \nhow terrible agriculture is and how much they suck out of the Federal \nTreasury. The truth of the matter is, the American farmers still \nproduce food for the American consumers at a smaller price than any \nnation on Earth. Happily, commodity prices are at a point now where \nthese subsidies do not amount to nearly as much as they used to, but \neverybody wants to do away with them. We produce rice in our State and \nwe will ship it to Japan for $250 a ton. The Japanese farmers get $900 \na ton for growing rice in their own country.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that Senator Reid has an amendment and \nwill be here shortly to offer it. I hope that during the course of the \nday, we can dispose of some of these amendments, start voting on them \nat 5:15 this afternoon, and finish this bill no later than tomorrow.\n  Again, my sincere thanks and congratulations to Senator Cochran for \nthe magnificent job he has done under unbelievably difficult \ncircumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas for his kind remarks and for his help and hard work in putting \ntogether this legislation.\n  When we presented this bill to the full Committee on Appropriations, \na number of committee amendments were adopted and approved at that \npoint. I am going to propose a unanimous-consent request that these \ncommittee amendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc, with some \nexceptions which will include two amendments that we adopted, one of \nwhich had to do with an earmark of funds that would be available to the \nSecretary of Agriculture for additional and supplemental disaster \nassistance and, in addition, to the catastrophic crop insurance \nbenefits that are available to agriculture producers. During the full \ncommittee markup, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska indicated that he would \noffer an amendment to strike that provision. So that is exempted from \nthis request.\n  There is also a provision in the bill dealing with a regulation \npromulgated by the Department of Agriculture relating to the labeling \nof frozen poultry products. One or more of the Senators from California \nwill offer an amendment on that subject. So that amendment is exempted \nfrom this proposal.\n  With that explanation, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe committee amendments to H.R. 1976 be considered and agreed to, en \nbloc, with the exception of the portion of the committee amendment \nappearing on page 83, line 4, down through and including line 2 on page \n84, provided that no points of order are waived thereon, and that the \nmeasure, as amended, be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments were considered and agreed to, en bloc, \nwith the exception of the committee amendment beginning on page 83, \nline 4, through page 84, line 2.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I hope Senators will--as suggested by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas--come to the floor now and offer \namendments. We will be happy to debate them and consider them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Phil Schwab, \na congressional fellow in the Democratic leader's office, be granted \nfloor privileges during floor consideration of the agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2685\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of any funds appropriated under this act \n                       for Board of Tea experts)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 2685.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . BOARD OF TEA EXPERTS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be used \n     for the salaries or expenses of the Board of Tea experts \n     established under section 2 of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     prevent the importation of impure and unwholesome tea'', \n     approved March 2, 1897 (21 U.S.C. 42).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have heard my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas and ranking member and comanager of this bill, on many \noccasions stand on this floor and talk about things he has done or \ntried to do over the years that keep coming back. Well, this amendment \ntakes second fiddle to none of the amendments that the Senator from \nArkansas has offered.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, I offered an amendment to do away with a \ntea tasting board. The amendment passed. Everyone thought the tea \ntasting board was history. Wrong. This organization, which was founded \nand formed in 1897, is back with a vengeance. How? No one seems to \nknow. But it is back spending taxpayers' money tasting tea.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of myself and \nSenator Brown of Colorado. I would like the Record to reflect that.\n  Mr. President, when I offered this amendment 2 years ago, there was \ngeneral acceptance that this was the right thing to do. Why? Because it \ndoes not seem appropriate anymore that we need people to swish tea \naround in their mouth to determine if the texture is right and the \ntaste is just right. This is an anachronism that should have gone out \nright after the turn of the century. Yet, with the new century fast \napproaching, they are still swishing tea.\n  I have learned in recent months that my efforts to eliminate the \nBoard of Tea experts somehow was lost in the bureaucratic shuffle that \ntakes place during the conference held on this bill and that takes \nplace in the bowels of the Agricultural Department.\n  There is no reason for this tea tasting board. The reason people are \nupset with Government is because of things like this. You would think \nthat a group of gentlemen and ladies working together would have had \nthe courtesy to say, ``Senator Reid, we are going to keep the Tea \nTasting Board; we do not care what you do on the floor.'' But rather \nthan do that, they sneak around in the dark of the night in some office \nroom here in Washington and figure out a way to thwart the will of \nCongress.\n  My amendment passed both bodies 2 years ago, but the Board is still \nhere. This is the reason people are upset about Government.\n  Is there a single human being in the United States that favors a tea \ntasting board or the Board of Tea experts? Is there anybody that favors \nthis? The answer is no, unless you are one of the tea tasters. There is \nno reason for this. Yet, we are spending a couple hundred thousand \ndollars a year of taxpayers' \n\n[[Page S 13695]]\nmoney having people meet in some fancy office room and swish tea around \nin their mouth.\n  I see no reason, Mr. President, why those in this country who enjoy \ndrinking tea need someone else to tell them what tastes good. I guess I \nshould not feel as upset as I am, because I have to tell you, these tea \ntasting people have resiliency. When I was a little kid, we would chase \nlizards, grab a lizard and sometimes jerk off the tail by mistake. But \nit did not matter, the tail grew back.\n  These tea-tasting people are just like the lizards. You grab them and \njerk something off and they are right back.\n  I repeat, I should not feel alone because President Nixon tried to \nget rid of the tea-tasting board. They outsmarted him. He was not easy \nto outsmart.\n  I tell you, Mr. President, as long as I am here, I am going to stand \nand talk about this board of tea experts and tell the American people \nwhat an absolute waste of taxpayers' money it is to have them spend \n$200,000 a year swishing tea around in their mouths so they can get \ntheir expenses paid for a little jaunt to wherever they hold this event \nevery year.\n  The tea expert board was created as part of the Tea Import Act of \n1897. I did not make a mistake. I did not say 1987, I said 1897. There \nare six outside experts and there is even a person from the FDA that \ncomprises this board.\n  They are supposed to set standards for tea. As part of their duties, \nof course, they taste this tea. As I have indicated, Mr. President, the \ncost of this is about $200,000 a year. The industry brags that they \noffset this by about $70,000 a year with some fee they charge the tea \nimporters.\n  This might not seem like a lot of money when we talk about billions \nof dollars every year. This is the kind of thing that causes people to \nlose their good feeling about government.\n  No matter how often you stamp this insect out, it comes back. Nobody \nwants them. We have to do away with this.\n  Now, I think that probably the Food and Drug Administration and other \norganizations may need to set some standards on tea. I hope so. Just \nlike they set standards on other things that are imported. But a tea-\ntasting board? A Board of Tea experts? I think the only tea party we \nneed is a congressional tea party to once and for all drown the \norganization. Put it out of its misery. There is not anybody in the \nUnited States that is going to stand up and cheer for the Board of Tea \nexperts. It seems inappropriate and, I think, morally reprehensible to \nexpend moneys from the Treasury for a program like this.\n  Mr. President, I always try to do things the right way. Maybe what we \nshould do is have a vote on this. I have the exact words of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas--the exact words. ``I have some very good news indeed for \nthe Senator from Nevada. I am not about to stand here and defend an \nappropriation for a tea-testing board. We will accept his amendment.''\n  Well, maybe what we need to do is get a vote on this thing. When the \nmanagers of a bill, I learned a long time ago, say they will accept an \namendment, I think that is usually the way to go but maybe what we need \nto do is have 100 Senators walk up here and vote on this tea-testing \nboard and maybe that will send a bigger message to the House and maybe \nto these people in the Agriculture Department that there are certain \nthings we need to get rid of.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have worked on other things that are really \nhotly contested and debated issues. The wool and mohair subsidy; that \nwas an issue that had some merit on both sides. I acknowledge that.\n  As the Senator from Mississippi and the managers of this bill know, \neither on this bill or at some subsequent time, I am going to do some \nwork on the sugar subsidy. There are merits on both sides of that. I \nunderstand that.\n  The same on the peanut subsidy. Although I think we should get rid of \nthe sugar subsidy and peanut subsidy, there is at least an argument \nthat can be made for those programs. No one is going to get on the \nfloor and defend a Board of Tea experts.\n  Mr. President, I think we should have a vote on this. I think we \nshould walk in here and rather than have this just accepted, I think we \nwill have a vote on this, whether the U.S. Senate really sincerely \nwants to send a message to the Agriculture Department that we ought to \nget rid of this. We want to send a message to the Federal Government \ngenerally, these are the kinds of programs that are wasteful and we \nneed not spend taxpayers' money on them.\n  When we are cutting personnel to our National Park System, when we \nare debating how much we are going to hurt agriculture, when we are \ntalking about Medicare cuts, can we not cut, once and for all, the tea-\ntasting board?\n  Mr. President, I understand the unanimous-consent request that was \ngranted last Friday that we will have votes at a later time. On this \namendment, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senator discussed his amendment, I \nrecalled that we had this issue before the Senate, as he said, 2 years \nago. My recollection is that we agreed at that time that there should \nnot be any Federal funds appropriated by the Congress for this Board of \nTea experts, and we specifically included language in the bill that \nprohibited any funds appropriated in the legislation be used for that \npurpose.\n  I am told, as we were sitting here trying to recall the exact details \nof that, that the FDA does have some responsibility, under its \nauthority to inspect imported foodstuffs, to determine whether they are \nsafe for human consumption. There is some authority for them to inspect \nimported foods, and this is an imported consumable food, but that no \nfunds would be used that were appropriated especially for paying \nexpenses of this Board of Tea experts. Our recollection is that \nindustry decided that they would provide the funds to carry out the \nwork that was being done.\n  I thought that is what was being done. We are checking with the FDA \nright now to get a reaction from that agency and to find out exactly \nwhat their side of the story is. Are they using funds we are \nappropriating after we have specifically prohibited the use of Federal \nfunds for that purpose?\n  I want to know the answer to that because I agree with the Senator \nfrom Nevada, if we have legislated a prohibition on the use of \nappropriated funds and this agency continues to use funds that are not \nauthorized, we need to know about it. We need to get somebody up here \nto answer to that.\n  I am sympathetic with the amendment the Senator is offering. I urge \nthe Senate approve it.\n  If, in fact, they are not using appropriated funds, I do not see any \npoint in kicking a dead mule. We could bring the dead mule in here and \nhave all 100 Senators line up here and come kick it if that would make \nus all feel better, but I do not see any point in going through that. I \ndo not see any need for voting on it if it is not happening and they \nare not using the appropriated money. I sympathize with the Senator and \nappreciate his bringing it to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the manner in which the Senator \nfrom Mississippi has responded. I could not agree more. The information \nwe have is until recently the American taxpayers directly paid more \nthan 60 percent of the Board's $200,000 annual cost.\n  In 1993, the cost was shifted to the American Tea Consumers by \nraising the fee of 3.5 percent per hundred weight of tea imported to 10 \ncents. Nonetheless, the taxpayers continue to fund the salary of the \nchief tea taster, maintain the Federal tearooms, and other related \nactivities. That is what the taxpayers should not be involved in.\n  I am all for the Food and Drug Administration making sure that the \ntea that is very popular in this country is safe and is good to \ndrink. But, Mr. President, we have coffee, we have all other kinds of \nprograms that the FDA is involved in, and we do not believe we need a \nboard of coffee experts.\n\n  I accept what the Senator has said. If it can be shown, of course, \nthey are not doing this--which I think will be hard to show, because \nvouchers have already been expended--I will be happy to withdraw my \nrequest for a recorded vote. I really think Senator Brown and I have \n\n[[Page S 13696]]\nsomething to say, and that is let us stop this. This is outrageous.\n  I appreciate the support of the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I, like the Senator from Mississippi, \nthought we put this thing to bed 2 years ago. I may be mistaken. These \nthings have a way of resurrecting themselves, even when Senators think \nthey have taken care of it. But I think the vote, if there is a \nrollcall vote, will be 100 to zip to discontinue this program, or at \nleast discontinue any Federal taxpayers' money being used in it.\n  I hope either way the Senator will vitiate his request for the yeas \nand nays because rollcalls take 20 to 30 minutes. My guess is, the way \nwe compute costs of the operation of this body, the rollcall vote will \ntake up almost enough time to cancel out any savings we get by \ntorpedoing the Tea Board. So I hope the Senator will think about that \nduring the day and possibly vitiate his request for the yeas and nays, \nbecause I can assure him, every single Senator in the U.S. Senate feels \nthe same way he does.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me respond to the managers of this bill. \nThe only reason we need a rollcall vote is so the Senate is on record \nstrongly supporting this amendment. I have the greatest confidence in \nthe Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arkansas. I do not \nknow of two more qualified people to handle an appropriations bill, \nespecially an agriculture appropriations bill, than these two \ndistinguished Senators.\n  Therefore, based on the statements that they just made and regardless \nof what we find out during the course of the day from our staffs, which \nI think will confirm basically what I have stated here today--but based \non the assurance they will do everything they can to make sure the \nconference language is very clear that the Federal Government should no \nlonger be involved in the Board of Tea tasting experts, if they need \none let it be paid for out of the private sector, I withdraw my request \nfor a recorded vote.\n  I also believe each time 100 Senators come over here with staff and \neverything, it costs the taxpayers money and we should not do that \nneedlessly.\n  So based upon what they have just stated here on the Senate floor, I \nask unanimous consent my request for a recorded vote on the amendment \nnow before the Senate be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada not only \nfor his decision to vitiate the yeas and nays on his amendment, but for \nhis kind comments about the managers of the bill and our efforts to \nmanage this bill for the Senate. He is a good friend and one of the \nbest friends I have in the Senate. I admire and respect him. We \ncontinue to enjoy working with him on matters of mutual concern that \ncome before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I do not know we have adopted the amendment. We \nprobably need to do that.\n  If there is no further debate, we ask the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2685) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we do know of a number of amendments \nSenators intend to offer to this legislation. We hope we can proceed to \nconsider them in an orderly way. It would be a shame to have periods of \ntime when we do not have amendments being debated or considered by the \nSenate during today and then wait until tomorrow and everybody wants to \noffer their amendments tomorrow just before we are going to vote on \nfinal passage.\n  So I encourage Senators to come to the floor now, as Senator Reid \nfrom Nevada has done, to present their amendments and let us dispose of \nthe amendments or at least debate them, and if we need to have record \nvotes then we will order record votes. We could have a record vote--I \nknow at least one is ordered under the agreement, maybe two; one, at \nleast, after 5:15 today. Then the other votes, if they are needed, will \noccur tomorrow. We have an order already entered for two amendments to \nbe voted on, and final passage of the welfare reform bill tomorrow at \n2:45. There is a period of time tomorrow set aside for concluding \nremarks on welfare reform.\n  So as Senators can see, we need to make progress today so we can \ncomplete action on this bill and all amendments to it, if at all \npossible, by noon tomorrow. That was our commitment to the majority \nleader when we were authorized to take this bill up today, and that is \nwhy we began on the bill at 10 o'clock, so Senators could come and \noffer their amendments and have them debated today. So we hope Senators \nwill cooperate with the managers of the bill in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2686 to Committee Amendment on Page 83, Line 4, through \n                            Page 84, line 2\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kerrey and Kohl, I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), for Mr. \n     Kerrey, for himself and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2686 to committee amendment on page 83, line 4, \n     through page 84, line 2.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 83, strike line 4 through line 15;\n       On page 43, line 17; strike $528,839,000 and insert in its \n     place $563,839,000;\n       On page 52, line 18; strike $17,895,000 and insert in its \n     place $22,395,000;\n       On page 52, line 24; strike $30,000,000 and insert in its \n     place $37,544,000;\n       On page 55, line 1; strike $1,500,000 and insert in its \n     place $3,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside until later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues that we are \non the Agriculture appropriations bill. The managers are available, \nready to do business, but nobody is coming forth with amendments. So I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring over their \namendments. Senator Cochran is here. Senator Bumpers is available. They \nare ready to do battle or do business, whichever.\n  We need to finish six appropriations bills before October 1. As I \nhave also indicated, if we finish the six appropriations bills, there \nis a possibility we will have a recess period for 5 days, which I hope \nwill be an incentive to some of my colleagues to speed up the process.\n  So, after this bill tomorrow, of course, we will vote on the historic \nwelfare reform bill at probably about 3:30, after disposing of a couple \nother amendments. But we would like to complete action on the ag \nappropriations bill by noon tomorrow and then move to another \nappropriations bill, possibly foreign operations, which we think we \ncould finish in a day and a half. And then it gets a little more \ndifficult. But my view is, with the cooperation of everyone with the \nmanagers, we could complete action, say, by September 30, a week from \nSaturday, probably with a Saturday session.\n  We probably would not finish all the conference reports, but at least \nhave completed action on the appropriations \n\n[[Page S 13697]]\nbills. That would help avoid what some have referred to as a train \nwreck because we could continue the Government with a continuing \nresolution. It would not be a very--we can do that quite easily.\n  On behalf of the managers, I want to make a plea to my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that they are here, they are ready for \nbusiness, and we would like to complete action on this bill by noon \ntomorrow. Thank you.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2687 to Committee Amendment on page 83, line 4, through \n                            page 84, line 2\n\n            (Purpose: To eliminate the Board of Tea Experts)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2687 to committee amendment on page 83, line 4, \n     through page 84, line 2.\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following:\n       (a) None of the funds appropriated or made available to the \n     Federal Drug Administration by this Act shall be used to \n     operate the Board of Tea Experts and related activities.\n       (b) The Tea Importation Act (21 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) is \n     repealed.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am not sure the amendment makes it clear, \nbut I ask unanimous consent that this be considered as an amendment to \nthe committee amendment that is before the body at this point.\n  Mr. President, I know the body has already discussed the tea-tasting \nboard. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nhas correctly pointed out we no longer fund in the ag bill the cost of \ntheir activities, at least in terms of their per diem.\n  As I understand it right now, the per diem of $50 a day is now paid \nfor by the tea-tasting experts themselves. In addition, they pay their \nown cost of travel and living expenses going to and from Washington to \nperform their duties.\n  But, Mr. President, there also exists in our Federal law a \nrequirement for the Food and Drug Administration to pay for the \nemployees that sample the tea. And that is what this amendment gets at. \nIt gets at that cost that is mandated by the Tea Importation Act by \nrepealing it.\n  Thus, this amendment will not only forbid the paying of the salaries \nby the FDA employees, but will also repeal the Tea Importation Act. Mr. \nPresident, this is a significant step because it says a lot about our \ncommitment as a country to competition.\n  Currently, the Tea Importation Act can be used to keep out a product \nfrom the United States. In effect, what it does is give to the industry \nthe ability to determine what quality is allowed to come into the \nUnited States, rather than our consumers. The fundamental question \nMembers will have to ask themselves is whether or not it is the \nGovernment's responsibility, through the tea-tasting board of experts \nto determine what tea is allowed to come into this Nation and which \nones these experts should exclude.\n  I have great faith and confidence in the ability of consumers in this \ncountry to determine for themselves what tea they like and what they do \nnot like. As a matter of fact, it seems ludicrous that in this day and \nage that we should have delegated to a Government board or agency the \nability to decide which tea is permissible to enter into the Nation.\n  So this amendment is quite straightforward. It forbids the FDA to pay \nfor the employees or eliminates from the bill the ability to pay for \nthe employees that FDA is required to hire. It also repeals the Tea \nImportation Act.\n  Mr. President, some will say there is danger to consumers here. \nSomeone could get a bad cup of tea if this amendment is adopted. \nIndeed, Mr. President, I suspect that is true. It is also possible \nwhether this Board exists or not. But this, more than anything, is an \neffort to bring competition to our economy and eliminate artificial \nbarriers to trade and to competition.\n  Moreover, it says a lot about what we envision the purpose is of the \nFederal Government's role. Those who think the Federal Government \nshould have an all-pervasive role will want to retain those people who \ngather periodically to taste tea from around the world at Government \nexpense, at least for the employees' salary. But others will think that \nAmericans are competent and capable enough to decide what tea they \nwant.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator has completed his \nstatement and yields the floor, let me say we already this morning had \nan opportunity to talk about this issue during the discussion of the \nReid amendment, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nNevada. We discussed during the pendency of his amendment the fact that \n2 years ago an amendment was adopted on the floor of the Senate \nprohibiting the use of any appropriated funds to pay the expenses or \nthe costs of this so-called Tea Board.\n  It was our understanding at the time that FDA, as part of its \nresponsibility to inspect imported food consumables, had a role to play \nin determining the fitness for human consumption of imported tea \nbecause it was an imported consumable product, and that was the \njustification Congress was given when inquiries were submitted to the \nagency about this program and the need for these funds.\n  It was the sense of the Senate at that time, and we debated the issue \nthen and we agreed, that there should be in the legislation a \nprohibition against the use of funds to pay the costs of this Tea \nBoard, this expert Board of persons, one of whom had to be employed \nunder this law the Senator from Colorado talks about to serve on this \nboard.\n  I have no quarrel whatsoever with insisting upon the language that \nhas previously been approved by Congress on this subject. We have \ninquired already this morning about the reaction of the FDA to \naccepting the language offered by the Senator from Nevada earlier \ntoday. We have accepted that amendment. It has been approved by the \nSenate on a voice vote. He, likewise, had asked for the yeas and nays \nand agreed to vitiate the yeas and nays. I do not know of anybody who \nis going to vote against the amendment.\n  I certainly am not going to defend the continued use, if it is going \non, of federally appropriated funds for the so-called tea tasters that \nthe Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Colorado have brought to \nour attention again.\n  I do not know what the reaction of the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas to this amendment would be. The only thing that is new in this \namendment that was not contained in the Reid amendment is the repeal of \na legislative enactment which is spelled out in the amendment offered \nby Senator Brown.\n  I hope that we will refrain from using this appropriations bill as a \nvehicle for the adoption of amendments that strike out previously \nenacted legislation. This is not a bill to rewrite farm legislation, \nFood and Drug Administration authorities, or any other legislative \nenactment. It is not appropriate on this bill to revisit the body of \nFederal law on a number of different subjects, including the \nauthorization for this so-called inspection or tea board.\n  So I hope that Senators will not get the idea that since I am not \nopposing this amendment that I agree that it is the thing to do, to \ntake up proposals to repeal certain previously enacted laws by the \nCongress.\n  I know there are Senators who want to make changes in different kinds \nof farm program language. I hope that Senators will resist offering \nthose on this bill and wait until we have the farm bill on the floor, \nwait until the Agriculture Committee has completed its review of all \nlaws on the subject of production agriculture and food inspection and \nthe like. If there are amendments that should be made to existing laws \non those subjects, it seems to me the best practice would be to wait \nuntil we have that bill on the floor and offer the amendments at that \ntime to that legislation.\n  This bill appropriates money to fund the programs, it does not write \nthe authority to fund the programs. So we are not talking in this \namendment about a funding level, except to say, \n\n[[Page S 13698]]\nand I agree with the Senator, that we should prohibit the use of funds \nappropriated in this bill to carry out the activities described in the \nSenator's amendment.\n  So with that caveat, I suggest that we accept the amendment. I hope \nthe Senator will consider vitiating the yeas and nays. I do not know of \nany Senator who would vote against this. Maybe it is controversial, but \nI do not think it is controversial to me. I think the Senator is on the \nright track, and we ought to do what he says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is somewhat different than the Reid \namendment that was offered earlier in the day in this respect: It does \nrepeal the underlying act which the distinguished chairman from \nMississippi has just outlined for the Senate, one other thing in terms \nof cost.\n  The Reid amendment eliminated the salaries for the Board of Tea \nexperts. It did not eliminate the funding of the salaries of the staff. \nI am advised that the FDA's field force expanded by 6.9 direct FTE's in \nsupport of the Tea Importation Program. The average cost is $6,000 per \nFTE, and the program cost the agency approximately $52,500. That was in \nfiscal year 1994. So it is slightly different than the Reid amendment \nin that it repeals the underlying Tea Tasters Act and it also \neliminates funding for the staff, which the Reid amendment did not.\n  I very much appreciate the distinguished chairman's support of the \namendment. In light of that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nrequest for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAbraham be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, one other caveat, if the Senator has \ncompleted his statement. We have inquired of the Food and Drug \nAdministration what requirements of law, if any, might be repealed by \nthis amendment related to their obligation to inspect on the basis of \ndetermining the fitness for human consumption of imported consumable \nproducts. And we are advised that the FTE's, the staff hours that are \nused for this purpose, are directly related to the obligation of the \nFDA to certify the fitness for human consumption of imported \nfoodstuffs. So I am told that is their reaction. So that is not the \nsole purpose of the employees who are described by the Senator from \nColorado, to see whether or not the tea tastes good. That has been the \nbig issue.\n\n  It sounds kind of ridiculous that people are telling us whether tea \ntastes good or not. Anybody can decide whether or not something tastes \ngood. That is not what we are suggesting ought to be protected in terms \nof any statutory language that may be affected by this amendment.\n  But if we find that there is a legitimate responsibility to determine \nwhether or not imported foodstuffs will be dangerous for human \nconsumption by citizens of the United States, that is another matter. I \nhope, as we proceed with the consideration of this issue, whether it is \nin the markup of the agriculture legislation this year, the rewriting \nof the farm bill, or wherever else we might have to consider this, that \nwe keep in mind that the FDA is not in the business, or should not be \nin the business, of just determining whether food tastes good, but \nwhether it is dangerous, whether it has potential harm or consequences. \nI think we do want to keep in place the authority for those \ndeterminations.\n  Having said that, I think the Senator knows what he is doing, and he \nis not trying to put anybody in jeopardy of contaminated imported tea. \nWe will make sure that, as we review this statutory language, either on \nthis or other legislation, we keep in mind that important \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 2687?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am told Senator Bumpers, the \ndistinguished manager on the Democratic side of the legislation, wishes \nto express his views on this amendment. So if the distinguished Senator \nwill permit me, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside, temporarily, \nthis amendment so that he may proceed to offer whatever other \namendments he may wish to offer at this time; or if he would like to \ndebate this issue further, that we proceed to do that. I would not want \nto go to a vote on the amendment until the Senator from Arkansas has \nhad an opportunity to be heard.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that. Certainly \nthat is appropriate. There are a couple of points I thought might be \nworthy of making.\n  This underlying act was passed originally in 1897. It is nearly a \ncentury old. Perhaps its length of time says something about the need \nto take a fresh look at it. The language of the act talks about the \npurity and quality and fitness of imported tea. Largely, purity and \nquality, it strikes me, are consumer decisions, not decisions \nappropriate for the Government.\n  Certainly, the chairman hits the nail on the head when he says the \nFDA has a responsibility to make sure that we do not have poisonous \nfoodstuffs harming consumers, and that function, I think, is clearly \nestablished under other sections of the law.\n  Right now, only about 1 percent of the 209 million pounds of tea \nimported every year is currently rejected due to bad quality. But, Mr. \nPresident, I think what is important here is the potential of an \nindustry abusing this kind of law to discourage price cutting and to \nrestrict competition when there is a glut on the market.\n  Mr. President, the first and only term that I served in the Colorado \nState Senate was a wonderful experience. In 1973, I got a chance to \nobserve human nature. Colorado had a statute on its books that provided \nfor the testing of plumbers. The State of Colorado wanted to make sure, \nI guess, that there were not any unqualified plumbers preying on the \npublic. So they would test plumbers for their ability to perform \nservices. On a regular basis, of the plumbers that applied, 90 to 95 \npercent would pass the exam. Sometimes 100 percent passed. It was not a \nterribly tough exam.\n  Colorado, like Arizona and Mississippi, had gone through years of \ngrowth. There were always jobs for plumbers in the State. Many came in \nfrom out of State. I think they were drawn not only by Colorado's \nbeautiful environment but, I think and suspect, by the job availability \nas well.\n  But there was a downturn, as Members will recall, in 1973 and 1974. \nIn 1974, the passage rate on the exam dropped. All of a sudden, \nplumbers coming into the State, instead of 90 to 95 percent passing, \nsome 70 to 80 percent flunked the exam. What caused this dramatic drop \nin the qualifications of plumbers? Was it the degradation of their \nabilities? No. It was a surplus of plumbers within the State. The fact \nwas, what they did was they used a Government board to test and \ndetermine who is qualified for admittance into the State in the \nprofession of plumbing as a way of eliminating competition. So when \nprices were in the process of dropping, they used the Government tool \nthat had been handed them as a way of eliminating new competition.\n  Leaving this tea tasters statute on the books gives the industry a \nhandle to use against someone who might try to cut prices. It leaves \nthe industry a handle they might use against somebody who would flood \nthe market and reduce prices for the consumer and increase competition.\n  I think that concept, as well as that fear, that concern--we, the \nGovernment, ought to be about protecting and helping the consumer, not \nendangering the consumer, which is what has drawn me to offer this \namendment. It is not just the waste of money under current \ncircumstances. I guess in 1994, we mentioned $253,500. It is not just \nthat waste of money. It is the concept that we would place in the hands \nof an industry the ability to restrict or penalize people who might \nreduce the ability to bring in a product, to reduce prices, and provide \noptions for the consumer.\n  It seems to me that we need to be very wary about items that reduce \ncompetition. There is the potential that this statute could be abused \nin a difficult market. That is why I think repealing the underlying \nstatute is so important, not just for the cost, not just because of the \nconcept of what Government should and should not do, but because of the \npotential abuse of \n\n[[Page S 13699]]\nthis statute in an anticompetitive fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have conferred with Senator Bumpers' \nstaff and also conferred with the legislative committee staff that has \njurisdiction over the Food and Drug Administration in this specific \nlegislation which is the subject of the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado.\n  It is our understanding there is no objection from the legislative \ncommittee to accepting this amendment.\n  Under the status of the debate, as I understand it, while the yeas \nand nays were requested and the yeas and nays were ordered, a \nunanimous-consent order was entered to vitiate the yeas and nays if we \nwere going to accept it on a voice vote.\n  We are prepared now to accept the amendment on a voice vote and we \nare prepared to proceed to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment 2687?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2687) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2688 to Committee Amendment on Page 83, Line 4 through \n                            Page 84, Line 2\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to carry out the \n                            peanut program)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask this be considered as an amendment to the \ncommittee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2688 to the committee amendment on page 83, line 4 \n     through 84, line 2.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PEANUT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available under \n     this Act may be used to carry out a price support or \n     production adjustment program for peanuts.\n       (b) Assessment.--The Secretary of Agriculture may charge \n     producers a marketing assessment to carry out the program \n     under the same terms and conditions as are prescribed under \n     section 108B(g) of the Agriculture Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. \n     1445c-3(g)).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment is different than the \nprevious amendment. What it does is deal with the expenditures for \nadministrative costs for the peanut program. It does not attempt to \nmodify or repeal the underlying program itself.\n  The reason I do not attempt to repeal the underlying program is \nbecause, as I understand it, the Agriculture Committee is diligently \nreviewing the peanut program and will have recommendations. My \nunderstanding is that those recommendations are in effect necessitated \nby the fact that the passage of the NAFTA agreement has opened up our \nmarket which is a protected market, in which peanuts sell for \nsignificantly higher amounts in the United States than they do \noverseas.\n  NAFTA has opened that market up for competition from Mexico. Mexico \nhas a significant ability to produce peanuts and produce them at world \nmarket prices dramatically lower than United States market prices.\n  The change in the peanut program will be essential. I expect we will \nbe seeing the Agriculture Committee move on that in a diligent fashion.\n  My amendment is less ambitious in its scope. What it simply suggests \nis that the administrative costs of the program should not be paid for \nby the taxpayers of this country, but it does empower the Secretary of \nAgriculture to charge producers a marketing assessment to carry out the \nprogram under the same terms and conditions as prescribed under the \nlaw.\n  What it does is shift from the taxpayers the cost of administering \nthis program over to the people who benefit by this program.\n  It seems to me that this amendment is fair and reasonable. The \nsavings, we are advised, is in the neighborhood of $2 million for this \nyear, a potential savings of $11 million over 5 years should this apply \nin future years.\n  I would be remiss if I do not note that the cost to the consumers of \nthis country and to the taxpayers of this country of the peanut program \nitself is many, many times beyond that.\n  I am advised that the peanut program costs the American taxpayers \n$120 million a year. Let me repeat that: $120 million a year. That is \nnot peanuts.\n  This peanut program has placed us in a situation where the taxpayers \nget hit for $120 million a year, to support a program that is then \npriced significantly above the world market.\n  The costs to the American taxpayers for peanuts is not just the $120 \nmillion a year. It is the American consumer that really pays the price.\n  Estimates from a GAO report in 1993 indicate that the cost to the \nconsumer could range between $300 million and $500 million a year.\n  What we have is a very unusual agriculture program. The peanut \nprogram is much different than most other programs, but not all. In \neffect what this peanut program does is makes us uncompetitive in the \nworld market, gouges American consumers for between $300 and $500 \nmillion a year, and impacts the Treasury by $120 million a year for the \nprogram itself.\n  This amendment is modest. All it does is talk about saving the $2 \nmillion of administrative costs. Mr. President, it is $2 million we \nought to save.\n  Farmers in America are the most competitive farmers in the world. \nThey are productive. They are creative. They are efficient. The areas \nwhere the Americans are not competitive, the areas where the American \neconomy has fallen behind the rest of the world are areas where we have \nnot had vigorous competition. Areas where we do have vigorous \ncompetitions, we compete and we outcompete anyone in the world.\n  While this is a modest move, I look forward with great interest to \nthe actions of the Agriculture Committee in dealing both with the cost \nfor consumer and the cost for the general treasury.\n  I think this amendment sends a signal. It sends a signal of our \ncommitment to begin to respect the taxpayers with regard to a program \nthat has clearly outgrown its usefulness.\n  I suspect this will be controversial, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me say that my concerns at this early \npoint in the debate on this amendment surround the fact that we are \nworking in the Agriculture Committee at this time and a meeting is \ncalled for this week to consider changes in existing farm legislation, \nincluding proposals to modify and reform the peanut program.\n  I have introduced legislation, for example, that seeks to reduce the \noverall costs of these programs, but to do so in a way that does not \nundermine the ability of farmers to continue to produce efficiently and \noperate at a profit, but how to go about downsizing the expenses of \nagriculture programs and still maintain that ability to produce what we \nneed in our country, the food and fiber needs, to meet those needs and \nto still have a sufficient amount to export to contribute to our \noverall economic health is a big challenge.\n  I do not think we will be able to adopt incremental change on an \nappropriations bill that modifies this or any other commodity program \nthat will achieve the goal in a coherent, rational, and orderly way.\n  This may be an excellent amendment in terms of improving the \nefficient administration of this program. But I would hate to see us \nadopt this amendment and have it undermine or in any way adversely \naffect the effort that we are making for comprehensive reform of \nagriculture programs in the legislative subcommittee. So that is the \nconcern that I want to raise at this point.\n  I know there are others who may have more experience and are more of \n\n[[Page S 13700]]\n  an expert in the understanding of the workings of the peanut program \nand how this particular amendment might affect the administration of \nthe peanut program, but I express that concern, still hoping that we \ncan fulfill the commitment that we have made to reduce the costs of \nthese programs.\n  I know the Congressional Budget Office, for example, has estimated \nthat the reforms I have suggested in my bill to reform the peanut \nprogram could achieve savings of over $300 million over 7 years. This \namendment will reduce the cost of the program somewhat. But if we adopt \nthis amendment and then we ask CBO to analyze the effect of the Cochran \nbill, that is going to have a negative effect. And in our overall \neffort at comprehensive reform and meeting the targets of \nreconciliation, we could actually be penalized in our efforts to reform \nthe farm bill by adopting amendments like this one in an appropriations \nbill. Then we might have to cut other programs, nutrition programs, \nschool lunch program, other farm programs, in order to make up the \ndifference.\n  So I am hopeful the Senate will take that into account and consider \nthat as we look at this amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Brown amendment \nwould address the commodity program that deals with peanuts, and it \nwould assess peanut growers throughout the United States for the \ntheoretical administrative costs of the program, or approximately $2 \nmillion a year.\n  Mr. President, this program is over 60 years old. It has been the \nfocus of intense, deliberate, significant debate and discussion within \nthe Agriculture Committee. The Senator from Mississippi, who is here on \nthe floor with us, has been very instrumental in managing the vast \narray of details related to this program.\n  And to come into the appropriations process ad hoc and intervene into \nthat process, in my judgment, is inappropriate, and intrudes in a very, \nvery intense process to try to deal with this program and all those \nAmericans that are affected by it and all the complexities. It does not \nneed ad hoc intervention. It does not need ad hoc amendments. I welcome \nthe Senator, who is not a member of this committee, to come forward and \nwork with us with his suggestions. But this is not the way to manage \nthis intensely complicated program.\n  So I rise against the amendment. I rise against its appropriateness. \nThis is not the place for it. In fact, it will only make more \ncomplicated and difficult that which we are trying to do.\n  Now, Mr. President, I wish I could say that all U.S. programs were \nproducing the kind of economic impact and social good that this program \nrepresents. In the United States, the program represents $1.2 billion \nin annual farm revenue, 150,000 U.S. jobs, $200 million in annual \nexports, and $6 billion in annual economic impact.\n  I mentioned a moment ago that the program is about 60 years old. All \nof the farm community and rural communities that are affected over this \nextended period of time obviously have become ingrained with the \nprogram.\n  The reach of the program goes beyond those that are directly involved \nwith growing. The reach of this program, over the lengthy period of \ntime which it has existed, now reaches into the financial community, \nthe agribusiness community, the agricultural equipment community, and \nrepresents thousands and thousands of jobs and is an economic \nstabilizer in communities that have suffered immensely over the last 25 \nor 30 years and continue to suffer from economic decline.\n  I do not suppose any of us here, if we were designing the program, \nwould design it the way it is today. But those of us who have inherited \nit have also inherited a social responsibility to the communities \naffected by it.\n  Seventy-five percent--Seventy-five percent--of the counties involved \nin producing this commodity in the United States have a poverty level \nin excess of 20 percent. These are hard-hit communities. These are \ncommunities that have suffered many of the changes that have been \noccurring when we move from rural to urban.\n  Most people I hear around here talk about their grave concern about \nrural America. I hear it everywhere I go. This is where, as they say in \nmy part of the country, the rubber hits the road, because we are \ntalking about a Government partnership, much of rural America \nrepresented by this program where changes that are not thought through \ncan create massive--massive--economic instability. They not only affect \nimmensely the health of the family farm in these communities, they \naffect the financial integrity of the loaning institutions and they \naffect significantly the extended economic suppliers of the industry.\n  There are some counties in my State if you just turn the switch off \ntomorrow will be out of business, flat out of business. These are \npeople who were playing under the rules that were designed by this \nGovernment, as I said, over a 60-year period, and they have been \nplaying by those rules.\n  Having said that, let me say that I take my hat off to this community \nthat surrounds this commodity. I came here a little over 2 years ago. \nEverybody already knew we were going to be paying a lot of attention to \nthese programs, because this is an era of change.\n  These people came to the table. Over the last 2 years, they have been \nworking with their Senators, with the Agriculture Committee, and they \nhave been endeavoring to represent and be a part of change. They have \nproposed and they have stood behind significant reforms in this \ncommodity program. But they do want to be treated responsibly. They do \nwant to be treated as partners. They do want us to appreciate that this \narrangement was put in place by this Government, not them. And they do \nnot want it dealt with in an ad hoc way. They want it to be dealt with \nas the good Senator from Mississippi has been doing.\n  I see my colleague from Alabama has come to the floor. The Senators \nfrom North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia have produced reforms that are \nno net cost to the Government. Those reforms will result in a 30-\npercent loss of income in the farm communities that I represent, but \nthey have supported those kinds of reforms.\n  Throughout the process, they have been willing to discuss how it can \nbe changed to make it satisfactory to the taxpayer, to the Federal \nGovernment and to the economic fragility of these communities. I think \nthey have done so in good faith. I have become an admirer of the \ndedication to finding a way to make this program satisfactory to the \nAmerican taxpayers, satisfactory to the producer, and satisfactory to \nthe communities that are represented by this.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, that I have been struck by the \ndictionaries we find in Washington. I heard it a lot in the Agriculture \nCommittee. When we talk about something we are doing in urban America, \nwe often talk about our ``investment.'' Somehow, when we get over to \nthe rural communities, that word becomes ``subsidy.'' When it is a \nFederal program that is working on the economic viability of rural \nAmerica, that is a subsidy, but if we are talking about building \nbridges and roads to deal with the issues in urban America, that is an \ninvestment.\n  Both are investments. We are talking about the economic viability of \nvast rural regions in our country that have very high poverty rates. Of \nall the various programs that I have viewed, there are very few I have \never seen that cost so little, that produce so many jobs and so much \neconomic good. That is sort of a rarity here, but that is what I see in \nthis program. Not that it is perfect, and we have all acknowledged that \nand we are all working to change, but that ought to be done in the \ncommittee. That ought to be done by the people with the expertise. That \nought to be done in good faith with the people that have come to the \ncommittee and said, ``We are willing to sit down and work out \ncompromises, and we are willing to do things to lower the burden on the \nAmerican taxpayer.''\n  It should not be done ad hoc in a frittering manner that destabilizes \nthe entire effort that we have been about for the last 2 years. This \nshould be done in the farm bill.\n  I commend all those Senators for the time they have expended on \nbehalf of trying to reach an appropriate compromise. I commend the \ncommunities, as I said earlier, for their willingness to work, and I \nrise in opposition, in closing, to ad hoc management of a very \ncomplicated program that affects thousands of Americans in our country. \n\n\n[[Page S 13701]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Georgia withhold?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Certainly.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to say I think the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia has really given a very eloquent, accurate, and \npersuasive statement about why this amendment should be rejected. There \nis no doubt about it; he is a very insightful Senator, and he has come \nto the Agriculture Committee with a great deal of good common sense and \njudgment which shows very clearly during his discussion of this \namendment.\n  We are dealing with an appropriations bill. We are at work, on the \nother hand, trying to reform all of the commodity programs so that we \ncan make them more cost effective, we can make them respond to the \nchallenge of deficit reduction, but at the same time maintain stability \nin the agriculture sector and the capability for the future, and that \nis the most productive country in the world.\n  It is an enormously important sector of our economy, and to start \nnitpicking on this bill with these programs, like this peanut program \nthat the Senator describes, we are running a great risk. It may sound \ngood, it may make some feel good to vote for a change like this that is \nbeing recommended, but it is not going to serve the economic interests \nof our country as a whole and certainly not those regions of our \ncountry that are involved in this program.\n  I commend the Senator for his eloquent statement and his hard work as \na member of our Agriculture Committee. I hope the Senators who heard \nhim will pay attention and vote like he suggests--vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 2688?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2688, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to \nmodify my amendment on the peanut program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2688), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PEANUT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available under \n     this Act may be used to pay the salaries and expenses of USDA \n     employees who carry out a price support or production \n     adjustment program for peanuts.\n       (b) Assessment.--The Secretary of Agriculture may charge \n     producers a marketing assessment to carry out the program \n     under the same terms and conditions as are prescribed under \n     section 108B(g) of the Agriculture Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. \n     1445c-3(g)).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the modification is the product of the \ndiligent work of the senior Senator from Alabama, and thanks to him a \ndrafting error was spotted and corrected. The language that is in the \nmodification makes it clear that this deals only with the \nadministrative costs.\n  Mr. President, I will read the language that has been added, as it \nstands, to the modification.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this act may be used \n     to pay the salaries and expenses of USDA employees who carry \n     out the price support or production adjustment program for \n     peanuts.\n\n  The following paragraph on assessments, which remains exactly as it \nwas in the original amendment, is simply an ability to, through \nassessments, raise that money that the taxpayers have provided to pay \nfor the salaries and expenses of USDA employees who administer the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, as I say, this is intended to save about $2 million a \nyear. It is not a substitute in any way for the changes in the peanut \nprogram which will be necessitated regardless of Members' feelings \nabout the program. Those changes will be necessitated by NAFTA and the \nnew competition of peanuts from the Mexican market. But it is, I \nbelieve, a step in the right direction to ask the people who benefit by \nthe program to at least pay the administrative costs and not stick the \ntaxpayers with that cost.\n  Mr. President, I believe this measure will be controversial. It is my \nunderstanding there are other Members who want to address it. I \nunderstand that the manager of the bill would prefer that the measure \nto be voted on tomorrow.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado has modified the amendment to apply to only \nadministrative costs, of which there are about $2 million, and that \nthere would be an assessment charged against the producers to carry out \nthe program.\n  I am sure that the peanut program is controversial and that many \nprograms are controversial. Agriculture programs are controversial, and \nunder the Department of Agriculture every agricultural program is \ncarried out and administered by the Department of Agriculture. Are we \ngoing to say that the wheat program, therefore, which is carried out \nand administered by the Department of Agriculture, if we were to follow \nthe same concept, that on the wheat program there ought to be an \nassessment against the wheat producers relative to the administration \nof the wheat program?\n  If we stop and think about other programs, does this mean that if you \ncarry this philosophy out, the Social Security recipients, therefore, \nshould pay an assessment to the Government for carrying out the Social \nSecurity program? Or the Medicare Program? Does this mean that the \nrecipients in this program ought to be assessed the costs to carry out \nand administer the program?\n\n  You could go on with every conceivable program that the Government \nhas that therefore this philosophy would be relative to. Or the same \nconcept could be applied in regard to Senators. Should Senators, \ntherefore, in order to have an accounting system for receipt of their \nsalaries be assessed fees for the Government to carry out that program \nor to administer that program?\n  I do not agree with this overall philosophy, and I just point out \nquestions pertaining to it.\n  I will have a good deal more to say about this later on, but I do \nwant to point out right now that the concept of charging the producers \nof a program an assessment to administer the program is rather unusual \nand, if we start it, it ought to be applied across the board to every \nconceivable program--the orange juice program, the corn program, every \nprogram, wherever you are going to do it.\n  And then there are also other people in the chain that are recipients \nof a program such as, in the peanut program, the shellers, and then \nthere are the market people, the manufacturers that use it--all of \nthese people who are in effect beneficiaries of a program that ought to \nbe considered rather than just the farmer. We have had a situation \nwhere we are looking at farmers today in some of the sections of the \ncountry who have had terrible disasters, and I just do not think this \nis the proper time to be doing something like this.\n  Overall, the peanut program has cost the taxpayers a relatively small \namount of money over the period of time it has been in existence--\nsometimes as prices go up and prices go down because of market \nconditions or, on the other hand, because of weather conditions like \ndrought and other things, but in the last 10 years, the peanut program \nhas averaged out costing the Government an average of $13 million a \nyear. And I do not think any other farm program has been operated as \neconomically and at as little cost to the Government over a like period \nof time in history.\n  It will vary. It has gone up sometimes, and then there have been \nyears in which actually the peanut program has made the Government \nmoney.\n  So I think when we look at this matter of saving $2 million, it \ncertainly calls for a concept, and if we are going to look at it in \nsome equitable and fair way across the board, we ought to consider all \nother programs. But the major thing is that here we are, as the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Mississippi, has \nmentioned in a situation where this week we go to \n\n[[Page S 13702]]\nmarkup relative to a farm bill, and various and sundry approaches may \nbe offered and considered there. I think, therefore, it is premature at \nthis time to be considering it. Certainly, the Agriculture Committee \nought to be given an opportunity to look at this before we move forward \nin this regard.\n  I yield at this point and will have something else to say later.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to extend my thanks to \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama. I believe he was off the floor \nworking on another matter when I extended my thanks the first time. But \nI appreciate his reviewing the amendment and pointing out the need for \ncorrective language, and we have adopted that through a modification. I \nvery much appreciate his kindness and his indulgence in helping to have \nthe amendment accurately brought forward. And by that I do not mean \nnecessarily it says what the Senator would like it to say, but I do \nmean that he was very helpful in making sure it represented what my \nwishes were to offer to the body.\n  Mr. President, the Senator quoted the $13 million a year cost for the \npeanut program. The $120 million cost that I had used in the Chamber \nwas the estimate we had gotten from the Congressional Budget Office for \n1995. I believe the Senator was talking about was historic costs. I \nthink both figures are correct and I think it is perfectly appropriate \nfor him to point out the historic cost. That is a reasonable and \nbalanced way to look at it.\n  Mr. President, he also raised an important point. If this program is \nto cover its own administrative costs, why not the wheat program? While \nhe was too kind to say it, we produce a lot of wheat in Colorado, and \nthat is a fair question. In my mind--and certainly this is not meant to \nspeak for all the Members, but in my mind this peanut program is \ndifferent. It is different in that we maintain a price of peanuts in \nthis country that is significantly higher than the world market.\n  Most of our programs and most of our products in the United States \nsell for the lowest price in the world. We have the most efficient, \nproductive, creative agriculture of any nation on the face of the \nEarth, and it shows in our prices. Consumers in America enjoy low \nprices for farm commodities. Our price for products, including wheat, \nsets the base.\n  That is, Europe and Japan not only import wheat, but by importing it \nthey pay more than American consumers because of the costs involved in \nshipment. People around the world pay a higher price for wheat \ngenerally than we do in the United States, so the wheat program goes to \na different focus. It does go to market stabilization which is thought \nto be of help for the consumer. Certainly the wheat program is a \nprogram that merits debate at the appropriate time.\n  At least in my mind, however, the wheat program is a dramatic and \ndifferent program than the peanut program. Why? It is dramatically \ndifferent because the peanut program is designed to market our peanuts \nat a significantly higher price in the world market. That has a \ndramatically different effect upon consumers and producers than the \nwheat program that does not attempt to have a significantly higher \nprice for wheat in America than we have in the world market.\n  Nevertheless, I think the Senator's point is a valid one, and it goes \nto the heart of the amendment. Should the taxpayers pay for the \nadministrative costs and which ones should the users?\n  It had been my understanding that, indeed, in Social Security and \nMedicare the cost of administration was borne by the taxes levied that \ngo into a trust fund, and we are asking to check that right now. I \ncertainly will want to make that point clear for the Record. I think \nthe Senator is right to raise that issue. He does come to the heart of \nthis amendment. That is the suggestion that the roughly $2 million a \nyear cost of administering this program, that markets a commodity at \nsignificantly above the world prices, be borne by the participants.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am a supporter of the wheat program. I \ndid not necessarily mean to be picking Colorado. I have always \nsupported the wheat program. I think it is a good program. But there \nare some distinctions between the wheat program and the peanut program \nrelative to the cost of Government, as there are with a number of \ncommodities.\n  Basically, the peanut program has a loan rate. That loan rate allows \nfor farmers to--in bad times when the price is low or when there are \nweather conditions and such--put their product that they have produced \ninto a loan. And then the CCC can take it out of the loan and set it. \nThey have to pay interest on it when they do, or else the Government \ncan, of course, have a nonrecourse loan and can sell it on the world \nmarket.\n  But the wheat program and most commodities have a greater cost rather \nthan just the loan. That is the target price or deficiency payment. And \nthere is no deficiency payment, there is no target price in peanuts at \nall. I think sometimes we have misunderstood various farm programs and \nother things also. But the peanut program does not have the deficiency \npayments at a great number. I am a supporter of the farm programs that \nallow for the target prices and allow for the deficiency payment. But I \ndo make that distinction, the distinction being raised about that at \nthis time.\n  So we will be discussing it further.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know there may be other Senators who \nwant to speak on this amendment. I have expressed my concerns already. \nWe have heard from the distinguished Senator from Alabama. It is likely \nthat we will be able to vote on this tomorrow, rather than today. There \nare other amendments that we know will be offered today and debated. We \ncan dispose of those amendments.\n  Because we have had a pretty full discussion of this suggested change \nin the bill, I am going to ask unanimous-consent that we set aside this \namendment and proceed to take another amendment up for consideration \nthat the Senator from Colorado will offer. So I make that unanimous \nconsent request to set aside the amendment temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to add to the record with regard to \nthe debate on the peanut amendment. I would ask, while that amendment \nis not presently before us, that I be allowed 60 seconds in which to \naddress the peanut amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the discussion on the peanut amendment, \nthe question was raised as to whether or not this, asking users or \nbeneficiaries of a program to pay the administrative costs, was \nappropriate or not and whether or not it was done in other areas, and \nmyself and others had speculated about the social security fund. I am \nadvised that indeed, the administrative costs for the Social Security \nprogram do indeed come from the fund. I think some of the confusion may \ncome in that the discretionary spending is considered part of funding \nthat comes under the discretionary caps for the budget function. But \nindeed, the source of the money is from the fund itself.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2689 to Committee Amendment on Page 83, Line 4, Through \n                            Page 84, Line 2\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to administer \n   tobacco grading and inspection, tobacco price support, quota, and \n                          allotment functions)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \ncommittee amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. \n\n[[Page S 13703]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2689 to the committee amendment beginning on page \n     83, line 4.\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . PRICE SUPPORT AND GRADING AND INSPECTION OF TOBACCO.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available under \n     this Act may be used to pay the salaries or expenses of the \n     employees of the Department of Agriculture to grade or \n     inspect tobacco or to administer price support functions for \n     tobacco.\n       (b) Assessment.--The Secretary of Agriculture may charge \n     producers a marketing assessment to grade or inspect tobacco \n     and to administer the price support functions under the same \n     terms and conditions as are prescribed in the Agricultural \n     Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445-1 and 1445-2).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment calls for the tobacco \nprogram to be no net cost to the American taxpayer. Some Members will \nsay, ``I thought it was already a no net cost.''\n  Indeed, there was legislation offered in 1982 that came under the \nheading of ``no net cost'' for the tobacco program. And yet, Mr. \nPresident, some Members may be surprised to learn that did not cover \nall of the costs of the program. That no-net-cost concept is a good one \nand one that this amendment attempts to complete.\n  But left out of the legislation in 1982 was an effort to cover the \nadministrative cost that involves maintaining the price support and \nboth the grading and inspection of tobacco. So administration of the \nprogram, grading and inspecting of tobacco, are still an expense to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, it is one thing to be upset about tobacco smoking in \nthis country and urge people not to use the product or suggest that \nperhaps the FDA ought to regulate it and extend additional regulations. \nBut, Mr. President, it is quite another thing to tax the American \ncitizen to pay for a product that we turn around and then urge them not \nto use. Good common sense indicates that we should not subsidize a \nproduct that we think is harmful to people and that they should not \nuse. I am one who believes that this country is all about freedom, and \nto the maximum extent possible, we ought to maximize people's freedom \nto choose.\n  So I have not been one that wants to outlaw all forms of tobacco or \nfollow other circuitous routes that simply eliminate that choice. I \nthink all Americans agree that our children should not consume tobacco \nproducts. But for adults, while we would all have strong feelings about \nthe subject and many of us feel that we would be better off without \ntobacco, I am not one who wants to ban it. But, Mr. President, I am one \nwho wants to have the tobacco producers pay for the cost of their own \nprogram.\n  It makes no sense to tax working men and women of this country to \nsubsidize a product and then turn around and tax them to urge people \nnot to use a product they have just subsidized. That makes no sense at \nall. That is what this amendment is all about. It simply says that when \ntobacco producers say they have a no-net-cost program, that it is in \nfact a no-net-cost program.\n  So this amendment does two things. One, it makes it clear that there \nwill be no taxpayers' funds appropriated in this bill that will be used \nto pay the salaries and expenses of Department of Agriculture employees \nto grade or inspect tobacco or to administer the price support \nfunctions for tobacco.\n  Second, Mr. President, it makes it very clear that the Secretary has \nthe ability to assess producers a marketing assessment for these \nfunctions. So it gives the Secretary a way to carry out these \nfunctions, but at the expense of the producers, not at the expense of \nthe taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, some will note that the Secretary already has the \nability to levy an assessment for this program. Indeed, the Secretary \ndoes. I added that assessment section so there could be no doubt that \nthere would be no question but that the Secretary could levy it for \nthis purpose. I think it is arguable one way or another that he already \nhas the authority to levy this assessment. But it seemed to me clarity \nwas a virtue in this circumstance. So we go the extra mile to make sure \nit is clear that he has the ability to raise funds for this purpose.\n  But, Mr. President, the American men and women who pay our taxes \ncannot understand why in the world we would have Government functions \nthat work to opposite purposes, why in the world we would subsidize a \nproduct which our Government turns around and tells us is hazardous to \ntheir health and urges people, at taxpayers' expense, not to consume \nit.\n  This amendment, I think, adds consistency to our functions. It adds \nsome consistency in the way we spend taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, it is my impression this will be a controversial \namendment; that there will be other Members who wish to voice their \nconcerns and objections about it. I hope there may be others who may \nwant to say a good word or two on its behalf. So I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator has completed his \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am confident there are Senators who \nwish to be heard on this amendment before we vote on it. I am also sure \nthat it is probable that this vote will be postponed until tomorrow. \nBut I hope that those who do want to speak on the amendment will come \nto the floor and do that so we can complete our debate on the amendment \nand leave to tomorrow the vote on the amendment, if that is the will of \nthe Senate.\n  There have been, of course, in the past, amendments similar to this \nthat have been before the body, so it is not a new issue. We have \ndebated this from time to time. I am confident that there are arguments \nthat can be made on the other side and will be by Senators who are \nexperts in this program.\n  From the point of view of the managers of the bill, though, I would \nsay that this is another example of an effort to modify with \nlegislative language, in effect, programs that are now under \nconsideration and review by the Agriculture Committee. We have this \nweek a markup scheduled on commodity program changes that are designed \nto meet the challenge of the budget reconciliation and resolution that \nwas adopted by the Congress to reduce the cost of the programs under \nthe jurisdiction of all the legislative committees.\n  This is under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, and it \nmay very well be that changes are going to be directed or recommended \nby the Agriculture Committee in this program. I do not know the extent \nto which this amendment, if it is adopted, will affect those \ncomprehensive changes that may be recommended by the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  When we were talking about the peanut amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator had offered, I mentioned that I had included the \npeanut program in a proposal that I have submitted to the committee \nwhich is designed to reform that program and reduce the costs of the \nprogram over time. I know that if we adopt the peanut amendment as \nproposed by the Senator from Colorado, it would reduce the savings that \nare now estimated by CBO to be attributable to the farm bill I am \nproposing.\n  There may be other Senators who have suggestions to make in the \nAgriculture Committee about the tobacco program. I do not know the \nextent to which this amendment would affect those projected savings. \nBut I do know that there will be some effect, and the question before \nthe Senate is whether we ought to adopt amendments such as this, \nknowing that they are going to be legislative in nature and will \nencroach on the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. So I voice \nthat concern as a concern that applies not only to this amendment but \nother amendments like it.\n  I discourage Senators who do have changes in legislative language and \nsuggest that it would be more appropriate and in better keeping with \nthe way we should do business here in the Senate to bring those up when \nthe legislative committees' bills are on the floor--or bring them up in \nthe committees of jurisdiction, even better, so those committees can \nreview these suggestions.\n  I respect very much the Senator from Colorado. He is one of the best \nminds in \n\n[[Page S 13704]]\nthe Senate. He is a Senator who has always been on the lookout for ways \nto improve the efficiency of Government programs and reduce unnecessary \ncosts. He is a leader in achieving results. Again, he is showing his \nability to carefully analyze Federal programs and look for ways that we \ncan improve them in terms of their efficiency. The savings of \ntaxpayers' dollars that will result from the changes are quite obvious. \nThis is another example which shows his diligence and his ability in \nthis regard. So I commend him for his continued efforts to do what he \nis trying to do. I applaud that effort.\n  Having said that, I hope that if Senators do want to comment on the \nlegislation and the proposed amendment, they will come to the floor to \ndo so, and I will put in a quorum call to ascertain whether we do have \nSenators who want to speak further on this amendment at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is nobody at the moment \nwaiting to bring up any amendments so I ask unanimous consent that I be \nable to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13680-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAL RIPKEN, JR.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a couple weeks ago, like many others, I had \nthe opportunity to be in Camden Yards to see a most extraordinary \nbaseball game when Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record. I remember as \na child thinking that the Gehrig record might never be reached, never \nbe broken.\n  For me, the fact that I could be there with my son, Kevin, to watch \nthat game, was really one of the highlights of this or any other year.\n  In watching, I could not help but think that Cal Ripken reflected the \nbest of all people who get up and go to work every day in all fields. \nWhether it is the nurse who is there for the evening shift on a \nweekend, the person who shows up at the police department and goes to \nwork to protect all of us, the teacher who is there teaching our \nchildren, the men and women of the Senate staff who are here--sometimes \nlong after we Senators are able to go home--every day working for the \nbest of our country, and on and on.\n  In this case I also think credit should be given to Peter Angelos and \nthose who own the Orioles. Earlier this year when there was talk of \nreplacement teams, they stood fast and said there would be no \nreplacement team for the Orioles. Nothing would be done to cut into Cal \nRipken's record. Indeed, they did not.\n  I also think that two things came as a result of that. One, it sent a \nsignal to baseball that there are some owners and some players who care \nmore for the game than care for the disgraceful dance that has gone on \nthe past year, the dance of charges and counter-charges and strikes and \nlockouts that resulted in the cancellation last year of the World \nSeries.\n  Second, by doing that, I believe it helped bring to an end the strike \nand it also gave baseball an evening of glory that it has not had for \nso long. It really did not become a question of whether the Orioles won \nor lost that night. It turned out they did win with Cal Ripken hitting \na home run. It was a chance for people to unite around this country and \nsay there are so many good things in baseball, and to go back to the \nbasics of it. I hope Cal Ripken's accomplishment does help.\n  As Kevin and I sat there, we watched the different people--Joe \nDiMaggio sitting a few feet from us, the President, the Vice President, \nand others just to the other side of us, but what united us was not the \nwell-known people but that baseball fans of all sort throughout that \nfield and throughout the country could share in a magnificent \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13704-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13704-S13705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VERMONT'S FINEST, SOFTBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently had a chance to watch some of \nthe best softball I have ever seen.\n  I saw the Vermonters, who make up my own team, play in the semifinals \nand then the finals and then win the softball championship.\n  I was out there Saturday in 95-degree heat, blistering sun, and I \nwatched these young men and women from my office's team and I thought: \nThat is real sportsmanship.\n  Then, the next day the final championship was fought between Vermont \nand New Hampshire.\n  In a league with 120 teams, the idea that the Senate softball \nchampionship this year came down to teams from New Hampshire and \nVermont is ironic.\n  You have to understand we are both northern New England States, and \nthe baseball season is rather short in northern New England. Our \nchildren grew up with hockey sticks and skates and skis--and have to \nsqueeze their baseball in between those light May snow showers and the \nSeptember autumn chill that stings the hands of all children who make \ncontact with ball and bat.\n  But there we were.\n  The Thundering Herd, the talented granite-like team of Senator Bob \nSmith's office had not been beaten all year. But neither had Vermont's \nFinest. Vermont's Finest, we say with no hint of modesty, is the name \nof our softball team.\n  The game went back and forth, only to be tied at the end of seven \ninnings. Vermont scored two runs in the top of the eighth and shut the \nHerd down to seal the victory and the championship.\n  We were led by Montpelier's Maggie Whitney, who played second base \nbut should be turning double plays with Cal Ripken, Jr. St. Albans' \nJamie Horan has a black eye and a 500-foot home run to show for the \nseries. Beebe Plain's Mike Lawson won rookie of the year honors while \nrepresenting the smallest town in Vermont with glove and lumber.\n  And the list of contributors is endless. Big Ed Pagano, our oak tree \nat first; Tom ``Stonewall'' Cosgrove, anchoring third on a nearly \nbroken ankle--an ankle, incidentally, we heard snap as he hit home \nplate. He would not allow it to break until he scored that run. Paul \n``The Enforcer'' Johnson, who with aging star J.P. Dowd provided key \nhitting and veteran leadership. Norwich's Regen O'Malley and UVM grad \nKara Calaca-Mottola were anchors behind the plate. And our own tank \ncommander, that stalwart marine, Bill Delaney, had more than a few key \nhits.\n  Rookies David East and Narric Rome were vital to the team effort.\n  Vivian Cocca pitched as gutsy a series of games as we have seen in \nyears.\n  Special honors have to go to our player-coach Brady Burgess, the \nsolid, taciturn hunk of granite, a native of Lincoln, VT, who grew up \ndreaming of one day holding the Senate trophy aloft. I am sure this is \na dream he had as a 3-year-old. He batted, fielded, and led his team to \nan impossible series of victories.\n  The loyal bench jockeys were Brattleboro's Jenny Backus, the purple-\nshorted Kevin ``Scooter'' McDonald, and the pride of St. Johnsbury, \nZima-drinking Amy Rainone.\n  And the whole team was aided by their biggest fan and 5-year-old bat-\nboy, Walter Albee, who occasionally let his aging baby boomer, semi-\nyuppie father play.\n  We have to tip our caps to a few teams. First, our friendly rivals \nthe Vermont Saps, from my good friend Jim Jeffords' office, who had \nwhat we call a ``rebuilding year'' this year but will no doubt be in \nthe playoffs next year as they have been.\n  Second, our tough but honorable rivals from the McCain-McConnell \nteam. It seems one of us is always knocking off the other to get to the \nmountain top.\n  Third, our friends on Senator Mikulski's team. In the past 5 years, \nwe have each won the championship twice and will be glad to be keeping \nit in the family.\n  Finally, to the Thundering Herd from New Hampshire--that the two New \nEngland teams made it to the top of the heap is a testament to \ntraditional Yankee values of team play, strength, and hard work. I say \nto my friends from New Hampshire, they will be first in the Nation when \nDixville Notch goes to the polls at midnight. You almost made it first \nin the Nation in softball, \n\n[[Page S 13705]]\nand we expect to see you again next year.\n  Mr. President, we joke a little bit about this, but I think some of \nthe most pleasant moments that I spent this year have been watching the \nsoftball team play--pleasant, because I know how hard the men and women \nwho work for the Senate, who support all of us, do work, Republicans \nand Democrats alike. It is the men and women here who so make the \nSenate the place it is and can be. And they are the ones who make it \npossible for Americans to have hope in us.\n  There are 100 Senators. None of us would be able to do our job \nwithout people, ranging from those who guard the doors of this Chamber \nto those who report our proceedings, to those who handle the bills as \nthey go through, and to all the others--those who make the electricity \nwork, to those who help us write the legislation. I sometimes joke we \nare merely constitutional impediments to the staff. The truth of the \nmatter is, we are, all of us, better--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nbecause of the selfless work of the men and women here in the Senate.\n  When I see them have a chance to play softball and enjoy themselves, \nI think how lucky we are to have them here. I have to tell all those in \nmy office, I could not be more proud than I was watching them play in \nthese championship games.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Mississippi on \nthe floor. When I started speaking there was nobody seeking \nrecognition. He is the manager of this bill. Is he seeking recognition? \nIf not, I have one more item to go to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No. Please proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13704-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BIPARTISAN BUDGET SUMMIT NEEDED NOW\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I called for a summit between \nCongressional leaders and the President to avoid a Government shutdown \nwhen the next fiscal year starts on October 1.\n   Since then, the House and Senate have passed a couple more \nappropriations bills and the administration has threatened more vetoes.\n   I was encouraged, however, by last week's meeting between \ncongressional leaders and the President that we may yet avoid a budget \ntrain wreck which will force the Government to shutdown. The President \nand congressional leaders were right to get together to discuss a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the Government beyond October 1.\n   I hope last week's meeting signals a start to rational negotiations \nto solve the current budget impasse. We need to build on the positive \nsignals sent by both sides to reach a compromise.\n   That is why I renew my call for a bipartisan summit now--before the \nbudget crisis. We need to sit down now to hammer out our differences.\n   Resolving differences is the essence of governing. Let us get \ntogether, the leaders of both parties, and work together to make our \nGovernment work.\n   I fear that few of our leaders have considered what happens if \nCongress and the President fail to reach an agreement and force the \nGovernment to shut down. Make no mistake about it--shutting down the \nGovernment will bring serious consequences.\n   First, shutting down the Government because Democrats and \nRepublicans cannot agree on the budget will accomplish nothing except \nadding more scorn of our political system. This partisan fighting for \njust the sake of a headline is exactly what Vermonters believe is wrong \nwith our present system. I believe this scorn will be fully justified \nif we do not work out our differences before forcing the Government to \nclose.\n   Second, and more importantly, shutting down the Government will have \nserious effects on the lives of millions of Americans.\n   The most immediate effect of a shutdown will be the furloughing of \nFederal employees. The only exceptions from furloughs under a \nGovernment shutdown are Presidential appointees, uniformed military \npersonnel, and Federal civilian employees rated ``essential.''\n   In 1990, the nonpartisan General Accounting Office estimated that \n319,541 Federal Government employees out of 741,653 would be \nfurloughed--about 43 percent of the Federal Government work force--\nduring a Government shutdown.\n   Imagine the effect on those hundreds of thousands of employees and \ntheir families who are facing the prospect of an unknown period of \nunemployment. These are hard-working people who struggle like millions \nof other Americans to balance their checkbook each month.\n  We should not hold their households hostage to our inability to \nprovide a workable Government budget for all Americans.\n   So let us keep in mind that when we contemplate a shutdown, we are \ntalking about punishing hard-working families, not faceless \nbureaucrats, as some would lead us to believe.\n   What would be the effects if 43% of our Government workers are not \nallowed to go to work?\n   The GAO surveyed Government agencies in 1990 to find out the answer \nto that question. Each agency estimated that a Government shutdown \nwould severely damage their effectiveness.\n   The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, estimated that \n``all environmental protection services would be shutdown.'' Do we \nreally want to leave our environment at risk to score political points \nover a Government shutdown?\n   The Food and Drug Administration estimated under a shutdown ``there \nwould be no work on applications for new drugs and devices.'' Do we \nreally want to put the benefits of new science and technology on hold \nto score political points over a Government shutdown?\n  The Social Security Administration estimated that under a shutdown \n``no new applications for Social Security or Medicare eligibility would \nbe taken or inquiries answered.''\n   Do we really want to make our senior citizens wait to score \npolitical points over a Government shutdown?\n   The Department of Justice estimated that a shutdown would delay \ntrials and weaken its ability to supervise the Federal parolee \ncaseload. Do we really want to slow down our criminal justice system to \nscore political points over a Government shutdown?\n   The Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that under a shutdown \n``there would be approximately 37,000 unanswered telephone calls per \nday and approximately 5,000 cancelled interviews per day.'' Do our \nveterans really deserve this kind of treatment to score political \npoints over a Government shutdown?\n   Perhaps the most lasting effect of a Government shutdown will be the \nwasted millions of taxpayer dollars.\n   At a time when the President and Congress are dedicated to \neliminating unnecessary Government spending, pouring money down a \nGovernment shutdown rathole makes absolutely no sense. Shutting down \nthe Government will make it harder to balance the budget--not easier--\nbecause lost revenue from a shutdown will simply add to our deficit.\n   The GAO estimated in its 1990 report that a 3-day closing would cost \nthe Government millions of revenue dollars.\n   The Interior Department, for example, would lose $30 million in \nrevenue during a 3-day shutdown, and the Treasury Department would lose \na whopping $420 million. A longer shutdown would lose millions more. Do \nwe really want to waste taxpayer money to score political points over a \nGovernment shutdown?\n   Closing the Government, even for a short time, carries serious \nconsequences. It would rightfully heap scorn on our political system.\n   It would impair the effectiveness of necessary Government services, \nwhich many Americans depend on every day. And it would waste millions \nof taxpayer dollars.\n   Let us stop this fiscal insanity. Let us build on last week's \nbipartisan meeting and call a bipartisan budget summit.\n   It is time for our leaders to start acting responsibly. It is time \nfor our leaders to start using some common sense. It is time for a \nbipartisan summit on the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13705-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13705-S13707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  \n[[Page S 13706]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that we have some amendments \nthat have been offered and are pending now on this agriculture \nappropriations bill which is the business before the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2686\n\n  One of these amendments that was set aside for debate for later today \nwas one offered by the distinguished Democratic leader in behalf of \nSenators Kerrey and Kohl. That amendment would strike a provision of \nthe bill that was added as a committee amendment appropriating funds \nfor use as disaster assistance to supplement the benefits provided by \ncatastrophic insurance to disaster victims. The reason the committee \napproved this amendment was because we have seen throughout the South \nthis year some very serious damage in the cotton fields of Alabama, \nGeorgia, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee, and Arkansas as well.\n  As a result of massive infestations of tobacco bud worms and beet \narmy worms, and other pests in the cotton crops in these States, it has \nbeen hard to estimate the exact amount of damage done because \nharvesting has not occurred in many of the areas where we know the \ndevastation is severe. So dollar amounts are simply estimates at this \npoint. But one estimate that we saw in my State of Mississippi alone \nindicates that over 160,000 acres of cotton have been damaged at a loss \nof over $100 million.\n  The reason the committee thought it was important to provide some \nadditional benefits is that the catastrophic crop disaster insurance \nprogram is not sufficient to help farmers in this situation. And many \nof them are not going to be able to plant crops next year, and some are \nnot going to be able to stay in business unless something is done to \nhelp them.\n  We have already seen this last week a request from the Governor of \nMississippi transmitted to Secretary of Agriculture Glickman asking for \ndisaster declarations in many of these counties in our State which will \nmake available emergency production loans. These loans will be at \nreduced rates of interest--I am told at about 3.75 percent interest--\nand would be available as emergency loan benefits, if the damage \nassessment reports justify the declaration and approval of the \ndeclaration by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  One difficulty that we are encountering, though, is that the early \nestimates are proving to be much less than what the damages are turning \nout to be because of these massive infestations of pests.\n  It is certainly a concern to me that the Senators from Nebraska and \nWisconsin are urging the Senate to overturn this provision in our bill. \nWe had hoped that the Senate and the House also would respond to this \ncrisis situation and be generous--as generous as the budget permits and \nas generous as our rules permit--to provide some additional assistance \nto these disaster victims.\n  I am urging the Senate to approve the committee amendment that \nprovides this crop disaster assistance money. The Senate should also \nknow that I have introduced separate legislation to authorize the \nSecretary, if he deems that additional disaster assistance is \njustified, to ask for additional appropriations.\n  That legislation has been introduced here in the Senate. It has been \nintroduced in the House in the companion bill which is sponsored by \nCongressman Roger Wicker and Congressman Bennie Thompson of \nMississippi. Our entire delegation was invited to a meeting at the \noffices of the Mississippi Farm Bureau federation in August to hear \nfirsthand the reports of cotton producers and those who were familiar \nwith the situation--immunologists, an economist from the Mississippi \nExtension Service at Mississippi State University who was familiar with \nthe facts. And, after hearing all of the information, it became very \nclear to me that we needed to respond both here in Washington and at \nevery level of government to try to help overcome the effects of this \nserious disaster.\n  It is one of those situations where it appeared that we were going to \nhave a very good and productive cotton crop throughout the country this \nyear. But all of a sudden, because of the excessive hot weather, hotter \nthan usual, dryer than usual, and an enormous infestation of these \ninsects and pests that almost overnight the complexion of the cotton \ncrop this year was changed. Producers began trying to find out what \nkinds of control measures could be effective to deal with this problem. \nSome of them spent huge amounts on chemical applications that they were \ntold by experts could help deal with this disaster only to find out \nthat the money was really wasted. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have \nbeen spent by many farmers in our State to try to deal with and control \nthese pests. And much of that money has been wasted.\n  There are many cotton fields in our State which will not even have a \ncotton picker put in the fields. They will not even try to harvest the \ncotton because it is just not there to pick. So total losses in many of \nour counties have been sustained.\n  I am going to ask, Mr. President, to put in the Record an estimate \nthat has been compiled from various sources, including the Mississippi \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Texas Extension Service, the Alabama \nExtension Service, and the National Cotton Council. The States of \nTennessee, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama are \ncovered in this report.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this estimate of cotton \nlosses due to the tobacco bud worm be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                COTTON LOSSES DUE TO THE TOBACCO BUDWORM                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Acres--Abandoned    Loss in  \n                  State                       and reduced    millions of\n                                                 yield         dollars  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMississippi..............................         160,000            100\nTexas (in lower Rio Grand and southern                                  \n Rolling Plains..........................         500,000        200-400\nAlabama..................................         400,000            155\nTennessee................................         150,000          50-75\nArkansas.................................         100,000             20\nGeorgia..................................         300,000             75\nNorth Carolina...........................

Mr. President, the estimates not only identify the \nacreage that has been abandoned and which will have reduced yields due \nto this infestation, but also the translation in losses in terms of \nmillions of dollars in my State of Mississippi. It is a $100 million \nestimate. But just this week, when I was home in Mississippi this \nweekend, the newspaper carried a story with new crop loss estimates \nthat have been compiled from throughout the South. It shows that even \nhigher estimates than had earlier been expected are now justified on \nthe basis of the losses that are occurring.\n  We have on our hands, Mr. President, one of the worst disasters in \nthe cotton industry that anyone can remember. Our committee decided \nthat it would be important to make available some additional funds \nwhich the Secretary of Agriculture could use to supplement the benefits \nof the Catastrophic Crop Insurance Program.\n  The Catastrophic Crop Insurance Program is a new program. Farmers \nwere told, when this program was approved, that it would be a \nsubstitute for the usual disaster assistance benefits that have \noccasionally been made available when disasters struck the agriculture \nsector, and that the amounts of the benefits would be about the same \nthat they would normally get; to qualify for the catastrophic crop \ninsurance, you would be charged $50, and that would be a processing \nfee.\n  I remember when I first heard about it, I said to the Department of \nAgriculture people who were briefing us, ``That's too good to be true--\n$50. You buy this insurance and it provides the same benefits that the \nFederal Government has been making available as disaster benefits on an \nad hoc basis when they thought it was justified.'' I was assured that \nis what the promise was.\n  What has happened, as we get down to the real details and we find out \nwhat the benefits are of this so-called Catastrophic Crop Insurance \nProgram, we are finding out it does not provide the same coverage that \nhistoric disaster assistance programs have provided.\n  Previous disaster programs traditionally provided coverage at 60 \npercent of \n\n[[Page S 13707]]\nhistoric yields at 65 percent of the market price. This new \ncatastrophic coverage is 50 percent of historic yield at 60 percent of \nthe market price.\n  That may not sound like a great deal of difference, but it is. It is \na substantially different program that is now being made available to \ndisaster victims.\n  I know that one reason for the change and one reason for the adoption \nof the new Crop Insurance Program was to provide a predictable level of \nbenefit when an agriculture disaster struck, and if farmers were not \nsatisfied that that was enough, they would be encouraged thereby to buy \nadditional coverage. They would buy up to another level of protection \non their own. But a lot of farmers have not done that, for varying \nreasons. Some misunderstood the benefit package that catastrophic \ninsurance provided; some were, frankly, convinced that the additional \ninsurance was too expensive for what they would probably get from it as \nbenefits; and there may have been other reasons. There has always been \na question about how the yields are calculated and whether the yields \nwere too high or too low, whether they were individual yields or \ncountywide basis yields. There have been a lot of problems with crop \ninsurance, and everybody knows that.\n  I raise this issue now, and I know it will be debated later by those \nwho are trying to strike this money from the bill, so Senators will be \non notice that we are probably going to have to vote on this amendment. \nUnlike other disasters that have been occasioned by flood or bad \nweather, this is a disaster that actually resulted in farmers going out \nand spending money to try to prevent it on their own, trying to apply \nwhat they hoped would be new chemicals that were promised to work and \ndid not or did not work well enough to justify the enormous expenses \nthat farmers went to to protect themselves.\n  Here they were. It was just weeks away from these bolls ripening and \nproducing the cotton for harvest when they noticed that these bolls \nwere being infested with bud worms and army worms and other pests.\n  One part of the story is good news, and that is that in many parts of \nour State, the delta region particularly, the cotton had gotten to the \nstage of development where it was not affected by the worms, and so we \nare not talking about every area of our State being equally devastated \nby this problem. But we do have many areas of our State where there are \ntotal losses and many areas where the yields are not nearly what they \nwere expected to be. It is disheartening and it truly is a disaster of \nenormous proportions. So I hope the Senators who are resisting this \neffort to provide additional assistance will reconsider.\n  The amount of money in the bill for this purpose is about $40 \nmillion, and Senator Kerrey's amendment will strike that money. We hope \nthat the Senate will vote against it.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to put in the \nRecord some additional supporting documentation on this, specifically \nan article that I talked about that was in the paper this weekend which \nmore clearly describes the seriousness of the situation and the \nenormous losses that are occurring in Mississippi and elsewhere as a \nresult of this cotton crop disaster.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Clarion-Ledger, Sept. 17, 1995]\n\n                Growers Pick Tough Year for More Cotton\n\n       Starkville.--Cotton yields will not be what many growers \n     dreamed of when they increased Mississippi's crop by 100,000 \n     acres to take advantage of stronger prices.\n       Higher than normal insect pressure and excessive heat have \n     taken their toll.\n       ``Preliminary yields do not look good,'' said Will McCarty, \n     extension cotton specialist at Mississippi State University.\n       The Sept. 1 crop report from the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture brought bleak news on the expectations for \n     Mississippi's crop.\n       ``The September report estimates 480,000 fewer bales of \n     cotton for Mississippi than the August report predicted,'' \n     McCarty said. ``The pounds per acre expectation dropped 158 \n     pounds. I can't remember the crop reporting service ever \n     dropping us that much in one month.''\n       The cotton specialist said the news could get worse as the \n     season finishes.\n       ``There is no doubt that the severe, continuous heat in \n     July, August and early September has taken a heavy toll on \n     the crop,'' McCarty said.\n       Blake Layton, extension entomologist at MSU, said the state \n     had faced the risk of catastrophic tobacco budworm numbers \n     for several years because of high levels of insecticide \n     resistance.\n       ``The extremely high numbers in 1995 turned that risk into \n     reality,'' Layton said. ``This risk will exist again next \n     year because we still will have problems with insecticide \n     resistance. Severe winter temperatures will help reduce the \n     danger.''\n       The entomologist said because of the cyclic nature of these \n     insects next year hopefully will be less severe.\n       ``We seldom have two back-to-back years of insect \n     populations at these levels of a pest like this,'' he said.\n       Layton said natural predators and parasites increase with \n     high numbers of an insect and help knock the numbers back \n     down. He said the damage to the 1995 crop is done. Growers \n     are no longer applying insecticides as the tobacco budworms \n     prepare to overwinter in the ground.\n       In Forest County, where cotton is a new crop, growers are \n     anxious to harvest and see the bottom line.\n       ``We're one of the few counties that haven't had tobacco \n     budworm problems, but we've had everything else--bollworms, \n     beet armyworms, yellow-striped armyworms and even loopers,'' \n     said Lee Taylor, Forest County agricultural agent. ``Last \n     fall's eradication efforts helped keep boll weevils from \n     becoming a factor this year.''\n       Taylor said growers turned to cotton as marketing of \n     soybeans and corn became less attractive. He said 1995 has \n     been a good year for cotton.\n       Otis Davis, Madison County agent, said growers began \n     harvesting cotton slightly earlier because of the dry \n     conditions. The drought is causing lighter seeds and smaller \n     bolls.\n       ``Insects were a tremendous expense to growers throughout \n     Madison County,'' Davis said. ``Cotton prices probably will \n     entice growers to return to cotton again next year.''\n       Growers throughout the southeast continue to await word on \n     disaster assistance from the federal and state governments as \n     a result of tobacco budworm damage.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month I introduced a bill that would \ngive the FAA independent status. As a matter of fact, when I introduced \nit, I read a speech as if I were giving it. It was really a speech that \nwas given 20 years ago by Barry Goldwater, and Barry Goldwater's speech \nwas a lengthy one, one that outlined the problems in 1975 that had \noccurred since the FAA had gone under the Department of Transportation \nback in 1967. He talked about the procurement problems and the \npersonnel problems that are very unique to the FAA.\n  Oddly enough, it was 20 years ago that Barry Goldwater made that \nspeech, and I talked to him the other day and he said, ``I hope we will \nbe able to do it now.''\n  I am talking about a life-and-death issue as a commercial pilot, I \nguess the last active commercial pilot in Congress. I have experienced \nhaving our lives in the hands of those controllers down there, and it \nis very significant that we do give them the independent status that \nBarry Goldwater was seeking back in 1975.\n  I really believe if we could do that, we could effect enough savings \nto actually prevent having to raise fees and having to raise taxes as \nis being considered right now in another bill, and as also is being \nsuggested by the President.\n  On August 9, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee made a \nstatement in the Chamber, and he said, ``The FAA tells us if they could \nhave this kind of operational flexibility''--now we are talking about \nindependent status, free from the bureaucracy of the DOT, free from the \nprocurement guidelines and the personnel guidelines--``they believe \nthey could cut as much as 20 percent out of the procurement budget'' \nfrom what they are spending today.\n  Now, this is significant because that happens to be approximately the \namount that historically has been contributed to the FAA for operations \nfrom the general revenues. And I suggest to you that my bill does not \ngive \n\n[[Page S 13708]]\nthe FAA the power to increase fees indiscriminately. I suggest, if we \ndo that such as is suggested in the McCain bill, instead of \nstreamlining their bureaucracy, they would merely raise fees.\n  I will read from the McCain bill the portion I am talking about. It \nsays, ``to establish a program of incentive-based fees for services to \nimprove the air traffic management system performance and to establish \nappropriate levels of cost accountability for air traffic management \nservices provided by the FAA.''\n  So, Mr. President, I have a lot of respect for Mr. Hinson, David \nHinson, who is the Administrator of the FAA. I think he is one of the \nfew real good appointments that this President has made. And I think \nthat if anyone could streamline his bureaucracy, it would be David \nHinson. But I suggest to you that the words that I recall that Ronald \nReagan made way back in 1965 when he said, ``There is nothing closer to \nimmortality on the face of this Earth than a Government program once \ndevised,'' that is exactly what we are faced with now. A bureaucracy \nnever, as long as it has the ability to raise funds, is going to \nstreamline their operation.\n  So I hope that we will be able to consider my bill very seriously. \nAnd I suggest there are about several million pilots out there that are \nconcerned about this also. I think it would be very difficult to go out \nright now and tell the pilots, who are paying an average of about \n$2,320 in various costs each year--for a small four-passenger airplane \nin addition to that, they are paying the gas tax--to go out and tell \nthese pilots that in 1990 we raised your gas tax and we raised it again \nin 1993, and now we are going to start raising your fees.\n  So, Mr. President, this can be done without increasing fees and \ntaxes. My bill will do that. I am going to be urging the passage of \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13707-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      ars facility at el reno, ok\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern with the \nSenate committee's designation of the primary ARS laboratory at El \nReno, OK, as a ``worksite.'' Upon a thorough evaluation of the Fort \nReno facility, it remains clear that this primary station remains an \nimportant and valuable resource for the agricultural community of the \nMidwest.\n  Fort Reno's 7,000 contiguous acres, numerous existing structures, \nincluding buildings and fences and valuable on-site personnel \nresources, make it a unique asset and an ideal location to direct and \nadminister research.\n  A large amount of work at Fort Reno is dedicated to closing the \nforage gaps in livestock production systems common to the Great Plains \nStates by experimenting in forage alternatives to native pasture and \nwinter wheat pasture.\n  Fort Reno's regional value is visible in their cooperative efforts \nwith ARS stations in Booneville, AR, and Bushland, TX, to solve the \nproblems caused by cattle raised on fescue pastures in the eastern-\nthird of the United States. Fort Reno's research on the resistance of \ntropical cattle breeds of fescue fungus problems continues to hold \nvaluable promise.\n  In addition, Fort Reno many years ago established watershed research \nlocations on several pastures to collect runoff and evaluate the \nenvironmental impact of agricultural waste, chemicals, and sediment \ngenerated by various grazing systems. Current plans call for an \nevaluation of this long-term data and an expansion of the program to \nlarger, system-size watersheds. This information will be very valuable \nas non-point source pollution reduction goals are expanded in the Clean \nWater Act reauthorization.\n  As a primary research facility, these are just several examples of \nprogress being made at Fort Reno and a demonstration of the facility's \ncontinuing contributions to the agricultural community of the Midwest.\n  I know the committee is aware that the House of Representatives \nmaintains full funding for the ARS station at Fort Reno in their fiscal \nyear 1996 Agriculture appropriations bill. In light of the important \nresearch and existing nature of the Fort Reno site, I continue to \nstrongly support full funding for primary research at Fort Reno.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Senator Nickles, I am aware of your strong interest in \nthe ARS facility at El Reno, OK, and share your support for the \nagricultural research conducted there.\n  The valuable work being conducted at the Fort Reno's facility is \nindeed unique and I recognize the importance of continuing research at \nthe site.

In \nconnection with that, I propose the following:\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the Senate \nresume consideration of the excepted committee amendment regarding \nchickens, and there be 2 hours to be equally divided between Senators \nBoxer and Cochran or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate Energy Committee \nwill be meeting their reconciliation targets by debating a proposal \noffered by the Chair which includes, among other things, something most \npeople have not heard much about. It is called the sale of the PMA's. \nAlmost nobody knows what that means--the sale of SWAPA or WAPA or the \nPMA's.\n  Well, there are a lot of ideas ricocheting around the Chambers of the \nHouse and the Senate these days. Many are labeled ``reform,'' \n``change,'' ``new,'' ``bright.'' The fact is some of these ideas are \nold ideas dressed in new clothes that have been bad for years. This is \none of them. The notion that we should sell the power marketing \nagencies in order to raise some short-term dollars in the short run and \nlose dollars every year thereafter makes no sense at all. \n\n[[Page S 13709]]\n\n  Let me describe for people who do not have any idea what this means \nwhat the consequences are and what PMA's are. In my State of North \nDakota, some 40 years ago, they decided to try to harness the Missouri \nRiver because it was causing a lot of problems. Spring flooding would \ncome and the old Missouri would snake out in a dozen different \ndirections and cause enormous flooding all the way down to Kansas City \nand elsewhere, and so they decided we needed to harness the Missouri \nRiver. So we built a series of dams under the Pick Sloan plan. One of \nthe dams was built in North Dakota called the Garrison Dam. It dammed \nup a half million acres of water behind it. Communities that used to \nexist are now under water and have been for years. It created a dam in \norder to prevent flooding, and one of the benefits of creating that dam \nis that they put in turbines and the water runs through those turbines \nand generates electricity. The promise was that if you in North Dakota \nwill be willing to play host to a flood that comes and stays forever, \nso that downstream they can play softball in the evening, light the \ncity park and not worry about flooding--if you will play host to a \nflood that comes and stays forever on a half a million acres in order \nto help folks downstream, we will give you some benefits. One of these \nbenefits is that you will be able to generate low-cost regional \nelectricity and send it around in a way that will benefit folks in the \nregion who are using electricity.\n  So our people said, ``Well, that sounds like something we would be \nwilling to do,'' and we did. The Pick Sloan program went forward and \nthe dam was built and the flood was created and we generate \nelectricity. That promise of low-cost electricity for our region is a \npromise that has been kept over the years.\n  Now, the Garrison Dam that generates that electricity with all the \nturbines and the water running through that is owned by the public. It \nis owned by the Government. And so are the transmission lines and the \ndam through which that electricity flows in order to provide benefits \nto people who are using their electricity on farms, in cities, in \nbusinesses. Those facilities, the dam and the transmission lines, are \nowned by the Government. It is a public facility owned by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In our region of the county, it is called WAPA, Western Area Power \nAdministration. It is the way we take public power generated from the \ndam and distribute it regionally for the benefit of the people in our \nregion because we promised them if they would accept a flood that came \nand stayed, we would give them some low-cost electricity as part of the \nbenefit, part of the payment.\n  Well, some years ago, there was a plan that was developed to cut \nGovernment waste--some of you remember it--called the Grace Commission. \nPeter Grace headed the Grace Commission. It had a lot of good ideas. In \nfact, about two-thirds of the ideas in the Grace report were eventually \nadopted--a lot of good ideas, but like anything else that has a menu of \nideas, some were genius and some were dumb.\n  One of the dumb ideas, in my judgment--using a pejorative term--in \nthe Grace report was to sell our dams that generate hydroelectric \npower.\n  All the way back to the Grace report, we had this goofy notion that \nif we would sell the dams so that those who would buy these dams and \nthe hydroelectric facilities could reprice the electricity to market \nrate, that would surely be a good thing for the Government. But, of \ncourse, that did not get much traction throughout the 1980's.\n  Some of the Grace report did because some of it made sense and some \nof it just did not make any sense at all. This was part that did not \nmake any sense, so it never got done. However, in recent years, there \nwere calls to sell the power marketing agencies--Southwest, SWAPA, \nWAPA, three of them, four of them actually, one of which is being \nsold--sell the power marketing agencies.\n  Well, it comes from people who, I suppose, have two motives now. One \nis they do not think the public ought to own anything--get it in \nprivate hands so it can be priced at whatever the highest price is. \nThat is the philosophy of some. And the second philosophy by some is \nlet us solve the budget problem today by selling assets.\n  In order to accomplish that philosophical purpose, they had to change \nthe rules this year--the first year ever in which they changed the \nrules--to allow you to sell an asset and show a reduced deficit.\n  Would it not be interesting to have a family budget like that? You \nsay, well, we will meet our yearly expenses by selling the car, then \nthe house, then the yard.\n  Well, we had a rule against that in Congress, for good reason, \nbecause people who thought much about it understood what everybody \nknows: you do not solve your fiscal problems by selling your assets. At \nleast you do not solve your operating budget deficit problems by \nselling your assets.\n  But this year, it is different. This year, the majority party says \nour budget is going to change. We are going to change that little old \nrule so you can sell assets and therefore show a lower operating budget \ndeficit.\n  Well, there is one inevitable truth about selling the power marketing \nagencies. And that is this: Every single year they bring money into the \nFederal Government from the sale of this electricity. Every single year \nwe get streams of hundreds of millions of dollars from the sale of this \nelectricity from the hydroelectric facilities.\n  Now, if you sell them, what would be the budget impact? The budget \nimpact in the first couple years would be--you would get the money for \nthe sale, would you not? So you show some more money coming in because \nyou sold them. Then what happens every year after that? Every single \nyear after that you have a loss. The Federal Government would not be \ngetting the money it used to get and not getting the money that it \nexpected to get.\n  This is so symbolic of the way fiscal policy exists around here. Sell \nan asset, use it to say you are going to deal with an operating budget \ndeficit. Sell an asset and get some money now despite the fact that in \nthe long term by selling the power marketing agencies you lose money. \nYou lose money every single year in the long term because the income \nstream that used to come in will no longer come in.\n  Now, we are going to meet on Wednesday in the Energy Committee to \ndeal with this reconciliation requirement. And you know, I am just not \nmoderate on the question of whether we should sell the power marketing \nagencies. The answer is no; under no condition should we sell the power \nmarketing agencies.\n  Some say, let us let the customers buy them on a preferential basis. \nThe power marketing agencies are part of a long-term promise that \nphilosophically ought not be abridged or violated. We ought not, for \nshort-term purposes, construct a mechanism here in budgetary policy \nthat is just pound-foolish in every respect--that will bring some money \nin in the short term by doing something that is fundamentally unsound \nand philosophically wrong and that in the long term will increase the \nFederal deficit.\n  This is to me both philosophically important, because I believe there \nare certain public principles involved in the public ownership of these \nassets, and it is also important from a fiscal policy standpoint. And \nwhen we meet on Wednesday, I intend to be one of those on the Energy \nCommittee that says, I do not support and will not support the sale of \nthe power marketing agencies.\n  There are a lot of good ideas running around this Chamber. I embrace \nmany, support many, and stand to speak for many. But when I see an old \nidea masquerading as a new idea, that is in fact a bad idea for this \ncountry, it is time to blow the whistle and say, ``Enough; no more.'' I \ndo not know where the votes are on Wednesday, but I hope we can defeat \nthis.\n  I say to those who wonder what the consequences might be, well, in my \nState, North Dakota--a very small State, 640,000 people--if they sell \nthe power marketing agencies and have people bid on them so we get some \nshort-term money in, what will happen is we will have short-term money \nin the front end and it will cost us higher budget deficits in the long \nterm, and about 200,000 North Dakotans will pay higher electric rates.\n  It makes no sense at all. It violates the promise that exists as a \nresult of the construction of these facilities. \n\n[[Page S 13710]]\nAnd in my judgment, this Congress would do well to decide to stand on \nprinciple and not entertain any longer the idea of selling the power \nmarketing agencies.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be a substantial amount of debate \nand discussion about this in the Energy Committee on Wednesday, and I \nhope that when the dust settles, we will find a way to defeat this \nproposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13708-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESTRUCTURING THE FARM PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me address one other quick item as \nlong as no one is seeking the floor. A group of us just had a press \nconference about an hour ago to introduce a piece of legislation that \ncalls for restructuring the Farm Program. That is not very important to \nmost people if you are not involved in farming or do not live in a \nrural county or do not live in a rural State. It may not matter to you \nwhat kind of a Farm Program this country has. But if you are a family \nfarmer trying to raise some kids and raise a crop and keep things \ntogether and make a decent living, the question of whether this country \nhas a Farm Program is critical to your survival.\n  We have two different approaches to the Farm Program these days: One \nembodied in the most recent budget that says, let us cut $14 billion \nout of the agricultural function, that says we should increase defense \nspending, build star wars, but we cannot afford a decent farm program; \nlet us cut $14 billion. The President, by contrast, said, let us cut $4 \nbillion.\n  Well, I accept that Agriculture should have some budget cuts and I \nsupported budget cuts in the past for them. They have taken more than \ntheir share in the past than they should have, but more is to come. But \nnot $14 billion, $4 billion to $4.2 billion the President suggested is \nin the range that makes some sense.\n  But what is interesting to me is that now that this budget \nrequirement is out there, one which I do not support by the way, we are \ndiscovering that the chairs of both committees in the House and the \nSenate in the agricultural area cannot write a farm plan. They cannot \nget a consensus on a farm plan. They cannot find 10 votes in the Senate \ncommittee for a farm plan apparently, because they paint themselves in \na corner with a $14 billion budget deficit reduction number in \nagriculture. You cannot write a decent farm plan with that.\n  Some say, well, we have a new approach called the freedom to farm \nbill. The freedom to farm bill, as my colleague, Tom Harkin, said, is \nthe ``welcome to welfare'' bill that disconnects in every single way an \nopportunity to have a long-term price support that is beneficial to \nfamily size farms.\n  I will not apologize for a minute to anybody for believing that \ninvesting in family farmers with a safety net that makes sense is \nworthwhile for this country. Nobody in this Chamber ever ought to stand \nup and claim to be pro-family if you are not pro-family farmer. Nobody \nunder any condition ought to talk about being pro-family unless they \nare willing to stand for the interests of maintaining a network of \nfamily farms in this country. That is where the nurturing and caring \nand sharing and the kind of development of family values in this \ncountry has always begun for 200 years and rolled across this country \nto our small towns and cities.\n  The fact is, it makes a difference in our future whether we have an \ninventory of agri-factories producing America's food or whether we have \nfamilies out there living on the land where the yard light is on at \nnight and sending kids to school and buying tractors in town. It makes \na difference the kind of agriculture we have.\n  Family farm-based agriculture is critically important to this \ncountry's future. I know a group of us introduced legislation today \nthat says you can create a better farm program and save money if you \nsimply disconnect from the giant agri-factories and decide to focus a \ntargeted price support on the family size farms.\n  People say, ``What is a family-size farm?'' I do not know the answer \nto that. We do not have a statistical definition of a family size farm. \nBut we do not have enough money anyway, so you try to layer in the best \nprice support you can for the first increment of production; and the \neffect of that is to provide the bulk of the benefits to family sized \noperations.\n  Now, we hope in the coming 3 or 4 weeks, in the time that is critical \nfor the future of the new 5-year farm bill, that we can find a critical \nmass between Republicans and Democrats, all of whom, hopefully, will \ncome together to get a network of family farms in this farm bill. And \nwe hope we can do that.\n  There are some in this Congress who are willing to wave the white \nflag of surrender and say, ``We give up. It cannot be done.'' What they \ndo is consign rural counties in this country to economic despair and \neconomic depression. My home county lost 20 percent of its population \nin the 1980's and 10 percent in the first half of the 1990's. It is \nshrinking like a prune. The current farm program does not work. And it \nis not going to help a thing by deciding to surrender and pass \nsomething called a freedom to farm act, which, as I said, is nothing \nmore than a welcome to welfare act.\n  There is a better way to do this. Senator Daschle, myself, Senator \nConrad, Senator Exon, Senator Harkin, and others introduced legislation \ntoday that we think puts us on the road, the right track, to deal with \nthis country's farm problems. I hope all Members of the Senate will be \nable to review it and consider it as we evaluate what direction this \ncountry takes with respect to farm policy in the coming 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I make the point that there is not a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13710-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13710-S13712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me again remind my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, the managers of the Agriculture appropriations bill \nare on the floor. They have been on the floor throughout the day.\n  There are Members here who have amendments who, for some reason, are \nholding back offering those amendments. Let me repeat what I tried to \nindicate this morning, that if we can complete action on the six \nremaining appropriations bills this week and by the 30th of next week, \nby next Saturday, a week from this coming Saturday, we would, I think, \nbe prepared to take the next week off, plus Columbus Day.\n  That is if we complete action on the appropriations. I do not mean \ncomplete the conference but complete action in the Senate Chamber so \nthat either will be ready for conference as soon as we return.\n  We are trying to avoid the so-called train wreck come October 1, \nwhich I think can be avoided fairly easily.\n  I know some of my colleagues are around but they just have not come \nto the floor. It is very difficult for the managers to proceed with the \nbill.\n  If we finish this bill, this will be No. 8 out of 13. Then we will \nmove to another appropriations bill, hopefully do three this week and \nthree next week. But the managers of the bill cannot move unless they \nhave the cooperation from Members.\n  Members sometimes are hard to move, but if you intend to offer an \namendment to this bill, I would say to my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, please cooperate. We are only trying to accommodate the \nrequests of many, many Senators the week of October 1. But we cannot \naccommodate those Senators unless we have the cooperation of all of our \ncolleagues. There will be a vote sometime this afternoon, about 5:30.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the distinguished leader would yield, I can say that \nwe are trying to reach an agreement on a vote at a time certain later \nthis afternoon, certainly not before 5:30. \n\n[[Page S 13711]]\n\n  There is an indication that we could have a debate and a vote on the \npromotion program amendment which would be offered by the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from Arkansas, but that vote could occur as late \nat 8 o'clock, we are told.\n  We are trying to work out an agreement on what our options are. We \nwould like to have a vote later this evening.\n  Mr. DOLE. Third reading would be one option. Can we go to third \nreading?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not think that is appropriate since we have \namendments where the yeas and nays have been ordered but we agreed that \nthe votes will not occur until tomorrow.\n  We have two amendments by Senator Brown from Colorado where the yeas \nand nays have already been ordered. We also have an agreement that has \nbeen entered into regarding an amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, where the vote will occur tomorrow afternoon \nafter we have completed action on the welfare bill.\n  So we have made progress. Senators have cooperated. We do have \noutstanding amendments, and we appreciate your suggestion that those \nSenators who do want to offer amendments come and offer them and talk \nabout them, and we will have a vote on one tonight and stack the rest \nof the votes for tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. In addition, if they have an amendment, it may be some of \nthe same Senators that had asked me about that first week in October. \nSo I will keep that in mind when they come around the next time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in relationship to the discussion, I \nthink Senator Bob Kerrey has an amendment that is supposed to be on the \nfloor at 5:30 to debate the amendment.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee has suggested that we \nvote on the committee amendment, but I am also told that the committee \namendment contains not only the disaster relief as proposed by the \nchairman, but also the provision that Senator Boxer objects to.\n  We could bifurcate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We would not want to vote on the one relating to the \npoultry issue that Senator Boxer is interested in, only that relating \nto the disaster assistance for cotton farmers.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Frankly, I think it is important we tell people we are \ngoing to start voting sometime after 5:15, that we start voting. I am \nhoping we can vote either on the Kerrey amendment or the committee \namendment.\n  Senator Bob Kerrey is supposed to be on the floor at 5:30. If he is, \nwe will work out an agreement. If he wants to vote right then, first, \nthat is fine. It is fine with the chairman. Then we will vote on that \npart of the committee amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We do not have to vote on both of them.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is right.\n  Mr. DOLE. Or we could vote first and then hear the amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. In any event, I hope we start voting here. Senator \nCochran and I have waited patiently here all day long with not some \ngrace, but, in any event, we have been here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto vitiate the yeas and nays on my amendment No. 2689.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2689, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I now will modify my amendment, provided \nthe amendment has been delivered to the desk, and ask that it be \nconsidered as an amendment to the bill, not the committee amendment as \npreviously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving right to object, I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will indicate that this does not \nrequire unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand the Chair. The Senator has the right to modify \nhis amendment without asking unanimous consent. I will not object.\n  The amendment (No. 2689), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``It is the Sense of the Senate that the current statute \n     establishing the Tobacco Marketing Assessment, which raises \n     revenues used solely for deficit reduction purposes and not \n     in any manner to offset the costs of the tobacco program, \n     should be amended to require that the current assessment be \n     set at a level sufficient to cover the administrative costs \n     of the tobacco program.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the Senator from \nColorado for his working with Members this evening in order to arrive \nat what we think is a reasonable conclusion to his desire. I think and \nhope that it will reach what he is attempting to reach without having a \nconfrontation. He has been very gentlemanly about it, and I do \nappreciate it. I hope that and believe that both sides will accept his \namendment now and that we can move on to other amendments.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to extend my thanks to both Senators \nfrom Kentucky; Senator Ford, who is here, and has been so helpful. I \nmight say that the Senator was expanding on the information that I got \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office, which was not clear, that the \ntobacco program has people who are paid for their grading and \ninspection already. I think that needs a clarification, and the Record \nshould clearly reflect it.\n  I think it is also appropriate to note the existence of a payment to \nreduce the deficit which has been made by the program. This amendment's \nclear policy is that this ought to be approved--no-cost-to-the-\nGovernment provision--that it makes it clear in drafting the new farm \nprogram, or revising the existing farm program, that both the deficit \nreduction effort, as well as the administrative costs, which my \namendment was concerned with, ought to all be completely paid for. I \nthink that this is very helpful in that regard.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 2689, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  So, the amendment (No. 2689), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending committee amendment so it \nmay be offered to the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2690\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds by the Department of Agriculture to \n activities that do not interfere with the primacy of State water law)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2690.\n       Insert at page 84, between line 2 and line 3:\n       Sec. 730. None of the funds available in this Act shall be \n     used for any action, including the development or assertion \n     of any position or recommendation by or on behalf of the \n     Forest Service, that directly or indirectly results in the \n     loss of or restriction on the diversion and use of water from \n     existing water supply facilities located on National Forest \n     lands by the owners of such facilities, or result in a \n     material increase in the cost of such yield to the owners of \n     the water supply; Provided: nothing in this section shall \n     preclude a mutual agreement between any agency of the \n     Department of Agriculture and a state or local governmental \n     entity or private entity or individual.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment has been improved by the \nhelpful suggestions of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  What it is meant to do is address a rather unusual occurrence that \nhappened several years ago; that is, water supplies, drinking water \nbeing delivered from reservoirs in the mountains of Colorado, being \ndelivered to the cities on the plains which crossed Federal ground.\n  The Forest Service at one point had suggested that literally the \ncities \n\n[[Page S 13712]]\nwould have to forfeit a third, a half, a tenth, some portion of their \nwater to be allowed to get a renewal of the existing permit to cross \nFederal ground. This was ironic because some of those permits predated \nthe existence of the Forest Service itself.\n  This approach was taken by the Forest Service, localized in Colorado, \nand not, at least at that point, in other States, thankfully, by other \ndepartments of the Federal Government. You can imagine this would cause \nenormous chaos. There is a law and body of case law that relates to \nthis and recognizes States rights in this area.\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, this phenomenon occurred where there \nwas no change whatsoever anticipated in the use of the water or the \nmeans of transiting the Federal ground at all. All of us understand \nthat there are important laws on the books that grant broad authority \nand grant new permits to either use or cross Federal ground. But this \nphenomenon had occurred at a point where they were talking about simply \nrenewing an existing permit with no change whatsoever. The policy \nliterally called into question then the water rights throughout almost \nall of the State.\n  As a matter of fact, if followed in other States, it could have \nendangered not only water rights throughout the entire West but \nproperty rights for States and citizens and municipalities throughout \nthe entire Nation because, of course, once one is allowed to extract or \nextort concessions based on renewal of an existing permit without any \nchanges, almost every city in the Nation has some vulnerability.\n  This, I think, makes the policy clear that that kind of extortion \nwill not take place.\n  I want to thank both the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas for their help in crafting this limitation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado for his amendment and for his successful negotiation of \nthe amendment with the administration. We are happy to recommend the \napproval of the amendment and hope the Senate will support it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just echo the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. The Senator from Colorado and \nseveral communities in Colorado have a very difficult problem in \nrenewing easements and rights-of-way on municipal water supplies which \ncross Federal lands. Those are up for renewal.\n  I happen to come down very strongly on the human needs side when \nissues like this arise. It is not that there are not other problems \nthat can and should be addressed in order to accommodate the future of \nthose lines for the benefit of both parties, and that is the reason I \npersonally favor and the administration favors the provision in this \namendment that as long as both parties voluntarily agree to changes \nwhich are beneficial to both, that is fine. But frankly, the Federal \nGovernment and Forest Service should not have the right to be arbitrary \nor capricious in renewing these rights-of-way which are critical to the \nvery existence of some of these communities.\n  The Senator from Colorado has my gratitude for offering it, and I am \nhappy that we were able to work out this language. We have no objection \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2690) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13710-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13712-S13713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MISLEADING ADS TO SENIOR CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, there have been a number of ads run on \ntelevision and newspapers regarding senior citizens programs in my \nState of South Dakota and, I understand, around the country. These ads \nare very misleading. They wrongly allege if current plans by the \nmajority in Congress are carried out, certain people will not be able \nto get care for Alzheimer's disease or nursing care or medical \ntreatment. These are scare tactics.\n  In my own case, I have taken great interest in senior citizens. In \nfact, my father, unfortunately, died of Alzheimer's disease. I have an \nAlzheimer's foundation. I am active on the board of the Alzheimer's \nassociation nationally and in my State. I have been a champion of \nsenior citizens. I am very concerned about their welfare. That is why I \nwas concerned greatly when Medicare's trustees--a majority being \nmembers of President Clinton's own cabinet--declared earlier this year \nthat Medicare would go bankrupt unless we do something about it--we who \nhold responsibility.\n  A general plan to protect and preserve Medicare has been put forth by \nthose courageous enough to be involved with it. I serve as a member of \nthe Finance Committee, and I have been a part of the development of \nthis plan. Our plan would not cut Medicare, but would slow its rate of \nincrease from about 10 percent a year, which is well above inflation, \nto about what President Clinton once called for 2 years ago, about 6 \npercent, twice the inflation rate.\n  Now, Mr. President, it seems strange to me that all these baseless \nads imply--and they list me by name in my State--that Senators who are \ntrying to save Medicare are somehow forgetting senior citizens and \npeople with Alzheimer's disease. I resent that deeply. As one who had a \nfather die of Alzheimer's disease, I will not take a back seat to \nanyone regarding the care of senior citizens. I also do not intend to \nsit idly by and let Medicare go bankrupt. Nor will I allow our fiscal \nhouse be dismantled in order to protect well-intentioned, but wasteful \nor inefficient Government programs. We cannot go around promising \neverybody everything.\n  We have a huge deficit that threatens our children's future. We also \nhave a Medicare system its trustees' have predicted will go broke if we \ndo not do something about it. We can save Medicare by reforming \nMedicare. We can save Medicare by finding greater efficiencies, and \neliminating waste, fraud and abuse. It means we have to use new \ntelecommunication methods and other medical technologies to lower \ncosts. It means we have to encourage greater choice in the kinds of \nmedical services available to seniors, which would also lower costs. We \ncan do all these things and more without cutting Medicare, but by \nslowing its growth rate in order for Medicare to be there for seniors \nwell into the next century. And that is very appropriate.\n  Now, we should take a look at who is running these ads, at least in \nmy State and maybe around the country. Who is disseminating this false \ninformation?\n  First of all, one of the sets of ads is being funded by the American \nFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Of course, one \nwouldn't know that by listening or reading the ads, because the ads are \nbeing run under a different name, the so-called Save America's Families \nCoalition. Another is run by the so-called American Health Care \nAssociation. I think that there should be truth in advertising here. \nWho are really behind these ads and what is there agenda?\n  Let me say that I know there are many sides to American politics. \nHowever, more and more, ads are being run on television and the radio \nand in the newspapers by front groups that try to hide the true source. \nIt is hard to know by the disclaimer exactly who is behind these ads.\n  And so, Mr. President, I would say as one who comes from a family who \nhas seen the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease firsthand that I am very, \nvery concerned. I am concerned about our Nation's seniors. I have \nfought for our \n\n[[Page S 13713]]\nseniors from the very first day I took office as a U.S. Congressman. \nAnd I will continue to fight for them as a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. My resolve is stronger than ever. Our first priority for \nseniors is simple: to preserve and protect Medicare. I have just come \nfrom a meeting working on a comprehensive plan to save Medicare. I \nwould hope that instead of running Medi-``scare'' ads, these liberal \nspecial interest groups would offer real solutions to what President \nClinton and every Member of Congress believes is a very severe problem. \nI would like to see their ideas, their plans specifically.\n  All of us will have to stand on the Senate floor soon and vote up or \ndown on these issues within the next few weeks. At that time, our views \nand our votes will be known. Before that occurs, I hope all those \nbehind the current ad campaigns will step forward and join in a \nconstructive effort to save Medicare. This issue is too important for \nour seniors, and they deserve a constructive dialogue and debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator from South Dakota withhold \nthat motion?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask unanimous consent that I might proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13712-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand where my friend from South \nDakota comes from. But there is part A and part B under Medicare. Part \nA, we talk about the trustees and their reports. They gave us two \nreports. One is a $136 billion surplus today in part A; but in 7 years \nit will be down to minus $6 billion. Under part B, there is $17 billion \nin surplus today; and 7 years from now it will be $25 billion in \nsurplus.\n  The President has put out that he would want $89 billion in part A to \nmake Medicare solvent for 10 years, and he has asked for a little bit \nmore to make Medicare solvent. We agree with the problems of solvency. \nThe President has three members on the board of trustees, or the \ncommission, that reports to all of us annually. And so we have given a \nproposal. We do not want to take $270 billion out over 7 years. We do \nnot want to cut another $240 billion out of Medicaid.\n  So when you look at that, the reduction in the budget comes out of \nhealth care--comes out of health care. And something, in my opinion, \nhas to be wrong when we are looking at children to be hurt, we are \nlooking at the elderly to be hurt. And yet the headline in the \nNashville Tennessean is, ``The GOP Plan Has Coddled the Rich and Socked \nIt to the Poor.'' That is big 2-inch headlines across the banner of \nthat newspaper.\n  So when you say we have not given a program, it is out there. It is \nout there. And we are not scaring our old folks. We are trying to \nprotect them. So, a little bit--a little bit is a whole lot better than \ntrying to reach a tax cut. $240 billion is a figure we all want to \nremember--$245 billion. That is a tax cut. When you cut the expenditure \nof Government to balance the budget, that is one thing. And we are all \nfor that. I am for it. But then you say you want to give a tax cut, \nthat means you have got to cut more.\n  So the problem now is not balancing the budget; the problem now is \n$245 billion that will be a tax cut. If we can get around to not using \nthat or not giving it to the ultrarich, I think the balanced budget and \nthe programs would go through very smoothly.\n  There is no big argument about making Medicare solvent, no argument \nat all, but it is giving a $245 billion tax cut to the most wealthy in \nthis country while you take a big hunk out of Medicaid.\n  And I see the Alzheimer's patients under Medicaid, I see the \nAlzheimer's patients under Medicare. There are a lot of people in this \nChamber that probably can use Medicare. I am of that age, others of \nthat age. But the problem results in a $245 billion tax cut. If we did \nnot have that, we would not have the problem. The ads would not be \nrunning. We would already have the appropriations bills out. We would \nbe waiting for the conference to come back. We probably could meet our \ndeadline of October 1 for the budget.\n  I understand my time is probably up, and I thank the Chair for his \nfriendly greetings.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13713-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13713-S13715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank \nthe managers of the bill for the increase that they have given to the \nWIC Program. I think the WIC Program is an outstanding program, and I \nthink it is worthwhile. Its value has been evidenced by the fact that \nthe distinguished managers of the bill have given it a very nice \nincrease for the upcoming year.\n  So I want to thank the senior Senator from Mississippi and the senior \nSenator from Arkansas for the additions to the WIC Program which they \nprovided in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator please \nwithhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his generous comments and his support for the provisions of \nthe bill which he described. It is very difficult in this time of \ndiminishing access to funds under our allocation and budget resolution \nto keep this caseload up to the existing level. It has been done with \nthe full cooperation of the other members of the subcommittee.\n  We recognize that it is an important program. It is a program that \nsaves money, I think, in terms of health care costs and learning \ndeficiencies that would occur were it not for the proper nutrition at \nthese ages.\n  So I appreciate very much the Senator noticing the hard work that was \nput in on this subject.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what the WIC Program is, for those who do \nnot know, it is a nutrition program, as the distinguished senior \nSenator from Mississippi said, a nutrition program for women, infants, \nand children.\n  Furthermore, invariably, at least in my State, it takes place in a \nsetting where you might say it is one-stop shopping, where a mother can \ncome and her infant child will be cared for and, in addition, can get \nsome nutrition advice from experts.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Mississippi said, this is really \nproven out to be a money saver in the long run. If we can keep these \ninfants healthy and get them off to a good start, savings to the Nation \nin the form of medical care are very, very significant in the long run.\n  So I am happy this was able to be worked out the way it was.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we were successful in getting Senators to \ncooperate in identifying the amendments that remain to be offered to \nthis bill. We are prepared now to seek unanimous consent to limit the \namendments on the bill to those which we will read. These have been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \n\n\n[[Page S 13714]]\nremaining amendments in order to H.R. 1976, other than the pending \namendments; that they be offered in the first or second-degree; if a \ncommittee amendment still remains to be amended, any first-degree \namendment be subject to relevant second degrees:\n  A Stevens budget for Assistant Secretary of Natural Resources \namendment; a managers' package; two Cochran relevant amendments; a \nMcCain funding for travel colleges; Domenici on scoring; Abraham on \nadvisory committees; Senator Bingaman requiring USDA energy savings \ninitiatives; Senators Boxer and Feinstein on chickens, fresh and frozen \nregulations; Senator Bradley, two relevant amendments; Senator Bryan, \none to eliminate the Market Promotion Program and three relevant \namendments; Senator Bumpers, two relevant amendments; Senator Byrd, \nrelevant amendment; Senator Conrad, an amendment to establish a United \nStates-Canadian review on water in North Dakota, ARS potato research \nlaboratory and a relevant amendment; Senator Daschle, two relevant \namendments; Senator Dodd, two relevant amendments; Senator Dorgan, a \nUnited States-Canadian study on Devil's Lake; Senator Feingold, a rural \ndevelopment amendment and one on research grants; Senator Harkin, food \nstamps amendment; Senator Kerrey, cotton disaster assistance funds \namendment; Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, prohibit Market Promotion \nProgram, mink export amendment, and a relevant amendment; Senator Kohl, \ntwo relevant amendments plus an amendment on rural development grants; \nSenator Lautenberg, two relevant amendments; Senator Leahy, an \namendment to restore livestock feed assistance and an alternative \ndevelopment amendment; Senator Levin, Michigan special research grant \namendment and a relevant amendment; Senator Reid, sugar program \namendment and two relevant amendments.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have just been advised that Senator \nFord would like to be added as having one relevant amendment. \nOtherwise, we have no objection to the list as read by the chairman.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask that my UC be amended, as pointed \nout by the Senator from Arkansas, and to add a Gorton relevant \namendment, plus a Gregg relevant amendment and, as modified, I so ask \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nagreement, as modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager on the \npart of the minority for his cooperation and all Senators for \ncooperating to identify these amendments.\n  Let me say now that if we called for the regular order, which I am \nprepared to do, as I understand it, the amendment of the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, which was offered earlier in the day by \nSenator Daschle on his behalf, would be the pending business. \nParliamentary inquiry. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is No. 2688 offered by \nthe Senator from Colorado to the committee amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is the amendment on the peanut subsidy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Just to refresh my own understanding of this, what was \nthe question and answer of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nas to what the regular order was?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2686, the amendment offered by \nthe Democratic leader on behalf of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I call for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2686\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2686 is the pending question.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have not yielded the floor. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the purpose of coming to this amendment \nin the regular order is that this amendment was the first offered today \nby the distinguished Democratic leader on behalf of the Senator from \nNebraska and the Senator from Wisconsin, with the understanding that it \nwould be taken up later in the day. It is later in the day. We have \ntold Senators that we would not have a vote on this bill until 5:30. We \nnow have reached that point and beyond. I have spoken against the \nKerrey amendment, and for the committee amendment, which is the subject \nof the Kerrey amendment.\n  The Kerrey amendment seeks to strike the committee amendment which \ncontains funds--$41 million--for disaster assistance for cotton \nproducers, which have been hard hit this year by a massive infestation \nof beet army worms, tobacco budworms, and unusually dry weather, which \nhas exacerbated a very difficult situation throughout the South and \nSouthwest.\n  I notice that the Senator from Nebraska has come to the floor now to \nspeak to the amendment. I am prepared to yield the floor and permit \nwhatever time he may need to discuss his amendment. I hope that we can \nthen vote on his amendment, or a motion to table his amendment. I am \nprepared to move to table his amendment and ask for the yeas and nays, \nbut I am not going to do that if he wants to speak to that amendment \nnow.\n  Before I yield for that purpose, I wonder if we can agree on a time \ncertain, for the benefit of all Senators, on a motion to table the \nKerrey amendment.\n  I am hopeful that the Senator could agree to take no more than 10 or \n15 minutes. I think I spoke for about 10 minutes. Most Senators know \nwhat this is all about. If additional time is needed, I am happy to \nconsider that, along with the interests of other Senators. I know \nSenators have made plans for other activities tonight. They thought \nthey were going to vote at 5:30. I wonder if the Senator can tell us \nwhat his needs would be in terms of time to debate this amendment. I \nwill be happy to yield to the Senator to respond, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, there are others who have told me they want to speak. I \njust arrived here. I am not sure how many others have actually come to \nspeak in favor of this amendment. I personally can get by easily with \n10 or 15 minutes. I wonder if the Senator would mind making it 30 \nminutes, and I will be prepared to yield it back if nobody else shows \nup. It may be necessary at this point, since some Members have been \nwaiting and know what time the vote was going to be scheduled, to give \nthem time to get here. As far as the amount of time I require \npersonally to speak on this amendment, 10 or 15 minutes would be all I \nwould need.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator. Let me see if this is suitable to \nSenators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we vote on or in relation to the Kerrey \namendment at 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Is the time to be divided in the usual fashion? Does the Senator wish \nto specify a division of time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Under the usual form, and that no other amendment would \nbe in order to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a fairly straightforward \namendment. I must say I offer it with some reluctance. The \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi and the distinguished ranking \nmember from Arkansas have done an excellent job with the agriculture \nappropriations bill and in staying open to suggestions and staying open \nto preferences of individual Members.\n  However, this $41 million appropriation for cotton really does put us \non a slippery slope, Mr. President. Last year, when we set in motion \nthe enhanced crop insurance program, the promise was that crop \ninsurance was to be to replace ad hoc disaster programs. That was the \npromise. If we begin today, less than a year later from putting that \nprogram into place, saying, well, here is a case we can make, there is \nno question--and I do not argue with the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi that the disaster and tragedy affecting cotton producers is \nmeritorious. However, we said that instead of \n\n[[Page S 13715]]\nad hoc disaster, we were going to do crop insurance.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that if we begin with cotton, there \nwill be amendments offered to do soybeans or corn or rice, or all sorts \nof things. We will get appeals, one after another. And those of us who \nhave heard those appeals thus far have been able to say, no, I would \nlike to go to the floor and offer an amendment on your behalf, I \nunderstand the disaster is serious; however, we are using crop \ninsurance.\n  We need to improve that program. It is not perfect. We nonetheless \nneed to work with that program, rather than, at least for people like \nme, breaking a promise to taxpayers that we would not have both an ad \nhoc disaster payment and crop insurance.\n  The details of the reallocation, Mr. President, are as follows: $35 \nmillion of the $41 million would go into a rural community advancement \nprogram, which includes grants and loans for water and sewer \nimprovements, rental housing, and other important rural development \nprograms. The Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Mississippi \nhave both spoken eloquently on the rather severe cuts we have in rural \ndevelopment in this bill. It is unavoidable. We can avoid a piece of \nthat by enacting this amendment.\n  Second, $4.5 million goes into the rural development loan fund \nintermediary lending program--an extremely successful program, one that \nhas bipartisan support, Mr. President--that promotes rural economic \ndevelopment by making investment capital available, via a locally based \nnonprofit intermediary, to rural businesses that typically cannot \nobtain financing from conventional sources.\n  Lastly, $1.5 million goes into rural technology and cooperative \ndevelopment grant programs, which provide funding to public bodies and \nnonprofit organizations to establish rural technology and cooperative \ndeveloping networks nationwide to help improve economic conditions in \nrural America.\n  Again, the amendment rests upon a belief that we should either do \ncrop insurance or ad hoc disaster. Again, I do not challenge the \nmeritorious nature of the cotton disaster. But I do believe, Mr. \nPresident, that it would be a terrible mistake for us to move away from \ncrop insurance, back into this sort of dual thing where we say, well, \nif crop insurance does not work, we will do ad hoc disaster on top of \nthat, and the next thing you know, taxpayers are paying for both. Next \nwill be blueberries and potatoes and everything else that comes in. \nThey will say, ``I see that in 1995 you took care of cotton; can you \ntake care of us as well?\"\n  I hope colleagues understand that I do not offer this amendment as a \nconsequence of radical disagreement or objection to what the chairman \nand ranking member are doing. They have done an exceptional job of \nputting this bill together. I offer it as a consequence of believing \nvery strongly that our policy ought to continue with crop insurance. If \nit is demonstrable that crop insurance does not work--and there are \nmany problems still with that--and it is demonstrable that it does not \nwork, we should abandon the crop insurance program and go back to year \nin and year out politically deciding in Congress how it is that we are \ngoing to allocate resources for the disaster program.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my stirring remarks on this particular \namendment. I told the Senator from Mississippi I was going to take 10 \nor 15 minutes. I have not done that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13713-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13715-S13716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will test the patience of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi by talking on a subject that is very much related to \nthis and that is the proposal that was made last Friday on Medicare by \nthe Republican leadership in the House of Representatives.\n  I read over the weekend the details that were available--not all \ndetails were available. I make the comments because I know on our side \nin the Senate Finance Committee they are deliberating, as well, trying \nto discover how to come up with $270 billion.\n  Allow me to say two things about this. One, there are many on this \nside, many Democrats on this side, that would rush immediately to \nembrace a proposal to eliminate the deficit by the year 2002 if we \ncould eliminate the enthusiasm for a tax cut that still is on the \ntable.\n  I understand that enthusiasm is there. I did not hear an awful lot of \npeople in the Senate, at least when they were campaigning for \nreelection, campaign on a promise to put those portions of the Contract \nWith America in our budget reconciliation.\n  The choice is not between bigger Government and smaller Government. \nWe would still have a balanced budget by the year 2002, all with cuts \nin spending. We would still have a proposal that would not have any tax \nincreases in it.\n  I think we could take an awful lot and we could get a bipartisan \nagreement and still have a very tough budget reconciliation if that \nwere acceptable to my colleagues on the Republican side.\n  Much more difficult, and it gets difficult on this side, is that we \nhave in place, Mr. President, with our entitlement programs, growth in \nthose programs that continue to erode our entire budget.\n  Imagine a business out there that has $1,000 or $100,000 or $1 \nmillion or $10 million or $100 million worth of sales with 67 percent \nof their sales being eaten up in costs related to mandated spending. \nThat is, noncontrollable spending.\n  In this case, most of the retirement and health care. Imagine, 67 \npercent. Their capacity to invest in equipment, their capacity to \ninvest in employees, their capacity to invest in things that maintain \ntheir base of sales is substantially reduced as a result.\n  The same is true with the Federal Government. It would be bad enough, \nMr. President, if we had 67 percent and it stayed there. Under both the \nPresident's proposal and the Republican budget resolution that \npercentage continues to grow so that in the year 2000 it is 75 percent, \nnot 67 percent.\n  Mr. President, that is 8 percentage points, approximately, additional \ngrowth in entitlements. On this year's spending that is nearly $140 \nbillion of additional money of our budget that is going to entitlement \nspending.\n  I know the Senator from Mississippi understands this. If we had $400 \nbillion which is what 25 percent would be, if we had 25 percent of our \nbudget allocated this year for defense and nondefense appropriations, \nwe would have $400 billion, Mr. President.\n  Our most dovish liberal member would probably spend $250 billion on \ndefense, leaving $150 billion for nondefense spending.\n  Mr. President, as I look at the Republican Medicare Preservation \nAct--whatever they call it; something to that effect--of 1995, they say \nthe proposal preserves Medicare in the future. It does not. All it does \nis it picks as the problem the year 2002 but it does not alert \nAmericans to the enormous demographic problem of baby boomers that come \nonline and begin to retire in the year 2008.\n  Mr. President, unless we take a longer view, we do not see the \nappropriated accounts begin to dip even lower than 25 percent, \neventually becoming zero, unless we take action.\n  There are two things that put pressure on the appropriations accounts \nthat requires us to cut back in agriculture this year, as well as all \nother of our 13 appropriations bills. One is a tax cut that is insisted \nupon by the Republican majority.\n  I do not believe--I am not sure even the majority is that \nenthusiastic on the Republican side. Bigger than that, Mr. President, \nby my calculation, is a factor of four--four times larger than that \nproblem--is the problem of growth of entitlements.\n  We Democrats will have to say to Republicans--indeed the proposal put \nout last Friday instead of saying it does too much, the biggest \ndeficiency that I find with the proposal, Mr. President, is it does not \ndo enough. My criticism of it, it is not big enough. It does not really \nfix the problem.\n  I stand here as one Democrat who is concerned about what we are doing \nto these appropriated accounts. I see many areas where Republicans and \nDemocrats, whether it is rural development or transportation or \neducation, could agree that we are not spending enough, that we are \ndecreasing our productive capacity in the future and denying ourself \nhigher standards of living and more economic growth.\n  As a result, where we have agreement we are simply unable to come up \nwith \n\n[[Page S 13716]]\nthe resources, first, because of a tax cut that is still in here; but a \nfar larger looming problem is the growth of entitlements.\n  I see that the cosponsor of this bill, Senator Kohl, of Wisconsin, is \non the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13715-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13716-S13724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2686\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senator from \nNebraska in offering an amendment to increase funding for critically \nimportant rural development programs, offset by the elimination of the \nad hoc cotton disaster provision included in this bill.\n  The cuts required in this year's Agriculture appropriations bill are \nvery difficult. Both the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee have done an admirable job with \nthis bill under very difficult budgetary circumstances.\n  However, there is one major provision in this bill to which I must \nobject, and that is the $41 million ad hoc cotton disaster provision. I \nfind this provision inappropriate for two reasons:\n  First, the cotton disaster provision is inappropriate in light of the \nFederal Crop Insurance Reform Act just passed last year. With great \nfanfare, Congress passed crop insurance reform legislation to require \nfarmers participating in USDA programs to buy federally subsidized crop \ninsurance, to better prepare for unexpected crop losses. We all hailed \nthe passage of this legislation as being the end to ad hoc crop \ndisaster payments, representing a new era of fiscal responsibility.\n  Despite the near unanimity of our decision to end ad hoc disaster \npayments, we stand here today debating whether or not to provide ad hoc \ndisaster payments. We made a promise to the U.S. taxpayer last year, \nand I think we should keep it.\n  The second reason that I find this disaster provision inappropriate \nis because of the painful cuts required elsewhere in the bill. At a \ntime when core rural development programs are being cut by nearly 30 \npercent from last year's level, providing $41 million in unauthorized \ndisaster payments becomes even that much harder to accept.\n  Mr. President, the choice we make regarding this amendment goes far \nbeyond any specific crop loss for any specific commodity in any \nspecific year. If we decide to allow this ad hoc disaster provision to \nremain in the bill, it will set a very bad precedent for crop insurance \nreform in general in the future.\n  If this provision becomes law, each of us will feel compelled to push \nfor ad hoc disaster assistance payments for crop losses every time our \nfarmers have losses. And our short-lived experiment in fiscal \nresponsibility will have failed.\n  But we can choose the alternate course, and reject this provision and \nthereby keep the promise that we made to the taxpayers last year to end \nad hoc disaster payments for crop losses.\n  So I urge my colleagues to choose the latter course, and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, how much time remains under the \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the Senator from \nMississippi has 17 minutes, and the Senator from Nebraska has 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will look at the language of the committee \namendment and recognize that we are not creating, by law, a new \ndisaster assistance program. We are giving authority, however, to the \nSecretary of Agriculture to use his discretion, and if he feels that \nsupplemental disaster assistance is justified under the circumstances, \nhe has access to these funds to make such assistance available to \ncotton crop producers who are victims of one of the most devastating \ndisasters that we have witnessed in the deep South.\n  This is a disaster that has come upon us very quickly, without any \nwarning. A lot of cotton farmers, as a matter of fact, had understood \nthat the level of catastrophic crop insurance assistance would be about \nthe same that usual disaster programs provide under circumstances that \nhave become familiar to those in farming: weather-related disasters, \nfloods, storms of various kinds. But, normally, weather-related \ndisasters have triggered the availability of some kind of disaster \nassistance from the Federal Government.\n  Relying upon that assurance, when the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthis administration promoted this program and encouraged farmers to \nembrace the new crop insurance program--they were told that they would \nautomatically be covered if they participated in the commodity \nprograms--cotton producers, who were signed up for the program, about \n90 percent of them nationwide, almost 100 percent of them in this \nregion, thought that in case of a natural disaster they would have some \npredictable level of coverage.\n  But, as it has turned out, the coverage that is being made available \nis substantially less than that which had been provided under disasters \nthat had been experienced in the past. What makes this disaster \ndifferent is that farmers, upon seeing the prospective devastation in \ntheir crops, began adding more pesticides, getting clearance through \nthe EPA for emergency clearance of new kinds of insecticides to try to \ncope with this menace. And even with the expenditures of huge sums of \nmoney, in some instances, it did not work and cotton crops were \ndevastated. Many of those who suffered from this disaster will not be \nable to gin a single bale of cotton. There are many who have suffered \nhuge yield losses.\n  As the insertions that I had printed in the Record earlier in the day \nwill clearly show, in our State it is estimated there will be over $100 \nmillion in damages and losses. These are real losses to real people who \nhave invested time, effort, and, over long periods of time, developed \nbusinesses and farms that now may be lost as a result of this \ninfestation and the lack of response from our Government.\n  It is my hope we will not just stand by and let this amendment be \nadopted and transfer these funds to other portions of this bill. I am \nhopeful the Congress will respond to this situation and give the \nSecretary the authority to do something for them. It does not say he \nhas to, but it says if he feels it is justified, if the facts justify \nit, if the severity of the loss justifies it, if there is merit to the \nsuggestion that the Government has a duty to respond to people in dire \nsituations who cannot help themselves, the Secretary has the authority \nto do it. That is all this provision says.\n  So, it disappoints me greatly that we are being asked to turn our \nbacks on farmers who traditionally have been able to look to Congress \nas sort of the last court of appeal when they are in desperate straits. \nAnd they are. Many are--not all, but many are. Those who are need to \nhave an opportunity to have their cases heard at the Department of \nAgriculture for additional and supplemental benefits under the crop \ninsurance program.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will agree to provide this opportunity for \nadditional assistance. I do not know how far these funds will go. Mr. \nPresident, $41 million sounds like a lot of money, but if you look at \nall the States that are involved and all the acreage that is involved, \nthis report we got from the extension service and the Department of \nAgriculture indicates the losses were substantial in our State and \nTexas, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, and there were some \nlosses in North Carolina and South Carolina as well--but in our State, \n160,000 acres have been either abandoned or have seriously reduced \nyields. In Texas, it is 500,000 acres; Alabama, 400,000; Georgia, \n300,000. These are huge amounts of land, where either no cotton is \ngoing to be harvested this year or very little will be harvested.\n  So I am saying that this is an unusual circumstance. Not only are the \nlosses being suffered, but huge expenditures have been made by many of \nthese farmers to try to protect themselves in this situation. So it has \ndoubled the loss. Not only did they incur losses because they will not \nget any return at all, they have expended more money trying to save the \ncrop that they had, that was well underway, that looked \n\n[[Page S 13717]]\ngood, was going to produce a good crop up until just a few weeks ago.\n  So I am suggesting that we look with a sympathetic heart upon the \nsituation that we find ourselves in today and approve this committee's \nrecommendation that these funds be made available if the Secretary \nthinks they can be used and that it is justified. And I hope he will \nfind it is justified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have two arguments in response to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  One, if we authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide disaster \nassistance for cotton, any Members who vote no on this amendment are \ngoing to find themselves at some point faced with another crop with a \ncomparable disaster, saying, ``Can you do what you did for cotton last \nyear?'' That is what is going to happen. There is no question in my \nmind. It has already happened to me. People have come to me. Just like \nthe Senator said, people misunderstood what the catastrophic program \nwas. They have come to me and said, ``We thought this thing covered \nmore. We did not look at the fine print. They told us it was something \ndifferent, and now I have a disaster. Can you provide ad hoc disaster \nrelief on top of the crop insurance we expected to be there?''\n  My answer has been, ``No, we have to work with crop insurance or let \nus get rid of it. If you do not like the crop insurance program and you \nwant to go to Congress year in and year out when there are disasters \nand try to get money appropriated, let us do that. Let us just assume \nthe program will not work.'' I think it can work, if the administration \nwill appoint a corporate board of directors.\n  Second, as to this catastrophic coverage, part of the problem here is \nthat there are Government employees who attempted--in our judgment, too \nquickly--to assume responsibility that they knew what this bill was \nabout and could inform people.\n  The law is very clear. It is not like this thing is ambiguous. For \nformer ASCS employees, who were describing what this program was, to \nmisunderstand this one, it requires a pretty substantial stretch of the \nimagination to figure out how they did. Because it says right in the \nbill that catastrophic coverage is only going to cover 50 percent loss \nin yield on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 60 \npercent of the expected market price.\n  So the coverage was never intended to provide full coverage against \ndisasters. It was always intended as a floor and that the individual \nwho was out there trying to make a judgment should have to buy up. We \nhave subsidized insurance available. They could pay more and buy up and \nget more coverage. The misunderstanding is in part a consequence of our \nwanting to maintain a system where the Government itself is operating \nthe insurance program.\n  So I hope, for reasons cited, Members will look very carefully at \nthis. It is a difficult amendment because the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi is very persuasive and very well liked and has put \ntogether an awfully good piece of legislation. But I promise Members \nthey will find, if they vote no on this amendment, that they will have \na difficult time voting no in the future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I offer a brief comment. We might as well be \nvoting up or down on this amendment. I think it is a mistake to say, \n``Let us leave it up to the Secretary of Agriculture.''\n  If you leave it up to him, he is going to do it. He is going to do it \nbecause that is the way things work. He has to live every day with the \ndistinguished head of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran. He has to deal \nwith him on many matters all the time. He is not going to let this \ninterfere. I am not being critical of him or Senator Cochran. It is \njust the way things work. So this decision to leave it up to him, we \nmight as well say let us vote it because that is the way it will work.\n  So I think we ought not to misunderstand what the nature of this \namendment is and the nature of what Senator Cochran is requesting. It \nis really should we or should we not authorize the payment of $41 \nmillion? Because that is exactly the way it will work. Of course, \nSenator Kerrey and I are suggesting it is an inappropriate thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am prepared to yield back the remaining time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek to have the vote at this \ntime rather than at 6:30?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am prepared to vote. I think everybody is. I ask \nunanimous consent that we proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure, since \nwe notified Members earlier that it was 6:30. I do not want to have \nsomebody get tied up in traffic. It is pretty lousy traffic out there. \nI would hate to notify everybody that it will be at 6:30, and then to \nyield 10 minutes. It seems like that may be a problem.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we all understand that, if you do not use \nthe time and yield it back, the vote could occur earlier.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, unless there is some personal information \nthat somebody is going to have trouble getting here, I am not prepared \nto object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Nebraska. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the majority leader has authorized me to \nannounce that this was the last vote today. We do have a number of \nother amendments, though, under the agreement which we could consider \nand discuss tonight, and if recorded votes are required, we could have \nthose votes occur tomorrow. We already have under an agreement an \namendment on poultry regulations that is set for a time certain \ntomorrow under the agreement.\n  There is an amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nBrown, on the peanut program that has the yeas and nays ordered, which \nwill occur tomorrow. Other amendments are identified in this agreement \nwhich we could take up this evening and dispose of, some of them on \nvoice vote maybe.\n  We are prepared to consider all the amendments tonight if Senators \nwill be here to offer them. So I encourage those who do have amendments \nto present them, offer them, let us discuss them and dispose of them, \nif we can. If rollcall votes are required, we will have those votes \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have been told that Senator Bryan will \nbe here within a minute or two to offer an amendment on the Market \nPromotion Program. It is an amendment he will offer on behalf of both \nof us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, since he is on his way and prepared to \noffer the amendment, his amendment be the next amendment in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I \nwithhold that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi, in a colloquy concerning potato \nproduction in Alaska.\n  Potatoes are one of the very few cash crops that can be grown \nsuccessfully in Alaska because of the short growing season and cool \nweather. Because of the extreme climatic conditions in my State, most \npotato cultivars produced in the lower 48 States are not successful in \nAlaska. While the potatoes grow, they do not produce tubers for \nproduction in future years. However, the Canadians have experimented \nwith some new varieties and have enjoyed tremendous results. \nUnfortunately, the Department's potato research program has not focused \non the unique needs in extreme Arctic climates like Alaska.\n  The Alaska Department of Agriculture has proposed a plan to use its \nclean environment for breeding these Canadian potato tubers for use in \nAlaska as well as West Virginia, New York, Colorado, and Maine. A clean \nbreeding environment is required to prevent disease, but the Department \nalready has a facility which can be used. Approximately $120,000 would \nbe required to cover additional operational expenses.\n  The State of Alaska's facility is the only State-operated plant \nmaterials center in the United States, and will be the only potato \ncultivar center in North America when the British Columbia facility \ncloses down its operation. The Alaska Materials Center successfully \nhandles 120 northern climate varieties of potatoes, and has been virus \nfree for its entire 10 years of operations. This center has the \npotential to provide disease-free stock for the other 400 varieties of \npotatoes grown in North America.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee provided $707 \nmillion for the Agriculture Research Service including a number of \nincreases to address specific agricultural issues. The Senate report \nincludes specific language directing the Agriculture Research Service \nto work with the National Potato Council to address disease problems in \nthe lower 48 States.\n  Since the Agriculture Research Service is already engaged in potato \nresearch, I ask the chairman of the subcommittee whether the necessary \nfunds could be provided to produce the Canadian potato for use in cold \nclimates in the United States in addition to the work it will do this \nyear on addressing disease problems in the lower 48 States?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As the Senator from Alaska noted, the subcommittee did \naddress the potato disease issue, but was not aware of the unique \nproblem in Alaska. I am pleased to learn that a tuber has been \ndeveloped that would be successful in Alaska, and agree that the \nService should address this unique need of cold-climate States.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for \nthe purpose of trying to establish an agreement on time on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would be pleased to do so. With respect to this \namendment that the distinguished floor leader is aware of, Senator \nBumpers and I will want to have some time tonight and just a small \namount tomorrow before the vote. It is not our purpose to prolong this. \nI would be willing to agree, subject to the agreement of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, to an hour on this amendment, to be divided equally.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would 10 minutes tomorrow before the vote be sufficient?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me inquire of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Arkansas has indicated that he agrees \nto that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour, equally divided, on the \namendment to be offered by the Senators from Nevada and Arkansas \ntonight, and then tomorrow, 10 minutes before the vote on or in \nrelation to this amendment, equally divided.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Would the Senator be willing to make that 15 minutes, \nequally divided?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I so modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is always gracious in accommodating his \ncolleague, when I suspect that the Senator may not agree with the \nthrust of the enlightened Bryan-Bumpers amendment that is just about to \nbe unveiled on the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2691\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate funding for the Market Promotion Program )\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself and Mr. \n     Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 2691.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 18, before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     made available under this Act may be used to carry out the \n     market promotion program established under section 203 of the \n     Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623)''.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I told the Members of the Senate that \nthere is a program that has cost the American taxpayers a billion \ndollars, much of that money going to the largest corporations in \nAmerica, and that there is no evidence it works, in this time of budget \nconstraints, one would think that Members of this body on both sides of \nthe political aisle would say, ``Senator, show me where that is; that \nis one cut that surely we can agree to.''\n  Mr. President, you would be wrong if you made that assumption. If I \nfurther \n\n[[Page S 13719]]\nasserted that there is a program which is currently slated in this \nbudget proposal at $110 million, that has been denounced by such groups \nas the Cato Institute, the Progressive Policy Institute, the Heritage \nFoundation, the National Taxpayers Union, the Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest, Citizens against Government Waste, Citizens for a \nSound Economy, the Concord Coalition Citizens Council, the Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, surely, Mr. President, you might think this is an \narrangement that has been made in Heaven, and we should have those on \nthe right and those in the political center all in agreement that a \nprogram costing the American taxpayers $110 million ought to be \neliminated.\n  Mr. President, you would be wrong, because this program continues to \nsurvive. If I put this in the context that at a time when this Congress \nis cutting money for the National Park Service, school-to-work \nprograms, vocational education, elderly housing, and countless hundreds \nof other programs that help needy Americans, who help us to advance our \nabilities to enjoy public recreational facilities in America, that \nwould make it even all the more unbelievable that there is a program \nout there that survives.\n  This program, Mr. President, not only survives, but earlier this year \nwhen we were considering the supplemental budget, it was increased from \nan $85 million to a $110 million program.\n  By now I suppose some are saying, ``Tell me, Senator, what is this \nprogram? What is this program that seems to survive when those who are \nthoughtfully considering the function and role of the Federal \nGovernment, both in the center and on the right, all agree that it \nought not to exist? It has cost us $1 billion that goes to some of the \nwealthiest corporations in America. Tell me what this program is. Let \nme have a chance to cast my vote to kill it.''\n  This program, Mr. President, is the Market Promotion Program. As the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair knows, because he has been \nsupportive over the years in our efforts, this is a program that \ncontinues to survive and, as I say, even prosper in this, a year when \nbudget austerity is supposedly the order of the day.\n  Let me tell you some of the companies that receive this money. For \nfiscal years 1993 and 1994, here are some of the companies that have \nreceived taxpayer funds for the Market Promotion Program.\n  Before stating exactly what these companies have received, I think a \nword of explanation about this program: Ostensibly, presumably, the \nunderlying premise of this program is that by providing taxpayers' \ndollars to advertising budgets of companies that deal with the overseas \npromotion of American agricultural products, that somehow--somehow--\nthat will increase our agricultural exports.\n  I acknowledge, Mr. President, that is a noble goal. I am fully \nsupportive of efforts to increase our agricultural exports overseas.\n  This is a program that is part of a larger budget picture in which, \nas the General Accounting Office has pointed out, the entire Federal \nGovernment spends about $3.5 billion annually on export promotion--$3.5 \nbillion.\n  While agricultural products account for only 10 percent of total U.S. \nexports, the Department of Agriculture receives and spends about $2.2 \nbillion, or 63 percent of the total.\n  I do not believe that it can be argued that we are being \nunnecessarily penurious in providing money to promote agricultural \nproducts abroad. The Department of Commerce, by way of contrast, spends \nabout $236 million annually on trade promotion.\n  Let me return to the beneficiaries of this program.\n  Your tax dollars are going to some of the largest and most successful \ncorporations in America to be added to their advertising budgets. Here \nis an example of the kind of companies that receive this generous \nlargess from the Federal taxpayers.\n  Ernest & Julio Gallo. Fine products. I can attest to that. Mr. \nPresident, $7.9 million go to Gallo wines to assist in their \nadvertising budgets. Now, certainly Ernest & Julio Gallo, great success \nstories, ought to be able to finance, without the benefit of Federal \ntax dollars, their own advertising programs.\n  The Dole people, $2.4 million; Pillsbury, the little doughboy, $1.75 \nmillion; Tysons Food, the chicken people, $1.7 million; M & M/Mars, \n$1.5 million.\n  Let me say, lest the thought be that somehow the Senator from Nevada \nis picking on programs that do not have any recipients or beneficiaries \nin his State and, therefore, it is kind of easy for him to take a cheap \nshot at others, I remind my colleagues that more than 2 years ago on \nthe floor this Senator took the lead in eliminating an equally \noutrageous program, the wool and mohair subsidy, in which there are a \nnumber of Nevada ranchers that received this largess, as I characterize \nit, for a period of some 39 years, from 1954 to 1993. I led the charge \nto eliminate that abomination in our Federal expenditure system.\n  I point out that M & M/Mars has a factory in Las Vegas, a wonderful \nproduct. They are not, in my judgment, entitled to get into the \nAmerican taxpayers' pocket for $1.5 million.\n  Campbell soups, $1.1 million; Seagrams, $793,000; Hershey, $738,000; \nJim Beam whiskey, $713,000; and Ralston Purina, $443,000. Mr. \nPresident, this is only a part of the $110 million that has currently \nbeen appropriated to go to companies of this size. It is an outrage.\n  The General Accounting Office has examined this program and done a \nstudy to assert its effectiveness. Let me share with my colleagues what \nits conclusions are.\n  It goes on to say that there are many problems with the MPP program, \nthe Market Promotion Program, one of which is that there is no \nstrategic planning. The USDA lacks overall guidance or priorities. To \ndate, listen to this, there is no solid measure of success or a way to \nevaluate how the money is spent.\n  I think that is a pretty compelling argument, Mr. President, to \neliminate the program. Moreover, it is not clear who should get the \nfunds. There are no strict guidelines about the size or type of company \nthat will receive these funds. I have mentioned some of the larger \ncorporations. But in addition to those that are depicted, McDonald's, \nthe hamburger people, Sun Maid, Welch's, among others, are also some of \nthe largest recipients of this funding.\n  I think the American taxpayers, when shared sacrifice appears to be \nthe clarion call of the day, want to ask themselves why are \ncorporations of this size not being asked to do their bit in reducing \nthe level of Federal expenditures? A sacrifice that simply requires \nthem to say, ``Look, we are not going to take Federal taxpayers' \ndollars to supplement our own advertising accounts. We will do that job \non our own. Nobody knows better than we do how to market. Nobody knows \nbetter how to advertise our programs and our products than we do. We do \nnot need and we are not going to accept Federal dollars.''\n  This program continues on. Moreover, as the GAO concluded, ``There is \nno proof that these funds do not simply replace funds that would \nalready have been spent on advertising anyway.''\n  Let me make that point clear: In effect, what the GAO is saying is \nthat there is no way in which they can assert that this $7.9 million \nthat Ernest & Julio Gallo, the group on the top of the list for fiscal \nyear 1993 and 1994, has not simply slid dollars out of the corporation \ntreasury that would have gone to the advertising budget and just simply \nsaid, look, we will release those with $7.9 million that the Federal \nGovernment is going to give us and direct that $7.9 million down the \nprofit line to be distributed to the shareholders of that company. In \neffect, this program, like its predecessor, the TEA--the Targeted \nExport Assistance Program--has become a convenient source of free cash \nfor wealthy businesses to help pay for their overseas advertising \nbudgets.\n\n  Mr. President, I argue forcefully and implore my colleagues, whatever \ntheir previous voting record may have been--is it not time to eliminate \nthis program? Whatever its justification may have been in the past, is \nthis not a new era? I compliment Members on both sides of the aisle who \nhave taken the lead to support a budget amendment to the Constitution, \nto require the President of the United States to submit a balanced \nbudget and the Congress to require a balanced budget. I am a supporter \nof that effort. \n\n[[Page S 13720]]\n\n  I support the target of 2002 or 2003, whatever it might be, to \nachieve that balanced budget. Presumably, these kinds of pronouncements \nherald a new era of Government spending in Washington.\n  But, if we allow these kinds of programs, corporate welfare, pork for \nthe wealthiest corporations in America, to continue, what kind of \nmessage do we send to the American people? I will tell you. The message \nis, it is business as usual. If you are a big corporation and have \ninfluence in high places and have access to the right kind of people, \neven though we are cutting the programs for the poor, the elderly, and \nthose who do not have influence in high places in Washington--but these \nprograms can be protected.\n  These are good citizens, good corporate citizens. They make important \ncontributions in their communities and in this country, I am sure. I \nwould think they would be shamed and embarrassed to reach out there at \na time when we are trying, struggling to balance this budget.\n  I offer no criticism of my colleagues who have had to wrestle with \nsome of these tough decisions in the money committees. It is not easy. \nI may disagree with them on some of their priorities. But it is \ndifficult. There is no magic wand that can be waved. We cannot simply \nsay let us eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse and we can balance the \nbudget. It requires tough and hard decisions.\n  Nobody has encouraged the Congress to do this more than some of the \nleading business people in America, the kind of people who are chief \nexecutive officers for these companies. I think they ought to stand up \nand say, ``You know, you are right. We ought to do our share, too. From \nhere on out we will simply pay for our own advertising budget. You \nreturn those dollars--$110 million--you return those to the Treasury \nand let us let that money be used to help reduce the deficit.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nArkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not know what year this is in my \ncrusade to torpedo this program. The Senator from Nevada and I--I think \nthis is the third year we have teamed up. But, if I am not mistaken, I \nwas opposed to the program even before that.\n  Though I yield to nobody in the Senate in my commitment to a viable \nagricultural economy--but, when I think of all the long-winded, endless \nspeeches that are made on the floor of the U.S. Senate about welfare \ndeadbeats, which we are going to vote on tomorrow; we are talking about \neliminating the earned income tax credit, which is the greatest \nantiwelfare provision we have ever adopted--we are talking about \ncutting it dramatically. We are cutting funds for the arts, the \nhumanities. We are cutting public broadcasting. We are cutting \neducation. We are at least $3 billion short on child care. We are \ntalking about cutting Medicare $270 billion between now and the year \n2002, and cutting Medicaid, health care for poorest of the poor, by \n$240 billion over the next 7 years.\n  And here is a piece of corporate welfare, unexcelled--I want to say \nin the history of this Senate. I have not been here quite that long, so \nI am reluctant to make that claim. But you think about the U.S. \nGovernment subsidizing, really in small amounts, by their standards, \nsomething to advertise their product abroad so they can export more.\n  I look at this chart, prepared by the Senator from Nevada. I see \nErnest & Julio Gallo, Seagrams, Jim Beam--of the top 10 companies here, \nthree of them alcoholic beverages. Even though this is a $110 million \nprogram this year, in the past it has been bigger, and we put in a \ntotal of $85 million to advertise alcoholic beverages abroad.\n  Can you see Ernest & Julio Gallo advertising to the Italians why they \nshould drink American wine? To the French why they should drink \nAmerican wine? What are we doing, giving Ernest & Julio Gallo $8 \nmillion? I think that is a privately held company--my guess is it is \nprobably a $5 or $10 billion corporation.\n  McDonald's? I do not know what McDonald's annual sales are. I guess \nthey are probably approaching the $15 billion mark, and we give them $3 \nor $4 million? That is probably less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \ntheir advertising budget, and we say, ``Sic 'em, tiger, go advertise \nBig Mac and McNuggets all over the world.'' Not only are the amounts we \ngive piddling amounts, the General Accounting Office says there is no \nrelevance to the amount of money we give them and the results. So why \ndo we continue with this?\n  How does a U.S. Senator go home and talk to a hometown Chamber of \nCommerce and tell them, ``If you just reelect me, I will spend my money \nas though it were yours?''\n  If you let that Senator and me go before that same Chamber of \nCommerce, I promise you, they will threaten to impeach him before it is \nover, for squandering $110 million on such programs as this.\n  People are supposed to graduate from this program, too, did you know \nthat? I think, as we lawyers say, ``since the memory of man runneth \nnot,'' nobody has ever graduated. They just keep hanging on.\n  Mr. President, one thing that is a little painful about this is there \nare some big corporations who have big presences in my State who get \nthis money. And it always saddens me, it always saddens me to go to the \nfloor and attack something that is at least mildly beneficial to some \nof the corporate citizens in my State.\n  You know, not only is this an utter waste of the $110 million, $12 \nmillion goes to foreign corporations. They are not even American \ncorporations. You know, I am not xenophobic about my nationality. But \nwhat on Earth are we doing spending $12 million on foreign corporations \nso they can advertise abroad?\n  Not only is this an absolute, utter waste; not only do we have no \nbusiness putting $110 million into the pockets of these gigantic \ncorporations in America when we are cutting the most vulnerable among \nus, poorest of the poor--even cutting education, the elderly through \nMedicare, the poor through Medicaid, the poor through the earned income \ntax credit--and then just knowingly hand out $110 million--not only is \nit corporate welfare, it is wrong.\n  And it is not only morally wrong, it is wrong for the U.S. Senate to \nbe picking winners and losers. There are other wineries. I have a few \nwineries in my State that would like to have a little of that Ernest & \nJulio Gallo money. Who decided to give it to Ernest & Julio Gallo \ninstead of some of the wineries in my State? Tyson Foods, as big as \nthey are, we have 11 major integrated poultry companies in my State. \nYou know we are big in that business, No. 1.\n  When it comes to even the whiskey business, who decides that Jim Beam \nand Seagrams are the two brands that should be advertised abroad? I am \nnot picking on them. If I were in their company and I saw this money \nlying around and I knew I could get a piece of it by simply applying \nfor it, I would probably apply.\n  Of the battles fought in the 20 years I have been in the Senate, \nthere have been a couple of others that I feel as strongly about as \nthis one. But I cannot tell you how wrong I feel this is. I do not feel \nthis is just an economic matter. I feel it is utterly, absolutely \nindefensible, and we ought to stop it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Market Promotion Program has as its \nobjective meeting foreign competition, boosting agricultural exports, \nstrengthening farm income, and creating American jobs.\n  Every billion dollars in agriculture exports helps create nearly \n20,000 jobs. Nearly 1 million Americans today have jobs that are \ndependent upon U.S. agricultural exports. Exports this year from the \nUnited States into the international marketplace are expected to reach \nalmost $50 billion in value. Farmers and ranchers, as well as American \nworkers, are the real beneficiaries of this program.\n  The arguments on the other side that are being made tonight would \nhave you believe that corporate America is the beneficiary, that \ncertain specific companies--they mentioned Gallo Wine, and McDonald's--\nare the beneficiaries of these programs. It is the American working man \nand woman, the American citizen, who benefits when our economy is \nstrong, when we compete in the international marketplace and \n\n[[Page S 13721]]\nwhen we sell more of what we produce in overseas markets than we \nimport. We need to do a better job.\n  We have a trade deficit right now. We are confronted with some new \nrules under the Uruguay round of GATT, under other trade agreements \nthat heighten and make more competitive the international marketplace, \nheighten competition between the European Community, for example, and \nthe United States. It involves other countries, too, who are competing \nfor their share of this international market--Canada, Australia, and \nthe Asian countries, that are emerging as strong competitors in many of \nthese industries.\n  So what does the Market Promotion Program really do? It gives the \nmoney to associations of those who market products. The U.S. Poultry \nand Egg Council is just one example. When Senators were talking about \nMcDonald's getting this money, I have a memo in here that talks about \nthat point. This is a memorandum from the president of the Poultry and \nEgg Export Council, U.S.A. They say specifically:\n\n       Our council has used MPP to help McDonald's sell more \n     American chicken but not to promote McDonald's. The facts are \n     that McDonald's franchises in other countries are foreign \n     owned and operated. They are under no obligation to buy U.S. \n     poultry or eggs, and can readily find lower-priced (and \n     lower-quality) product in those countries. But by allowing \n     McDonald's to apply for and receive funds under MPP requires \n     their franchises to be entirely supplied with U.S. products. \n     The point is we are not promoting McDonald's. We are getting \n     McDonald's to advertise U.S. chicken and eggs, and it has \n     been quite effective. In fact, the State of Arkansas has \n     likely benefited more from this activity than any other \n     State.\n\n  So what we learned by getting the facts from the Poultry and Egg \nExport Council is that it was this council that applied for and \nreceived funds under the Market Promotion Program, not McDonald's. The \ncouncil was allocated the funds to promote U.S. poultry and egg \nproducts in the international market. McDonald's uses poultry and eggs \nin its outlets, but they do not have to use U.S. poultry and eggs in \noverseas outlets.\n  That is the whole point. But because this program has been helpful, \nwe have sold more U.S.-produced and processed poultry and eggs in \noverseas markets that we would otherwise would not have sold, they tell \nus in this memo, without this program.\n  They mentioned the wine industry. I happened to find out the other \nday--and here is an interesting fact to contemplate--that the European \nUnion spends more on wine exports, subsidizing, encouraging the export, \nthan the United States currently spends for all commodities under the \nMarket Promotion Programs. The number is $89 million just for wine \nexports from the European Union. That is why when you would go into a \ngrocery store around here, or anywhere where wines are sold, and you \nlook at the French wines or some of the other European wines, you are \namazed at how low the prices are compared to the domestic wines. That \nis why.\n  The European Union governments are putting their money together, and \nthey are expanding their share of the market aggressively by reducing \nthose prices to American consumers. This is the biggest market in the \nworld.\n  So foreign companies and foreign countries are joining forces as they \nhave never done before to try to capture a larger share of this market. \nWho suffers? Well, our consumers enjoy lower prices because of this \ncompetition with lower priced products. But our domestic food and \nbeverage industries, our poultry producers, those who are involved in \nagriculture production, are having a hard time meeting this competition \non a price basis because we do not subsidize these industries as they \nsell in this market. And we have a small amount available under \nlegislation that authorizes funds to be made available to help promote \nthe sale of U.S. farm commodities and U.S.-packaged foods and other \ncommodities that are eligible under this program.\n  As the competition becomes keener under these international \nagreements, more and more countries, more and more industries are going \nto be competing and doing it more aggressively.\n  The GATT Agreement under the Uruguay round changes does not outlaw or \nabolish or make illegal subsidies. It makes changes in which subsidies \nare to be used and which cannot be used. It talks about trade-\ndistorting subsidies. But we are finding that Canada, Australia, the \nEuropean Union certainly, are building their funds to embark upon much \nmore aggressive marketing programs and promotion programs than they \never have before.\n  Here we are being asked tonight to abandon ourselves, to say to the \nU.S. Government, ``Quit helping U.S. industry, quit helping U.S. \nfarmers, quit helping U.S. ranchers promote the sale of what they are \nproducing in the international marketplace.''\n  I think we ought to wait a minute and not be stampeded by arguments \nlike we are helping corporate America with welfare benefits. This is \nhelping those who are working in the poultry industry in Arkansas, in \nMississippi, and in other places.\n  They are not targeting McDonald's for benefits. We are seeing these \nfunds used to promote a wide range of activities in the international \nmarket.\n  I was looking at a list of these firms and these associations. And \nthese groups of farmers, many of them are cooperatives. The National \nCotton Council has a memo here which talks about the impact of this \nprogram in promoting the sale of cotton and cotton fiber throughout the \ncountry. ``Value added creates jobs.'' And they are talking about the \nfact that some of these funds are used in name-brand advertising.\n  Most of the money is used for generic advertising of American \ncommodities. But they find that the best way in some markets to ensure \nincreased export sales of U.S.-grown-and-produced commodities is \nthrough branded promotions. This is what the studies have shown. This \nis what the experience shows.\n  And so those who criticize the program on that basis are ignoring the \nsuccess that the program has enjoyed in using branded promotion. But \neven so, 40 percent of the funds for branded promotions involved small \nbusinesses. The market promotion program, we are told by the experts at \nthe Department of Agriculture and those who participated in the \nprogram, has served as an incentive to buy American-grown-and-produced \nagriculture commodities and related products. Without MPP, companies in \noverseas markets would likely buy from often subsidized foreign sources \nrather than from the United States.\n  So those who are making clothes in Asia, they do not have to buy U.S. \ncotton. They can buy cotton that is produced in Uzbekistan or the Sudan \nor any number of countries around the world where cotton is grown and \nsold. And they are trying to sell it at prices less than we can sell \nit. And if we can convince them through the advertising of facts about \nthe quality of our product that it is better, it is longer lasting, it \nis more durable, it is more comfortable if you have clothes made with \nU.S. cotton, then we are going to sell more. But if we sit on our hands \nand we do not promote what is good about American products and what is \ngood about American agriculture, nobody is going to know about it. We \nknow about it. But we have to be aggressive and we have to promote and \nprotect our job interests, our economic interests, in this competitive \ninternational market.\n  So to criticize the program and say let us just abolish it --that is \nwhat this amendment does. They did not say let us just reduce it or let \nus change it in some way. Let us just abolish it. That is what this \namendment says. I think it is shortsighted. I think it misses the \npoint. I think it fails to recognize the successes we have had in the \npast and the importance of our continuing an aggressive marketing \nstrategy on behalf of our farmers and ranchers, those involved in these \nfood industries and clothing industries where U.S. agricultural \ncommodities are used.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi reserves the \nremainder of his time.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Not to belabor the point, my colleague from Mississippi and I--I \nthink it is fair to say we have a disagreement on the value of this \nprogram. I know the hour is late, but I hope that a number of Senators' \noffices are still tuned in. \n\n[[Page S 13722]]\n\n  One of the best articles that I have read on this MPP program was \nprinted recently in the Los Angeles Times, Sunday edition, June 25, \n1995. I think it is a matter of about seven or eight pages. I implore \nmy colleagues, or at least their staff, just read that article. Just \nread that article. It quotes both those who support the program and \nthose who criticize it.\n  My good friend from Mississippi mentions the good folks at \nMcDonald's, the hamburger people. Let me just say to him and the rest \nof my colleagues, I enjoy a Big Mac. I am a hamburger man. In fact, \njust this summer while we were on tour through our State I ran across a \nMcDonald's manager who had a McDonald's tie on. It shows the Big Mac, \nthe French fries. I said, ``I've got to have that tie.'' I am a Big Mac \nkind of a guy. So my comments are not directed with any sense of malice \nor hostility, but simply as one trying to do justice to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  McDonald's, the hamburger people, are good folks. I wish I had been \nas smart as Ray Kroc. And I wish I had been that smart to put together \nthis impressive enterprise. Most folks of this generation think it has \ngone on forever. It has lasted only about 40 years, and it has been an \nincredible success. I pay great tribute to the entrepreneurship and the \nvision of folks that thought, ``By golly, we can change the fast food \nbusiness in America,'' and we can do it in a way that McDonald's has \nbeen eminently successful. Let me comment on the success. And I know my \ndistinguished colleague who joins me in arms, the Senator from \nArkansas, may want to add his comments, also.\n  McDonald's, which has received $1.6 million in this program since \n1986--that is when the Targeted Export Assistance Program, which is the \nprogenitor to MPP, was in existence; it is the same program \nessentially--has received $1.6 million. Remember, this is to supplement \none's advertising account.\n  McDonald's had a net profit in 1994 of $1.224 billion--$1.224 \nbillion. You know, whether you are to the left of Mao Tse-tung or to \nthe right of Genghis Khan, wherever you fit yourself on the political \nscale, if you accept the premise that Federal tax dollars are finite, \nthey are not inexhaustible, there ought to be some priorities.\n  How, good Lord, can you say, McDonald's with a net profit of $1.224 \nbillion ought to be able to get into this program? You know what they \nspent in 1994 in advertising? $694.8 million. And yet the American \ntaxpayer is supplementing the good folks of McDonald's who make those \ngreat hamburgers and French fries that so many of us enjoy.\n  Let me just give you the cumulative impact of this. The top corporate \nrecipients of this money from 1986 to 1994: Sunkist Growers, \n$76,375,000. In a different era and in a different context the great \nSenator Everett McKinley Dirksen used to say, ``A million here, a \nmillion there. Before long you will be talking about real money.'' Let \nme suggest, Mr. President, to our colleagues that $76 million is more \nmoney than 99.9 percent of the people in America will ever see in their \nlifetime--ever see.\n  The Blue Diamond Growers, they do not do too badly, $37,338,000. \nSunsweet Growers, $22 million. I am rounding these numbers off. And our \ngood friend, Ernest & Julio Gallo, the winery folks--this was not an \naberration, this 1993-1994 number; they have this program down; whoever \nis doing this good work for them obviously deserves a lot of credit--\nthey have gotten $23 million since 1986. Sun-Maid Growers of \nCalifornia, $12 million; Tyson Foods, $11 million; Pillsbury Company, \n$11 million.\n  I do not quarrel with the proposition that my good friend from \nMississippi argues when he says, look, we do need to support American \nagricultural promotions. But, Mr. President, not in this fashion, not \nwhen there is not one scintilla of objective evidence where GAO and \nother groups can make the proposition stick that this is a program that \nworks.\n  Moreover, its premise is flawed: Money to supplement advertising \nbudgets that ought to be the responsibility of the private sector, for \nbranded products, some of the largest companies not only in America but \nin the world at a time when we are desperately struggling to balance \nthis budget.\n  My friend from Arkansas used the word ``indefensible,'' and I think \nthat sums it up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article appearing in \nthe Los Angeles Times, June 25, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 25, 1995]\n\n                       Thank You for Your Support\n\n                 (By John M. Broder and Dwight Morris)\n\n       No other government program may generate such universal \n     scorn as an obscure Agriculture Department office that pays \n     highly profitable agribusiness concerns millions of dollars a \n     year to promote Sunsweet prunes in Taiwan, low-shelf Gallo \n     wines in Europe, Chicken McNuggets in Singapore, Kentucky \n     whiskey in Scotland and bull semen in South America.\n       But as Congress prepares to chop away at billions of \n     dollars in spending for health care, space exploration and \n     school lunches, the USDA's Market Promotion Program is \n     gliding through the budget process unscathed, enjoying \n     bipartisan congressional and White House support despite \n     years of controversy over its worth.\n       In fact, during the debate this spring over $16 billion in \n     cuts from the current federal budget, Congress voted to \n     increase the program's funding by almost 30%, from $85 \n     million to $110 million.\n       The MPP's defenders say that's a piddling sum for a program \n     that helps American farmers compete against heavily \n     subsidized producers in Japan, Europe and elsewhere.\n       Its opponents, ranging from the Heritage Foundation on the \n     right to Ralph Nader on the left, vilify the program as pure \n     pork (almost literally--the U.S. Meat Export Federation got \n     $7.2 million in 1994) and an example of corporate welfare at \n     its worst.\n       The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of \n     Congress, calls the program poorly run and of questionable \n     value; the Congressional Budget Office perennially lists it \n     among the prime candidates for extinction.\n       And year after year, the Market Promotion Program survives, \n     championed most actively by California lawmakers, who gave \n     birth to the program a decade ago and who receive campaign \n     contributions from the California fruit, nut and wine \n     producers that are among the program's prime beneficiaries.\n       The MPP, originally designed as a response to the unfair \n     trade practices of other governments, has grown over the \n     years into a program that provides a lucrative bounty for \n     producers of everything from soup (Campbell Soup Co., \n     $515,651 in 1994) to nuts (the California Pistachio \n     Commission, $1.15 million).\n       Early critics derided the program as ``walking-around money \n     for Californians,'' because it was sponsored by then-Sen. \n     Pete Wilson (now California governor) and then-Rep. Leon E. \n     Panetta (now White House chief of staff) to help the state's \n     producers get a place at an agricultural aid trough long \n     dominated by the big corn, wheat and soybean farmers of the \n     Midwest and Great Plains.\n       As the program grew, it took in growers, processors and \n     shippers in all 50 states and virtually every congressional \n     district--which helps explain its ability to survive in \n     difficult fiscal times. Its tenacity also bears testimony to \n     how difficult it will be to bring the $1.5-trillion federal \n     budget into balance, despite new bipartisan zeal to do so.\n       Programs that serve powerful constituencies and enjoy well-\n     financed corporate support--from subsidies for corps to tax \n     breaks for oil and gas drilling--are among the most \n     entrenched parts of the federal budget, having resisted \n     repeated efforts to repeal them. These benefits amount to an \n     estimated $50 billion a year, or about a tenth of the \n     discretionary portion of the budget.\n       Farm programs have proved particularly resistant to budget \n     surgery, combining as they do the romantic appeal of the \n     family farmer, the political clout of a major industry and \n     their importance to the economies of many states and \n     communities. Add to that the bogymen of subsidy-happy \n     Japanese and Europeans--whose government backing is often \n     cited as a reason to keep U.S. farm programs--and the \n     durability of costly undertakings such as the MPP becomes \n     understandable.\n       ``Everything about this program is wrong. We should junk \n     this disastrous program and save the taxpayer some money,'' \n     said Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.), a longtime MPP foe who \n     represents one of the least agriculture-dependent states in \n     the union. ``The amount of our national debt does not give us \n     the luxury to fund this fatally flawed program that has no \n     proven benefit for American agriculture.''\n       In the end, the way this collision of forces affects the \n     range of federal subsidies will help determine whether the \n     overall budget-balancing campaign is successful this time \n     around--and also whether the pain inflicted is judged to have \n     been borne fairly across society.\n       Gus Schumacher, head of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural \n     Service, which oversees the MPP, defends the program. He \n     notes that the European Union spends more each year to \n     promote overseas sales of French, German and Italian wines \n     than the U.S. government spends on all of its agricultural \n     advertising.\n\n[[Page S 13723]]\n\n       Schumacher describes the subsidy as an inexpensive weapon \n     in the international competition in high-value agricultural \n     products, which is the fastest-growing sector in global \n     trade.\n       ``This is not the time to get weak-kneed about American \n     agricultural exports,'' Schumacher said. ``It's time to stand \n     up to our competitors. What are we supposed to do, \n     unilaterally disarm?''\n       Schumacher acknowledged that corporate giants such as E & J \n     Gallo Winery Inc., Sunkist Growers Inc. and Dole Food Co.--\n     all California-based--and Pillsbury Co., Tyson Foods Inc. and \n     others have received millions of dollars from the government \n     over the years to supplement their own very large advertising \n     budgets. But, he said, critics forget that the grapes, \n     prunes, tangerines, flour and chickens marketed by big \n     agribusiness are grown by thousands of small farmers across \n     the country.\n       William K. Quarles, Sunkist's vice president for corporate \n     relations, defended the MPP as an appropriate response to \n     foreign competitors, who spend far more than the United \n     States on agricultural promotion. Sunkist uses the program to \n     increase its advertising in countries--particularly those in \n     Asia--it as already targeted as fruitful markets, not to pry \n     open new countries, he said.\n       ``The federal program acts as a multiplier to what we would \n     be doing,'' Quarles said. ``In all the countries we're in, we \n     would be doing some advertising, but with federal monies we \n     increase that advertising and create additional demand.''\n       He also said Sunkist is required to match the federal funds \n     on a dollar-for-dollar basis and that its exports create jobs \n     in California for thousands of packers, pickers, truckers, \n     and longshoremen,\n       The participating corporations have made sure they have a \n     receptive audience for their side of the story. Since 1984, \n     Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson has contributed more than \n     $988,000 to political campaigns through its political action \n     committee and through direct contributions by its executives. \n     Executives of Modesto-based E & J Gallo poured more than \n     $750,000 into federal campaigns over the same period.\n       Over the past decade, the 10 largest Market Promotion \n     Program recipients have also made political contributions \n     totaling $166,000 to Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) and \n     $105,000 to Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), both key \n     supporters of the program.\n       The General Accounting Office and other critics say the big \n     food companies can afford to promote their own products and \n     that the government has no business spending the public's \n     money to reimburse them.\n       Bryan noted that McDonald's Corp.--which received $1.6 \n     million in MPP funds from 1986 to 1994--had a $1.224-billion \n     net profit in 1994 while spending $694.8 million on \n     advertising worldwide.\n       Similarly, ConAgra Inc.--which sells the Chung King, \n     Wesson, Butterball, Swift, Armour, Banquet and Swiss Miss \n     brands, among others--received $826,000 in MPP funds from \n     1986 to '94, a pittance compared to its advertising budget \n     last year of $200 million.\n       ``How in God's world do we justify spending taxpayer \n     dollars to supplement this program?'' Bryan asked. ``This is \n     a company that is large, it is successful, and they can \n     effectively handle their own advertising and promotion \n     budget.''\n       Similar fulminations come from Nader's Center for Study of \n     Responsive Law, the libertarian Cato Institute, the Heritage \n     Foundation, Citizens Against Government Waste, the \n     Progressive Policy Institute--even the Marin Institute for \n     the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems, which \n     objects to the program because it underwrites overseas \n     advertising for beer, wine and whiskey.\n       But a ConAgra spokeswoman said the company participates in \n     the promotion program because it allows a testing of the \n     waters in markets that it otherwise could not afford to \n     enter.\n       ``We have never lobbied on behalf of this program, but we \n     do believe it serves an important purpose,'' said Lynn \n     Phares, ConAgra's vice president for public relations. ``It \n     opens expanding markets for products that would not have the \n     money spent on them. If more hot dots are sold in Korea, that \n     benefits not just the company that is the conduit (ConAgra), \n     but the corn growers and hog producers that create the \n     product.''\n       For its part, the nonpartisan GAO has tired of issuing \n     reports detailing the program's flaws.\n       ``It's such an easy target,'' sighed Allan I. Mendelowitz, \n     director of international trade issues for the GAO.\n       Several years ago, the GAO discovered, the MPP financed a \n     $3-million advertising campaign in Japan for the California \n     Raisin Board, featuring the animated dancing raisins that \n     were such a hit in the United States.\n       It bombed.\n       The campaign's theme song, ``I Heard It Through the \n     Grapevine,'' couldn't be translated into Japanese, so it ran \n     in English and was therefore incomprehensible to most \n     viewers, according to the GAO. The shriveled dancing figures \n     disturbed Japanese children, who thought they were potatoes \n     or chunks of chocolate. The characters' four-fingered hands \n     reminded television viewers of members of criminal \n     syndicates, whose little fingers are cut off as an initiation \n     rite.\n       If all that wasn't enough, the Raisin Board couldn't even \n     get its product onto store shelves during the promotion \n     period.\n       The board's goal was to sell 900 tons of raisins in Japan \n     during the campaign; exports during the period reached a \n     little more than half that. And the U.S. government spend $2 \n     in promotion costs for every dollar's worth of raisins that \n     reached Japanese store shelves.\n       The California Prune Board has a mixed record in using \n     federal money to try to open new markets for its fruit. The \n     California prune has made substantial inroads in Britain, \n     even though the dried fruit still has what the board \n     delicately describes as an ``image problem'' in that country \n     arising from ``the laxative stigma and the forced consumption \n     of poor-quality prunes during childhood.''\n       Rich Peterson, Prune Board executive director, said \n     advertising efforts on the California prune's behalf over the \n     past decade have helped increase sales by 45% in Britain, 75% \n     in Italy and 108% in Germany--all against stiff competition \n     from heavily subsidized French prunes.\n       ``That wouldn't have been possible without MPP funding,'' \n     Peterson said. ``The prune industry on its own would not have \n     had resources to launch the campaigns we've been able to \n     mount.''\n       The board spends roughly $1 million a year in MPP funds to \n     produce generic promotions for California prunes, and private \n     funds such as Sunsweet Growers Inc. of Yuba City, Calif., \n     spend millions more. Advertising focuses on prunes as a \n     healthful snack, Peterson said, rather than on their \n     gastrointestinal benefits.\n       ``We don't do dancing prunes,'' Peterson said. ``There's no \n     cutesy stuff for the prune.''\n       It's a different story in Asia. Prunes have been well-\n     received by the health-conscious Japanese, but the Taiwanese \n     have rejected them as an inferior version of the popular, \n     though expensive, Chinese black date. The Clinton \n     Administration has consistently supported the MPP, proposing \n     to spend $100 million a year on it for the next five years. \n     Officials argue that as the new General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade requires governments to cut direct subsidies to \n     farmers, it is crucial to maintain strong marketing efforts \n     that are legal under the trade pact. But critics insist that \n     the money should be spent on more productive programs rather \n     than on subsidizing the advertising of rich marketing \n     cooperatives such as Sunsweet, Sunkist and Sun-Maid.\n       ``I do not believe any member of this body should be able \n     to keep a straight face and support some of the measures we \n     are voting for when we cannot kill a program like MPP that is \n     a pure subsidy for some of the biggest corporations in \n     America and abroad,'' Sen, Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said in a \n     fruitless effort to kill the program earlier this year.\n       Times researcher Gary Feld contributed to this report.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me make just a few closing comments \nin opposition to this amendment. According to the Department of \nAgriculture's estimates based on their studies of the program, every $1 \nthat we have spent in the Market Promotion Program has translated into \n$16 in additional agricultural exports.\n  The Foreign Agriculture Service recently released its studies \nevaluating the effectiveness of the program, and that study concludes \nthat the 25-fold increase in export promotion activities for U.S. high \nvalue food exports, made possible by MPP and its predecessor, the \nTargeted Export Assistance Program, strongly supported the 300-percent \nincrease in exports of those products since 1986 and was the leading \nfactor in increasing the U.S. share of the world consumer food market. \nThat is persuasive evidence. I do not see how you can ignore that. If \nyou are trying to decide whether you vote for this amendment to abolish \nthe program or not, this was a study that was done to assess the \neffectiveness of this program.\n  It works. It means more U.S. jobs. It means more U.S. agriculture \nproducts being exported throughout the world. It is good for America. \nIt is good for American citizens.\n  All regions of this country, the United States, have benefited from \nthe program. It is not just a program that singles out one commodity \narea or one region.\n  According to this same Foreign Agriculture Service study, the \nemployment and economic effects of MPP are clear. With two-thirds of \nthe jobs supported being off the farm--that is, manufacturing, \ntransportation, and service industries--the other third were jobs on \nthe farm. They have analyzed it in that respect.\n  Recently, the Department of Agriculture presented us some specific \nexamples of the program's effectiveness, and I want to bring them to \nthe attention of the Senate. \n\n[[Page S 13724]]\n\n  Last year, a new regulation by the Japanese Government requiring that \npoultry products be identified by country of origin actually helped \nsales of U.S. poultry, as a result of a campaign conducted by the \nU.S.A. Poultry and Egg Export Council under this program.\n  The council had spent $167,000 in MPP funds to conduct joint \npromotions with 12 chain stores in Japan. The stores affixed the U.S. \nstickers saying ``U.S. poultry, U.S. regs,'' to product packaging, \ndisplayed point of purchase materials and devoted greater portion of \nshelf space to U.S. poultry products. By the end of the promotion, the \n12 chains reported total sales of over 110 tons of U.S. commodities. A \nyear after the program, the stores continue to use these labels.\n  There are other examples. MPP funds helped the processed potato \nproducts industries who reached a record $485 million in sales last \nyear. They nearly doubled the level of just 5 years ago. U.S. pear \ngrowers and exporters were able to sell more than $73 million last \nyear, their highest level ever. The emerging market in Russia is \nbecoming the United States fourth largest meat market. Canned salmon \nfrom Alaska is being sold in the United Kingdom. U.S. hard wood \nproducts are being exported. There are a number of other success \nstories in greater and greater quantities because of the thoughtful use \nof these funds.\n  Mr. President, new GATT trading rules are opening markets throughout \nthe world. We are encountering new opportunities, and we must expand \nour efforts, we must increase the aggressive way we are going after our \nshare of these new markets, competing effectively where we can. And \nbecause of the openness of these markets, they are increasingly \ncompetitive, and other countries are enjoying these opportunities, too.\n  So reducing or eliminating, which is what this amendment would do, \nthe Market Promotion Program at this time in the face of continued and \nincreasing foreign competition would be tantamount to unilateral \ndisarmament, and I am against it and I am arguing against it. The \nimpact would be felt throughout our economy in terms of lower exports, \nreduced economic activity and fewer jobs. I do not think we want that.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I recognize our time has expired. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for up to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, when you consider the mood of the \ncountry, which everybody recognizes is pretty hostile and very \nvolatile, most of it directed at the U.S. Congress and the people who \noccupy this Chamber and the one down the hall, most people do not \nunderstand what this Market Promotion Program is. But it is the very \nepitome of what people are upset about.\n  I cannot fathom our continuing a program such as this. We spent $2 \nbillion a year helping companies export--$2 billion--and here we put \n$110 million in for not just these corporations listed on this chart \nbut dozens and dozens of other corporations, all of whom are quite \ncapable of fending for themselves--the biggest in America.\n  Can you imagine McDonald's spending $60 million or $80 million a year \non advertising and us giving them $3 million to advertise Big Mac in \nRussia or wherever? What kind of nonsense is this?\n  This is one of those issues that if every single American were \nrequired to listen to the debate on this issue, I promise you, this \n$110 million would be torpedoed in a megasecond. People would be \nappalled if they knew this sort of thing went on and particularly in \nlight of the people we are cutting.\n  I still believe in helping people. I believe in what de Tocqueville \ntalked about, an enlightened self-interest. I said it on this floor a \nhundred times. We ought to help people who want to make it and are \nreaching for the first rung on the ladder. We are passing a lot of \nlegislation here that guarantees a lot of people who would like to have \na chance, for example, to go to school on the GI bill like I did. I \nwould not be standing here if it were not for the GI bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My brother made it pretty big in the corporate world. He \nwould never have made it. We came from very poor circumstances. So, \nyes, I believe in helping people. I do not believe in helping people \nwho do not want to help themselves. But I can tell you a little help \nfrom time to time from the Federal Government pays rich dividends, and \nwe ought to be spending where it pays rich dividends. We ought not to \nbe spending it on dancing raisins in Japan that scared half the \nchildren of Japan out of their wits. It was in English, and they did \nnot understand any of it. Little shriveled raisins--they thought they \nwere aliens. That was $3 million worth of scaring Japanese children. I \ncould go on with the horror stories. I am not going to belabor it. \nAbout everything that needs to be said has been said.\n\n  I want to point out again that we are spending $2 billion on export \nenhancements right now. Why are we adding this piddling amount for the \nbiggest corporations in America? If the people on this list right \nhere--which is a lot longer than that list--cannot fend for themselves, \nthis country is in more trouble than I thought it was. I am here to \nhelp people who cannot fend for themselves and who need and deserve \nhelp. This $110 million--I am not asking you to put it anyplace else. \nPut it on the deficit. You could not find a better place to put it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we have discussed this issue \nfully tonight, and we will have an opportunity to conclude debate \ntomorrow morning before voting on the amendment. I am prepared to move \non to other subjects.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in connection with the unanimous-consent \nagreement, in which we listed all amendments that were in order to the \nbill, I need to add an amendment for Senator Bennett of Utah, which \nwould be a relevant amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Bennett amendment be added to the \nlist of amendments in the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we understand that there is now an \nagreed-upon list. We will consider these amendments as they are called \nup tomorrow. Some have agreements on them in terms of time available \nfor debate and time for recorded votes that will occur, and the yeas \nand nays have been ordered on some of the amendments. On others, we \nhope we can work them out as they are called up. We may be able to \nagree to some of these. We hope Senators will be here tomorrow and be \nprepared to work quickly as we try to wrap-up consideration of this \nbill.\n  I understand that no other Senators intend to come to the floor \ntonight to offer amendments. So we are prepared to wrap up the business \nof the Senate tonight and go out for the evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13716-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, in a statement on the Senate floor last \nweek, I indicated I would oppose any reconciliation instructions that \nhurt students. I said it was time that we took students out of harm's \nway.\n  Unfortunately, the reconciliation package we will consider on \nWednesday does precisely the opposite. It harms students and their \nfamilies. Three-quarters of the cuts in this package will be borne by \nstudents and their families.\n  For the first time, institutions of higher education would be charged \na fee of 2 percent of the total amount of money borrowed by students, \nand parents of students, at each institution. While this fee could not \nbe directly passed on to students, institutions of higher education \nwould have to find the money somewhere. I greatly fear that the result \ncould be a reduction of institutional student aid, or cutbacks in \neducational programs and student support services. Clearly, a change of \nthis magnitude harms students and their families.\n  Increasing the interest rate on parents loans comes at a time when \nmiddle-income families are increasingly hard-pressed to make ends meet \nand help pay for their children's college education. This harms \nstudents and their families.\n  Decreasing the interest subsidy during the grace period from 6 to 4 \nmonths hits students when they have just finished their college \neducation and are looking for a job. This harms students and their \nfamilies.\n  Capping the direct loan program at 30 percent ensures that no new \nschools will enter the program and that students at these institutions \nwill not be able to benefit from this program. It also removes an \nincentive to improve the regular guaranteed loan program. Advancements \nsuch as improved services to the student and better, more favorable \ninterest rates could well disappear. This would harm students and their \nfamilies.\n  The series of changes affecting lenders, holders, and guaranty \nagencies could well endanger the stability and viability of the current \nprogram. For instance, more lenders might leave the program. Thus, we \ncould well have fewer lenders at a time when more are needed because of \nthe proposed 30 percent cap on direct lending. This would jeopardize \naccess to loans by all students, and would harm students and their \nfamilies.\n  I intend to oppose these instructions. To make such draconian changes \njust to save money is not, in my opinion, prudent public policy. It \nwould be far better to put a tax cut in harm's way and to spare \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13725-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13725-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13725-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13725-S13726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH ANGOLA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 80\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since March 26, \n1995, concerning the national emergency with respect to Angola that was \ndeclared in Executive Order No. 12865 of September 26, 1993. This \nreport is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, (50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect \nto Angola, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United \nNations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, \n1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than \nthrough designated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale \nor supply to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola \n(``UNITA''). United States persons are prohibited from activities that \npromote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from \nattempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that \nhave the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. \nThe order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the \npromulgation of rules and regulations, as might be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (``FAC'') issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement the \nPresident's declaration of a national emergency and imposition of \nsanctions against Angola (UNITA). There have been no amendments to the \nRegulations since my report of March 27, 1995.\n\n  The Regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola \nother than through designated points. United States persons are also \nprohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote \nsuch sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by \nany United States persons that evades or avoids or has the purpose of \nevading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions \nset forth in the Executive order. Also prohibited are transactions by \nUnited States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels \nor aircraft, relating to transportation to Angola or UNITA of goods the \nexportation of which is prohibited.\n  The Government of Angola has designated the following points of entry \nas points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the \nRegulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela \nProvince; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benguela Province; and Namibe, \nNamibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although \nno specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for \nshipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is \ndestined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing \nrequirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.\n  2. The FAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to \nassure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA--through \nthe dissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic \nbulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls \nfrom banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of \nthese prohibitions. United States exporters have also been notified of \nthe sanctions through a variety of media, including special fliers and \ncomputer bulletin board information initiated by FAC and posted through \nthe Department of Commerce and the Government Printing Office. There \nhave been no license applications under the program.\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 25, 1995, through September 25, 1995, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nAngola (UNITA) are reported to be \n\n[[Page S 13726]]\nabout $170,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs for \nFederal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Customs Service, the Office of the Under Secretary \nfor Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel) and the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Office of Southern African \nAffairs).\n  I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

This report is submitted pursuant to \nsection 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA), and section 505(c) of the International \nSecurity and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-\n9(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the national \nemergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order No. \n12957 and matters relating to Executive Order No. 12959.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order No. 12957 (60 Fed. \nReg. 14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with \nrespect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, \nmanagement, or supervision by United States persons of the development \nof Iranian petroleum resources. This action was in response to actions \nand policies of the Government of Iran, including support for \ninternational terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmeans to deliver them. A copy of the order was provided to the Congress \nby message dated March 15, 1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order No. 12959 to \nfurther respond to the Iranian threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States.\n  Executive Order No. 12959 (60 Fed. Reg. 24757, May 9, 1995) (1) \nprohibits exportation from the United States to Iran or to the \nGovernment of Iran of goods, technology, or services; (2) prohibits the \nreexportation of certain U.S. goods and technology to Iran from third \ncountries; (3) prohibits transactions such as brokering and other \ndealing by United States persons in goods and services of Iranian \norigin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (4) prohibits \nnew investments by United States persons in Iran or in property owned \nor controlled by the Government of Iran; (5) prohibits U.S. companies \nand other United States persons from approving, facilitating, or \nfinancing performance by a foreign subsidiary or other entity owned or \ncontrolled by a United States person of transactions that a United \nStates person is prohibited from performing; (6) continues the 1987 \nprohibition on the importation into the United States of goods and \nservices of Iranian origin; (7) prohibits any transaction by any United \nStates person or within the United States that evades or avoids or \nattempts to violate any prohibition of the order; and (8) allow U.S. \ncompanies a 30-day period in which to perform trade transactions \npursuant to contracts predating the Executive order.\n  In Executive Order No. 12959, I directed the Secretary of the \nTreasury to authorize through licensing certain transactions, including \ntransactions by United States persons related to the Iran-United States \nClaims Tribunal in The Hague, established pursuant to the Algiers \nAccords, and other international obligations and United States \nGovernment functions. Such transactions also include the export of \nagricultural commodities pursuant to preexisting contracts consistent \nwith section 5712(c) of title 7, United States Code. I also directed \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to consider authorizing United States persons through specific \nlicensing to participate in market-based swaps of crude oil from the \nCaspian Sea area for Iranian crude oil in support of energy projects in \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.\n  Executive Order No. 12959 revokes sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \nNo. 12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \nNo. 12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with \nit. A copy of Executive Order No. 12959 was transmitted to the \nPresident of the Senate and Speaker of the House by letter dated May 6, \n1995.\n  2. In its implementation of the sanctions imposed against Iran \npursuant to Executive Order No. 12959, the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl (FAC) of the Department of the Treasury has issued 12 general \nlicenses and 2 general notices authorizing various transactions \notherwise prohibited by the Executive order or providing statements of \nlicensing policy. In order to ensure the widest dissemination of the \ngeneral licenses and general notices in advance of promulgation of \namended regulations, FAC published them in the Federal Register on \nAugust 10, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 40881). In addition, FAC disseminated \nthis information by its traditional methods such as electronic bulletin \nboards, FAX, and mail. Copies of these general licenses and general \nnotices are attached to this report.\n  General License No. 1 described those transactions which were \nauthorized in connection with the June 6, 1995 delayed effective date \ncontained in Executive Order No. 12959 for trade transactions related \nto pre-May 7 trade contracts. General License No. 2 authorized payments \nto or from Iran under certain circumstances and certain dollar clearing \ntransactions involving Iran by U.S. financial institutions. General \nLicense No. 3 authorized the exportation of certain services by U.S. \nfinancial institutions with respect to accounts held for persons in \nIran, the Government of Iran, or entities owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran. General License No. 3 also contained an annex \nidentifying 13 Iranian banks and 62 of their branches, agencies, \nrepresentative offices, regional offices, and subsidiaries as owned or \ncontrolled by the Government of Iran. General License No. 4 authorized \n(1) domestic transactions involving Iranian-origin goods already within \nthe United States except for transactions involving the Government of \nIran or an entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, and \n(2) transactions by United States persons necessary to effect the \ndisposition of Iranian-origin goods or services located or to be \nperformed outside the United States, provided that they were acquired \nby that United States person in transactions not prohibited by the \norder or by 31 C.F.R. Part 560, that such disposition does not result \nin the importation of these goods or services into the United States, \nand that such transactions are completed prior to August 6, 1995. \nGeneral License No. 5 authorized the importation into the United States \nof information and informational materials, confirmed the exemption of \nsuch information from the ban on exportation from the United States, \nand set forth a licensing policy for the exportation of equipment \nnecessary to establish news wire feeds or other transmissions of \ninformation. General License No. 6 authorized the importation into the \nUnited States and the exportation to Iran of diplomatic pouches and \ntheir contents. General License No. 7 provided a statement of licensing \npolicy for consideration, on a case-by-case basis, to authorize the \nestablishment and operation of news organization offices in Iran by \nU.S. organizations whose primary purpose is the gathering and \ndissemination of news to \n\n[[Page S 13727]]\nthe general public. General License No. 8 authorized transactions in \nconnection with the exportation of agricultural commodities pursuant to \npre-May 7 trade contracts provided that the terms of such contract \nrequire delivery of the commodity prior to February 2, 1996. General \nLicense No. 9 authorized import, export, and service transactions \nnecessary to the conduct of official business by the missions of the \nGovernment of Iran to international organizations and the Iranian \nInterests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan in the United States. \nGeneral License No. 10 provided a statement of licensing policy with \nrespect to transactions incident to the resolution of disputes between \nthe United States or U.S. nationals and the Government of Iran in \ninternational tribunals and domestic courts in the United States and \nabroad. General License No. 11 authorized the exportation of household \ngoods and personal effects for persons departing from the United States \nto relocate in Iran. General License No. 12 authorized the provision of \ncertain legal services to the Government of Iran or to a person in Iran \nand the receipt of payment therefor under certain circumstances.\n\n  General Notice No. 1 described information required in connection \nwith an application for a specific license to complete the performance \nof pre-May 7 trade contracts prior to August 6, 1995 (except with \nrespect to agricultural commodities as provided by General License No. \n8). General Notice No. 2 indicated that the Department of the Treasury \nhad authorized the U.S. agencies of Iranian banks to complete, through \nDecember 29, 1995, transactions for U.S. exporters involving letters of \ncredit, which they issued, confirmed, or advised prior to June 6, 1995, \nprovided that the underlying export was completed in accordance with \nthe terms of General License No. 1 or a specific license issued to the \nexporter by FAC. General Notice No. 2 also noted that the U.S. agencies \nof the Iranian banks were authorized to offer discounted advance \npayments on deferred payment letters of credit, which they issued, \nconfirmed, or advised, provided that the same criteria are met.\n  3. The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 560 (the \n``ITR''), have been comprehensively amended to implement the provisions \nof Executive Orders No. 12957 and No. 12959. The amended ITR were \nissued by FAC on September 11, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 47061-74) and \nincorporate, with some modifications, the General Licenses cited above. \nA copy of the amended regulations is attached to this report.\n\n  4. In consultation with the Department of State, FAC reviewed \napplications for specific licenses to permit continued performance of \ntrade contracts entered into prior to May 7, 1995. It issued more than \n100 such licenses allowing performance to continue up to August 6, \n1995.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 15 through September 14, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are \napproximately $875,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Customs Service, the Office of the Under Secretary \nfor Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department \nof State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, the \nBureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of Politico-Military \nAffairs, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and the Department of \nCommerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the General Counsel's \nOffice).\n  6. The situation reviewed above continues to involve important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an extraordinary and unusual threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \nThe declaration of the national emergency with respect to Iran \ncontained in Executive Order No. 12957 and the comprehensive economic \nsanctions imposed by Executive Order No. 12959 underscore the United \nStates Government's opposition to the actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Iran, particularly its support of international terrorism \nand its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to \ndeliver them. The Iranian Transactions Regulations issued pursuant to \nExecutive Orders No. 12957 and No. 12959 continue to advance important \nobjectives in promoting the nonproliferation and antiterrorism policies \nof the United States. I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to \ndeal with these problems and will report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend titles 5 and 37, United States Code, to \nprovide for the continuance of pay and the authority to make certain \nexpenditures and obligations during lapses in appropriations; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROTECTION ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I introduce an important piece of \nlegislation called the Federal Employee Compensation Protection Act.\n  With a budget stalemate looming ahead, I think it is crucial that we \nkeep our faith with Federal employees. The Mikulski-Sarbanes \nlegislation will keep that faith by protecting Federal employee pay and \nbenefits during a Government shutdown. Our legislation will ensure that \nFederal employees in Maryland and across the Nation will be able to \nmake their mortgage payments, put food on the table, and provide for \ntheir families.\n  A shutdown of the Federal Government, no matter how short, would \ndisrupt the lives of thousands of Federal employees and their families. \nIn my State of Maryland alone, there are more than 280,000 Federal \nemployees. They are some of the most dedicated and hard-working people \nin America today. These employees have devoted their careers and lives \nto public service, and they should not be used as pawns in a game of \npolitical brinkmanship.\n  Federal employees have already endured their fair share of hardship \nthis year. Downsizing, diet COLA's, attacks on pensions and health \nbenefits, and now the threat of unpaid furloughs have damaged morale at \nnearly every Federal agency. This assault must stop Mr. President. We \ncannot continue to denigrate and downgrade Federal employees and at the \nsame time expect Government to work better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Mikulski-Sarbanes legislation and \nwork to prevent this train wreck from happening. We have a contract \nwith our Federal employees, and we should encourage their dedication by \nensuring that the contract is honored and their pay and benefits are \nnot put in jeopardy.\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation to ensure the protection of Federal employee pay and \nbenefits in the event of a furlough.\n  We have a responsibility to the men and women who have dedicated \nthemselves to public service and I would hope that my colleagues would \njoin Senator Mikulski and I in our ongoing effort to maintain the \nFederal Government's commitment to its dedicated work force.\n  Over the past several months, Federal employees have been subject to \nnumerous attacks on their pay and earned benefits. Despite my \nopposition, Congress approved the Republican budget resolution which \nseeks to change the calculation of retirement benefits for Federal \nemployees from the employee's highest 3-year average to the highest 5-\nyear average. The resolution also contains a reduction in the Federal \nGovernment's contribution to employee health care benefits and an \nincrease from 7 to 7.5 percent in Federal employee contribution rates \nover the next 7 years.\n  In my view, this is a breach of the contract with Federal employees. \nIn an attempt to restore fairness for Federal workers, I offered, along \nwith Senator Mikulski and several of my colleagues, an amendment to the \nRepublican budget resolution which would have stricken the high three/\nhigh five provision. Unfortunately, the provision failed by the \nnarrowest of margins.\n   Mr. President, Federal employees have made a choice to serve their \ncountry and we should respect and reward that choice by supporting \nthese hardworking, dedicated individuals. \n\n[[Page S 13729]]\nThrough the legislation Senator Mikulski and I are introducing today, \nwe have the opportunity to send a message to the Federal work force and \nto all American citizens that Congress honors and values the commitment \nthose who work for the Government have made.\n  As I have stated many times before, Federal employees have already \nmade significant sacrifices in past years in the form of downsizing \nefforts, delayed and reduced cost of living adjustments, and other \nreductions in Federal employee pay and benefits. They have been called \non to sacrifice further in this Congress through the Republican budget \nresolution and are now facing the very real possibility that, through \nno fault of their own, they may have to either work without pay or be \nprohibited from coming to work at all.\n  In a consistent and committed way, Federal workers give dedicated \nservice to our country and they deserve to have their pay and earned \nbenefits protected. Like Cal Ripken, who was recently honored in \nBaltimore, Federal employees show up day in and day out and do their \njobs. In my view, we should recognize and encourage such dedication by \nensuring that the pay and benefits of Federal workers are not placed in \njeopardy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1251. A bill to establish a national fund for health research to \nexpand medical research programs through increased funding provided to \nthe National Institutes of Health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the national fund for health research act\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this week finds us at the height of the \nappropriations process, as the end of the fiscal year rapidly \napproaches. It has been a season of difficult fiscal decisions which \nmust be made to conform to the constraints of our balanced budget \nagreement. Never are the tradeoffs as vivid as when we consider \nspending levels for health and education programs, as we did this \nmorning when the Senate Appropriations Committee completed action on \nthe fiscal year 1996 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill.\n  I am pleased to report that the committee provided nearly $1.5 \nbillion more than the House for education programs. In addition, we \nprovided a 2.7=percent increase for health research at the National \nInstitutes of Health. While this level is less than that provided by \nthe House, I believe it represents a fair balance between the vitally \nimportant issues of health and education. But clearly, my preference \nwould have been to provide a much larger increase for medical research \nso that the engine which drives the quality of medical care and reduced \nhealth costs could run at full tilt.\n  The current reality is, however, that available funds for \ndiscretionary spending are decreasing. We cannot continue to look \nsolely to the appropriations process for the necessary resources to \nkeep our biomedical research enterprise growing at a rate which takes \nadvantage of the myriad medical breakthroughs on the horizon. We must \nlook for a funding source to supplement annual appropriations to the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Today I am pleased to unite with my friend and colleague, Senator \nHarkin, in introducing legislation to establish the national fund for \nmedical research. We joined forces in this effort last year and worked \nhard to see that medical research was a part of the health care reform \ndebates. At the end of the process, although the issue was ultimately \nunresolved, we had received the attention and support of many Members \nin this Chamber. We introduce this bill today, with the support of \nSenator Boxer of California, with the intention of building on the \nmomentum of last year to gain the support of our many colleagues in \nthis body who are committed to the biomedical research infrastructure.\n  Our legislation proposes to create a new fund in the U.S. Treasury, \nfinanced by an increase in Federal tobacco taxes and income generated \nthrough a voluntary Federal income tax checkoff. By raising the Federal \ntax on cigarettes by 25 cents per package, as well as raising the tax \nto an equivalent level on smokeless tobacco products, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has estimated annual income for the fund of \napproximately $4.2 billion. These funds will be distributed on a \nphased-in basis to the National Institutes of Health to supplement, not \nreplace, the funds the organization receives each year in the \nappropriations process. Funds will be distributed in accordance with \nthe proportion of funds each of the member institutes and centers \nreceive in the appropriations process, after 5 percent has been divided \nbetween the Office of the Director, the National Center for Research \nResources, and the National Library of Medicine.\n  Funds raised through this proposal will increase the budget of the \nNIH by 35 percent over the fiscal year 1995 appropriated level. This \nwill allow many more research grant applications to be funded so that \nscientific opportunities of merit can be pursued and ultimately \ntranslated into cost-effective treatments and cures which will improve \nour national quality of life. I know of no better investment for the \nFederal Government than one which strengthens our human capital--be it \nin education or health research, our greatest strength is a healthy, \nand thus wealthy, populous.\n  Mr. President, my good friend, the great philanthropist, Mary Lasker \nonce said, ``If you think research is expensive, try disease.'' \nDiseases cost this country hundreds of billions of dollars annually. \nLast year, federally supported research on Alzheimer's disease totalled \n$300 million, yet it is estimated that $90 billion is expended annually \non care. Federally supported research on diabetes totals $290 million, \nyet it is estimated that $25 billion is expended annually on care. \nFederally supported research on mental health totals $613 million, yet \nit is estimated that $130 billion is expended annually on care.\n  As we struggle in the coming months to achieve a balanced budget, we \nmust embrace policies that enable us to make the most out of our scarce \nFederal dollars. Federal funding for medical research should be a top \npriority because without new knowledge to develop new strategies to \nprevent disease, new treatments to delay the progression of disease and \nnew interventions to cure disease; health care costs will continue to \nspiral out of control. Disease drives the cost of health care. A \nconcerted Federal assault on disease will not only save precious funds, \nbut it will provide hope to the afflicted.\n  Watching a medical catastrophe affect a family or individual is one \nof the greatest tragedies we face in this country. The impacts are \naccentuated when this misfortune comes in the form of an incurable \ndisease. Loved ones are left with no hope, and feeling powerless as \nthey watch the debilitating effects of disease overcome the individual. \nI know many of my colleagues in the Senate have experienced this sense \nof powerlessness. They have watched helplessly while family members \ndeteriorate from the effects of a deadly disease. The vibrant \nindividual that they knew and loved is reduced to a withering shell of \na human being. The one thing, and the only thing that provides comfort \nto the afflicted and to their loved ones, is hope. Hope for an end to \nthe suffering. Hope for a return to a normal life. Hope for a cure. \nThis hope does not have to be great, even the faintest glimmer brings \nhappiness to someone faced with a fatal future.\n\n  Medical research is the sole hope we can provide to millions of \nAmericans who will experience disease and disability either in their \nown lives or in their families. We can care for them in our hospitals \nand clinics but we cannot alleviate their pain or end their suffering \nwithout cures and preventative treatments. Cures are the direct result \nof our investment in medical research.\n  This legislation is important because it will help provide a more \nsustainable funding base for medical research. During the debate on the \nbudget resolution, I offered an amendment to restore $7 billion of the \nnearly $8 billion cut for the NIH proposed by the Senate budget \nresolution over the next 7 years. This amendment passed by a vote of \n85-14. While this was a short-term victory for the NIH, it demonstrates \nthe need for a stable endowment for medical research. The war against \ndisease can not be fully waged if medical researchers have to engage in \nyearly squabbles with Congress over funding levels.\n\n[[Page S 13730]]\n\n  As most of my colleagues know, I am a practical man. I do not \nunderestimate the difficulty any tax increase has in the current \npolitical climate, but I submit we must listen to the people who put \nthe new Republican majority in power.\n  A recent Harris Poll has shown that Americans strongly support health \nresearch and are willing to put their money behind their words. The \npoll asked Americans which type of scientific research they favored--66 \npercent favored medical research and a pitiful 4 percent preferred \ndefense research. This same poll determined that if assured that the \nfunds would be spent for medical research, 74 percent of Americans are \nwilling to spend $1 more in taxes. Other polling data consistently \nshows that more than two-thirds of Republican and Democratic voters, \nincluding voters in tobacco-growing States, favor raising tobacco \ntaxes.\n  These results make it clear that our constituents desire a strong \nFederal commitment to medical research, even if it means an increase in \ntaxes. An increase in tobacco taxes is easily the most appropriate \nsource of funding for this bill. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention reports that the Federal Government spends more than $20 \nbillion per year to pay for the direct health care costs caused by \ntobacco. Tobacco taxes will help offset and reduce the economic costs \nof smoking. Taxes on tobacco products are a proven source of revenue \naround the world. Most major industrialized nations tax tobacco at $2 \nto $3.60 per package.\n  The increase in the tobacco tax will provide extensive health \nbenefits. Tobacco use is the greatest cause of preventable death in \nAmerica. About 1.3 million children and adults will be discouraged from \nsmoking by a 25-cent tobacco tax. Because about half of all long-term \nsmokers die of diseases caused by smoking, a 25-cent tobacco tax will \nsave the lives of more than 300,000 Americans alive today. I hope these \nheart-wrenching statistics will put an end to the congressional \ncoddling of the almighty tobacco lobby. Tobacco use imposes a great \nprice on our society, and those who profit from tobacco use should \ncontribute their fair share to this devastation.\n  This legislation has everything to do with providing our Nation with \na brighter future. While sustainable resources for medical research are \nessential for our Nation's prosperity, our young people will ultimately \ndetermine the future of our Nation. Zenia Kim, a finalist in the Miss \nOregon Pageant, and an aspiring medical researcher, provides me with a \npersonal impetus to progress on this legislation. Like many Zenia had \nnot given disease or medical research much thought until a close \nrelative was stricken with cancer. After seeing her family member \nexperience the terrors of chemotherapy, she dedicated her life to \nfinding a cure to cancer.\n  Zenia has vigorously pursued this pledge by working during her \ncollege summers at Oregon Health Sciences University. It was here, at \none of our Nation's top academic medical centers, that she encountered \nthe problems of insufficient funds for medical research. This inspired \nher to develop a comprehensive proposal to cure cancer. The main \ncomponent of this proposal is research. Kim writes, ``as a future \nmedical scientist, I would like to know that there will be enough \nfunding available to pursue my research endeavors.''\n  I would like Zenia to someday realize her goal and find a cure for \ncancer. I would like to assure Zenia, that when she graduates from \nmedical school, we will have adequate funding for medical research. I \nurge my colleagues to support the National Fund for Medical Research to \nhelp Zenia and others like her to provide hope for those tormented by \ndisease and disabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record, a copy of the bill, \na question and answer summary, a sample of letters of support, and a \nlist of nearly 200 organizations supporting this effort.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Fund for Health \n     Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and are \n     willing to pay for it. Polling data consistently shows that \n     more than two-thirds of all voters support a major tobacco \n     tax increase if revenues generated are dedicated to health-\n     related programs.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovascular disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n     of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability, is critical to holding \n     down costs in the long term.\n       (6) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (7) Because the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67) freezes discretionary \n     spending for the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n     likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n     action is taken.\n       (8) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n       (9) Each year 419,000 Americans die directly from tobacco \n     use and thousands more die from diseases caused by exposure \n     to environmental tobacco smoke. This year one out of every \n     five Americans who die will die from tobacco use.\n       (10) A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention estimates that the Federal Government expended \n     more than $20,000,000,000 in 1993 alone to treat illnesses \n     associated with tobacco use.\n       (11) A 25 cent increase in the tobacco tax would discourage \n     1,300,000 Americans from smoking and prevent more than \n     300,000 premature deaths.\n       (12) An estimated 90 percent of all smokers start when they \n     are teenagers or younger.\n       (13) Voluntary income tax checkoffs for medical research \n     for specific diseases exist in some States and have proven \n     successful in generating funds for such research.\n               TITLE I--NATIONAL FUND FOR HEALTH RESEARCH\n\n     SEC. 101. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund \n     for Health Research'' (hereafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts as are \n     transferred to the Fund under subsection (b) and any interest \n     earned on investment of amounts in the Fund.\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to--\n       (A) taxes received in the Treasury under section 5701 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to taxes on \n     tobacco products) to the extent attributable to the increase \n     in such taxes resulting from the amendments made by title II \n     of the National Fund for Health Research Act; and\n       (B) the amounts designated under section 6097 (relating to \n     designation of overpayments and contributions to the Fund).\n       (2) Transfers based on estimates.--The amounts transferred \n     by paragraph (1) shall annually be transferred to the Fund \n     within 30 days after the President signs an appropriations \n     Act for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     and Education, and related agencies, or by the end of the \n     first quarter of the fiscal year.

The Fund would \n     greatly enhance the quality of health care by investing more \n     resources in finding preventive measures, cures and cost \n     effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions \n     that strike Americans.\n       Financing for the Fund comes from an increase in federal \n     tobacco taxes--25 cents per pack of cigarettes and an \n     equivalent tax on other tobacco products. This tax would \n     raise an estimated $4.2 billion annually. In addition to \n     providing revenue for the Fund, raising tobacco taxes will \n     protect children and save lives. Every day more than 3,000 \n     children become smokers and more than 1,000 of them will \n     eventually die as a result of smoking. Raising tobacco taxes \n     is a highly effective way to reduce tobacco use by children. \n     A 25-cent tax will discourage an estimated 1.3 million \n     children and adults from smoking and will save the lives of \n     more than 300,000 Americans alive today.\n       Each year amounts within the Fund would automatically be \n     allotted to each of the NIH Institutes and Centers. Five \n     percent of the monies would be directed to extramural \n     construction and renovation of research facilities, the \n     National Library of Medicine, and the Office of the Director. \n     So that an appropriate range of basic and applied research is \n     supported, each Institute and Center would receive the same \n     percentage of the remaining Fund monies as they received of \n     the total NIH appropriation for that fiscal year. In order to \n     insure that the additional funds generated do not simply \n     replace regularly appropriated NIH funds, monies from the \n     Fund would be released only if the total appropriated for the \n     NIH in that year equal or exceed the prior year \n     appropriations.\n       Additional monies for the Fund would be generated by a \n     voluntary federal income tax check-off. Every year, when \n     filing their Federal income tax returns, Americans would have \n     the opportunity to designate tax overpayments and \n     contributions for health research. Monies from the check-off \n     would be deposited in the Fund.\n       Why is this proposal necessary?\n       Health research has brought us the advances in treatment \n     and prevention of disease and disability that define our \n     current high standards of medical practice. Perhaps more than \n     any other component of our health care system, health \n     research holds the promise of both reducing medical costs and \n     improving the quality of life of Americans. Yet, because the \n     federal budget agreement freezes discretionary spending for \n     the next four years, Federal funding for health research will \n     likely not even keep up with inflation unless a separate \n     funding stream is established.\n       Will the Fund simply replace existing monies appropriated \n     to NIH?\n       No. Monies generated by the Fund would be in addition to, \n     not in replacement of those provided to each of the NIH \n     Institutes in the normal appropriations process. Monies from \n     the Fund could not be allotted unless total NIH \n     appropriations in that year were equal to or greater than the \n     prior year appropriations. Therefore, the Fund could not be \n     used as a mechanism to replace or reduce regularly \n     appropriated funds.\n       How would money from the Fund be allocated among research \n     priorities?\n       The proposal does not pick winners and losers among areas \n     of health research. It does not interfere with the funding \n     decisions made through the normal appropriations process. \n     Funds would be allocated to each of the NIH Institutes and \n     Centers based on the percentage that each of these entities \n     received of the total NIH appropriation for that year. Monies \n     allotted to each NIH entity would be spent according to a \n     plan developed by the entities' advisory council in \n     consultation with the NIH Director. Each Institute would \n     decide the appropriate distribution of Fund monies among \n     various research priorities within the Institute.\n       In recognition of the poor state of many medical research \n     facilities, 2 percent of the total Fund would be taken off \n     the top for extramural construction and renovation of \n     research building and facilities. In accordance with \n     traditional funding patterns, 1 percent of the total Fund \n     would go to the National Library of Medicine. An additional 2 \n     percent would go to the NIH Director for intramural \n     construction and renovation and other activities supported by \n     the Office of the Director.\n       Isn't research a major reason why the cost of health care \n     is so high in this country? Won't an increase in research \n     funding lead to an increase in health care costs?\n       Absolutely not. Funding for research can be an effective \n     means of controlling health costs in the long run. Investment \n     in research pays off in terms of lower medical expenses, \n     reduced worker absenteeism, and improved productivity. For \n     example, according to NIH statistics, an investment of $1.2 \n     million in the development of a mass screening device for \n     neonatal hypothyroidism in newborns has the potential 1-year \n     saving of over $206 million. An investment of slightly over \n     $679,000 for a treatment for preventing the recurrence of \n     kidney stones saves close to $300 million in annual treatment \n     costs and lost days work.\n       Today, many families are anxiously looking for a treatment \n     and cure of Alzheimer's disease. Federally supported funding \n     for research on Alzheimer's disease totals $300 million \n     annually on caring for people with Alzheimer's. A cure or \n     treatment for Alzheimer's, in addition to relieving \n     suffering, would result in enormous savings.\n       Won't more research lead to the development and over \n     utilization of new tests and expensive equipment?\n       There are legitimate concerns about the over utilization \n     and duplication of expensive technologies. These concerns \n     should be addressed by an increased emphasis on outcomes and \n     effectiveness research. We should solve the problem of over \n     utilization of services but not at the expense of improving \n     quality and coming up with more effective treatments and \n     cures.\n       Do the American people support increases in tobacco taxes \n     to pay for increases in health research?\n       Polling data consistently show that more than two-thirds of \n     Republican and Democratic voters, including voters in \n     tobacco-growing states, favor raising tobacco taxes if \n     revenues are dedicated to health-related activities.\n       Does the proposal include prevention research?\n       Absolutely. Research is our first line of defense. It is \n     the ultimate investment in prevention. Research provides the \n     building blocks for prevention--research has produced \n     immunizations, critical information about the importance of \n     diet and exercise in preventing disease, and a screening test \n     to prevent the transmission of HIV through blood products. \n     Research is the key to prevention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               Cancer Understanding and Research Efforts\n\n                        (Statement of Zenia Kim)\n\n       The CURE program is designed to focus on two areas of \n     cancer treatment: prevention and research.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       I remember when I was attending Junior High and High \n     School, I never really learned about cancer or the risk \n     factors involved. When I was a senior in high school, a very \n     close relative of mine became very ill and was diagnosed with \n     cancer. She started chemotherapy treatment but things got \n     worse. I promised myself at that moment that I was going to \n     perform my own research on cancer. What caused this disease \n     and why wasn't my loved one getting better? I began \n     volunteering at our local hospital in the Pathology lab, \n     where I observed doctors examining various forms of cancers. \n     I learned how to spot cancers of all sorts. As I continued my \n     education at Brigham Young University, I continued with my \n     cancer research. I worked with a Chemistry professor by the \n     name of Dr. James Thorne, and he assisted me in understanding \n     the chemical aspect of cancer research. We worked on a \n     treatment called Photodynamic Therapy. This form of cancer \n     treatment became very appealing because it did not have as \n     many negative side effects that chemotherapy had. I became so \n     involved with the research that I wrote my own paper on \n     Photodynamic Therapy. I am still continuing my research with \n     Dr. Thorne for the third year, and hope that this is our real \n     breakthrough in curing cancer. While I \n\n[[Page S 13734]]\n     was performing research on Photodynamic Therapy, I really wanted to \n     continue my volunteer work in a hospital setting. I \n     volunteered at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in the \n     Oncology Department. Here, I got to experience the other \n     side, the patient's side. I remember talking with many cancer \n     patients and listening to their distress, their hopeless \n     feelings. I became so determined . . . that I was going to \n     find a cure for cancer. As my research continued at BYU, I \n     discovered that research funds were very limited. The \n     national funding organizations can hardly support any of the \n     proposals coming in. As a future medical research specialist, \n     I became disheartened. Over the summer, I worked at Oregon \n     Health Sciences University Medical School performing medical \n     cancer research, and there too discovered the limited funding \n     available for research. This is why I became so inspired to \n     develop my own program called the CURE.\n\n\n               cancer understanding and research efforts\n\n       The CURE focuses on two areas of cancer treatment. The \n     first is prevention. I believe that if many students learned \n     about the risks involved with cancer as a junior high or high \n     school student, there would be a significant decrease in the \n     incidents of cancer. I would like to see a unit integrated \n     within the health curriculum that emphasizes the risks of \n     cancer. Furthermore, I would like to invite guest speakers, \n     perhaps one who has fought and recovered from cancer or the \n     loved ones of a cancer victim, to tell about their side of \n     their story. I think that by personalizing a real situation, \n     students feel more sensitive and more in tune with the \n     problem. That is exactly what we need. We need students to \n     feel realistic, sad, or even scared so that they won't \n     associate with any of the risks involved with cancer. The \n     decisions that students in their junior high and high school \n     years make can indefinitely affect the course of their lives. \n     Furthermore, this is the time that they opt to engage in such \n     acts as smoking, using tobacco, sun tanning, etc. So, \n     by integrating a cancer unit within secondary education, \n     the hope is that the future generations will choose to \n     stay risk free and beat the battle against cancer.\n       The second area of cancer treatment that the CURE focuses \n     on is research. Prevention is great to eliminate cancer but \n     for those already afflicted with cancer, there must be \n     another alternative. I would like to personally declare, to \n     those of all ages, that research is the first and most \n     important step towards cancer cure. By understanding the \n     mechanism of how cancer cells undergo their uncontrolled rate \n     of division, we can come closer to finding the right reagents \n     to stop it. I know that cancer research has been going on for \n     many years, and I believe that we are coming so much closer \n     to the cure. We really need to support the research funding. \n     I have sadly discovered that less than 10 percent of all the \n     proposals that are sent to large funding organizations, such \n     as the National Institute of Health, actually get funded. \n     This to me is a horrifying reality. But the question always \n     seems to be, ``Where are we going to get the money?'' I \n     believe that we can first start with larger corporations. \n     They have elicited a certain percentage of their profits into \n     donations. I would like to encourage those corporations to \n     donate more of their profits into research. Also, I support \n     Senator Hatfield's and Senator Harkin's Trust Fund Proposal \n     in allocating more money towards research from a tobacco tax. \n     By raising the tobacco tax by a small fraction, we will not \n     destroy the tobacco industry and we will be able to fund more \n     scientific discoveries. As a future medical scientist, I \n     would like to know that there will be enough funding \n     available to pursue my research endeavors. I love research \n     and I thrive off making new scientific discoveries. I just \n     hope that I can continue my love for research when I work in \n     my own laboratory someday soon.\n       As Miss Tri-Valley, I have actually had the opportunity to \n     speak to students in junior high and high schools throughout \n     the Beaverton/Portland area. I always emphasize these two \n     important points that I have established in the CURE Program: \n     Prevention and Research--these are our two means of defeating \n     cancer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                               September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The American Lung Association \n     strongly endorses the legislation you are introducing today, \n     Research Trust Fund Act. Enactment of the Research Trust Fund \n     Act will be a win-win proposition for the health and well-\n     being of the American people.\n       The Research Trust Fund Act will save lives through \n     prevention. Each year 419,000 Americans die from causes \n     directly related to tobacco use and thousands more die from \n     diseases caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. \n     These preventable deaths represents a huge human loss to our \n     society. The proposed $0.25 increase in the federal excise \n     tax on tobacco products will help reduce the number of people \n     who smoke. It is estimated that for every $0.25 increased in \n     the federal tobacco tax, about one million people living \n     today will be discouraged from smoking and 200,000 to 300,000 \n     premature deaths will be prevented.\n       The Research Trust Fund Act will save health care dollars. \n     The cost of treating people who suffer from tobacco related \n     illnesses places a staggering financial burden on the \n     American health care system. Although smokers tend to die \n     younger, over the course of their life, current and former \n     smokers generate an estimated $501 billion in excess health \n     care costs. Treating tobacco related illnesses cost the $21 \n     billion per year, with an additional estimated cost of $47 \n     billion in lost productivity. Reducing the number of people \n     who use tobacco products by increasing the federal tobacco \n     tax will help reduce the economic burden tobacco consumption \n     places on the U.S. health care system.\n       The Research Trust Fund Act will save lives through \n     improved treatments and cures. The estimated $4 billion to $5 \n     billion generated by the Research Trust Fund will provided \n     needed additional funding for biomedical research sponsored \n     by the National Institutes of Health. Through increased \n     support of basic and clinical biomedical research at the \n     National Institutes of Health, researchers will continue to \n     broaden our understanding of life sciences and develop new \n     approaches to preventing, treating, and curing disease.\n       The American Lung Association and its volunteers stand \n     ready to work with you and Congress to enact this important \n     legislation. I would also like to take this opportunity to \n     commend you for your leadership and foresight in introducing \n     the Research Trust Fund Act. The Research Trust Fund will go \n     a long way to improving the health of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Jacqueline D. McLeod, MPH, M.Ed,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Federation of American\n\n\n                           Societies for Experimental Biology,\n\n                                 Bethesda, MD, September 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Federation of American Societies for \n     Experimental Biology (FASEB) supports with enthusiasm your \n     efforts to provide supplemental resources for NIH and \n     biomedical research.\n       The Federation concurs that the federal commitment to \n     health research is grossly underfunded. Less than 3 percent \n     of the nearly one trillion dollars our Nation spends on \n     health care is devoted to health research, while the defense \n     industry spends 15 percent of its budget on research. Ample \n     evidence exists to demonstrate that health research has \n     improved the quality of health care in the United States, and \n     is one of the best methods of health care cost containment.\n       Therefore, FASEB supports the proposal to create an \n     additional source of biomedical funding, such as through the \n     National Fund for Health Research Act. We are confident that \n     these additional funds would not be used to offset regular \n     appropriations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Ralph A. Bradshaw, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Committee To Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the nearly six million \n     members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, I am writing in strong support \n     of your legislation to increase medical research funding to \n     the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       Increased research into the causes and potential cures of \n     many diseases related to aging could have a profound impact \n     on the lives of older Americans and their families. \n     Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder, afflicts \n     about 4 million people in the United States, and costs the \n     nation an estimated $80 billion to $100 billion a year. \n     Osteoporosis, which causes fragile bones and painfully \n     crippling fractures, costs an estimated $10 billion a year. \n     When families can no longer meet the care needs of relatives \n     with these illnesses, disabled people often end up in nursing \n     homes, where bills totaled $69.6 billion in 1993.\n       The Hatfield/Harkin Research Fund legislation to be \n     introduced today is a significant step forward to find cures \n     or better treatments, save lives and dollars. We commend you \n     on your long-time commitment to medical research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    American Medical Colleges,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatfield and Harkin: The Association of \n     American Medical Colleges (AAMC) strongly endorses your \n     proposal to create a National Fund for Health Research. The \n     debate on this year's budget makes it clear that we must \n     identify additional, sustainable sources of funding to \n     supplement the regular appropriation for the National \n\n[[Page S 13735]]\n     Institutes of Health [NIH] if we are to continue to rely upon \n     scientific discovery to improve the health and quality of \n     life for all Americans. In addition, sustained support for \n     the NIH is needed if the United States is to maintain its \n     position as the world's leader in biomedical and behavioral \n     research. The fund you propose is an innovative and necessary \n     complement to NIH funding.\n       The Federal Government plays a necessary role in the \n     support of this nation's biomedical and behavioral research \n     efforts. The investment that the Federal Government has made \n     in the NIH has produced a comprehensive network of \n     scientists, physicians, and technicians at more than 1,700 \n     institutions across the United States dedicated to the \n     continued pursuit of fundamental knowledge and the \n     application of this information to the prevention, diagnosis, \n     and treatment of disease. NIH-supported scientists have made \n     enormous contributions to the nation's health. In addition, \n     NIH-sponsored research has made significant economic \n     contributions, both locally and nationally. The role that the \n     U.S. biotechnology industry plays globally is just one \n     example of the economic benefits to be derived from NIH \n     research.\n       Moreover, your proposal addresses a major cause of disease \n     and death in this country: tobacco. As health professionals, \n     we must do everything in our power to reduce the use of \n     tobacco in this country, particularly among children and \n     teenagers. Your bill is an important part of that strategy. \n     We will work with you to urge all health-related \n     organizations and institutions to support this proposal and \n     to encourage other Senators to cosponsor it.\n       Finally, on behalf of the Association's members, I wish to \n     thank you for your leadership and unfailing commitment to a \n     strong, vital medical research effort in this country. We \n     appreciate the continued support and trust that you have \n     placed in the NIH, and by implication in our institutions and \n     faculty. We look forward to continuing to work with you to \n     sustain this national treasure that is so critically \n     important to the nation's health.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                             Jordan J. Cohen, M.D.\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          American Cancer Society,\n\n\n                                National Public Issues Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of more than two million \n     American Cancer Society volunteers, I am writing to commend \n     you and Senator Harkin for your leadership in introducing the \n     National Fund for Health Research Act. Your proposal combines \n     two critical initiatives: increasing biomedical research \n     funding and protecting children from tobacco addiction by \n     raising tobacco taxes. The American Cancer Society strongly \n     supports this bill.\n       Increasing funding for biomedical research is a top \n     priority for all health organizations that understand the \n     role such research plays in treating diseases, reducing \n     suffering, improving the efficiency of our health care system \n     and improving the health status of the entire nation. The \n     American Cancer Society is particularly concerned about the \n     rise in cancer rates. Cancer will become the leading cause of \n     death in the United States by the year 2000. Biomedical \n     research performed by the National Institutes of Health is of \n     vital importance in the fight against cancer. The United \n     States currently devotes less than 3 percent of health care \n     spending to research. This amount is unacceptably low as a \n     matter of health and economics.\n       There is no more appropriate way to finance this bill than \n     through a tobacco tax increase. By itself, this tax will \n     discourage about 1.3 million children and adults from smoking \n     and will ultimately save the lives of more than 300,000 \n     Americans alive today. Raising tobacco taxes is one of the \n     most important measures we can take to reduce the current \n     epidemic of tobacco use by teenagers.\n       More than two-thirds of Republican and Democratic voters, \n     including voters from tobacco-growing states, supports \n     raising tobacco taxes for health-related purposes such as \n     this.\n       You have our full support. We look forward to working with \n     you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kerrie B. Wilson,\n       National Vice President for Government Relations, American \n     Cancer Society.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Medical Research and Health Care Concerns: A Survey of the American \n                                 Public\n\n          (Conducted by Louis Harris & Associates, June 1995)\n\n       A nationwide Harris telephone poll was conducted of 1004 \n     adults in the United States from June 8-11, 1995. Figures for \n     age, sex, race, education, and region were weighted where \n     necessary to bring them into line with their actual \n     proportions in the population. The margin of error for the \n     survey is approximately 3.1 percent.\n       Research! America, a national not-for-profit organization \n     dedicated to raising public awareness of and support for \n     medical research, commissioned Louis Harris & Associates to \n     ask questions about medical research as a part of a larger \n     survey focusing on a broad range of current issues.\n\n\n                               HIGHLIGHTS\n\n       1. Americans oppose cuts in medical research dollars.\n       Respondents were told that one impact of proposed changes \n     in the Federal budget would be less money going to \n     universities and their hospitals which teach medical students \n     and do medical research. When asked whether they favored or \n     opposed these changes in the Federal budget, 65% opposed \n     proposed cuts in Federal support for universities and \n     hospitals.\n       The younger those surveyed, the higher their response: \n     Among 18-24 year-olds, the opposition to the proposed cuts \n     rises to 75%; among 15-29 year-olds, the opposition to the \n     proposed cuts is 72%.\n       2. Americans would pay higher taxes to support medical \n     research.\n       73% would be willing to pay a dollar more perweek in taxes \n     if they knew the money would be spent on medical research to \n     better diagnose, prevent and treat disease.\n       Results from a November, 1993 Harris Poll were very \n     similar--74% were willing to pay a dollar more per week in \n     taxes if spent on medical research.\n       3. Americans urge Congress to provide tax incentives for \n     private industry to conduct medical research.\n       61% of those surveyed want their Senators and \n     Representatives to support legislation that would give tax \n     credits to private industries to conduct more medical \n     research.\n       4. Americans are willing to designate tax refund dollars \n     for medical research.\n       45% would probably, and 15% would definitely check off a \n     box on their federal income tax return to designate tax \n     refund money specifically for medical research.\n       When asked how much money they would be willing to \n     designate to medical research, the median amount reported was \n     $23.\n       5. Americans overwhelmingly value maintaining the United \n     States' position as a leader in medical research.\n       94% of those surveyed believe that it is important that the \n     United States maintains its role as a world leader in medical \n     research!\n       6. Americans heartily endorse having the Federal Government \n     support basic science research.\n       Those surveyed were asked if they agree or disagree with \n     the following: ``Even if it brings no immediate benefits, \n     basic science research which advances the frontiers of \n     knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the Federal \n     Government.''\n       69% of respondent agree; 79% of young people ages 18-24 \n     agree with the need to support basic research.\n       7. Medical research takes second place only to national, \n     defense for tax dollar value.\n       While 45% gave federal defense spending the highest rating \n     for tax dollar value, second place went to medical research \n     with 37% of the respondents giving it a favorable tax dollar \n     value.\n       Public education and federal anti-crime efforts ranked the \n     lowest.\n       8. Americans want more information about medical research \n     in the print and broadcast media.\n       61% of the Americans surveyed would like to see more \n     medical research information in newspaper, magazines and on \n     television.\n       77% of young people 18-24 want more medical research \n     information from these sources.\n       For further information on the survey or

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Hatfield to \nintroduce the Fund for Health Research Act. This legislation is similar \nto legislation that the two of us introduced during the last Congress \nwhich gained broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\n  Our proposal would establish a national fund for health research to \nprovide additional resources for health research over and above those \nprovided to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in the annual \nappropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance the quality of \nhealth care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures and \nmore cost effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions \nthat strike Americans.\n  The fund would be financed by a 25-cent tax on each pack of \ncigarettes and an equivalent tax on other tobacco products such as \nsnuff and chewing tobacco. This tax would raise an estimated $4.2 \nbillion annually.\n\n[[Page S 13737]]\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to providing revenue for health research, \nraising tobacco taxes will protect children and save lives. Every day \nmore than 3,000 children become smokers and more than 1,000 of them \nwill eventually die as a result of smoking. Raising tobacco taxes is a \nhighly effective way to reduce tobacco use by children. A 25-cent tax \nwill discourage an estimated 1.3 million children and adults from \nsmoking and will save the lives of more than 300,000 Americans alive \ntoday.\n  Additional moneys for the fund would be generated by a voluntary \nFederal income tax check-off. Every year, when filing their Federal \nincome tax returns, Americans would be given the opportunity to \ndesignate tax overpayments and contributions for health research. \nMoneys from the check-off would be deposited in the fund.\n  Each year under our proposal amounts within the national fund for \nhealth research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH \ninstitutes and centers. Each institute and center would receive the \nsame percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for \nthat fiscal year.\n  Last year Senator Hatfield and I argued that any health care reform \nplan should include additional funding for health research. Health care \nreform has been taken off the front burner but the need to increase our \nNation's commitment to health research has not diminished.\n  While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our \nmedical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States \ndevotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health \nresearch. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on \nresearch. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war \nagainst disease and disability continues.\n\n  Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health \ncosts in the long run. If we can find the cure for a disease like \nAlzheimer's the savings would be enormous. Today, federally supported \nfunding for research on Alzheimer's disease totals $300 million yet it \nis estimated that nearly $100 billion is expended annually on caring \nfor people with Alzheimer's.\n  Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could \neliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving \npatients' quality of life.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hatfield and I do everything we can to \nincrease funding for NIH through the appropriations process. But, given \nthe current budget situation and freeze in discretionary spending what \nwe can do is limited. Without action, our investment in medical \nresearch through the NIH is likely to continue to decline in real \nterms.\n  The NIH is not able to fund even 25 percent of competing research \nprojects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is \ncompared to rates of 30 percent or more just a decade ago. Science and \ncutting edge medical research is being put on hold. We may be giving up \npossible cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and countless \nother diseases.\n  Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young \npeople from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people \nunder the age of 36 even apply for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid \nthat the lower success rates among all applicants is making biomedical \nresearch less and less attractive to young people. If the perception is \nthat funding for research is impossible to obtain, young people that \nmay have chosen medical research 10 years ago will choose other career \npaths.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that over 130 groups representing \npatients, hospitals, medical schools, researchers, and millions of \nAmericans have already endorsed our proposal. And, polling data \nconsistently show that more than two-thirds of Republican and \nDemocratic voters, including votes in tobacco-growing States, favor \nraising tobacco taxes if funds will be devoted to health related \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, health research is an investment in our future--it is \nan investment in our children and grandchildren. It holds the promise \nof cure or treatment for millions of Americans.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Santorum, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1252. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives to stimulate economic growth in depressed \nareas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the enhanced enterprise zone act of 1995\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senators \nLieberman, Santorum, DeWine, and Moseley-Braun in introducing the \nEnhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995, legislation to stimulate job \ncreation and residential growth in America's most distressed rural and \nurban communities.\n  In 1980, then-Representative Jack Kemp introduced the first \nenterprise zone legislation in the United States, the Urban Jobs and \nEnterprise Zone Act. Twelve years later, the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993 authorized over 100 enterprise and \nempowerment zones to receive a limited combination of tax benefits and \nother Federal assistance to support economic revitalization and \ncommunity development.\n  For truly distressed communities, however, there is concern that this \npackage of benefits will not be sufficient to spur economic growth and \njob creation. This concern was reaffirmed by the Senate earlier this \nweek during consideration of S. 4, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. On \nWednesday, September 13, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment \ncalling on Congress to enact enterprise zone legislation that includes \nstronger incentives for investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n  At a time when Congress is debating the merits of the Federal welfare \nsystem and looking at reforms to our social safety net, it is \nimperative that we look for ways to stimulate new opportunities for \nwork and growth in our most distressed neighborhoods.\n  For that reason, today my colleagues and I are introducing \nlegislation to supercharge existing enterprise communities and \nempowerment zones. These enhanced enterprise zones would encourage \nentrepreneurial and residential activity by:\n  Establishing a capital gains rate of zero for the sale of any \nqualified investments that are held for at least 5 years;\n  Permitting limited income deductions for the purchase of qualified \nstock in businesses located in an enterprise zone;\n  Doubling the amount small business owners in these zones are allowed \nto expense;\n  Providing a limited tax credit for low-income renovations;\n  Loosening regulatory barriers to home ownership and job creation;\n  Providing incentives and grants for resident management and home \nownership of public housing; and\n  Creating a pilot school choice program for the existing empowerment \nzones, supplemental empowerment zones, and Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, for economically troubled areas, attracting \nentrepreneurial businesses is the key to beginning the process of \nrevitalization. The tax benefits of enhanced enterprise zones are \ntargeted at addressing the principal hurdles facing small businesses \nwhen they are just getting started--raising capital and maintaining \ncash flow.\n  First, we eliminate taxation on capital gains. The United States has \nsome of the highest capital gains taxes in the world. For distressed \ncommunities seeking capital investments, these taxes inhibit investment \nand lockout sources of growth. Our bill establishes a capital gains \nrate of zero for the sale of any qualified zone stock, business \nproperty, or partnership interest that has been held for at least 5 \nyears.\n  Second, we encourage investment in enterprise zones through the \ncreation of enterprise zone stock. Ask small business entrepreneurs \nwhat their biggest hurdle is, and chances are they will reply--raising \ncapital. This legislation allows individuals to deduct the purchase of \nqualified enterprise zone stock from their income--up to $100,000 in \none year and $500,000 in their lifetime.\n  Third, we provide small enterprise zone businesses with extra \nexpensing. Another obstacle particularly difficult \n\n[[Page S 13738]]\nfor small businesses to overcome is maintaining an adequate cash flow. \nOur legislation would double the maximum allowable expensing for \npurchases of plant and equipment in the enterprise zones.\n  Fourth, we encourage the renovation of deteriorated buildings located \nin the enterprise zones. This proposal is based upon legislation \nintroduced by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and it is designed to \nencourage private investment in economically distressed areas by \nproviding a targeted, limited tax credit to businesses to help defray \ntheir cost of construction, expansion, and renovation of buildings \nlocated within enhanced enterprise zones.\n  Another obstacle to growth and jobs in distressed communities is the \nburden of regulation on small businesses. Our bill would create a \nprocess by which local governments could request a waiver or \nmodification of regulations that hinder the job creation, community \ndevelopment, or economic revitalization objectives of the enterprise \nzone. The relevant Federal agencies would have the discretion to \napprove or disapprove of any regulatory waiver or modification. \nFurthermore, they would be prohibited from granting regulatory waivers \nthat would violate the Fair Labor Standards Act or present a \nsignificant risk to public health, safety, or the environment.\n  To help low-income families become homeowners with a stake in their \ncommunities, our legislation would establish an Enterprise Zone Home \nOwnership Program. Based upon Jack Kemp's proposals when he was the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, this proposal would provide \ngrants for: First, resident management of public housing; and second, \nhome ownership of public housing, vacant and foreclosed properties, and \nfinancially distressed properties.\n  Finally, within the nine empowerment zones, two supplemental \nempowerment zones, and Washington, DC, our bill would create a pilot \nschool choice project to provide low-income parents and their children \nwith financial assistance to enable them to select the public or \nprivate school of their choice. Under this plan, a designated grantee \nwithin each empowerment zone will provide parents with educational \ncertificates to be used towards the cost of tuition and transportation \nfor elementary or secondary schools within the empowerment zones.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, will enhanced enterprise zones work? \nThe answer, quite simply, is yes. We know they will work because 35 \nStates and the District of Columbia already have enterprise zones that \nhave produced over 663,000 jobs and $40 billion in capital investment. \nThe enterprise zone concept has been endorsed by the National \nGovernor's Association, the Conference of Black Mayors, the Council of \nBlack State Legislators, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  This bill represents an affirmative effort to create economic \nopportunities for the urban and rural poor by recognizing that private \nenterprise, not government, is the source of economic and social \ndevelopment. Taken as a whole, the incentives included in this \nlegislation for investment, entrepreneurship, home ownership, and skill \ndevelopment will being economies in distressed areas back to life. They \nwill encourage full participation in our market economy and public \ninterest in local neighborhoods--resulting in economic growth and new \njobs.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I'm delighted to join in the \nintroduction of this important legislation, the Enhanced Enterprise \nZone Act of 1995.\n  Last week, this body unanimously approved an amendment calling on \nCongress to enact legislation to supercharge the enterprise communities \nand empowerment zones we created in 1993. While the 1993 legislation \ncreating these entities was not perfect and the legislation did not go \nfar enough, particularly for the enterprise communities, it represented \na fundamental change in urban policy. I believe that legislation was a \nclear recognition of the fact that government does not have all the \nanswers to the ills of poverty in this country and that American \nbusiness can and must play a role in revitalizing poor neighborhoods.\n  The 1993 legislation was a good start but it did not go far enough. \nThe bill we are introducing today takes us further down the road of \nattacking the problems that plague our cities and economically \ndistressed rural areas.\n  I should note that I do have concerns with some of the provisions of \nthe regulatory flexibility title of this bill. For example, I think we \nmust work on making changes to provide greater assurance that any \nmodifications or waivers of rules would not in any way compromise the \nbenefits that are achieved through existing environmental protection \nand public health laws and regulations. I hope that these provisions \ncan be worked on as this bill progresses through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Given that reservation, I believe this is an important bill that will \ndo much to provide an economic boost to the areas of this country that \nmost desperately need that help.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Shelby):\n  S. 1253.

A bill to disapprove of amendments to the Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines relating to lowering of crack sentences and sentences for \nmoney laundering and transactions in property derived from unlawful \nactivity; read the first time.\n\n\n                           DRUGS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am today introducing two bills, \nboth of which address one of the most serious problems facing this \ncountry today: the epidemic of drugs in our Nation.\n  The purpose of each bill is simple. The first bill would prevent \nreductions in crack cocaine penalties proposed by the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission from taking effect. The second would raise the penalties for \ndistributors of powder cocaine by applying existing mandatory minimums \nto a larger group of cocaine dealers.\n  No problem has parents more worried than the drugs and violence so \nprevalent today in schools throughout the Nation. All of us spend a lot \nof time fretting about how to protect our kids and keep them from \ngetting caught up in drugs and gangs and the terrible dangers they \ncreate.\n  Nevertheless, on April 11, by a 4 to 3 vote, the Sentencing \nCommission proposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines dealing \nwith crack distribution and possession.\n  According to the Department of Justice, the effect of these \namendments would be to lower base sentences dramatically for criminals \nwho deal in crack cocaine. New sentences for these criminals would be \nbetween one-half and one-sixth their present length. Some drug dealers \nnow subject to substantial prison sentences could end up serving no \njailtime at all.\n  In my judgment, this sends entirely the wrong message: that in the \nwar against crack, society has blinked.\n  That is not what we should be telling the crack dealers.\n  That is not what we should be telling concerned parents across this \nNation.\n  And that is not what we should be telling the brave law-abiding \nmembers of our communities who are fighting back against the crack \ndealers.\n  Accordingly, the first bill I am introducing simply says: This shall \nnot happen. It blocks these guideline changes, changes that otherwise \nwould automatically become effective on November 1.\n  The principal reason the Sentencing Commission gave for lowering \nsentences for crack dealing was fairness. The Commission was concerned \nthat a powder cocaine dealer has to distribute 100 times more powder \ncocaine than a crack dealer to receive the same sentence as the crack \ndealer.\n  The Commission believes that this disparity creates a perception of \nunfairness because a substantial majority of convicted crack dealers \nare African-Americans, whereas a majority of convicted powder dealers \nare not. It further believes that the solution to this \n\n[[Page S 13739]]\n\nperception is to drastically lower crack sentences.\n  I believe the Commission is wrong on two scores. First, the \nCommission itself has given several strong reasons why it is entirely \nlegitimate for our laws to punish crack distribution more severely than \ndistribution of powder cocaine, and there are some reasons even beyond \nthose the Commission gave.\n  Second, there is some basis for believing that the differential in \nthe sentences may be too great. But the answer is not to lower the \ncrack sentences. The answer is to toughen the powder sentences. That is \nwhat I am proposing in the second bill I am introducing today.\n  As to the first point: The Commission itself, in a report issued just \nthis February, recognized that there is a strong foundation for \nCongress' original decision to punish distributors of crack more \nseverely than distributors of powder cocaine.\n  That is a judgment every U.S. Court of Appeals that has considered \nthe question has shared. As the Commission explained, crack is more \naddictive, provides a more intense high, is easier to use, does greater \nharm, and is associated with greater violence than simple powder.\n  Though powder cocaine and crack contain the same active ingredient, \nthe cocaine alkaloid, crack is far more attractive and addictive. This \nis primarily because crack is easily smoked while powder is injected or \nsnorted.\n  Smoking is one of the quickest methods of maximizing the drugs \neffects. The quicker the cocaine reaches the brain, the greater the \neffect, the shorter the effects duration and the greater the likelihood \ncocaine use will lead to dependence and abuse.\n  Furthermore, somebody who has never used drugs before is much more \nlikely to try a drug by smoking it than by injecting it. It is \nunpleasant and requires some expertise to inject oneself with a foreign \nsubstance. Smoking seems casual and easy. Therefore it is no surprise \nthat three times more people smoke cocaine than inject it.\n  Crack is also associated with systemic violence to a greater degree \nthan powder cocaine. Use and distribution of crack are also associated \nmore generally with enhanced criminal activity of all types.\n  Crack is also more dangerous in other ways. It produces more medical \nemergencies than snorting powder or injecting cocaine. And it is sold \nin small quantities at affordable, even cheap, prices--making it easier \nfor small kids to get and use.\n  In short, crack is a very dangerous drug. The response it calls for \nis surely not to lower penalties for the people who distribute it to \none-half to one-sixth their present length.\n  The second reason the Sentencing Commission's reasoning is unsound is \nthat differential treatment of crack and powder cocaine is far from \nunique in drug sentencing. To the contrary, in other instances as well \nwe treat source and derivative drugs differently in terms of the \nquantities an individual must distribute to trigger the same sentence.\n  For example, a distributor of a given amount of heroin--a derivative \nof opium just as crack is a derivative of powder cocaine--gets the same \nsentence as somebody who has distributed 20 times that amount of opium. \nSimilarly, a distributor of smokeable methamphetamine, or ice, gets the \nsame sentence as somebody who has distributed ten times that amount of \nregular methamphetamine.\n  Third, the Commission's proposed changes are incompatible with the \nstatutory mandatory minimum sentences that Congress has established for \ndistribution of crack cocaine.\n  Congress set the trigger amounts based on its view of the seriousness \nof the crack epidemic and the key role played by retail distributors. \nCongress deliberately decided that Federal enforcement should focus on \nboth traffickers in high places in the processing or distribution chain \nand the managers of retail level traffic. Congress thought both were \nserious traffickers because they keep the street markets going.\n  The Commission recognized when it forwarded its amendments to the \nCongress that they are inconsistent with present law. Rather than \nadjusting its guidelines to conform with congressional directives, \nhowever, as has always previously been its practice, the Commission has \ninstead elected to change the guidelines and ask Congress that it \nadjust the laws to accommodate the Commission's views.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the Commission's solution to this \nunfairness is in fact quite unfair to the law abiding citizens \neverywhere trying to fight back against crack dealers. And many of \nthese antidrug activists themselves are African-Americans.\n  The Commission's proposals are not fair to the children in schools \nwracked by drug-induced violence. They are not fair to those children's \nparents, who want the Government to use every tool it can to protect \ntheir kids. And they are not fair to the vast majority of people living \nin communities, like Detroit, trying as hard as they can to defend \ntheir neighborhoods against unceasing attacks by crack dealers. The \nlast thing most of these people want is for the Federal Government to \nrelax its efforts in combatting the scourge of crack.\n  That is not to say that I have no sympathy with the Sentencing \nCommission's concern that the higher crack sentences create a \nperception of unfairness. I am particularly troubled because present \nlaw has resulted, at least occasionally, in insufficiently severe \npunishment of kingpins at the top of crack distribution chains when \ncompared with punishments meted out to retail dealers.\n  The problem is that some of these kingpins take the precaution of \ndistributing their product in powder rather than in crack form. Because \nof where the powder triggers are set, some of these individuals have \nreceived considerably less than the mandatory 5 year penalty even while \nthe retail distributors, who are distributing the final product, are \nreceiving at least 5 year sentences.\n  As I said before, though, in my view, however, the answer to these \nproblems is not to lower the crack sentences. Instead we should toughen \nthe powder sentences.\n  That is why the second bill I am introducing proposes to raise \nsentences for powder distribution by making the triggers for mandatory \nminimums 100 grams for 5 years and 1,000 grams for 10 years, rather \nthan 500 and 5,000 as they are now. That would also mean that the \nquantity ratio for powder and crack would be 20 to 1, the same as the \none between opium and its very dangerous and addictive derivative \nheroin.\n  I am pleased that I have been joined in the effort to block the crack \nguideline changes by a number of distinguished colleagues, including my \ngood friend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Senator Hatch, the \nformer chairman of that committee, Senator Thurmond, and Senators \nGrassley, Kyl, Feinstein, and Shelby.\n  The Department of Justice likewise opposes the Sentencing \nCommission's proposals and has asked Congress to block them.\n  It is my firm expectation that the Congress will act promptly on this \nmeasure to prevent these changes from taking effect on November 1.\n  I also will ask the Congress to take up in short order my proposal to \ntoughen the sentences for powder dealers. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in promoting tough, fair sentences for all drug \ndealers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                                    ____\n  Detroit Branch--National Association for the Advancement of Colored \n                                People,\n\n                                      Detroit, MI, August 8, 1995.\n\n                Detroit Branch--NAACP Official Statement\n\n       Detroit, MI.--The current issue of the sentencing policy \n     regarding ``crack'' and powdered cocaine is one that grips at \n     the very heart and soul of our society. The jails are filled \n     with young people, particularly young African American and \n     Hispanic males and females, for the selling of these drugs.\n       The Detroit Branch of the NAACP, which is the largest \n     branch in the nation with over 51,000 members, has \n     articulated a very specific concern in the gross inequities \n     in the sentencing policies for the sale of ``crack'' cocaine \n     as compared to the sale of powdered cocaine. Drugs are in \n     fact destroying the very spirit of our communities and are \n     usurping the energy and vitality of our youth. It has been \n     our very specific hope that legislation would be implemented \n     to equalize the penalties for identical quantities of \n     powdered cocaine and ``crack.'' \n\n[[Page S 13740]]\n     Please note for the record that we do not condone, support, encourage \n     or sympathize with any of those who would sell this death and \n     destruction to our community. We believe that this is the \n     scourge of our nation. Yet, at the same time we recognize \n     that young African American and Hispanic individuals do not \n     fly, ship or transport these drugs into the streets of \n     Detroit, Chicago, Washington, D.C. or Los Angeles.\n       We are very pleased to note the effort to address with a \n     more systematic commitment to equity, punishment that fits \n     the crime. We believe that reducing from 500 grams to 100 \n     grams, the level of powdered cocaine determined in an illegal \n     sale of this drug does begin the process of a more equitable \n     application of crime and punishment. It is our belief that \n     both ``crack'' and powdered cocaine have a detrimental impact \n     on our community. Yet, we do not believe that the current \n     laws governing the illegal sale of ``crack'' cocaine versus \n     powdered cocaine and the subsequent sentencing for such \n     infractions are by any means fair and appropriate.\n       Therefore, it is our position that the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee has a key opportunity to bridge the gap between \n     these inequities and to make more appropriate the type of \n     sentencing resulting from the sale of powdered cocaine. You \n     must know that the overwhelming sentiment within the African \n     American and Hispanic communities is that our young people \n     are being targeted, exploited and directed toward the jail \n     industrial complex.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicare contracting reforms, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 medicare contractor reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nreform the way Medicare administers its health benefits. Under current \nlaw, Medicare is not allowed sufficient flexibility to award contracts \nto administer Medicare benefits based on performance, skill and \nexpertise, or competition. This bill is long overdue and follows up on \nan oversight hearing I held as chairman of the Medicare subcommittee a \nfew years ago.\n  When Medicare was enacted 30 years ago, private health insurance \ncompanies were awarded the task of administering the program. GAO \nrecently testified before the Finance Committee that when Medicare was \nenacted ``legislation essentially delegated many day-to-day \nadministrative decisions to private insurers, to further lessen the \nrisk of undue Federal interference and to better ensure that Medicare \nwould treat its beneficiaries no differently than the private \ninsured.'' Under my legislation, important administrative functions \nwould still be performed by private sector companies but the pool of \neligible companies would be broadened. Medicare would also have the \nopportunity to take advantage of private sector initiatives to improve \ncustomer service, lower administrative costs, and improve operational \nefficiency.\n  Mr. President, there is bipartisan recognition that funding for \nMedicare's administrative operations is currently inadequate. Funding \nfor contractors has actually declined over the last several years. When \nadjusted for inflation, Medicare's contractor budget actually declined \nby 37 percent over the last 6 years. The Finance Committee, on which I \nserve, has heard testimony from the General Accounting Office, the HHS \nOffice of Inspector General, and others in support of higher spending \nfor Medicare administrative services. Increased spending on payment \nsafeguard activities can actually save the Medicare Program money. \nAccording to the GAO, every dollar spent on Medicare safeguard \nactivities returns at least $11 to the Medicare Program.\n  But, Mr. President, before we spend additional money on program \nadministration we need to make sure that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA] has the ability to spend its contractor funds \nwisely and to enter into contracts with the most efficient entities.\n  The legislation I am introducing today replaces outdated Medicare law \nand gives HCFA the tools to take full advantage of innovations and \nefficiencies in the private sector when it comes to utilization review, \ndetecting fraud and abuse, and processing claims. No longer would all \nMedicare contractors be required to perform all Medicare administrative \nactivities. This legislation would permit the Secretary of HHS to \nselectively contract with any agency or organization that is capable of \ncarrying out specific administrative functions, such as fraud and abuse \ndetection, customer service, or utilization review.\n\n  Under current law, Medicare is restricted to contracting with health \ninsurance companies. In the private sector, many large employers \nselectively contract with companies that specialize in, and have \nexpertise in, utilization review or in adjudicating claims. The \nMedicare Program should not be prohibited from making similar \ncompetitive decisions. This flexibility will not only increase \ncompetition but it will enhance contractor performance by allowing \nMedicare to contract with entities who excel in a specific function.\n  Under current law, Medicare is forced to pay the costs of terminating \na Medicare administrative contract even if the contract is terminated \nfor cause, including poor performance, outright fraud, or even if the \ncontract merely expires. Medicare is the only Federal program required \nto pay for these extraordinary termination costs. This is inconsistent \nwith the Federal contracting authority and should be changed \nimmediately.\n  Mr. President, my legislation would change current law that \nautomatically renews Medicare's administrative contracts every year. \nMore important, the decision on the awarding administrative contracts \nfor part A would be given to HCFA while preserving a provider's right \nto choose its own fiscal intermediary. Because most hospitals have \nnominated the national Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association as their \nfiscal intermediary, when a State Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan leaves \nthe Medicare Program the national Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association \nchooses which State Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan becomes the fiscal \nintermediary for the hospitals in that State. Under my legislation, new \ncontractors would be awarded contracts using the same competitive \nrequirements that apply throughout the Federal Government.\n  Hospital and nursing homes would still be able to choose their fiscal \nintermediary every 5 years from a list of at least 3 approved \ncontractors. This freedom of choice keeps pressure on contractors to \ncontinuously improve customer service to beneficiaries and health care \nproviders.\n  HCFA would also be allowed to monitor and respond to instances when a \nhealth insurance company is processing claims or auditing costs reports \nof health care providers that it owns. As the distinction between \nproviders and insurers becomes blurred, a serious conflict of interest \ncould emerge in these types of situations and HCFA must have the \nability to safeguard the Medicare Trust Fund from these types of \nconflicts of interest.\n  Just as Medicare has reformed its payments to doctors and hospitals \nover the past decade, and is considering changes to the way it pays \nhealth maintenance organizations, it is time to consider alternative \nways to pay contractors. Current Medicare law that requires cost-based \nreimbursement is inconsistent with payment performance incentives and \ncompetitive bidding.\n  Mr. President, I believe my legislation updates current Medicare law \nand is long overdue. This bill would equip the Health Care Financing \nAdministration with the tools to move the Medicare Program into the \nnext century. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislative \nproposal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, to save a highly cost effective \nand vital program that assists homeless veterans to find employment, I \nam today introducing a bill that would reauthorize the Homeless \nVeterans Employment Program [HVEP]--formerly called the Homeless \nVeterans Reintegration Project--for 3 years.\n  As some of you may recall, during the debate on H.R. 1944, the \nrescissions bill, I expressed my dismay and strong opposition to the \nzeroing out of this low-cost national program--funded at just over $5 \nmillion annually--that is so important to homeless veterans. In view of \nthe fact that up to one-third of America's homeless are veterans--an \nestimated 271,000 can be found on the streets any given night--and \nMinnesota veterans have often told me about the effectiveness of HVEP, \nI was appalled when I learned that the program had fallen victim to a \nlate-night leadership agreement with the administration on the \nrescissions package.\n  Since it is such a small program, many of your may be unaware of \nHVEP's background and its impressive accomplishments. HVEP, which is \nadministered by the Labor Department's Veterans Employment and Training \nService, is a job-placement program begun in fiscal year 1989. HVEP \nprovides grants to community based groups that employ flexible and \ninnovative approaches to assist homeless, unemployed veterans to \nreenter the work force. Let me repeat--grants to community-based \ngroups, not funding to some large impersonal Federal bureaucracy that \nsome of my colleagues regularly deride.\n  Permit me to briefly point out some of HVEP's strengths and \naccomplishments: It is one of the most successful job placement \nprograms in the Federal Government. Since its inception it has placed \n11,000 veterans into jobs at approximately $1,000 per placement. HVEP \ngrantees build complimentary relationships with VA, Job Training \nPartnership Act, and other programs--they do not duplicate any other \nservices. HVEP is critical to the implementation and success of the \ninnovative standdown projects that are held across the country.\n  I have had the good fortune of attending several Minnesota \nstanddowns, including one recently, and I have been consistently \nimpressed with the effectiveness of this volunteer program of veterans \nhelping homeless veterans. I've been deeply moved by the sight of \nveterans doing all they can to help their less fortunate buddies--\nveterans exerting themselves to care for homeless veterans whom the \nrest of society tends to ignore and, sometimes even scorn. Standdowns \nare a unique point of light that need to be nourished, not strangled. \nAnd the same is true for the HVEP itself.\n\n  In conclusion, I want to stress that the $5 million saved annually by \nterminating HVEP will quickly be offset by the enormous costs of \nproviding public assistance to the veterans who will remain homeless \ndue to the lack of a paying job. Reauthorization of HVEP will permit us \nto meet our obligation to men and women who fought bravely and \nunquestioningly for our country, but who are desperately seeking work \nto escape the misery and indignities of homelessness.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \none-time election of the interest rate to be used to determine present \nvalue for purposes of pension cash-out restrictions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         uruguay round agreements act modification legislation\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to make two \nmodifications \n\n[[Page S 13743]]\nto the pension-related provisions of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements \nAct.\n  Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges facing Americans today \nis to save and invest for retirement. It is a challenge that is made \ndifficult by all of the important matters that compete for a share of \nthe American family's limited income day in and day out. Parents \nroutinely ask themselves, for example, if they can afford to make a \ncontribution to an individual retirement account when they still need \nto save for their child's college education.\n  Sometimes, the choices people face are even more stark: Whether to \nset aside money for retirement, repair the family car so a mother or \nfather can get to work, or just put food on the table or clothes on the \nkids' backs.\n  Employers, too, must make similar choices. To attract and retain \nqualified employees, they want to be able to offer good pension \nbenefits. But, they have to decide whether they can put more money into \na pension plan for their employees when the business needs new \nequipment just to stay competitive.\n  It's easy to relegate retirement to second place behind any of these \nother pressing needs--especially when retirement is 5, 10, 20, or 30 \nyears away. But, adequate planning for retirement is no less important \nor urgent. When the time comes, we will all need to draw upon the \nresources we have been able to set aside during our working years.\n\n  Because there are so many competing demands placed on people's \nincomes--because it is so difficult to save for retirement even under \nthe best of circumstances--the Federal Government should be sure to do \nwhat it can to encourage people to save and invest for their retirement \nyears.\n  One thing Congress could do in that regard is provide new incentives \nto save. The new chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, \nhas a plan to enhance and overhaul the Individual Retirement Account \n[IRA]. I am pleased to have cosponsored that proposal, S. 12, with him.\n  Another thing we could do is simplify current law to make it easier \nfor people and their employers to participate in retirement plans. \nSenator Pryor has an excellent proposal, S. 1006, the Pension \nSimplification Act, that I hope the Finance Committee will also \nconsider when it acts on reconciliation in the near future.\n  The bill that I am introducing today takes two additional steps in \nthe direction of pension simplification, correcting two problems that \nwere created by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, last year's GATT \nbill.\n  The first change in my bill relates to the interest rate used to \ncalculate lump sum distributions from defined benefit pension plans. \nThe GATT bill required use of the interest rate on 30-year Treasury \nsecurities, a rate that is proving too volatile for many retirement \nplans, particularly small plans. As Bruce Tempkin, an actuary and small \nbusiness pension specialist at Louis Kravitz & Associates, put it \nrecently, ``it is similar to taking out a varible-rate mortgage with no \ncap.'' You could find yourself getting ready to retire and expecting a \nlump sum distribution of a given amount, but being told that you will \nactually get a third less because the interest rate just changed.\n  My bill would give plans a one-time option to choose a fixed interest \nrate between 5 and 8 percent instead of the floating 30-year Treasury \nrate. That will make it easier for employers to plan for the required \ncontributions, and for employers and employees alike to understand what \ntheir lump sum benefits will ultimately be.\n  The second change included in my bill would correct an anomaly that \nwas created under section 415(b)(2)(E) of the code. As a result of the \nchange made in last year's GATT bill, lump-sum distributions are \ncalculated differently from--and thereby bear no relationship to--the \nactuarial equivalent of a monthly life annuity for early retirees. It \nis a result that, from all indications was unintended. My bill includes \na technical correction to ensure that the two options--the monthly life \nannuity and the lump sum distribution--are indeed actuarially \nequivalent for early retirees.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of \nthis important initiative. I also ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INTEREST RATE FOR DETERMINATION OF PRESENT VALUE \n                   FOR PURPOSES OF PENSION CASH-OUT RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subclause (II) of section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     determination of present value) is amended by inserting ``, \n     or, at the irrevocable election of the plan, an annual \n     interest rate specified in the plan, which may not be less \n     than 5 percent nor more than 8 percent'' after ``prescribe''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subclause (II) of section \n     205(g)(3)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1055(g)(3)(A)(ii)) is amended by \n     inserting ``, or, at the irrevocable election of the plan, an \n     annual interest rate specified in the plan, which may not be \n     less than 5 percent nor more than 8 percent'' after \n     ``prescribe''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     amendments made by section 767 of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

415(b)(2) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1968 (relating to limitation on \n     certain assumptions) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Except as provided in clause (ii), for \n     purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under \n     subparagraph (B) or (C),'' in clause (i) and inserting ``For \n     purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (C) \n     and, except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of \n     adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B),'', and\n       (2) by striking ``For purposes of adjusting the benefit or \n     limitation of any form of benefit subject to section \n     417(e)(3),'' in clause (ii) and inserting ``For purposes of \n     adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B) for any form of \n     benefit subject to section 417(e)(3),''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     amendments made by section 767 of the

Mr. President, I would like to call to the \nattention of our colleagues celebrations that are underway to celebrate \nthe 75th anniversary of the establishment of the town of Indian Head, \nMD. The mayor of Indian Head, Warren Bowie, along with the entire \ncommunity, has planned several significant events to commemorate this \npropitious milestone.\n  One of two incorporated townships in Charles County, Indian Head's \nhistory goes back much further than its date of incorporation in 1920. \nThe territory now known as Indian Head was given to Lord Baltimore, and \nthen to Gen. Charles Cornwallis, as part of a land grant made by the \nEnglish King in 1736. Records later reveal that Cornwallis titled the \nland to George Washington in 1761.\n  Older charts and maps dating from 1776 through 1866 indicate that \nIndian Head has had several names including Indian Point, Indian \nHeadlands, and Indian Head Point. All of these names reflect the more \npopular tale of how the name Indian Head was bestowed upon the town. As \nthe story is told, there was an Algonquin chief who had promised his \ndaughter in marriage to the son of the chief of the neighboring \nPiscataway Tribe. Before the two children were united, the young woman \nmet an Indian hunter who was traveling up the Potomac River from the \nVirginia Colony. The two immediately fell in love. The Algonquin chief, \nenraged at the disruption of the wedding plans, ordered the hunter to \nleave and never to return to the region again. The hunter vowed that he \nwould come back for his love. His plans to return were discovered and \nfoiled. The night he returned, he was ambushed by Algonquin warriors \nand beheaded. His head was placed on a spear and set in the sand as a \nwarning to other trespassers. The very next day, the first white \nsettlers came and discovered this monument. Hence the name Indian Head.\n  Indian Head was slow to populate itself, largely due to the fact that \nthe area was mainly marshland. But in 1890 the U.S. Navy decided to \nmove its proving ground to Indian Head, primarily because of its \nlocation between the naval shipyards in Norfolk and the Washington Navy \nYard on the Anacostia. As the installation at Indian Head grew, so did \nthe town. When it became inevitable that the United States would become \ndeeply engaged in World War I, Indian Head was given a large \nappropriation to expand its facilities to produce smokeless powder. The \nnaval powder factory, which is now the naval ordnance station, provided \nthe stimulus for the expansion of Indian Head.\n\n[[Page S 13745]]\n\n  Indian Head is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The \nactivities that have been sponsored to commemorate this auspicious \noccasion exemplify the deep devotion of Indian Head's residents to the \ncommunity. The spirit and enthusiasm of Indian Head's citizens have \nbeen the foundation of its success. These celebrations provide the \nopportunity to renew the dedication that has supported Indian Head \nthroughout its history and helped it to develop into one of Maryland's \nmost attractive communities.\n  We in Maryland are fortunate to have an area as community-oriented as \nIndian Head. I join the citizens of Charles County in sharing their \npride in Indian Head's past and optimism for continued success in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13744-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SUMMER INTERNS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer recognition \nto my summer interns, who have dedicated their time and effort this \nsummer, serving the people of Michigan on my behalf. In an era when \ncynicism about our Government and the political process runs rampant, \nthey have maintained an optimistic view of our Government, and have \nmade considerable sacrifices so that they could play a more active role \nin the American political system. They were of great help to us this \nsummer and I am grateful for their service. In appreciation of their \nhard work and dedication, I submit a list of their names, and ask that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n       Lisa Maria Carroll, Nathan E. Clukey, Christopher DeMuth, \n     Hope Durant, Michael J. Earle, Robert Glazier, John \n     Iakovides, Thomas Marshall, Danny Mayer, Denise Mills, \n     Michael Mikelic, Ryan O'Donovan, Stephen V. Potenza, Barry \n     Regan, John Sanke, Sergio Santiviago, Nedda Shayota, Joseph \n     A. Snearline, Matthew J. Suhr, Courtenay Youngblood, Paul Yu.\n\n  Mr. President, these fine young men and women performed valuable \nservice assisting with legislative research, front office support, and \nplaying for my expansion softball team. Like all expansion teams, this \nyear was a rebuilding year. Our team's record may not have been the \ngreatest, Mr. President, but without the interns, I would have had no \nsoftball team.\n  On a more serious note Mr. President, it is my belief that a \ncongressional internship is the best and most effective way to learn \nfirsthand about the governmental process. Our interns are given the \nchance to observe and participate in all kinds of activities essential \nto the workings of the Senate. From committee markups to floor speeches \nand votes, to the daily workings of the office, they have been given a \ndiverse and extensive lesson in the governmental process. It is a \nlesson that, regardless of their future ambitions, will remain with \nthem throughout the course of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13745-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE EIGHTH ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS AND HERITAGE OF AFRICAN-\n                               AMERICANS\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities, and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ, began \nits 1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. The heritage festival program \nsalutes some of the different ethnic communities that contribute so \ngreatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old country \ncustoms and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity to \nexpress pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a part of our \ncollective heritage. Additionally, the Spring Heritage Festivals will \ncontribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden State Arts \nCenter's Cultural Center Fund which presents theater productions free-\nof-charge to New Jersey's school children, seniors, and other deserving \nresidents. The heritage festival thus not only pays tribute to the \ncultural influences from our past, it also makes a significant \ncontribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Saturday, September 16, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series \ncelebrated the Eighth Annual Festival of the Arts and Heritage of \nAfrican-Americans. The first African-American Heritage Festival, \nfounded by Clinton Crocker of Tinton Falls, NJ, was held in September, \n1988. The festival took its place in the series in September, 1988. The \nfestival took its place in the series of heritage festivals at the \nGarden State Arts Center under the leadership of Julian Robinson, then \ncommissioner of the New Jersey Highway Authority and was so ably \norganized this year by Carol Washington.\n  Clinton Crocker's early vision of a major festival which would \nreflect pride in the African-American presence in New Jersey, has laid \nthe foundation for an outstanding event that celebrates the beauty and \ndiversity of African-American culture. The festival presented a wide \nvariety of performing arts including: soloists, African dance troupes, \ngospel singers, and African story-tellers sharing traditional tales. \nThe festival also showcased ethnic foods from the African continent as \nwell as African-American favorites and was undobtedly one of the \nhighlights of the day.\n  The African-American Heritage Festival has proven itself to be an \noutstanding event over the years. The festival continues to grow in \npopularity each year, more than doubling its annual attendance from its \nfirst year. With increased popularity has come increased profits which \nhas led to the development of a Relief Fund for Uwanda and other needy \nAfrican nations. Profits also go to fund recreational activities for \nneedy seniors, the disadvantaged, and for scholarship funds for college \nstudents.\n  Congratulations once again on the eighth anniversary of the Festival \nof the Arts and Heritage of African-Americans. Best wishes for \ncontinued success and to all who attended the festival to celebrate a \nday of pride in their ethnicity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13745-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13745-S13746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AL MEIER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to rise today \nto honor a distinguished citizen from my State--Iowa Commissioner of \nLabor Al Meier. When Al retired on July 28, he stepped down as the \nlongest serving labor commissioner in the United States.\n  Over the years, Al Meier has been an ally on the side of working \nIowans. Before Al was named labor commissioner in 1977, he served on \nthe OSHA Review Commission, and prior to that he represented the AFL-\nCIO. He has also chaired the organizational committee of the Governor's \nSafety and Health Conference.\n  As labor commissioner, Al was responsible for helping Iowans stay \nsafe on the job and off. Accountable for all division of labor \nprograms, Al's duties included safety inspections, such as elevator and \namusement ride inspections; wage payment collection, child labor, \nminimum wage, asbestos removal, and contractor registration.\n  I can tell you that no one worked harder on keeping Iowans safe in \nthe workplace than Al Meier. But his work wasn't just about safety, as \nvital as that is. It was also about security--economic security--\nhelping Iowans live better lives, and building a better future for our \nState. He was, and still is, at his best when it comes to helping \nothers fight for a better life.\n  Al has been a fighter all his life. A former Golden Gloves contender, \nhe never relinquished the fighting spirit it took for him to compete in \nthe boxing ring. Whether it was through his work in political \norganizing, negotiating on the Hill, or representing the union, Al has \nbeen a fighter and a builder. He built coalitions. He built \nopportunities. He built a stronger Iowa.\n  And throughout it all, Al has never compromised in his commitment to \nhelping people. I know of no greater tribute, and no better legacy, \nthan that.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to salute the leadership and selfless \nservice that \n\n[[Page S 13746]]\nAl Meier has demonstrated throughout his life. I am especially honored \nto count Al as one of my dearest friends--a friend that I have known \nfor many years. Once again I congratulate Al on his many years of \nservice to Iowans, and I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing \nhim a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13745-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HADLEY ROFF\n\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute \nto a long-time friend and associate, Hadley Roff. Since I first met \nHadley when we were both students at Stanford University, he has been a \nclose and dear friend. Over the years, as we worked together when I was \nmayor of San Francisco, during a campaign for Governor, and as a U.S. \nSenator, our friendship and respect for one another continued to grow.\n  Hadley Roff's career, both in Washington, DC, and in San Francisco, \nshows exactly what can be accomplished when someone devotes his life to \npublic service.\n  Hadley began his distinguished career as a reporter for a San \nFrancisco newspaper, the News, in 1956 and continued as the News was \nmerged with the Call Bulletin and, finally, with the San Francisco \nExaminer. Hadley, from his days at Stanford University, wanted to work \non a San Francisco newspaper. He did and he closed two of them.\n  Hadley soon switched his sights to the world of public service.\n  In Washington, DC, he industriously served as chief of staff to U.S. \nSenator John V. Tunney, press secretary for Senator Edward M. Kennedy \nand national media director for the Presidential campaign of Senator \nEdmund Muskie. But, Hadley gladly returned to San Francisco when the \nchance arose to serve the city of San Francisco.\n  Hadley adeptly served the citizens of San Francisco under four \nmayors. Beginning as press secretary for Joseph L. Alioto, Hadley \ncontinued to serve during the tenures of Art Agnos, my administration, \nand Frank Jordan.\n  Hadley served as my deputy mayor for more than 8 years when I became \nmayor of San Francisco in 1978. He constantly showed a particular \ndevotion to public safety that has continued to today. As deputy mayor, \nHadley was always made aware when a fire reached three alarms and, \nregardless of what he may have been doing, Hadley was off to the scene.\n  More recently, when Hadley served as my State director in my Senate \noffice for 2 years, Hadley was instrumental in assisting former San \nFrancisco Fire Department Assistant Chief, Frank Blackburn, in \nestablishing a temporary emergency water system that helped save the \nlives of 140,000 Rwandan refugees in 1994.\n  Hadley describes himself as a ``human switchboard,'' understanding \nthe need to get the right people to a problem, but he is much more than \nthat. He is a very gracious person who always shows great concern for \npeople. He was never too busy to take a call or listen to someone's \nthoughts. During demonstrations, he effectively maintained a \nconstructive dialog and, more often than not, made it so everyone left \nsmiling. He was the heart and soul of the office and his dedication \ncould not help but motivate others.\n  For a long, long time Hadley has been a big part of my life.\n  Recently, Hadley left my office to become a director for the San \nFrancisco Urban Institute at San Francisco State University. And, \ntoday, many San Franciscans are joining together to pay tribute to him \nand to celebrate his affiliation with the Urban Institute. I am sorry I \ncannot be home right now, joining in the celebration, but it is with \nfond memories and enthusiastic praise, that I wish Hadley, his wife \nSusie, and everyone at the Urban Institute all the best.\n  Hadley, we miss you, but do not think for a second that we will not \ncall you into duty when projects that need that special Hadley touch \narise.\n  Congratulations, Hadley, on the tribute and the wonderful opportunity \nof working at the Urban Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13746-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTRACTS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate adopted \nmy amendment to condition receipt of welfare benefits on signing and \nadhering to a personal responsibility contract. I was pleased that this \nimportant provision was added to the Work Opportunity Act. I believe it \nis critical to successful welfare reform emphasizing personal \nresponsibility and common sense.\n  The underlying bill required States and welfare recipients to \nnegotiate personal responsibility contracts. However, there were no \ndetails about what that meant. Without definition, the personal \nresponsibility contract could be meaningless and ineffective. Such a \nresult would have been unfortunate because an effective contract has \nthe potential to significantly change welfare as we know it.\n  The centerpiece of the Iowa Family Investment Program is the \nrequirement that individuals on welfare must sign an individualized, \nbinding contract with the State outlining what they will do to get off \nof welfare. The contract would also say what services the State would \nprovide to move the family off of welfare. Failure to sign a contract \nor abide by the terms of the contract would result in termination of \nwelfare benefits.\n  Mr. President, Iowa instituted a number of reforms in our welfare \nprograms. After only 22 months of implementation, the Iowa welfare \nreform program is showing promising results. More families are working \nand earning income, there are fewer families on welfare and AFDC costs \nare declining.\n  My amendment borrowed from the Iowa program and used the Iowa \ncontract as a model for the Nation. A contract significantly \nstrengthens accountability in the welfare system.\n  I was pleased that the amendment was adopted and thank the two \nleaders for their assistance in getting my amendment approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/18/senate-section/article/S13746-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n NOMINATION OF PAUL M.
