Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1026, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1996 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending: Nunn amendment No. 2425, to establish a missile \n     defense policy.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe we will take up some \nuncontested matters at this time.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I wonder if it would not be appropriate at \nthis time to ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment, which \nis the missile defense amendment sponsored by myself and Senators \nWarner, Levin, and Cohen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe that we are now prepared to clear \nsome more amendments. The first amendment is the Warner amendment, as I \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2461\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on negotiations between the \n Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy and the Governor of the \nState of Idaho regarding the shipment of spent nuclear fuel from naval \n                               reactors)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 570, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3168. SENSE OF SENATE ON NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING \n                   SHIPMENTS OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL FROM NAVAL \n                   REACTORS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, and \n     the Governor of the State of Idaho should continue good faith \n     negotiations for the purpose of reaching an agreement on the \n     issue of shipments of spent nuclear fuel from naval reactors.\n       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than September 15, 1995, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives a written report on the \n     status or outcome of the negotiations urged under subsection \n     (a).\n       (2) The report shall include the following matters:\n       (A) If an agreement is reached, the terms of the agreement, \n     including the dates on which shipments of spent nuclear fuel \n     from naval reactors will resume.\n       (B) If an agreement is not reached--\n       (i) the Secretary's evaluation of the issues remaining to \n     be resolved before an agreement can be reached;\n       (ii) the likelihood that an agreement will be reached \n     before October 1, 1995; and\n       (iii) the steps that must be taken regarding the shipment \n     of spent nuclear fuel from naval reactors to ensure that the \n     Navy can meet the national security requirements of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment, by myself, is cosponsored \nby Senators Exon, Kempthorne, Thurmond, Craig, Cohen, Snowe, Smith, and \nGregg. It expresses a sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of Energy and the Governor of Idaho should continue \ngood-faith negotiations to reach an agreement on shipments of nuclear \nfuel from naval reactors and requires a written report on the status or \noutcome of the negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to \nrequire all parties to continue good-faith negotiations to reach an \nagreement to permit the resumption of shipments of spent nuclear fuel \nfrom naval reactors to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. I \nhave joined with several other Senators to reach an agreement which we \nhope will encourage the parties on both sides who are negotiating this \nissue to resolve it as soon as possible, because of the serious \nimplications to our national security.\n  In order to support the national security requirements of the United \nStates, the Navy must be able to refuel and defuel nuclear powered \nwarships. Because of an ongoing dispute between Idaho and the \nDepartment of Energy, shipments of spent nuclear fuel to the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory have been halted. This situation has \nrapidly reached a crisis level and must be resolved expeditiously. My \namendment urges all parties to negotiate, in good faith, an agreement \nthat would protect this vital component of our national security. The \namendment also retains, if necessary, the option for Congress to take \nfurther actions in joint conference if warranted.\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious matter. Briefly, the background \nis that the State of Idaho has been receiving shipments for 38 years \nfrom the U.S. Navy of its spent fuel.\n  Without getting into the problem area, there are negotiations ongoing \nbetween the Governor of Idaho, such other officials within his \nadministration, the Department of Energy, and the Department of the \nNavy. But I feel strongly obligated this morning to inform the Senate \nof the seriousness of these negotiations, and our sincere hope is that \nthe matter may be resolved prior to the conference of the Armed \nServices Committees of the House and the Senate, because absent a \nresolution of this dispute between the three parties I just named, I \nfeel it is incumbent upon the Congress of the United States to address \nthe legislative solution.\n  Why? Because, for example, the preparations for refueling the U.S.S. \nNimitz are now 3 months delayed and increasing. The Navy has fewer than \nthe needed aircraft carriers today to meet its operational \nrequirements, and I know from some personal experience nothing is more \nsevere to the United States Navy than prolonged deployments of ships \nbeyond their schedules away from home. It impacts most severely on \nreadiness. It impacts also on the family situations of our Naval \npersonnel and the like.\n  Likewise, the Navy is tying up commissioned ships; that is, ships \nstill in commission, and requiring full manning on these ships since \nthey cannot be defueled. Six ships will be tied up: Gato, Whale, \nPuffer, Bergall, Flying Fish at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and \nBainbridge at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n  This also impacts the yard work. The representations from the Navy \nthis morning indicate that up to 2,000 shipyard workers in the States \nof Washington, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Hawaii are subject to \nlayoffs unless this matter is resolved in the very immediate future.\n  I thank all my colleagues for their support, especially the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, for his diligent efforts in reaching \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Warner, Senator Craig, and Senator Exon in cosponsoring the \npending amendment. The pending language strikes the appropriate balance \nbetween the legitimate national security requirements of the Navy and \nthe State of Idaho's sovereign right to protect its interests.\n  The amendment is a recognition that good-faith negotiations are \ncurrently underway and it is my hope that these talks will lead to an \nagreement that protects the interests of all the parties. I want to \noffer special praise to Governor Batt for his effort to establish \nreasonable criteria for an agreement to settle this very important \nissue.\n  Mr. President, the people of Idaho have a long, successful \nrelationship with the Navy. The Navy has been a good neighbor in \nsoutheastern Idaho for over four decades and I want to see that \nrelationship continue.\n  At the same time, the House and Senate at last seem to be moving \nforward with a serious plan to deal with the national problem of \ndisposing of spent nuclear fuel. This is a very positive step for Idaho \nand the Nation and I want to urge my colleagues to keep working toward \nthis solution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to add my support to this \namendment which requires all parties to negotiate in good faith \nimmediately with officials of the State of Idaho in order to resolve \nthe current dispute which has resulted in halting shipments of spent \nnuclear fuel from the Navy.\n  I want to commend Senator Warner, Senator Kempthorne, and others for \ntheir diligent efforts in reaching this agreement. It is critical that \nthe Navy be allowed to resume shipments of spent nuclear fuel \nimmediately in order to enable the Navy to continue to defuel and \nrefuel its ships. I hope that those involved in the negotiations on \nboth sides of the issue will work in a spirit of cooperation which \nprovides for a timely settlement because of the serious national \nsecurity implications.\n  I support this amendment, recognizing that it provides for further \nlegislation in joint conference should it be necessary. I am confident, \nhowever, that negotiating officials, recognizing the importance of \nreaching an agreement as soon as possible will resolve this issue in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support and as a sponsor of the \namendment. It is absolutely crucial that the situation that has arisen \nover the fueling and defueling of fuels from the nuclear Navy be \nresolved.\n  This amendment, putting this body on record as supporting good faith \nnegotiations between the Secretary of Defense and the Governor of Idaho \nfor the purpose of pursuing an agreement on the issue of naval spent \nnuclear fuels, is a step in the right direction.\n  Idaho has always recognized the importance of a strong nuclear Navy \ndefense deterrent. Idaho takes a back seat to no one when it comes to \nsupporting the defense of this Nation.\n  At the same time, however, Idaho will not become a de facto spent \nnuclear waste repository. The facilities at the Idaho National \nEngineering Laboratory were never designed nor intended to be a \npermanent nuclear waste disposal facility. I will not stand for that to \nhappen and will always fight to assure Idaho does not become a nuclear \nwaste dump for the Navy and the Department of Energy.\n\n[[Page S 12651]]\n\n  This Nation must stand up and commit itself to addressing the final \ndisposal of commercial, military, and DOE nuclear fuels. This amendment \nwill go a long way to assure we reach the goal of a functioning Navy \nand Idaho does not become a permanent nuclear waste repository.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. I think the Senator \nfrom Virginia has outlined it correctly in terms of the urgency of \ntrying to find some solution to this. I commend him for sponsoring this \namendment. I agree with him. At some point, we will have to legislate \non this subject unless the parties can agree.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a pending amendment, which is the \nNunn-Warner-Levin-Cohen amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be \ntemporarily laid aside so that we can handle these three or four \namendments that have been worked out, at which time the pending \namendment would then be the pending action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The amendment (No. 2461) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2462\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Levin, I offer an \namendment which would authorize the Army to use leasing agreements to \nmodernize its commercial utility cargo vehicle fleet. This fleet is \npast the point of economically useful life and has become a significant \ntraining and operational maintenance fund. This program, using \ncommercial practices to require essential commercial services, is in \nkeeping with the spirit of acquisition reform.\n  I believe the amendment has been cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. It has been \ncleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2462.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate point in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . ENCOURAGEMENT OF USE OF LEASING AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) Chapter 137 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 2316 the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 2317. EQUIPMENT LEASING.\n\n       ``The Secretary of Defense is authorized to use leasing in \n     the acquisition of commercial vehicles when such leasing is \n     practicable and efficient.''\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``2317. Equipment Leasing.''\n\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of\n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit a report to the congressional defense committees \n     setting forth changes in legislation that would be \n     required to facilitate the use of leases by the Department \n     of Defense in the acquisition of equipment.\n       (c) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of the Army may conduct a \n     pilot program for leasing of commercial utility cargo \n     vehicles as follows:\n       (1) Existing commercial utility cargo vehicles may be \n     traded-in for credit against new replacement commercial \n     utility cargo vehicle lease costs;\n       (2) Quantities of commercial utility cargo vehicles to be \n     traded in and their value to be credited shall be subject to \n     negotiation between the parties;\n       (3) New commercial utility cargo vehicle lease agreements \n     may be excuted with or without options to purchase at the end \n     of each lease period;\n       (4) New commercial utility cargo vehicle lease periods may \n     not exceed five years;\n       (5) Such leasing pilot program shall consist of replacing \n     no more than forty percent of the validated requirement for \n     commercial utility cargo vehicles but may include an option \n     or options for the remaining validated requirement which may \n     be excuted subject to the requirements of subsection (c)(8);\n       (6) The Army shall enter into such pilot program only\n        if the Secretary:\n       (A) awards such program in accordance with the provisions \n     of section 2304 of title 10 United States Code.\n       (B) has notified the congressional defense committees of \n     his plans to execute the pilot program;\n       (C) has provided a report detailing the expected savings in \n     operating and support costs from retiring older commercial \n     utility cargo vehicles compared to the expected costs of \n     leasing newer commercial utility cargo vehicles; and\n       (D) has allowed 30 calendar days to elapse after such \n     notification.\n       (8) One year after the date of execution of an initial \n     leasing contract, the Secretary of the Army shall submit a \n     report setting forth the status of the pilot program. Such \n     report shall be based upon at least six months of operating \n     experience. The Secretary may exercise an option or options \n     for subsequent commercial utility cargo vehicles only after \n     he has allowed 60 calendar days to elapse after submitting \n     this report.\n       (9) Expiration of Authority.--No lease of commercial \n     utility cargo vehicles may be entered into under the pilot \n     program after September 30, 2000.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last year Congress passed the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act of 1995, in which we sought to reform \nDefense acquisition procedures and rely on more commercial products and \nprocesses for the Defense Department.\n  Consistent with Defense acquisition reform, this amendment authorizes \nthe Defense Department to use commercial leasing practices to acquire \ncommercial vehicles for the Army.\n  This will permit the Army to modernize its fleet of commercial \nutility cargo vehicles [CUCVs] without any new appropriated funds.\n  The Army has an old and expensive fleet of about 45,000 CUCV's. They \nneed a fleet of only about 13,000 CUCV's, and can make significant \nsavings on operation and support costs if they use newer vehicles.\n  The Army is short on funds for modernization of its vehicle programs, \nand has identified it as a priority area for modernization. This \namendment could help the Army modernize its CUCV fleet at no additional \ncost.\n  The amendment is also strongly supported by the Army acquisition \nexecutive.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2462) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2463\n\n (Purpose: To place a limitation on the use of funds for former Soviet \n                        Union threat reduction)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Kyl and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Kyl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2463.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR COOPERATIVE THREAT \n                   REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available for fiscal year 1996 under the heading \n     ``Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction'' for dismantlement \n     and destruction of chemical weapons, not more than \n     $52,000,000 may be obligated or expended for that purpose \n     until the President certifies to Congress the following:\n       (1) That the United States and Russia have completed a \n     joint laboratory study evaluating the proposal of Russia to \n     neutralize its chemical weapons and the United States agrees \n     with the proposal.\n       (2) That Russia is in the process of preparing, with the \n     assistance of the United States (if necessary), a \n     comprehensive plan to manage the dismantlement and \n     destruction of the Russia chemical weapons stockpile. \n\n[[Page S 12652]]\n\n       (3) That the United States and Russia are committed to \n     resolving outstanding issues under the 1989 Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding'' \n     means the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government \n     of the United States of America and the Government of the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral \n     Verification Experiment and Data Exchange Related to \n     Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, \n     Wyoming, on September 23, 1989.\n       (2) The term ``1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement'' means \n     the Agreement between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on destruction and non-\n     production of chemical weapons and on measures to facilitate \n     the multilateral convention on banning chemical weapons \n     signed on June 1, 1990.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill concerning the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, commonly known as Nunn-Lugar. The purpose of this amendment is \nto require both the DOD and the Russians to get serious about chemical \nweapons destruction activities and to focus their efforts in a \nproductive manner.\n  Of the $371 million requested for the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram with Russia and other former States of the Soviet Union, $104 \nmillion was requested for chemical weapons destruction.\n  Reducing the chemical weapons stockpiles of both the United States \nand Russia is an important goal. Chemical weapons and nerve agents are \namong the cheapest and most effective manner to kill people. The number \nof chemical-weapons nations has tripled from 8 in 1969 to as many as 26 \ntoday. Moreover, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \nhas counted 15 separate cases of recent chemical conflict in the Third \nWorld.\n  The problem is that current CTR Program to reduce chemical weapons is \nill defined and lacks focus.\n  The first purpose of my amendment is to withhold $54 million for a \nchemical weapons destruction facility until the completion of the joint \nfeasibility study. This approach is consistent with the GAO report from \nJune 1995 ``Weapons of Mass Destruction, Reducing the Threat From the \nFormer Soviet Union: An Update.'' In the report, the GAO noted,\n\n       . . . the United States have yet to agree on the \n     applicability of a technology to be used in chemical weapons \n     destruction facility and may not do so until midway through \n     fiscal year 1996. This uncertainty raises questions as to the \n     program's need for the $104 million it is requesting in \n     fiscal year 1996, in part, to begin designing and \n     constructing the facility.\n\n  Agreeing on a destruction technology is important because Russia is \ncurrently proposing using a ``neutralization'' technology which would \nblend the chemical toxin with other chemicals in an attempt to \nneutralize the toxin. This is an unproven technology and will create \ntwo to three times the amount of chemical waste already in the \ninventory. The United States preferred technology is incineration, \nalthough that is not without its problems.\n  My amendment requires that the United States and Russia complete a \njoint laboratory study before the United States provides the balance of \nthe $104 million for a controversial, unproven approach.\n  A second aspect of my amendment is the requirement that Russia agree, \nwith United States assistance, to prepare a comprehensive plan to cope \nwith the Russian chemical weapons destruction program. According to the \nGAO, the administration originally proposed this approach to the \nRussians. The current plan is to develop a proposal for each individual \nwhich will be involved in chemical weapons destruction--there are seven \nsites in Russia.\n  With a declared stockpile of 40,000 metric tonnes, the only way to \nmanage the chemical weapons issue is to view the totality of the \nproblem. The United States cannot be certain whether the proposals deal \nwith the whole problem, unless a comprehensive, detailed plan is \nprepared. Further, the United States cannot be certain of its total \nfinancial obligation without a comprehensive plan.\n  The third aspect of my amendment is to require the President to \ncertify that the Russians are committed to resolving outstanding issues \nunder the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 \nBilateral Destruction Agreement.\n  The Wyoming MOU was intended to build confidence between the United \nStates and Russia in the chemical weapons area and thus facilitate \ncompletion of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \nDestruction. This would be done by exchanging detailed and complete \ndata about their respective chemical weapons programs and by testing \ninspection procedures.\n  Under the MOU, during the first phase, the countries are to exchange \ngeneral data on their chemical weapons and make reciprocal visit to \nstorage, production, and destruction facilities. In the second phase, \nthe counties are to exchange detailed data on their chemical weapon \nstocks and verify this information through reciprocal on-site \ninspections. During this phase, each country is to provide the other \nwith general plans for dismantling chemical weapons production \nfacilities.\n  The first phase of the Wyoming MOU was completed in early 1991. The \nsecond phase of the MOU was delayed because of disputes between the two \ncountries. In a report issued to Congress in January 1995 entitled \n``U.S. Assistance and Related Programs for the New Independent States \nof the Former Soviet Union,'' the administration was more forthcoming. \nThe report says:\n\n       . . . Phase I of the [Wyoming] MOU was completed in \n     February 1991. Documents allowing for the second and final \n     phase of the MOU were agreed upon at the January 1994 Moscow \n     Summit. Russian implementation of Phase II has yielded \n     problematic results. . . . The U.S. believe that several key \n     question and concerns have not yet been resolved in Russia's \n     data declaration. . . . The U.S. continues to have \n     significant concerns about Russia implementation of the \n     Wyoming MOU. . . . Russia still must take concrete steps to \n     fulfill its commitment and resolve existing problems.\n\n  Although not yet ratified, the Bilateral Destruction Agreement \nrequires each party to undertake not to produce chemical weapons and to \nreduce their chemical weapons stockpile to 5,000 agent tonnes. The \nprinciple issue holding up completion of the agreement concerns the \nconversion of former chemical weapons production facilities. Russia \nmissed the December 1992 original target date for starting its \ndestruction program. Currently, it has no comprehensive plan defining \nwhen and how the weapons will be destroyed. An unclassified ACDA report \non arms control compliances merely notes that ``questions remain on \ncertain aspects of the Russian date declaration and inspections.''\n  The Wyoming MOU and the Bilateral Destruct Agreement were intended to \nsupport and facilitate the Chemical Weapons Convention which would \nrestrict members from developing, producing, acquiring stockpiling, \nretaining transferring or using chemical weapons, and require the \ndestruction of those weapons within 15 years.\n  Although it is in our interest to have Russia agree to a verifiable \nChemical Weapons Convention, how can the United States have any \nconfidence in the integrity of the CWC, if Russia has failed to \nimplement these two agreements? For these reasons, Mr. President, it is \nmy intent that the Senate send a signal to Russia and the DOD to get \nserious about putting this important chemical weapons destruction \nprogram in place.\n                  cooperative threat reduction program\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would just like to make some general \ncomments about the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, otherwise \nknown as Nunn-Lugar.\n  To date, close to $1.6 billion has been authorized or appropriated \nfor this program. Out of this amount, less than half of the funds have \nbeen obligated. Earlier this year, the Department of Defense told the \ncommittee that they expected to obligate around $860 million of the \nprevious year's funding by the end of the fiscal year.\n  The committee has been supportive of this effort to help the \nRepublics of the former Soviet Union dismantle and destroy their \nchemical and nuclear weapons stockpile. For various reasons, however, \nthe Department has run into problems in managing the program, either \nthrough administrative problems on the United States side, or, as a \nresult of not being able to conclude implementing agreements with \n\n[[Page S 12653]]\nRussia and the other Republics. I believe the program has been a useful \npolitical tool. However, I don't believe that the program has \naccomplished as much as the Department of Defense would lead one to \nbelieve. The Department of Defense says that the large number of \nreductions in Russia and the Republics are as a result of the \nassistance received through this program.\n  Mr. President, that can hardly be the case, when the majority of the \nfunds for this program overall were not obligated until the latter part \nof 1994. I believe it is accurate to say that this program has been \nhelpful in securing the reductions and return of the strategic nuclear \nweapons from the three Republics, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. \nRussia, however, achieved their reductions prior to entry into force of \nthe START Treaty because it was in their economic interest to do so. By \nimplementing the reductions prior to START entering into force, Russia \nwas able to dismantle those items without having to declare them under \nthe treaty and adhere to the dismantlement requirements of the treaty. \nA number of Members have been concerned with the slow rate of \nobligation of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. For that \nreason, the committee recommended a reduction from the President's \nbudget request, and also agreed with the recommendation of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, to place limitations on the use of the funds, pending a \nPresidential certification regarding the progress of the chemical \nweapons dismantlement program.\n  Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe \nconducted two hearings on nuclear terrorism and proliferation. The \nmajority of witnesses recommended that funds for this program, as well \nas the Department of Energy's companion program be substantially \nincreased.\n  Mr. President, I believe that recommendation is premature, based on \nthe track record of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The \ncommittee will continue to pay close attention to the Department's \nmanagement and obligation rate of the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that the Senator from \nArizona had on the Defense appropriations bill. I believe it has been \nworked out. I worked with him on it. We modified some of its \nprovisions.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment would limit the use of funds \nauthorized for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program pending \ncertification of the following: First, the United States and Russia \nhave successfully completed a joint laboratory study evaluating the \nchemical weapons neutralization process; second, that Russia is in the \nprocess of preparing a comprehensive plan to dismantle and destroy its \nchemical weapons stockpile; and third, that Russia remains committed to \nresolving the outstanding issues regarding its compliance with the 1989 \nWyoming memorandum of understanding and the 1990 bilateral destruction \nagreement.\n  This is a very important amendment.\n  We urge its adoption.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2463) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2464\n\n  (Purpose: To make various technical corrections and other technical \n               amendments to existing provisions of law)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf \nof the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Thurmond, \n     for himself and Mr. Nunn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2464.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under Amendments \nSubmitted.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment, on behalf of the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, makes certain technical amendments to \nthe existing provisions of law. The amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2464) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, while I commend the work of the Senators \ninvolved in negotiating this compromise amendment on missile defenses, \nwhich is certainly an improvement over what is currently in the bill, I \ncannot support the amendment. By nature, compromises are never perfect, \nbut they usually take the form of something each side can live with. In \nthis case, I do not believe that the language in this amendment is \nsomething we can afford to live with.\n  Despite the changes, this proposal still commits us to the deployment \nin the near future of expensive and destabilizing missile defense \nsystems. This is not the way we should be going. The time and energy \nthe Senate has put into this issue would be much more wisely spent on \nratification of the START II and chemical weapons treaties, which are \nsitting in the Foreign Relations Committee. The proponents of robust \nmissile defenses argue that the end of the cold war makes obsolete arms \ncontrol treaties negotiated in that area. I could not disagree more. \nThe way to a more secure United States and a more peaceful world is \nthrough building on our arms control treaties, not destroying them.\n  This amendment, while designed by its authors to be compliant with \nthe ARM Treaty, moves us in the direction of fundamentally altering or \neven withdrawing from the treaty. The AMB Treaty is a cornerstone of \nour arms control policies, and I believe we must retain its integrity, \nespecially to ensure Russian ratification and implementation of START \nII. Putting at risk this ratification makes us less safe, not more.\n  I am also concerned about the costs of deploying national missile \ndefenses, which has not entered into this debate to the extent it \nshould. By one estimate, it could cost some $100 billion, and the way \nweapons systems go, like the B-2, it is not hard to imagine the costs \nsoaring higher. Many of the proponents of this star wars-like \ndeployment joined me in supporting the balanced budget amendment, but \nhave not explained how they would reconcile that goal with the huge \ncosts of this program.\n  I recognize the choices that had to be made on this issue, and \nSenators Nunn and Warner got the best deal that they could. But when \nSenator Warner says that the amendment sets a clear path to deployment \nof national missile defenses, I have no choice but to oppose it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues who were involved \nin drafting this amendment on missile defense. The hard work that went \ninto the crafting of this compromise is strong evidence of both the \nimportance of the issue and the dedication of the members and staff who \nspent many days and nights attempting to defense common ground on this \ncritical issue. Their efforts, and the several votes we have already \nhad on the fiscal year 1996 Defense authorization and appropriations \nbills regarding missile defense will be viewed one day as the turning \npoint in the debate on defending America and American interests against \nballistic missile attack.\n  There are elements of this compromise that I am satisfied with. For \nexample, section 232(9) contains the following language: ``Due to \nlimitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude deployment of more than \n100 ground-based ABM interceptors at a \n\n[[Page S 12654]]\nsingle site, the United States is currently prohibited from deploying a \nnational missile defense system capable of defending the continental \nUnited States, and Hawaii against even the most limited ballistic \nmissile attacks.'' While some might find virtue in being defenseless \nagainst even the most limited of threats--a threat not even \ncontemplated during the negotiations of the ABM Treaty--I do not. This \ndefenselessness can only serve as an invitation to those with interests \nthat are hostile to our own to develop or acquire the capability to put \nthe United States at risk from long-range ballistic missiles. That this \namendment recognizes our inability to defend against even a limited \nthreat should be regarded as progress.\n  The recent revelations about Saddam Hussein's weapons program should \nteach us that we won't ever know as much about some ballistic missile \nand weapons of mass destruction programs as we think we do. Combine \nthis with the cavalier export control regimes of other countries \ncurrently possessing these weapons and delivery systems, and the oft-\nstated l10 years until the United States could be threatened by long-\nrange missiles sounds more like wishful thinking than dispassionate \nanalysis.\n  I have three major concerns with this amendment:\n  First, unlike the committee-reported bill, the amendment does not \nrequire the deployment of a national missile defense system capable of \ndefending all of the United States against even the most limited of \nthreats. This must change. We have been engaged for too long in \ndeveloping for deployment the necessary systems. Instead of committing \nto deploy an NMD system against a limited threat, this amendment \ncommits to more procrastination. We've had enough of this, and anything \nshort of a commitment to deploy is unacceptable.\n  Second, section 238 of the amendment prohibits the use of funds to \nimplement an ABM/TMD demarcation agreement with any of the states of \nthe former Soviet Union which is more restrictive than that specified \nin section 238(b) without the advice and consent of the Senate or \nenactment of subsequent legislation. This funding prohibition is fine, \nas far as it goes; unfortunately, it does not go far enough. The \namendment is silent on the possibility that the administration could \nenact a more restrictive demarcation unilaterally. In essence, the \namendment tells the administration that if it wants to have a more \nrestrictive demarcation standard than that spelled out all it has to do \nis announce the standard unilaterally, without Russian agreement. This \namendment would not prohibit the use of funds by the administration if \nit were simply to take the current Russian proposal on demarcation and \nadopt it as the unilateral position of the United States. To go one \nstep further, as written this amendment would allow both the United \nStates and Russia to adopt the same Russian proposal unilaterally \nwithout triggering the prohibition on the use of funds in section \n238(c). If we are not willing to permit, as part of a bilateral or \nmultilateral agreement, a more restrictive demarcation standard than \nthat specified in the amendment, why should we be willing to allow the \nadoption of a more restrictive standard unilaterally?\n  Third, prior to deployment of a national missile defense system \ncapable against a limited threat, section 233(3) of the amendment \nmandates congressional review of, ``(A) the affordability and \noperational effectiveness of such a system; (B) the threat to be \ncountered by such a system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with \nrespect to such a system.'' In addition to the fact that section 233(3) \n(A) and (B) are unnecessary restatements of a basic purpose of each \nyear's Defense authorization and appropriations bills for all defense \nprograms, the requirement in section 233(3)(C) is completely backward. \nInstead of requiring review of the effect of defending America on the \nABM Treaty, we ought to review the effect of the ABM Treaty on \ndefending America. The defense of our country is more important to me \nthan the defense of a treaty that puts our country at risk.\n  There are other parts of the amendment in need of improvement, though \nthey are of lesser importance than the problems I've already raised. \nI'll conclude by making four observations: First, notwithstanding the \ndesire by some to ignore the threat posed to the United States by \nweapons of mass destruction and their ballistic missile delivery \nsystems, this threat is serious and we cannot continue to procrastinate \nover employing the means at hand to reduce this threat. Second, a \nnational missile defense against a limited threat would in no way \nundermine United States-Russian deterrence, and would only enhance \ndeterrence of rogue nations or groups with interests contrary to those \nof the United States, all of whom are limited by scarcity of funds. We \nwould do well to pay close attention to what Secretary Perry said \nrecently, that, ``The bad news is that in this era, deterrence may not \nprovide even the cold comfort it did during the cold war. We may be \nfacing terrorists or rogue regimes with ballistic missiles and nuclear \nweapons at the same time in the future, and they may not buy into our \ndeterrence theory. Indeed, they may be madder than MAD.'' Third, \nhowever the Russian Duma acts on the START II Treaty, its decision will \nbe based on many factors, only one of which is their perception of \nUnited States actions with regard to the ABM Treaty. It is incorrect to \nsuggest that Duma ratification of START II is based solely on our \nballistic missile defense legislation, and the Senate cannot allow \nitself to be held hostage by threats of retaliation by the Duma. \nFourth, the missile defense provisions in the underlying bill will not \nviolate the ABM Treaty unless the administration takes no action to \nmodify the treaty. Indeed, Secretary of State Christopher made this \npoint in an August 14, 1995 cable, where in talking points provided for \nselected U.S. embassies he said, ``The provisions as proposed by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee call for deployment of a national, \nmultiple-site missile defense that, if deployed, without treaty \namendment, would violate the ABM Treaty.'' Secretary Christopher is \nsaying that a multiple-site NMD system could be made ABM Treaty-\ncompliant by simply amending the treaty. The assertions that have been \nmade on this floor and by administration officials that, in and of \nitself, the underlying bill violates the ABM Treaty, are wrong. If you \ndon't want to take my word for it, ask Secretary Christopher.\n  I think the amendment weakens the committee-reported Missile Defense \nAct of 1995, but having said that it is important to get this bill to \nconference where we will have an opportunity to improve these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 1 month ago I rose to support the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995, as the Armed Services Committee reported it. It \nseemed to me to be just about the right response to the growing threat \nof weapons of mass destruction and ballistic and cruise missiles. \nFrankly, I was a bit surprised by the vehemence with which some of my \ncolleagues opposed the bill once it came to the floor.\n  Many Americans are unaware that right now, America is defenseless \nagainst ballistic missiles. If that fact were better known, I think \nmany Americans would be very angry that the Missile Defense Act of 1995 \nran into so much opposition from the Clinton administration and some of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  But the fact is that our choice--the choice of those who want to \nprotect America from this growing threat--was between this revised \namendment or no bill at all. Given the other important aspects of this \nbill, and given Saddam Hussein's recent revelations, we chose to work \nthings out and to take a step toward defending America--although it is \nnot as big a step as we wanted. Nevertheless this amendment is a step \nforward and, let us not forget, we will have an opportunity in \nconference with the House to make modifications.\n  In any case, there can be no doubt that this bill and this amendment \ntake concrete steps toward establishing effective theater and national \nmissile defenses.\n  On the essential question of national defense, this amendment \nestablishes as U.S. policy the deployment of a multiple-site national \nmissile is operationally effective against limited, accidental, or \nunauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the territory of the United \nStates--a defense system that can be augmented over time to provide a \nlayered defense. The Secretary of Defense is instructed to implement \nthis policy \n\n[[Page S 12655]]\nby developing a national missile defense system--consisting of ground-\nbased interceptors, fixed ground-based radars, and space-based \nsensors--capable of being deployed by the end of 2003.\n  Unlike some of my\n   colleagues who still believe that the cold-war-era ABM Treaty \ndefends America, I believe that nothing short of the development and \ndeployment of an effective national missile defense system will truly \nprotect America against the threats of the 21st century.\n\n  The recent revelations by Saddam Hussein--that the Iraqis filled \nnearly 200 bombs and warheads for ballistic missiles with biological \nand toxin weapons--should drive this point home.\n  With respect to the ABM Treaty, this legislation calls for a year of \ncareful consideration on how to proceed with the ABM Treaty in the \nlonger term. During that time the President could and should seek to \nnegotiate with Russia a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow \nthe United States to proceed with multiple-site deployments. \nFurthermore, this legislation prohibits the use of funds to implement \nan agreement limiting theater missile defenses--which were never \nlimited by the ABM Treaty--without the advice and consent of the \nSenate. This was intended to address to the very real concern that the \nadministration has not abandoned the ill-conceived course of \nnegotiating changes to the ABM Treaty that would restrict theater \nmissile defenses despite oft-stated and deep-seated Senate objections.\n  This legislation also establishes a theater missile defense core \nprogram and a cruise missile initiative that focuses our resources on \ndeploying effective systems that are needed right now to defend, \nAmerican interests around the globe.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not achieve all of the objectives \nI would like to have seen achieved. However, it does take firm, \ntangible steps toward defending America--most importantly by setting a \ngoal of 2003 to deploy a multiple site, effective defense of the United \nStates of America. On this there cannot be and will not be any \ncompromise. We will have a conference with the House. And if the \nconference report that is worked out is acceptable and is passed by the \nCongress, the responsibility will be with the President to sign this \nbill so that defending America becomes the law of the land.\n\n                       Hans bethe warned of this\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at a point in our history when we have \nsuccessfully avoided the Armagedonnic catastrophe of nuclear \nconfrontation and have began the sensible process of limiting nuclear \nwarheads by treaty, the Senate proposes to adopt a bill that could \nresurrect the nuclear arms race, and, in the process, jeopardize 23 \nyears of arms control treaties. The Armed Services Committee has \npresented the Senate with a bill that proposes a national ballistic \nmissile defense system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this \nis a $48 billion proposition.\n  Can we in good conscience embark on a project to doubtful feasibility \nand enormous cost, which only addresses one of many nuclear threats? \nPotential adversaries will simply channel their resources into \nproducing delivery vehicles that the system could not defend against; \nsubmarines, cruise missiles, stealth aircraft, terrorists car bombs.\n  In 1977, Prof. Han Bethe of Cornell University, one of the most \ndistinguished figures of sciences in the nuclear age, during a visit to \nmy home in upstate New York, warned me that such a plans would 1 day be \npresented to the Senate.\n  On March 23, 1983, with little attention given to the technical \ndetails, President Reagan proposed an initiative which became known as \nthe strategic defense initiative [SDI]. We have yet to work out the \ntechnical details of a national missile defense system. Yet there are \nthose in this body who appear to be bent on deploying some remnant of \nthe SDI, without regard to the potential threats that exist, or the \ncosts involved.\n  In testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee in 1992, Dr. Bethe \nelaborated on his objections to deploying such a system. I ask \nunanimous consent that an excerpt from the transcript of that hearing \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Hearing Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, February 25, 1992\n\n       Senator Moynihan. I recall that 15 years ago, Dr. Bethe, \n     you and Mrs. Bethe very graciously came to lunch, and you \n     tried to warn me against something I never heard of. I really \n     didn't know what you were talking about. It turned out to be \n     Star Wars.6\n       You described, as I recall, having me with a Soviet \n     physicist in a conference in Rome or some such place and you \n     both agreed that there were those people who thought one \n     could have a small nuclear device explode in space and send \n     out a laser beam that would zap something on the other side \n     of the universe. You both agreed\n      that it was crazy but that there were plenty of crazy people \n     in both our countries and they were likely to try it. You \n     were not wrong.\n       But now we are further down in our notions. Brilliant \n     Pebbles I think is the most recent formulation.\n       Do you think we should pursue this kind of anti-missile \n     technology at this level? I know that you thought at the \n     grand level it would not prove coherent, and it did not. But \n     might it at a lower level? Did you have any thoughts for us \n     on this?\n       Dr. Bethe. I have a strong opinion on Star Wars. I thought \n     it was misconceived from the beginning, and by now I think \n     there is no reason at all to pursue it or to pursue any \n     variation of it.\n       Senator Moynihan. Or to pursue any variation of it.\n       Dr. Bethe. The Brilliant Pebbles, in contrast to the X-ray \n     laser, are likely to be technically feasible. But I am \n     terribly nervous about having 1,000 such devices cruising \n     about above the atmosphere. One of them might hit an \n     asteroid. They tell me and I think they are right that they \n     have precautions against that. But I believe that the only \n     thing that should be done is research. That should continue. \n     But we should not deploy any of these devices.\n       Senator Moynihan. Did I hear you correctly when you said \n     that it might hit an asteroid?\n       Dr. Bethe. Yes.\n       Senator Moynihan. I thought for a moment you had said \n     ``astronaut.'' But it might be both or either, for that \n     matter, if it comes to it.\n       May I say to the Chairman and to my colleague, Senator \n     Robb, that in 1977, Hans Bethe on our back porch in upstate \n     New York, said one of these days some crazy scientist is \n     going to come along to you fellows in the Senate and say I \n     have a plan whereby we put these nuclear weapons in place all \n     over the atmosphere and at a certain point we detonate them \n     and they produce a laser and it goes zap. And he said it's \n     coming and when it comes, tell those people they are loony.\n       Well, it came, just as he predicted. In 1945, he wrote that \n     the Soviets could have the bomb in 5 years; they got it in 4. \n     After our luncheon in 1977 we got Star Wars in 5, I think.\n       We could have saved ourselves a lot of grief, it seems to \n     me, if we had listened to you in the first place. You know, \n     the people who built these bombs know\n      something about how they work. Dr. Bethe, you've even \n     suggested you could go down into the basement and turn \n     uranium into reactor fuel. It is not that much of a \n     technical feat.\n       But you would keep the research going on the general \n     principle that you ought to know as much physics as you can \n     but leave it on the ground and not deploy any Brilliant \n     Pebbles or Sullen Sods or whatever.\n       Dr. Bethe. I think we should not deploy any of this. I \n     think even if they are effective, everybody has agreed that \n     they are no good against a strong enemy like the Soviet Union \n     used to be. I think it would be a mistake to deploy such \n     devices against accidental launch of Third World countries.\n       Is that the answer you wanted?\n       Senator Moynihan. Yes. I wanted your view, but that was the \n     question I wanted answered. Yes.\n       Does Ambassador Nitze have a different view?\n       Ambassador Nitze. I think the terms involved are very \n     confusing and are not precisely defined. With respect to the \n     interception of shorter-range ballistic missiles, for \n     instance, such as the Patriot missile, which was used during \n     the Gulf War, I think that is an important thing which one \n     should continue to develop.\n       Dr. Bethe. [Nods affirmatively.]\n       Senator Moynihan. I think you are getting agreement from \n     your colleague at the table. But those are ground-based or at \n     least based within the atmosphere.\n       Ambassador Nitze. They are ground based, the Patriot \n     missile. I think most of the devices which might be used \n     against, for instance, shorter-range things, such as SCUDS, \n     would be ground-based. But there are some that are not.\n       The man who really invented Brilliant Pebbles--I forget his \n     name--now works at Los Alamos and he believes that one ought \n     to go for something which he calls ``burros,'' being the \n     stupidest animal around. Instead of having these bright \n     interceptors, you have ones with low capability but which \n     would be very good against shorter range missiles, which \n     would be in the lower atmosphere. I think he may be right \n     about that.\n       So if there are ways and means of dealing with the shorter \n     range threats, which the Saddam Husseins or the Iraqis and so \n     forth are capable of, I think we ought to be willing \n\n[[Page S 12656]]\n     to deploy those in the event the technology works out.\n       So it's a question of I want to know precisely what it is \n     that we are talking about when we say don't do it or do do \n     it.\n       Senator Moynihan. Dr. Bethe does not seem to disagree with \n     that.\n       Dr. Bethe. I agree that it would be good to have an \n     effective means against shorter-range missiles. Brilliant \n     Pebbles is not the right thing, and I believe some \n     knowledgeable people think that we can have such a device. \n     When we see one, I am in favor of it.\n       Senator Moynihan. Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, George P. Shultz recounts in his \nbiography ``Turmoil and Triumph'' that SDI was President Reagan's own \nidea but that the plan was announced after a favorable endorsement from \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. Then Secretary of State Shultz reports that \nwhen Lawrence Eagleburger informed him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nhad told the President that a strategic defense system could be \ndeveloped, the Secretary responded, ``The Chiefs are not equipped to \nmake this kind of proposal. They are not scientists.'' Of course, when \nthe scientists were consulted, it was concluded it could not be done.\n  Finally, consideration must be given to the possible response of \nRussia to our actions. The original bill would have required us to \nabrogate the ABM Treaty. If we were to break the ABM Treaty \nunilaterally, it is clear that Russia would respond by rejecting START \nII. This amendment still proposes that if the Russians do not agree to \nmodify the ABM Treaty to allow us to deploy a national missile defense \nsystem that consideration be given to United States withdrawal from the \nABM Treaty. Russian nationalists would certainly be pleased if we would \ndo so.\n  My point is simply that the national missile defense system \nenvisioned in this bill will only be effective against limited \nballistic missile attacks. Limited is not defined, but it is unlikely \nthat it might be referring to a capability of defending against 1,400 \nballistic missiles launched simultaneously? We can wipe out 1,400 \nballistic missiles; not with a ballistic missile defense system, but \nwith a treaty. The START II Treaty. Treaties can go a long way to \nprotecting us against nuclear weapons. If we jeopardize ratification of \nSTART II, we risk a lot for this limited ballistic missile defense \nsystem.\n                            missile defense\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, during the August recess, I had about \nseven events each day and never passed up the opportunity to let them \nknow about the most critical threat facing America today--missile \nattack. I spoke about the fact that the actions we take today will \ndirectly affect the kind of defense posture our country has in 5 to 7 \nyears.\n  The danger we face is real. Yet I was surprised and shocked at the \nambivalence and lack of understanding that exists concerning this vital \nissue. Many people simply do not realize--and are themselves shocked to \nbe told--that our country today has no missile defense system in place \ncapable of protecting American cities from long range missile attacks.\n  I estimated that perhaps most Oklahomans were not readily aware of \nsome of the basic terms of the debate currently going on in Washington \nabout the important missile defense provisions of the current defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I would suggest that part of the reason for this has to do with the \nmedia, particularly the national media, most of which has either not \nadequately focused on this issue or has skewed it in such a way as to \ndowngrade its importance. But there are also similar problems with the \nlocal media.\n  For example, in Oklahoma there are two major daily newspapers, the \ndaily Oklahoman and the Tulsa World. Their differences reflect similar \ndisparities in the national media.\n  The Tulsa World reflects a consistent liberal view of the world, one \nwhich favors the expansion of the role of government in almost every \narea except defense. Their left-leaning editorial view tends to distort \nthe reality of significant issues such as missile defense.\n  The daily Oklahoman, on the other hand, much more clearly reflects \nthe conservative social and economic values of Oklahomans. It is a \nlarger paper and provides a much more realistic approach to issues such \nas national defense.\n  During the past month, each of these papers had major editorials on \nthe threat of missile attack. There is quite a difference in their \napproach. I think it will be instructive for my colleagues to examine \nthese editorials and ponder how the media is shaping the debate about \nvital issues facing our country.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the two editorials I mentioned \nconcerning missile defense--one from the Tulsa World and one from the \ndaily Oklahoman--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n                  [From the Oklahoman, Aug. 20, 1995]\n\n                         For the Common Defense\n\n       The Clinton administration's attachment to a pair of \n     international agreements has the potential to weaken U.S. \n     defenses against a foreign attack.\n       President Clinton last week announced the United States \n     would cease future nuclear weapons tests in hopes of \n     energizing stalled talks aimed at producing a worldwide test \n     ban.\n       At the same time, Clinton's threatened veto of the defense \n     authorization bill--because it orders development of a \n     national missile defense system--is behind efforts to water \n     down the missile defense part of the bill.\n       It's a double-whammy for U.S. national security.\n       First, although declaring a U.S. nuclear test ban looks \n     great on television and might evoke comparisons with John F. \n     Kennedy (something Clinton wouldn't mind), it's quite a leap \n     of faith minus guarantees the Russians will do likewise.\n       Also, Pentagon officials are concerned a test ban will make \n     it impossible to guarantee the reliability of America's 7,000 \n     nuclear weapons. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., says doubt about \n     the U.S. arsenal could even invite a nuclear attack.\n       Alarmingly, it appears Clinton cares more about reviving \n     world test ban talks than he does about protecting the United \n     States.\n       Concerning national missile defense, the Senate bill \n     mandates a system to protect the country from deliberate or \n     accidental missile attack. But Clinton has threatened a veto, \n     saving it would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty signed with the then-Soviet Union.\n       Recently four senators proposed an amendment to allow \n     missile defense planning but delaying deployment pending \n     congressional review. It also would permit the president to \n     negotiate changes in the ABM treaty to allow a missile \n     defense.\n       Sounds pretty good, but some analysts say the amendment, \n     which will be voted on when Congress returns from its August \n     recess, could be a subtle way to kill a missile defense \n     system.\n       Baker Spring of the conservative Heritage Foundation says \n     the amendment's delaying aspects would allow Clinton, who \n     opposes missile defense, ``to strangle programs in the \n     crib.'' Spring says it seems as if ``we're saying the ABM \n     treaty comes first, the defense of the nation comes second.''\n       Finally, Clinton argues two mutually exclusive ideas. \n     First, he says existing nuclear weapons can defend America, \n     making a missile defense unnecessary. Then he says the United \n     States will quit the testing that ensures the reliability of \n     current weapons systems. Huh?\n       Clinton can't have it both ways. The Senate should insist \n     on moving ahead with a missile defense program.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Tulsa World, Aug. 14, 1995]\n\n                         Pork, Republican Style\n\n       Right-wing Republicans in Congress are pushing a bill that \n     would force the Pentagon to develop a multi-site national \n     missile defense system by 2003. This is the latest \n     incarnation of the Star Wars program, a science-fiction anti-\n     missile system that blossomed during the Reagan \n     administration.\n       There are many reasons why this outrageously expensive \n     scheme should be put to sleep once and for all.\n       First, it would have to work perfectly in order to protect \n     American cities and military bases from nuclear weapons. It \n     would do little good to knock down 19 out of 20 nuclear-\n     tipped missiles aimed at, say, New York. The 20th bomb would \n     do the job. Anyone who works with computers and other \n     electronic equipment knows from personal experience that this \n     goal of perfect performance is impossible.\n       Even if science could find a perfect way to frustrate a \n     missile weapons system with a 100-percent success rate, the \n     same science could just as easily find the means to frustrate \n     the anti-missile system. So, the next logical step would be \n     an anti-anti-missile system, a weapon to knock out or to \n     disable the anti-missile defense system. It wouldn't have to \n     be disabled completely--just enough to get a few nuclear \n     devices through the ``shield.''\n       But there are more urgent reasons why this is a bad idea. \n     It would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with \n     the former Soviet Union. This pointless provocation does not \n     reduce the risk of nuclear war. It increases it.\n       Finally, it is an insult to the budget-balancing process. \n     It is unbelievable that this wasteful scheme is being \n     advanced at the \n\n[[Page S 12657]]\n     same time Americans are being asked to accept cuts in such things as \n     education, care for the elderly and medical help for the \n     poor.\n       John Isaacs, spokesman for an arms control advocacy group, \n     explained part of the problem: ``Defending pork is a \n     bipartisan pastime. It is endorsed by both Democrats and \n     Republicans.''\n       Star Wars is the right-wing Republican version of pork.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, some of my colleagues who have been \ncomplaining about the liberal eastern media should be aware that there \nare similar problems and concerns reflected in the local media in the \nvery heartland of America.\n  As we approach a vote on the missile defense provisions of the \ndefense bill which have been worked out among our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I want to commend Senators for their good-faith \nefforts to reach a compromise on this very complex and contentious \nissue.\n  I supported the wording of the original bill that came out of the \ncommittee as a good start which recognized the threat and put us on the \nroad to providing the real missile defense we need.\n  While I will vote in favor of the new compromise provisions, I am not \npleased with the weakening of language and goals that this compromise \nrepresents. I am very hopeful that the language can be significantly \nstrengthened when we get to conference.\n  We started out saying that we would deploy a national missile defense \nsystem.\n Now we are just going to develop for deployment a national missile \ndefense.\n\n  This compromise urges deployment of theater missile defenses to \nbenefit our deployed troops and allies, but only allows a missile \ndefense for the American people to be developed for deployment.\n  We began by simply calling for highly effective missile defenses; we \nhave now required that they be affordable missile defenses.\n  No one wants to waste money. But how will affordability be defined? \nHow do we put a price on defending America from missile attacks?\n  The truth is that the term ``affordable'' will simply be used as a \nclub by opponents of missile defense for whom the price of security is \nalways too high.\n  The term ``cost effective'' will just be used to fight every dollar \nthat we try to spend on missile defense from now on.\n  Cost effectiveness should not even be an issue--the destruction by \none bomb of a single building in Oklahoma City cost $500 million. \nImagine how much a limited strike by nuclear weapons will cost.\n  We claim to recognize that the era of mutual assured destruction is \nover. But instead of recognizing the reality that the ABM Treaty is a \nrelic of the cold war and mutual assured destruction, this compromise \nrequires negotiations with the Russian Government within the context of \nthe ABM Treaty before we defend the American people from attack.\n  This is a much smaller step forward than it should have been. We \nshould stop talking about developing options, and begin to deploy a \nnational missile defense system.\n  The American people must know that the threat we face in the very \nnear future is real and it affects all of us. It would be the height of \nirresponsibility if we were not prepared to meet this reality.\n  The challenge before us is to face the facts. Former CIA Director \nJames Woolsey, who served in the Clinton administration and is no \npartisan advocate, has told us bluntly: Up to 25 nations either have or \nare developing weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver \nthem.\n  The CIA currently tells us that North Korea is now working on a long-\nrange missile--the Tapeo Dong II--which may be capable of reaching \nAlaska and Hawaii within 5 years.\n  These are serious challenges. It is our duty to face them now and not \nblind ourselves by rationalizing that we can wait 10 more years or 20 \nmore years. If we do, it may well be too late.\n  So it is my hope that when the defense bill gets to conference we \nwill be able to strengthen the language so that we make it clear that \nwe are proceeding on a course which will put in place a national \nmissile defense system within 5 to 7 years.\n  In my mind, this is the least we can do to meet our highest \nconstitutional obligation--the one without which no other obligations \nhave any meaning--to provide for the common defense--the protection of \nour people, our freedom, and our country.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the \nbipartisan compromise on ballistic missile defenses [BMD]. Although two \nkey amendments by opponents of BMD were voted down by the Senate on \nAugust 3 and 4, the bipartisan amendment is necessary in order to \nadvance the Department of Defense authorization bill and to bring it to \na conference with the House.\n  I supported the original version of the bill submitted by the Armed \nServices Committee. The original version set a proper course for \ndeployment of theater and strategic ballistic missile defenses on a \ntime-line commensurate with the potential threat. Additionally, the \noriginal language repudiated the ABM Treaty and its philosophical \nbasis, mutual assured destruction, by declaring that it is the policy \nof the United States that the two are ``not a suitable basis for \nstability in a multipolar world.''\n  Though I am not at all entirely pleased with the compromise language, \nthe present version does preserve the fundamental principles of the \noriginal bill: immediate deployment of theater missile defenses; the \npossibility of multiple site national missile defense deployments; \nlayered defenses; and review of the ABM Treaty. The new language \ndiffers from the original bill in three sections. I hope that these \ndifferences, which are as follows, are addressed by the conferees.\n  First, the compromise calls for the United States to embark on a \nprogram to develop for deployment a national missile defense system. \nThis characterizes the research we have undertaken for the last 12 \nyears and changes nothing with respect to our Nation's commitment to \ndeploy defenses. The original bill clearly called for deployment of a \nnational missile defense system and is a more proactive statement of \ncongressional intent to deploy a national missile defense system rather \nthan to conduct research forever.\n  The threat facing the United States, its allies and troops abroad by \nthe proliferation of ballistic missiles mandates that we move forward \ntoward deploying ballistic missile defenses. In a March 1995 report, \n``The Weapons Proliferation Threat,'' the Central Intelligence Agency \nobserved that at least 20 countries--nearly half of them in the Middle \nEast and Asia--already have or may be developing weapons of mass \ndestruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. Five countries--\nNorth Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Syria--pose the greatest threat \nbecause of the aggressive nature of their weapons of mass destruction \nprogram. All already have or are developing ballistic missile that \ncould threaten U.S. interests.\n  Second, in addressing the requirements of a layered defense system, \nthe compromise language merely calls for a system that can be augmented \nover time as the threat changes. The original bill required a system \nthat will be augmented over time as the threat changes to provide a \nlayered defense. The key issue here is whether the DOD plans now for a \nlayered defense system, one potentially with space-based assets, or \ndoes DOD merely hold out the option for the possibility of evolving to \na layered defense?\n  I believe the commitment for layered defenses is important. Space-\nbased interceptors provide worldwide, instantaneous protection against \nmissiles launched from anywhere in the world, and are both cheaper and \nmore effective than their ground-based counterparts. Missiles \nlaunched--either by accident or in anger--against the United States or \nour allies and friends, could be destroyed in the early stages of their \nflight, before they release their warheads if, but only if, we have \nspace-based interceptors. This is especially important with multiple \nwarhead missiles or missiles with chemical or biological warheads. With \nthe latter, the early intercept results in more harm to the attacking \nnation as chemical or biological agents would be dispersed over its \nterritory. Another advantage of space assets is that they are always on \nstation.\n  Third, both the compromise and the original bill have language \nconcerning the demarcation line between strategic \n\n[[Page S 12658]]\nand theater ballistic missile defenses. This section was necessary \nbecause the current position of the Clinton administration constrains \nkey theater missile defense systems. The effect of what the Clinton \nadministration proposed was to degrade the only advanced theater \nsystems in research and development in the United States. The bill and \ncompromise both require the administration to submit for approval by \nthe Senate any agreement it reached with the Russians on limiting \ntheater missile defenses. In addition, it prohibits the expenditure of \nfunds for 1 year only to implement any agreement that would limit the \ncapability of our theater missile defense systems. It is my hope that \nin conference, the restriction will be made permanent.\n  The compromise version, however, does not make clear that it is the \nintent of the Senate, that any unilateral limitation by the United \nStates should also be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. \nThe administration has received five letters from Members of the Senate \nand has participated in countless meetings over the past 8 months on \nthis subject. That the Senate takes this matter seriously and would not \nlook favorably on attempts to circumvent the clear intent of the \nSenate, should be abundantly clear.\n  The United States must proceed immediately with the development and \ndeployment of theater ballistic missile defenses, and, at the earliest \npractical time, should deploy national missile defenses. During the \nlast 4 weeks, while Congress has been on recess, information has \nsurfaced concerning Iraq's military buildup of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The Washington Post reported that Iraq turned over 147 \nboxes and two large cargo containers containing information which \ndescribes a broader and more advanced effort by the country to produce \nnuclear arms, germ weapons and ballistic missiles than previously \nknown. Among the new disclosures is an Iraqi admission that it had germ \nor toxin- filled shells, aircraft bombs and ballistic missile warheads \nready for possible use during the Persian Gulf war.\n  Iraq also admitted to having begun a crash program in August 1990--\nthe month it invaded Kuwait--aimed at producing a single nuclear weapon \nwithin 1 year. And, finally, the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq plans \nto investigate Iraq's admission that it was capable of indigenously \nproducing engines for Scud missiles and that it has made more progress \nin developing a longer range missile than it had previously stated.\n  The important lesson is that we almost always know less about a \ncountry's program to develop weapons of mass destruction that we think \nwe do. We cannot afford to be sanguine about how long it will take one \ncountry or another to develop a ballistic missile that can threaten the \nUnited States. The evidence suggests that the threat is closer than we \nthink. It is time to seriously address this issue.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to stress that my preference is to \nstick with the original bill language, and I will work with the \nconferees to reinstate some of the critical sections of that bill. \nHowever, in an effort to advance the DOD bill to conference, I am \nreluctantly supporting the compromise amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nunn-Warner-Levin-\nCohen amendment. I commend my colleagues for their tireless efforts in \ndeveloping a compromise on this issue which moves us away from some of \nthe most dangerous steps called for in the committee version of the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995.\n  I still have serious reservations about the compromise language, \nparticularly the effect it may have on Russian ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty. I also question whether the greatest threat of a \nnuclear detonation in the United States comes from ballistic missiles.\n  However, given the likelihood that the Defense authorization bill \nwill pass, I will support the amendment before us as a way to remove \nsome of the more egregiously misguided provisions in the current bill \nlanguage on missile defense.\n  I would like to discuss briefly some of the areas where I see \nimprovement and to point out candidly those provisions in the amendment \nwhich I regard as still being problematic.\n  The amendment clearly makes significant improvements over the current \nlanguage. It moves us away from the certainty of deploying a national \nmissile defense system by 2003. It narrows the focus of missile defense \nefforts from all ballistic missile threats to accidental, unauthorized, \nor limited missile attacks. It guarantees a decisive role for the \nCongress before deployment can occur. It removes restrictions on the \nPresident's ability to negotiate with Russia an appropriate demarcation \nstandard between strategic and theater ballistic missile defenses. And \nit includes the requirement that missile defenses be affordable and \noperationally effective.\n  These are no small achievements. They represent significant \nsubstantive improvements over the current language.\n  There are still several areas of weakness, however.\n  As I said earlier, I am particularly concerned about the effect this \namendment may have on the START process. While the authors of this \namendment have done their best to move us away from a collision course \nwith the ABM Treaty, and many of us believe that they have, that may \nnot be a view shared in Moscow by the Russian Duma.\n  I am not sure they will understand the fine distinction between \n``develop for deployment'' and ``deploy.'' I am not sure they will \nunderstand what we mean when we say that we will proceed in a manner \nwhich is consistent with the ABM Treaty, and then say that we are \nanticipating the need and providing the means to means the treaty. And \nI think they will be alarmed by references that are made to withdrawing \nfrom the treaty.\n  I am concerned about the consequences if the Russians believe that we \nare not acting in good faith, but are intent on abrogating the ABM \nTreaty. As I said on this floor a month ago, the most likely \nconsequence of our breaching the ABM Treaty would be a Russian refusal \nto ratify START II.\n  Why? Because the cheapest way to defeat a missile defense system is \nto overwhelm it. So, if the Russians feel threatened by our development \nof a national missile defense system, they are likely not only to \nscratch the START II Treaty, but to begin a strategic buildup. We will \ncounter with our own buildup and efforts to improve missile defenses, \nand before you know it we will be in a costly arms race, which the ABM \nTreaty was designed to prevent.\n  A costly new arms race is not what Americans expected with the end of \nthe cold war. But that is exactly what they will get if we are not \ncareful to avoid damaging the ABM Treaty, which has been the basis for \nall strategic arms control agreements over the past two decades. I \nmight add that these agreements were made without the United States \ndeploying a strategic missile defense system.\n  A second fundamental concern I have is whether we are correct to \nfocus our resources on defending against nuclear warheads delivered by \nballistic missiles. Even the kind of limited program the authors of \nthis amendment are talking about would cost tens of billions of dollars \nto eventually deploy.\n  The threat of ballistic missile attack from rogue states or \nterrorists groups is at best a questionable one, and is not likely to \narise in the next decade, if ever.\n  The more likely means of delivery of a nuclear explosive device to \nour shores, as I have said on this floor repeatedly, would be an \ninnocuous ship making a regular port call in the United States. A \ndetermined group could assemble a device in the basement of a landmark \nsuch as the World Trade Tower with catastrophic results. Terrorist \ngroups or outlaw states would not need a ballistic missile to reach our \nterritory.\n  And that is where we should be focusing our resources: On tracking \nthese terrorist groups and rogue states and securing the many tons of \nfissile material now spread throughout the vast territory of Russia.\n  In conclusion, let me again thank Senators Nunn, Levin, Cohen, and \nWarner for their efforts on this vital issue. They have greatly \nimproved upon a piece of legislation, which unamended would have \nseriously threatened our national security.\n\n[[Page S 12659]]\n\n  Unfortunately, despite these improvements, I believe that the \npotential is still there to undermine the ABM Treaty and our security \nin the process. However, the choice between the two alternatives--the \nmissile defense language in the bill versus the amendment before us--is \nreally not a choice. I will support the amendment to avoid the more \ndamaging consequences of the current bill language.\n   Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Senate has before it today two \nlegislative proposals that address U.S. policy toward the Anti-\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and missile defense generally. There is \nlanguage in S. 1026 that would require the United States to deploy a \nmultiple-site national missile defense system, an action that would \nviolate the ABM Treaty. Its alternative, the substitute offered by my \ncolleagues, Messrs. Nunn, Levin, Warner, and Cohen, would only require \nthe United States to ``develop'' such a defense ``for deployment.''\n   Though I am not happy with either proposal, I will vote for the \nsubstitute only because it does less damage to the ABM Treaty than its \nalternative. Nobody should interpret this vote, however, as a ringing \nendorsement of the policies set forth in the substitute, for reasons \nwhich I would like to discuss in some detail in this statement today. \nIn my opinion, neither the original language in S. 1026 on missile \ndefense, which was narrowly approved by a straight party vote in the \nArmed Services Committee, nor the substitute addresses my deepest \nconcerns about the future of the ABM Treaty.\n   I recognize the hard work that my colleagues, Messrs. Nunn, Levin, \nWarner, and Cohen, have devoted to forging a bipartisan consensus on \nthis controversial issue. Yet several provisions remain in both \nproposals that jeopardize the future of the ABM Treaty and, as a \nresult, the stability of the strategic relationship between the United \nStates and Russia.\n   Before identifying section by section my specific concerns with \nthese proposals, I would like to address some broader issues.\n\n\n                   Context of Missile Defense Issues\n\n   For almost a quarter century, the ABM Treaty has helped to preserve \nthe peace by guaranteeing the United States the means of retaliating in \nthe event of a nuclear attack by Russia. By prohibiting Russia from \ndeploying a national multiple-site strategic missile defense system, \nthe treaty works to ensure the reliability of the United States nuclear \ndeterrent; in performing this function, the treaty also saves the \ntaxpayer the burden of supporting a robust national missile defense \nsystem.\n   The majority in the Armed Services Committee knows all about the \nimportance of protecting U.S. deterrence capabilities--during committee \ndeliberations over the stockpile stewardship program, I heard a lot \nabout the specter of ``structural nuclear disarmament'' and the vital \nimportance of maintaining a vital nuclear second-strike capability.\n   I therefore cannot explain why there is language in this bill \nreferring to deterrence as a mere relic of the cold war. With thousands \nof Russian and United States nuclear weapons continuing to threaten \neach other, there is no law that Congress can pass that would repeal \nnuclear deterrence--it remains an unpleasant reality, a basic fact of \ninternational life. Mutual assured destruction is not so much a policy \nor a doctrine as a fundamental reality about the current strategic \nrelationship between the United States and Russia.\n   It is good for our security that the ABM Treaty prohibits Russia \nfrom developing or deploying systems to kill United States strategic \nmissiles. Similarly, the lack of a strategic missile defense system in \nthe United States enhances Russia's confidence in its own deterrent. As \na result, the treaty has provided a solid foundation upon which the \nsuperpowers can reduce their nuclear arsenals without jeopardizing \nstrategic stability. This process is now well underway with the START I \nand II treaties. It is a process that, at long last, appears to be \nactually working: the stockpiles are indeed being reduced.\n   The ABM Treaty, however, is now under assault by critics who believe \nit is obsolete. They believe that recent technological developments \noffer the prospect of a safe harbor against theater and limited \nstrategic missile strikes. This is, of course, not the first time that \na technological innovation has led to great strategic instability, \ngreat expenditures, and great dangers to our national security. This is \nnot the first time that unbounded faith in technological fixes has \ncaptured the imagination of defense specialists and editorial writers.\n   The development of the multiple independently targetable reentry \nvehicle (MIRV), for example, was once heralded as a giant technological \ninnovation that would bolster U.S. national security. Yet the START II \ntreaty will eliminate all ground-based MIRV's precisely because of the \nrisks they pose to strategic stability. MIRV's were introduced, lest we \nforget, amid fears that Russia was deploying a missile defense system. \nThe American and Russian experience with MIRV's should remind us all \nthat technology must remain the tool of policy to serve the national \ninterest--it must not drive that policy.\n   Yet technology is very much what is driving the current debate over \nthe future of the ABM Treaty. The whole debate boils down to a few \nfairly straightforward questions: One, are the gains to U.S. and \ninternational security from developing and deploying a national \nstrategic missile defense system worth the risks? Two, are these gains \nworth the costs of acquisition, deployment, and maintenance of such a \nsystem? Three, will these investments address genuine threats? Four, \nare there more effective and affordable alternative ways to preserve \nnational and international security than by developing missile \ndefenses? Five, does the legislation before us today enhance or erode \nthe national security? And six, is America in the post-cold war \nenvironment really best served by a go-it-alone missile defense \nstrategy, or is our security more dependent upon cooperation with our \nallies and maintenance of strong military and intelligence capabilities \nagainst potential adversaries?\n   Congress simply has not fully examined the costs we would pay from \nabandoning the ABM Treaty. When it comes to domestic regulatory \ndecisions, the new congressional majority claims to favor rigorous \ncost/benefit analysis. Yet its members appear reluctant to apply such \nanalysis to our national defense policy, particularly with respect to \nexisting proposals to hinge America's security on star wars or its many \nsequels. Unfortunately, even the substitute missile defense amendment \nbrings new risks and costs into the debate on missile defense.\n\n\n                 The Fable in the First-Degree Amendment\n\n   Let us imagine for a moment that a fictitious new party to the \ntreaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons [NPT], is suddenly \nswept up in a new wave of collective national paranoia. Rumors of new \nforeign threats are rampant, though always hard to pin down. \nNevertheless, the country decides to embark on a policy to acquire an \naffordable and operationally effective nuclear weapon to serve as a \ndeterrent against limited, accidental, or unauthorized foreign nuclear \nattacks. Since the legislators of country x know that the NPT contains \na provision that permits withdrawal from the treaty on only 90 days' \nnotice, these members of parliament promptly decide--after very little \ndebate--to enact a new law authorizing the development for deployment \nof nuclear weapons, so long as this is accomplished within, or \nconsistent with that treaty. The law then goes on to define specific \ntechnical characteristics of such weapons that can be developed without \nbreaching the treaty. And the only weapons that are taboo under this \nnew law are those that exceed these standards and that are actually \ndetonated.\n   On the 91st day of the international outcry over this incredible \nlaw, country x unveils a robust nuclear arsenal without ever having \nbreached the treaty, leaving the whole world to ask, what went wrong?\n   Now forget country x. Let us take some concrete examples. What if \nthe Iranian parliament decides that this approach makes great sense as \nan approach to NPT implementation? What if the Russian Duma someday \ndecides that this is also the way to go in insert its own most-favorite \nnotions of defense policy into its laws implementing the START II \nTreaty? What if Syria becomes a party to the Biological Weapons \nConvention and passes a law \n\n[[Page S 12660]]\npermitting the development for deployment of certain specific types of \nbiological weapons for what it asserts are purely defensive purposes? \nWhat if Germany decides that its commitments under the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime only extend to missile systems that are \nactually demonstrated or flight-tested above the standard 500 kg \npayload/300 km range guidelines? What if each of the 159 countries that \nhave signed the Chemical Weapons Convention decides to enact new laws \ndefining the specific technical characteristics of chemical weapons \nthat are controlled under that treaty? And specifically with respect to \nthe ABM Treaty, if it had been acceptable in the last decade to develop \nfor deployment weapons systems and components that are banned under the \nABM Treaty, would Russias notorious Kraysnoyarsk radar station have \nviolated that treaty?\n   Mr. President, I submit that this is not the way to go about \ninterpreting treaties. This is not the way to stop proliferation. This \nis not the way to pursue arms control. This is not the way to enhance \nthe national security interests of the United States. And this surely \ndoes not serve the interests of international peace and security. Yet \nthis, I regret to say, is the essence of the approaches now before the \nSenate with respect to the development and deployment of missile \ndefense systems that are not allowed by the ABM Treaty.\n   Though I disagree with this aspect of both of these approaches, the \nsubstitute has the advantage of at least not requiring the immediate \ndeployment of prohibited missile defense systems. It continues to \nsuffer, however, from several important weaknesses. It contains vague \nand dangerously ambiguous language. For example, the term limited, as \nused in the term limited, accidental, or unauthorized, is undefined and \nhence expands significantly the scope of the national missile defense \n[NMD] scheme. It requires the development, with the express intention \nof deployment, of an NMD system that is not allowed under article I of \nthe ABM Treaty. It requires the development of TMD systems, such as \nTHAAD and Navy Upper Tier that have capabilities to counter strategic \nballistic missiles, a mandate that conflicts directly with article VI \nof the ABM Treaty. It accepts the committee's one-sided and largely \nunsubstantiated assertions, or findings, about the grave imminent \nmissile threat facing the United States, while ignoring several ways in \nwhich this threat has been attenuated in recent years. It fails to \noffer a single finding about the positive and constructive ways that \nthe ABM Treaty has served key U.S. security interests. It repeals laws \nthat require U.S. compliance with the ABM Treaty. And it places the \nU.S. Congress on formal record endorsing a unilateral U.S. definition \nof an ABM Treaty-permissible missile defense system.\n   Yet despite all these serious weaknesses, the substitute is still \nmarginally better for arms control and nonproliferation than the \nmissile defense measure contained in S. 1026. In sum, though the \nsubstitute has clearly not de-fanged the missile defense proposal found \nin the bill, it has at least filed down some of its incisors.\n\n\n                        From Fable to Nightmare\n\n   I would now like to turn from the fable to the nightmare: namely, \nthe missile defense language in S. 1026. On August 4, 1995, Anthony \nLake wrote to the majority leader that ``* * * unless the unacceptable \nmissile defense provisions are deleted or revised and other changes are \nmade to the bill bringing it more in line with administration policy, \nthe President's advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.''\n  The letter addressed specific concerns over the ABM Treaty and NMD\n   language. If enacted, the letter stated, these terms--\n\n       . . . would effectively abrogate the ABM Treaty by \n     mandating development for deployment by 2003 of a non-\n     compliant, multi-site NMD and unilaterally imposing a \n     solution to the on-going negotiations with Russia on \n     establishing a demarcation under the Treaty between an ABM \n     and a TMD system. The effect of such actions would in all \n     likelihood be to prompt Russia to terminate implementation of \n     the START I Treaty and shelve ratification of START II, \n     thereby leaving thousands of warheads in place that otherwise \n     would be removed from deployment under these two treaties. \n     [Emphasis added.]\n\n  This language echoes similar views expressed by Defense Secretary \nPerry and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili. At issue here is not a duel between liberals or \nconservatives or Democrats and Republicans--at issue is the gain and \nloss to the national security of the United States from abandoning the \nABM Treaty. By my reading, there is no contest.\n  I do not believe that it in any way serves our national interest to \nset ourselves on a course to abrogate that treaty. It surely does not \nserve America's interests to encourage Russia--as this bill inevitably \nwould--to develop its own multiple-site strategic ABM system, an action \nwhich would only weaken our own nuclear deterrent. The costs to cash-\nstrapped American taxpayers of repairing that damage could potentially \nmount into the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  I cannot understand how the supporters of the bill's missile defense \nprovisions can simultaneously claim to worry about what they call, \n``structural nuclear disarmament'' while they are also pushing for a \ncourse of action--abrogating the ABM Treaty--that would truly undercut \nthe effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. It in no way serves \nour interests to encourage Russia to reconsider its commitments under \nthe START I and START II treaties.\n  And by derailing the strategic arms control process, the bill's \nmissile defense language also aggravates the global threat of nuclear \nweapons proliferation. Coming on the heels of the successful permanent \nextension of the NPT, the bill's language on both missile defense and \nnuclear testing would weaken, rather than strengthen, the global \nnuclear regime based on the NPT, an outcome that would prove \ncatastrophic to our global security interests.\n  Few people realize that if there is no ABM Treaty, Russia will even \nbe able to export its strategic missile defense capabilities, something \nthat Article IX of the ABM Treaty now expressly prohibits. I doubt many \nof my colleagues are aware that the ABM Treaty is not just an arms \ncontrol convention--it is also explicitly a nonproliferation treaty. \nArticle 9 reads as follows:\n  To assure the viability and effectiveness of this Treaty, each Party \nundertakes not to transfer to other States, and not to deploy outside \nits national territory, ABM systems or their components limited by this \nTreaty.\n   Note that this language does not prohibit the United States from \nassisting its friends and allies to develop and deploy TMD systems. The \ntreaty does, however, prevent both Russia and the United States from \nsharing strategic missile defense capabilities with other countries. \nAnd in the case of Russia, those capabilities include interceptors with \nnuclear warheads.\n  It seems appropriate, therefore, that before we set ourselves on a \ncourse of abrogating the ABM Treaty, we should carefully examine the \nfull implications for U.S. defense interests around the world of \neliminating the only international constraint on the proliferation of \nthese strategic missile defense systems.\n   How will such proliferation affect the ability of the United States \nto respond to regional crises that might arise around the world in the \nyears ahead? How will it affect the United States ability to project \npower? I am not satisfied that anybody has seriously weighed such \nconsiderations.\n   The treaty, furthermore, does not only ban the horizontal or \ngeographic spread of such missile technology. It also helps to \nconstrain both the size and sophistication of the United States and \nRussian nuclear weapon stockpiles--in short, the ABM Treaty also \nconstrains the vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. By banning \nthe deployment of national strategic missile defense systems, the \ntreaty works to protect the effectiveness and reliability of the US \nnuclear arsenal and thereby works to stabilize nuclear deterrence. \nAbandonment of the treaty will trigger a new offensive nuclear arms \nrace, as leaders both here and in Russia will have to find new ways to \ndefeat these new missile defense systems.\n  Yet I have seen little indication in the process of reviewing this \nproposal\n \n[[Page S 12661]]\n\nthat anybody here has considered how these particular side effects of \nthe bill's ABM proposals--in particular the proliferation-related \naspects of these proposals--would affect the full range of U.S. \nnational security interests around the world.\n   Even our allies, Britain and France, would be affected--the collapse \nof the ABM Treaty would mark an end to any hopes of encouraging these \ncountries to engage in deep cuts of their nuclear stockpiles. And I \ncannot believe for a minute that China would sit by as its neighbors \nringed its borders with strategic missile defense capabilities. Among \nChina's many options to respond to such a development would be a \ndramatic expansion of its offensive nuclear capability. The next \ncrisis, predictably, would be the collapse of the NPT itself as country \nafter country submits its 90-day withdrawal notice--following the \ncourse taken by Country X.\n\n\n                         Some Specific Concerns\n\n   I would now like to outline my specific concerns with these \nproposals--concerns which I will address section by section.\n   Sec. 232 (Findings): Both the bill and the compromise language on \nmissile defense lack any congressional findings acknowledging the \npositive and constructive ways that the ABM Treaty has advanced \nAmerica's arms control and nonproliferation interests. In failing to \naddress these benefits of the treaty, and in failing to recognize that \nin some ways the missile threat to the United States has actually \nlessened in recent years, the proposed findings seriously \nmischaracterizes--and in my view overstates--the missile proliferation \nthreat facing the United States.\n   Few of us here will disagree that the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, jeopardizes our security. \nMany, however, would disagree that developing systems that would be in \nviolation of the ABM Treaty is the right way to go about addressing \nthat threat, especially when there are so many ways of delivering such \nweapons other than by missile.\n   Sec. 233 Policy: With respect to the Policy section, the substitute \nis ambiguous on the fundamental issue of the U.S. intent with respect \nto compliance with the its obligations under ABM Treaty. To the limited \nextent that it addresses this issue, it focuses only on compliance with \na particular version of the ABM Treaty, namely, the treaty's \nobligations as they are unilaterally interpreted in this bill. The \nlanguage also sets in gear significant initiatives without any prior \nconsensus among the parties to the treaty. The terminology about \n``multiple-site'' deployments will apply to systems that have \ncapabilities against strategic missiles. And given that all missile \nattacks are limited by the laws of nature, it is by no means clear what \nthese current proposals mean by the term ``limited'' missile attack.\n   Indeed, this term ``limited, accidental, or unauthorized'' combines \nthe features of a wild card and an elastic clause: though precedents \nhave already been set using this undefined term, I would not want \nRussia to enact legislation unilaterally defining its own \ninterpretation of these terms. Changes such as these to an important \ninternational agreement should be made on the basis of mutual \nunderstandings between the parties and in accordance with the \nconventional amendment and ratification process, rather than dictated \nby statute.\n   References in these proposals to the right to withdraw from the ABM \nTreaty are either redundant--since this right is quite explicit in the \ntreaty--or outright extortionary, since they seek to prescribe a \nspecific diplomatic outcome which only negotiations can appropriately \naccomplish.\n   The compromise proposal also contains language that questions the \ncontinued importance of nuclear deterrence as a basis of U.S. national \nsecurity, despite considerable evidence that deterrence remains as a \nfoundation of our national security and despite the lack of any viable \nalternative.\n   Neither the original bill nor the compromise language addresses the \nissue of nuclear-armed BMD systems--it would surely seem to me that \nbefore we consider taking actions that will lead to multiple violations \nof the ABM Treaty, we should examine fully some of the consequences of \nthat decision, especially with respect to the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. Many people forget that the ABM Treaty also prohibits the \nglobal spread of strategic ballistic missile defense systems. \nConsidering that Russia has just such nuclear-capable systems, it \nhardly seems wise to set ourselves on a course to abandon a treaty that \nprevents the spread of just such technologies. As part of their efforts \nto reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons as a basis of their \nsecurity, both the United States and Russia might well consider \npursuing an agreement to outlaw nuclear-armed missile defense systems.\n   Sec. 234. TMD Architecture: The initial operational capability dates \nin this section and in section 235 (NMD Architecture) should be \nconsistent with understandings reached between the parties to the ABM \nTreaty. THAAD and Navy Upper Tier should only be included in the Core \nProgram if the parties to the ABM Treaty agree that such systems and \ntheir components are permissible under the treaty; the same should \napply to space-based sensors including the Space and Missile Tracking \nSystem (SMTS), and to follow-on systems.\n   Sec. 235. NMD Architecture: As I have already noted, the term \n``limited''--used both in the bill and the compromise to refer to \nfuture missile defense capabilities--is undefined in both proposals. \nClearly, this term should not be defined only by one party to the \ntreaty--if this term has a meaning which Russia does not share, it will \nonly open the door to Russia legislating its own definitions of key \nterms not only in the ABM Treaty but also the START II treaty, the \nChemical Weapons Convention, and possibly other important arms control, \ndisarmament, and nonproliferation agreements.\n   The compromise requires the development for deployment of an NMD \nsystem capable of being deployed at multiple sites, a policy that if \nimplemented would violate the current text of the ABM Treaty. \nDevelopment and deployment of NMD systems are matters that must be \narranged pursuant both to negotiations and to existing treaty amendment \nprocedures, including ratification.\n   Similarly, space-based sensors should be developed only as agreed by \nthe parties. I believe the President should at the very least be \nrequired to prepare a formal assessment of the arms control and \nnonproliferation implications of any systems being developed or \ndeployed for purposes of NMD. References in this section to sea-based \nand space-based systems and expanded numbers of ground-based \ninterceptors only invite the international community to doubt our \nwillingness to live up to our ABM Treaty obligations not to develop or \nto deploy such systems.\n   Sec. 236. Cruise Missile Defense Initiative: Both the compromise and \nthe bill contain language addressing the dangers from the continued \nglobal spread of weapons of mass destruction. Yet both also fail to \nclarify that some of the most likely delivery systems for most weapons \nof mass destruction do not involve ballistic or cruise missiles. It \nseems to me that before we launch into framing defense initiatives \naround specific weapons systems, we should understand better the nature \nof the specific and anticipated threats they pose relative to other \nweapons systems.\n   I can think of at least two other delivery systems that may pose a \nthreat to US defense interests that is equal to or greater than the \nproliferation threat now posed from ballistic missiles--first, the \ncapabilities of advanced strike aircraft (Pakistans F-16s come to mind \nhere as just one example) to deliver weapons of mass destruction, and \nsecond, the threat coming from terrorists using such weapons. Spending \ntens and hundreds of billions on missile defense will not help us to \naddress either of these clear and present dangers.\n   Sec. 237. ABM Treaty: References in the compromise proposal to \nprovisions of the treaty relating to the amendment and withdrawal \nprocess are unnecessary since such provisions are already law of the \nland. Including them only signals an intention to implement such \nrights. Neither proposal acknowledges some of the positive \ncontributions the ABM Treaty has made to the national security of the \nUnited States. It should not be for United States\n \n[[Page S 12662]]\n\nalone, nor Russia alone, to define unilaterally key terms of this \ntreaty--the process of interpretation must involve Russia and the \nnormal process of making, ratifying, and amending treaties. Also the \ncomprehensive review called for in the compromise proposal fails to \ninclude specifically an assessment of the full implications for U.S. \ndiplomatic and security interests of a collapse of the ABM Treaty.\n   Sec. 238. Prohibition on Funds: The velocity/range demarcation \nstandard is unilateral--it has not yet been agreed by the parties. The \nimplementation of the demonstrated capabilities standard should also be \ngoverned by mutual agreement of the parties. The specific prohibition \non funding should only apply to systems that are not in compliance with \nthe ABM Treaty as agreed by the parties. Since section 232 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 1995 remains law of the land, \nthere is no need to repeat it in this bill with respect to the \nPresident's treaty-making powers.\n   Sec. 241. Repeal of Other Laws: The current first-degree amendment \nfollows the existing language in the bill by repealing outright 10 laws \npertaining to missile defense. Some of those provisions are obsolete. \nBut other parts of those laws--such as those dealing with the U.S. \ncompliance with the ABM Treaty, the requirement for realistic tests, \nthe importance of financial burden-sharing with our friends, the \nrequirements for consultations with our allies, previous congressional \nfindings about the positive value of the ABM treaty, and requirements \nfor consultations between the parties to the treaty on activities \nrelating to implementation.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n   Thus to vote for the missile defense proposal in the bill amounts to \na vote against the ABM Treaty, and a vote against that treaty is to \nvote for the proliferation not just of defensive missile systems, but \nfor the proliferation of the strategic nuclear missiles that will be \nnecessary to defeat those defenses. In a very real sense, the death of \nthe ABM Treaty could well signal the deaths of both strategic nuclear \narms control and nuclear nonproliferation. I cannot support any such \nproposal.\n   I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the committee language on \nmissile defense. Let us by all means get on with the business of \nreducing external weapons threats to our country's security, a business \nthe ABM Treaty makes legitimate with respect to TMD. But let us not \nretreat into a technological Fortress America as we would with the \nmissile defense provisions in S. 1026.\n   Today, we have before us a choice between one missile defense \nproposal that is a nightmare and another that is a fable. Given \nadditional time, Congress may well have been able to construct a third \noption, one which built upon and acknowledged the important \ncontributions that the ABM Treaty continues to make to our national \nsecurity. But the schedule is such that we do not have such time. \nAccordingly, I will vote for the least bad of the two proposals before \nus.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record at \nthis point an analysis prepared by my staff of the missile defense \nprovisions now before the Senate, and a table comparing key provisions \nof the ABM Treaty with the proposals found in the substitute amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\nAnalysis of 1995 Missile Defense Proposals in the Senate (Submitted by \n                          Senator John Glenn)\n\n       Last July, the Senate Committee on Armed Services (SASC) \n     reported out the FY96 defense bill (S. 1026), which contained \n     several provisions that would, if implemented, place the \n     United States in violation of the ABM Treaty (ABMT). Included \n     were provisions requiring the deployment of a multiple-site \n     national ballistic missile defense system and prescribing a \n     unilateral U.S. definition of the scope of systems subject to \n     the ABMT, thereby circumventing the ABMT formal amendment \n     process.\n       Following widespread criticism of this proposal, Senators \n     Nunn, Levin, Cohen, and Warner offered in August a bipartisan \n     substitute. Though the substitute does not require immediate \n     deployment of BMD systems in violation of the ABM Treaty, the \n     substitute does not resolve several outstanding questions \n     about America's intentions with respect to its obligations \n     under the ABMT. The table in Annex 1 of this memo illustrates \n     some of the inconsistencies between the substitute and the \n     ABM Treaty.\n       This memo (1) describes and analyzes the SASC missile \n     defense recommendations, and (2) describes and analyzes the \n     substitute proposal.\n\n\n                             1. sasc action\n\n       In summary, the bill moves U.S. policy: (a) away from \n     nuclear deterrence (mutual assured destruction); and (b) away \n     from several ABMT prohibitions (including: multiple-site \n     deployments, ABM systems based at sea and in space, giving \n     TMD systems capabilities to intercept strategic missiles, \n     space-based sensors useful against strategic systems, etc.). \n     The bill contains a unilateral U.S. definition of an ABMT-\n     permissible system. The bill also limits the negotiating \n     flexibility of the President and prohibits the President from \n     spending funds to implement more restrictive ABM controls.\n       The current text of S. 1026 was reported out of Committee \n     on July 12. Subtitle C of Title II (RDT) contains 11 \n     sections pertaining to ``missile defense.'' The proposed \n     language covers theater missile defense (TMD) against theater \n     ballistic missiles (TBMs), national missile defense (NMD) \n     against strategic ballistic missiles (SBMs), announces \n     several findings and new national policies covering both \n     systems, alters the U.S. policy toward the ABMT, and repeals \n     10 other missile defense laws. While not quite abrogating the \n     treaty outright, the SASC language still sets the US on a \n     course out of the ABMT.\n\n                          Findings and policy\n\n       In S.1026, Congress ``finds'' that: missiles are posing a \n     ``significant and growing threat'' to the US; the development \n     of TMDs ``will deny'' US adversaries an option for attacking \n     the US and its allies; the intelligence community sees a \n     growing missile threat; TMDs will ``reduce the incentives'' \n     for missile proliferation; the ABMT's distinction between \n     strategic and non-strategic missile defense is ``outdated''; \n     nuclear deterrence (mutual assured destruction) is ``not a \n     suitable basis for stability''; TMD and NMD enhance strategic \n     stability by reducing incentives for first-strikes; export \n     control and arms control regimes are not alternatives to TMD \n     and NMD; and the ABMT prevents the US from establishing a \n     limited missile defense.\n       In response to such findings, the SASC favors the following \n     US policies: to ``deploy as soon as possible'' TMDs; ``deploy \n     a multiple-site national missile defense system''; ``deploy \n     as soon as practical'' effective defenses against ``advanced \n     cruise missiles''; invest in R for follow-on BMD options; \n     employ ``streamlined acquisition procedures'' to speed BMD \n     deployments; and ``seek a cooperative transition'' away from \n     the doctrine of mutual assured destruction.\n\n                          System Architecture\n\n       With respect to TMD, the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) \n     shall establish a ``top priority core theater missile defense \n     program'' consisting of (by year of deployment) PAC-3 (1998), \n     Navy Lower Tier (1999), THAAD (2002), and Navy Upper Tier \n     (2001). These systems are to be interoperable and are to \n     exploit air and space-based sensors and battle management \n     support systems. The Corps SAM and BPI systems will be \n     terminated. The SecDef shall develop a plan for deploying \n     follow-on systems. The SecDef shall submit a report in 60 \n     days specifying a plan to implement these provisions.\n       With respect to NMD, the SecDef shall develop a NMD system \n     for deployment by 2003 consisting of: ground-based \n     interceptors in such locations and numbers as are necessary \n     to provide a defense of Alaska, Hawaii, and CONUS against \n     ``limited ballistic missile attacks; fixed ground-based \n     radars and space-based sensors; and battle management/\n     command, control, and intelligence (BM/C3).'' SecDef shall \n     develop an ``interim'' capability by 1999 as a ``hedge \n     against the emergence of near-term ballistic missile \n     threats.'' SecDef shall use ``streamlined acquisition \n     procedures'' to expedite NMD deployment, while saving costs. \n     SecDef shall submit a report in 60 days on the implementation \n     of this law and analyzing options to improve the system, \n     including: additional ground-based interceptors or sites; \n     sea-based missile defense systems; and space-based kinetic \n     energy and directed energy systems.\n       With respect to cruise missiles (CMs), SecDef shall \n     undertake ``an initiative'' to ensure effective defenses \n     against CMs. He shall submit a plan in 60 days.\n\n                         The ABM treaty (ABMT)\n\n       The bill offers a sense of the Congress that the Senate \n     should undertake a review of the ``value and validity'' of \n     the ABMT and should consider establishing a ``select \n     committee'' to review the ABMT and that the President should \n     cease negotiating any understandings on the ABMT until this \n     review is completed. The sense of the Congress also includes \n     a requirement for SecDef to submit a declassified negotiating \n     history of the ABMT. The bill provides a unilateral \n     demarcation line to designate permissible BMD systems: if a \n     system or component has not been ``flight tested in an ABM-\n     qualifying flight test'' (defined in the bill as a flight \n     test against a missile target that is flying over a range of \n     3,500 km or at a speed of greater than 5 km/second), it is \n     not covered by the ABMT. The Senate finds, however, that \n     these parameters are ``outdated'' and hence should be \n     ``subject to change'' after the Senate review of the ABMT. \n     The bill prohibits the expenditure of funds to implement \n\n[[Page S 12663]]\n     any lower standard. SecDef is to certify annually that no US BMD system \n     is being constrained more than as provided in this bill.\n\n                           Budget categories\n\n       For budgetary purposes, the bill identifies the following \n     as of the national BMD program: PAC-3, Navy Lower Tier, \n     THAAD, Navy Upper Tier, Other TMD, NMD, and Follow-On and \n     Support technologies.\n\n                         Repeal of 10 BMD Laws\n\n       The SASC bill repeals the following, including several \n     significant provisions:\n  1. In the MDA91: Congress endorsed US efforts to work with Russia on \nstrengthening nuclear command and control, reduce strategic weapons, \nand strengthen nonproliferation efforts. Congress also: defined the US \nBMD system as directed against ``limited'' ballistic missile threats \ndeclared that this system shall be ``ABM Treaty-compliant'' and limited \nto ``100 ground-based interceptors''; urged the President to pursue \n``discussions'' with the Soviet Union to clarify what is permissible \nwith respect to space-based missile defenses and to permit other \nchanges in the ABMT (including adding sites, using space-based sensors, \netc); required the SecDef to include ``burden sharing'' in a BMD \nreport; clarified that the ``limited'' BMD defense capability shall \nonly cover threats ``below a threshold that would bring into question \nstrategic stability''; and provided $4.1 billion for SDI projects, \nincluding $465 million for ``space-based interceptors'' (including \nBrilliant Pebbles).\n       2. In sec. 237 of the NDAA94: the SecDef was prohibited \n     from approving any TMD project unless it passed ``two \n     realistic live-fire tests.''\n       3. In sec. 242 of the NDAA94: Congress sought to increase \n     burden-sharing of BMD development costs; the SecDef was to \n     prepare a plan of cooperation with allies (specifically cited \n     were NATO, Japan, Israel, and South Korea) to avoid \n     duplication and reduce costs; the section contains a sense of \n     the Congress that whenever the US deploys a TMD system to \n     defend a country that has not provided financial support for \n     that system, the US should consider ``whether it is \n     appropriate to seek reimbursement'' to cover some of the cost \n     of that deployment; the section also\n      established a special ``Theater Missile Defense Cooperation \n     Account'' (subject to audit by GAO) to receive foreign \n     funds to support TMD development.\n  4. In sec. 222 of the DDAA86: Congress prohibited the deployment of \nany ``strategic defense system'' unless the President first certifies \nthat the system is both ``survivable'' and ``cost effective'' (i.e., \nthat it ``* * * is able to maintain its effectiveness against the \noffense at less cost than it would take to develop offensive \ncountermeasures and proliferate the ballistic missiles necessary to \novercome it'').\n  5. In sec. 225 of the DDAA86: Congress found that the President's \nCommission on Strategic Forces had declared in its report to the \nPresident dated 3/21/84 that ``One of the most successful arms control \nagreements is the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972''; noted that \nthe Secretary of State has stated that ``* * * the President has \nexplicitly recognized that any ABM-related deployments * * * would be a \nmatter for consultations and negotiation between the Parties''; and \nissued a sense of Congress that it ``fully supports the declared policy \nof the President * * * to reverse the erosion of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty of 1972,'' that Congress's support for SDI ``does not \nexpress or imply an intention on the part of Congress that the United \nStates should abrogate, violate, or otherwise erode such treaty,'' that \nsuch funding ``does not express or imply any determination or \ncommitment on the part of the Congress that the United States develop, \ntest, or deploy ballistic missile strategic defense weaponry that would \ncontravene such treaty,'' and that funds ``should not be used in a \nmanner inconsistent with any of the treaties commonly known as the \nLimited Test Ban Treaty, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, the Outer Space \nTreaty, or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.''\n  6. In Sec. 226 of the NDAA88/89: The SecDef was prohibited from \ndeploying ``any anti-ballistic missile system unless such deployment is \nspecifically authorized by law after the date of enactment of this \nAct.''\n  7. In Sec. 8123 of the DDApA89: This was a sense of the Congress on \nSDI. It said SDI ``should be a long-term and robust research program'' \nto provide the U.S. with ``expanded options'' to respond to a ``Soviet \nbreakout'' from the ABMT and to respond to other future Soviet arms \ninitiatives; such options ``can enhance'' U.S. ``leverage'' in arms \nreductions negotiations; funding levels ``must be established using \nrealistic projections of available resources''; and the ``primary \nemphasis'' on SDI should be ``to explore promising new technologies, \nsuch as directed energy technologies, which might have long-term \npotential to defend against a responsive Soviet offensive nuclear \nthreat.''\n  8. In Sec. 8133 of the DDApA92: Congress here reached several \nfindings about the implications for our NATO allies of modifying the \nABMT, including--that all of our NATO allies ``have in the past been \nsupportive of the objects and purposes of the ABM Treaty''; that \n``changes in the ABMT would have profound political and security \nimplications'' for these allies and friends of the U.S.; and that \nbefore seeking to negotiate any changes in the treaty, the U.S. should \nconsult with U.S. allies and ``seek a consensus on negotiating \nobjectives.''\n  9. In Sec. 234 of the NDAA94: Congress reached several findings, \nincluding that: the MDA91 ``establishes a goal for the United States to \ncomply with the ABM Treaty''; DoD is ``continuing to obligate hundreds \nof millions of dollars'' on development and testing of systems before a \ndetermination has been made that such items would be in compliance with \nthe ABMT; and the ABMT ``was not intended to'' limit systems designed \nto counter modern TBMs ``regardless of the capabilities of such \nmissiles'' unless such TBMs ``are tested against or have demonstrated \ncapabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles.'' The \nSecDef was required to conduct a review of several listed BMD systems \nto determine if such systems (including Brilliant Eyes) ``would be in \ncompliance with the ABM Treaty.'' The SecDef shall immediately notify \nCongress if there is any compliance problem in pursuing advanced TMDs \nand describe the problem. The bill attached funding limitations pending \nsubmission of the report.\n  10. In Sec. 235 of the NDAA95: This section listed 13 program \nelements for the BMDO, for budgetary purposes.\n\n                     Analysis of the SASC Language\n\n  The SASC language establishes a policy of deploying a multiple-site \nnational ABM system--this cannot be implemented without either amending \nor abrogating the ABMT. Amending the treaty would permit the Russians \nto deploy their own multiple-site system, including enhanced BMD \nfeatures ostensibly intended only for TMD systems but which would have \nsome significant capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles. The \nmeasure thus focuses only on what may be potentially gained from \nexpanded BMD efforts, and ignores what may be potentially lost--\nincluding the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, the ABMT \nitself, the START process, and the NPT, as the strategic arms reduction \nprocess comes to a halt amid new missile defense developments.\n  The committee text also places into law a unilateral U.S. definition \nof systems that can be developed within the ABMT--under that treaty, \nsuch changes are supposed to be arranged by through an amendment \nprocess based on mutual agreement of the Parties. A unilateral U.S. \ndefinition would serve as a dangerous precedent inspiring Russia to \ninsert its own ``most-favorite-notions'' of BMD into its own statute \nbooks. Moreover, the 5 km-second/3500 km range demarcation line is well \nabove the parameters of most TBM systems today (which fly at about 2 \nkm/sec), yet dangerously close to the slowest SBM systems (which fly at \nbetween 6-7 km/sec). Thus the Committee language serves to: blur the \ndistinction between strategic and theater systems; raise the risk of \ntechnological surprise and treaty ``break out'' activities; complicate \ntreaty verification (given the greater growing ambiguity over which \nsystems are strategic and which are theater); and jeopardize the \nstrategic arms reduction process.\n  The Committee language also repeals several laws that specifically \nrequired U.S. adherence to the ABMT and that required burden-sharing in \nthe form of increased financial contributions from our allies for BMD \nsystems.\n  The premise of all the SASC proposals are the findings that the U.S. \nis now facing a serious missile threat and\n \n[[Page S 12664]]\n\nthat this threat is growing. Both of these premises are open to \nquestion.\n  There are at least six rebuttals to the proposition that the U.S. is \nnow facing a ``serious and growing threat'' that requires either the \namendment or abrogation of the ABMT to counter--\n  (1) A Growing Threat? In April 1987, President Reagan announced the \nestablishment of the Missile Technology Control Regime to regulate \ninternational commerce in goods relating to missiles that are capable \nof delivering a 500 kg warhead a distance of 300 km. Since that time, \nCongress has heard Administration spokesmen repeatedly testify about \nthe 15-20 countries that either now have such missiles or are \ndeveloping them (or may have the capability to develop them). Yet the \nnumber of countries alleged to be developing such missiles has \nremained, to a considerable extent, constant since the MTCR was \nestablished.\n  Arguably, the worst missile threats facing the U.S. are those that \ninvolve the delivery of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs, including \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons) against U.S. territory, U.S. \nforces, or U.S. allies. The most potentially destructive threat comes, \nand will continue to come for the foreseeable future, from Russia's \nnuclear-tipped ICBMs--a situation that will likely persist for quite a \nwhile. Ironically, nothing would be more effective in encouraging \nRussia both to halt its nuclear disarmament activities and to expand \nits missile fleet than if the United States decides to deploy--or even \nprepare to deploy--a multiple-site national missile defense system in \ncontravention of the ABMT. The ABMT has succeeded in permitting the \nsuperpowers to reduce their nuclear arsenals because the treaty gives \neach country high confidence in the credibility of its nuclear \ndeterrent. Eliminating or watering down that treaty is thus the wrong \nway to go about alleviating the worst nuclear and missile threats now \nfacing the United States.\n  The worst missile threat to the U.S. is, in short, the old missile \nthreat, not a new one. The U.S. has a big stake in the success of the \nSTART/ABM process: its success will mean that America's worst missile \nthreat will be a declining threat.\n       Is the global WMD proliferation threat--serious though it \n     is--growing? If not,\n      then the global missile threat may not be as grave as is \n     commonly believed.\n  Support for international nonproliferation regimes provides one \nindicator of the WMD proliferation threat. As of August 1995, the NPT \nhas 178 parties; over 159 countries have signed the CWC and 135 \ncountries have ratified the BWC. Though some parties may well be in \nviolation of those treaties, it is difficult to deny that these three \ntreaties enjoy widespread, almost universal international support, and \nthat this support is growing. The rush is on to get rid of chemical and \nbiological weapons, not to acquire them. The stockpiles of the nuclear \nweapon states are going on a downward, not an upward, trend. If the \nCTBT is successfully concluded in 1996, there will be no more nuclear \nexplosions anywhere for any purpose. Progress is being made on a cutoff \nof the production of fissile nuclear material for weapons or outside of \nsafeguards. To point to the illicit weapons activities of a few states \nis not to suggest the existence of a new international proliferation \nnorm.\n  Moreover, the interest that Iran, North Korea, India, Pakistan, and \nIsrael have shown in developing long-range missile capabilities needs \nto be interpreted in light of other international trends. Over the last \nthree decades, the following surface-to-surface missiles have either \nbeen cancelled or are going nowhere: South Korea's NHK-1; Taiwan's Chin \nFeng (``Green Bee''); Argentina's Condor II; Egypt's al-Zafir, al-\nKahir, Ar-Ra'id, and Vector; Saudi Arabia's CSS-2; Iraq's Al-Hussein; \nIraq's Al-Abbas; Iraq's Badr-2000; Brazil's SS-300; the Israel/Iran \n``Flower'' project; the Libyan Otrag rocket program; all of the United \nStates and ex-Soviet INF missiles; the disarmed and to-be-dismantled \nICBM's in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine; the South African missile \nand space launch vehicle program; the China/North Korean DF-61; and \nseveral others. It is wrong, therefore, to declare without \nqualification that the missile threat against the United States is only \ngrowing--in some respects it continues to jeopardize U.S. interests, \nbut in other respects the threat is arguably declining.\n       (2) Clear and Present Dangers. The worst dangers come from \n     the further proliferation and use of WMDs by additional \n     countries or subnational groups. As for systems of delivering \n     such weapons, Congress's preoccupation with missiles--\n     typically ballistic missiles--is baffling. The massive \n     investments called for in the legislation for TMD and NMD \n     will surely not address the worst (albeit unlikely) military \n     threat now posed to the United States involving the delivery \n     of WMD--that is, an all-out Russian strategic nuclear attack \n     on the United States. It will do little to address attacks \n     coming by means of cruise missiles and various remote piloted \n     vehicles. And it will do nothing to prevent or deter a \n     country of subnational group from deploying a weapon of mass \n     destruction in the U.S., against U.S. citizens or troops, or \n     against U.S. allies by means of any of several non-missile \n     delivery systems that would be available for such a mission, \n     at a fraction of the cost.\n  Among the most attractive delivery systems--in terms of ready \navailability, cost, reliability, and potential effectiveness--are \nadvanced strike aircraft. These are delivery systems that are not \nregulated by any treaty or regime. As for national policy, the United \nStates continues to export nuclear-capable strike aircraft or parts for \nsuch aircraft without even verification measures or host-country \ncommitments to guarantee non-nuclear uses. Pakistan, for example, a \ncountry now under U.S. nuclear sanctions, continues to make commercial \nU.S. purchases of spare parts for its F-16 nuclear weapon delivery \nvehicles. France, meanwhile, is seeking buyers for its Mirage 2000 \nwherever they can be found. The F-16C aircraft has a maximum weapons \nload of 5,400 kg and a combat radius of 930 km; the Mirage 2000 has a \nmaximum weapons load of 6,300 kg and a combat radius of 700 km. By \ncomparison, the North Korean Nodong--now under development--will have a \nreported 1000 kg payload and a 1000 km range.\n  In November 1991, Stanford University's Center for International \nSecurity and Arms Control issued a report entitled, ``Assessing \nBallistic Missile Proliferation and Its Control,'' authored by a panel \nof participating experts that included three senior officials now in \nthe Clinton Administration, including the current Secretary of Defense, \nWilliam Perry. The report found that: ``Advanced-strike aircraft are \ngenerally as capable as missiles, and in many cases more capable, for \ndelivering ordnance, so it is logical to devote, at minimum, comparable \nefforts to their control.'' Yet US efforts, epitomized by the SASC bill \nand past BMD legislation, continue both to neglect this clear and \npresent threat. These efforts instead focus shortsightedly on (a) the \nballistic missile threat, (b) developing technological defenses against \nsuch missiles, while (c) neglecting the potentially negative military \nconsequences of developing such defences, and (d) ignoring other means \nof addressing the missile proliferation threat (i.e., prevention, \npreemption, and deterrence).\n  (3) Future Threats. Both the CIA and the DIA directors have recently \ntestified that the U.S. will not face a new missile proliferation \nthreat for at least a decade. As stated earlier, even North Korea's \nTaepodong will at best be able to reach remote U.S. island territories \nsometime in the 21st Century, assuming that country remains in \nexistence and its missile development program is successful.\n  Also, if the ballistic missile threat to Israel, Japan, and South \nKorea were so immediate and direct, the gravity of this threat is still \nnot reflected in national funds invested by these countries in missile \ndefense ventures. Though these countries have expressed interest in TMD \nsystems, the United States is still paying most of the bills.\n  Missiles are not the only means by which a country could attack the \nUnited States. A variety of aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAVs) could serve as potential delivery vehicles for WMDs, including \nnuclear weapons. For example, the Tier 2+ experimental reconnaissance \nUAV now under development in the United States, was described in the \nJuly 10, 1995 issue of\n \n[[Page S 12665]]\n\nAviation Week as having the following performance characteristics: a \n14,000-mile range, a 2,000-pound payload, an ability to stay in flight \nfor more than 42 hours, and a maximum altitude of 65,000 feet. The \nUnited States, and U.S. forces abroad, may well be facing a graver \nthreat from such aircraft in the next decade than they will face from \nballistic missiles. Smuggled or covertly deployed WMDs also remain a \nserious threat, as do WMDs deployed by means of land vehicles or a wide \nvariety of ships.\n       Proponents of the new legislation raise the specter of \n     North Korean missile attacks against the United States. Yet \n     North Korea is still many, many years away from having a \n     missile that could reach the continental United States, or \n     even Alaska or Hawaii--assuming it would want to launch such \n     a missile even if it had such a capability. Nevertheless, the \n     SASC's missile defense proposal would lead the United States \n     out of the ABMT (and thereby scuttle the START process), a \n     multi-billion-dollar proposal intended largely to cope with \n     the Taepodong's hypothetical worst-case capabilities in the \n     21st Century. An alternative to this approach would be to \n     concentrate more on discouraging North Korea from building \n     such missiles in the first place.\n  Furthermore, certain trends in advanced conventional weaponry may \nrival or surpass the threat to U.S. forces in the years ahead that will \ncome from ground-to-ground missiles--especially with respect to \nincreasing accuracy and stealthiness of advanced conventional weapons.\n  (4) Missiles Have Not Historically Been Decisive. From Hitler's V-2 \nrocket bombardment of London, through the Iraq/Iran war of the cities, \nto the recent war in Kuwait, missiles have not proven to be a decisive \nweapon, either as an offensive weapon or as a weapon of deterrence. \nIsrael's significant technological edge in nuclear and missile \ntechnology did not prevent it from being repeatedly attacked by \nmodified Iraqi Scuds; nor did the Patriot antimissile batteries deter \nIraq from launching repeated missile strikes on both Israel and Saudi \nArabia. It is also not at all clear that the widespread deployment of \nTMD systems in East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East would \nnecessarily alleviate the nuclear weapons proliferation threat in those \nregions--it could even aggravate that threat by stimulating the search \nfor new weapons designs and delivery systems.\n  (5) BMD Proliferation. The ABMT is not just an arms control treaty. \nIt is also a nonproliferation treaty, in two respects. First, Article \nIX prohibits Russia and the United States from exporting strategic \nmissile defense systems or components covered by the treaty. If the ABM \ntreaty collapsed, there would be no legal obstacle to Russia exporting \nhighly-capable missile defense technology to hot spots around the \nglobe, such as East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. The export \nof such systems could well foster or aggravate regional WMD and missile \nraces. Some of Russia's BMD interceptors are reportedly nuclear \ncapable. Others have characteristics (range, thrust, navigation \nsystems, materials and coatings) very much like offensive ballistic \nmissiles. The simulated offensive ballistic missile used as a\n target in testing the Israeli Arrow TMD interceptor, for example, is \n     another Arrow. Second, if horizontal (or geographical) BMD \n     proliferation becomes popular thanks to the collapse of \n     the ABMT, this will also stimulate more vertical \n     proliferation of both existing strategic nuclear weapons \n     and their delivery systems.\n       (6) Alternatives to Missile Defense. To the extent that the \n     U.S. and its allies face missile proliferation threats, there \n     are more--and more effective--ways to approach this threat \n     than in searching for technological shields. The massive \n     funds that have been spent on missile defense have drained \n     valuable resources away from needed investments in \n     nonproliferation regimes, sanctions, export controls, \n     intelligence collection and sharing, active and preventive \n     diplomacy, conventional war-fighting capability, and other \n     such classic nonproliferation tools. Arguably, the U.S. \n     Marines remain today America's best ``ground mobile TMD \n     system,'' if one factors in cost, effectiveness, and treaty \n     considerations. Given past underinvestment in sharpening the \n     classic tools of nonproliferation, one should not be \n     surprised to see chronic nuclear and missile proliferation \n     threats.\n\n\n               2. the nunn/levin/cohen/warner substitute\n\n       In summary, while the substitute dulls the teeth of the \n     SASC's missile defense language, it surely does not \n     ``defang'' that language. The text still sets the U.S. on a \n     course out of the ABMT: it requires the ``development for \n     deployment'' of a multiple-site missile defense system \n     covering all U.S. territory; it accepts all the SASC findings \n     about the gravity of the missile threat; it questions the \n     value of nuclear deterrence; it establishes a provocative new \n     national policy to ``consider . . . the option of \n     withdrawing'' from the ABMT if Russia refuses to accept \n     unilateral U.S. proposed treaty amendments; it seeks the \n     accelerated development and ``streamlined'' acquisition of \n     systems that are not ABMT-compliant; it endorses the \n     ``demonstrated capabilities'' definition of an ABMT-compliant \n     system; and it endorses a unilateral U.S. definition of the \n     velocity and distance criteria for distinguishing strategic \n     from non-strategic missiles.\n       The BMD provisions are broken down into the following \n     sections: findings (232); policy (233); TMD architecture \n     (234); NMD architecture (235); cruise missile defense \n     initiative (236); policy toward ABM treaty (237); spending \n     prohibition (238); BMD program elements (239); definition of \n     ABM treaty (240); and repeal of 10 laws (241). A copy of \n     these provisions appeared in the Congressional Record on \n     August 11.\n       The substitute includes the following notable findings: (a) \n     the existence of a ``significant and growing'' missile threat \n     to the U.S. (later called an ``increasingly serious \n     threat''); (b) TMD can reduce incentives for proliferation; \n     (c) NMD can ``strengthen strategic stability and \n     deterrence''; (d) the doctrine of nuclear deterrence \n     (``MAD'') is ``questionable''.\n       The bill would establish the following national policies \n     to: (a) deploy ``as soon as possible'' TMDs against TBMs; \n     (b)``develop for deployment'' a multiple-site NMD system (and \n     to ``consider'' withdrawing from the ABM treaty if Russia \n     refuses to agree to necessary treaty amendments); (c) develop \n     BMD ``follow-on'' options; (d) streamline the BMD acquisition \n     process; and (e) seek a ``cooperative transition'' away from \n     MAD.\n       The SecDef is to report to Congress (before submitting the \n     FY 1997 defense budget) on the costs of RDT/deployment of \n     each BMD system (both TMD and NMD).\n       The bill includes Navy Upper Tier system and THAAD within \n     TMD core program--both of which have been criticized as \n     having potential strategic ABM capabilities.\n       Requires the SecDef to develop a NMD system by 2003 that \n     shall ``be capable of being deployed at multiple sites,'' \n     include space-based sensors, include a limited NMD ``hedge'' \n     capability by the year 2000 involving ``one or more'' sites. \n     SecDef shall conduct an analysis of options to improve NMD \n     effectiveness, including sea-based and space-based weapons, \n     and additional ground-based interceptors.\n       The SecDef shall prepare a plan to upgrade U.S. cruise \n     missile defenses.\n       The Senate should undertake a review of the ``value and \n     validity'' of the ABM treaty.\n       The President cannot implement over the next fiscal year a \n     more restrictive definition of an ABM-permissible system than \n     that established in the bill--the bill establishes a \n     demarcation line at targets traveling at 3,500 km range, 5 \n     km/second velocity, and the ban only covers deployment of \n     systems that are ``flight tested'' against targets fitting \n     this definition.\n       The bill repeals 10 TMD/NMD-related laws (following the \n     SASC bill).\n\n                  Analysis of the substitute proposal\n\n       The table in Annex 1 compares this proposal with key \n     provisions of the ABMT. The most troublesome language \n     pertains to the requirement to develop for deployment a \n     multiple-site BMD system along with specific new systems \n     (e.g., space-based and sea-based) that are not now permitted \n     by the ABMT.\n       There is a real danger that this language will be perceived \n     by the Russian parliament and by Russian military and \n     political leaders as a U.S. intention to abandon the treaty. \n     If this occurs, then the consequences for both arms control \n     and nonproliferation will be grave. We can expect the \n     following:\n       The Start II treaty will be in jeopardy; Russia may even \n     consider withdrawing from Start I.\n       The other nuclear weapon states (France, China, and \n     Britain) will be reluctant to join in the process of nuclear \n     arms reductions if Russia and the U.S. are no longer \n     constrained by the ABMT.\n       Russia's reactions to the U.S. deployment of a national \n     multiple-site missile defense system could well include a \n     reversal or even an expansion of its offensive nuclear \n     arsenal and deployment of its own national multiple-site \n     defense against U.S. missiles--all of which would lead the \n     U.S. to consider following suit.\n       There is adequate reason to believe that the Russians will \n     indeed interpret the U.S. policy to develop a national \n     multiple-site BMD system for deployment as an intention to \n     violate the ABMT, an action that could jeopardize the Start \n     process. Russian perceptions of the U.S. legislation will \n     have a profound impact upon the future of several strategic \n     arms control initiatives, as indicated in the following \n     statements:\n       On August 17, Mikhail Demurin, a spokesman for the Russian \n     Foreign Ministry, told a wire service reporter that Russia \n     believes the legislation pending in the U.S. Senate on \n     missile defense would lead to the ``actual liquidation'' of \n     the ABMT.\n\n[[Page S 12666]]\n\n       On August 4, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake wrote \n     to the Senate Majority Leader that the NMD language in S. \n     1026 ``would effectively abrogate the ABM Treaty. . . . The \n     effect of such actions would in all likelihood be to prompt \n     Russia to terminate implementation of the START I Treaty and \n     shelve ratification of START II.''\n       On July 28, Defense Secretary Perry wrote a letter to Sen. \n     Nunn in which he said that the SASC's BMD language would \n     ``put us on a pathway to abrogate the ABM Treaty . . . \n     jeopardize Russian implementation of the START I and START II \n     Treaties . . . [and] threaten to undermine fundamental \n     national security interests of the United States.'' By \n     continuing to call for the development with the intention of \n     deploying a multiple site BMD system, the compromise language \n     keeps the U.S. on the ``pathway'' to abrogation.\n       On June 28, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. \n     Shalikashvili, wrote to Sen. Levin that ``Because the \n     Russians have repeatedly linked the ABM Treaty with other \n     arms control issues--particularly ratification of START II \n     now before the Duma--we cannot assume they would deal in \n     isolation with unilateral U.S. legislation\n      detailing technical parameters for ABM Treaty \n     interpretation. While we believe that START II is in both \n     countries' interests regardless of other events, we assume \n     such unilateral US legislation could harm prospects for \n     START II ratification by the Duma and probably impact our \n     broader security relationship with Russia as well.''\n       On June 20, Russian President Yeltsin submits the START II \n     treaty to the Russian Duma with a cover letter stating that \n     ``It goes without saying that the Treaty can be fulfilled \n     only providing the United States preserve and strictly \n     fulfill [the] bilateral ABM Treaty of 1972.''\n       On April 27, Russian foreign ministry spokesman Nikita \n     Matkovskiy expressed alarm that the US has started testing \n     anti-missile defense systems that the US unilaterally claims \n     are non-strategic; Matkovskiy stated that ``In our opinion \n     the continuation of the policy of accomplished facts instead \n     of an intensive search for a mutually acceptable solution can \n     only complicate matters, if not drive them into a blind \n     alley.'' (Interfax)\n       On April 23, Russian arms control expert Anton Surikov \n     stated that US BMD plans ``are in fact yet another attempt to \n     push through the back door the old Reagan SDI idea. That's \n     why they pose a considerable threat to strategic stability in \n     the world and provoke China and other `minor nuclear \n     countries' to sharply build up their nuclear missile \n     forces.'' (Itar-Tass) On August 4, Surikov specifically \n     claimed that the US Senate's BMD language ``prompts our \n     country to refrain from ratifying the START-2 Treaty and \n     reconsider some provisions under the START-1 one.'' (Itar-\n     Tass)\n       On March 28, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev commented on \n     prospects for Russian ratification of the START-II treaty, \n     noting that ``It is also essential that no attempts be made \n     to evade the ABM Treaty, since both treaties are closely \n     connected with each other.'' (Itar-Tass)\n       On March 17, columnist Vladimir Belous wrote in Segodnya \n     that ``Some [US] senators even demand that the administration \n     stop the ABM negotiations, which can allegedly limit US \n     freedom of action. In fact the intention is to reanimate the \n     Reagan SDI program, although in a more modest form . . . It \n     must be admitted immediately that if the ABM Treaty is \n     effectively undermined, further implementation of the START I \n     Agreement will be in question.\n       On March 7, Aleksander Piskunov, the vice-chairman of the \n     Duma Committee for National Defense, stated after a meeting \n     with American congressmen that ``It is absolutely obvious \n     that the discussion of the possibility of implementing the \n     ABM system will be fraught with serious consequences and will \n     tell negatively on the upcoming ratification of an agreement \n     on the further reduction of strategic offensive weapons.'' \n     (Itar-Tass)\n       On February 10, retired Major-General Vladimir Belous, \n     writing at length in Segodnya about ABMT-related \n     developments, concluded that each Party ``will give its own \n     interpretation to the parameters for delimitation and will be \n     guided by them, which could lead to the de facto undermining \n     of the treaty as a document of international law. Too much is \n     at stake for there to be haste or inconsistency on this \n     issue. The profound connection between strategic offensive \n     and defensive weapons must be pointed out once more. This \n     signifies at this stage that the ratification of the START-2 \n     treaty by the Russian parliament is possible only when the \n     delimitation of strategic and `non-strategic' . . . has been \n     achieved and officially affirmed. And in no case before \n     that.''\n       On January 18, Aleksandr Sychev wrote an article in \n     Izvestiya warning that ``The White House plan to avail itself \n     of a new ABM defense system gives rise to the suspicion that \n     the United States is trying to bypass the ABM Treaty and \n     attain military-strategic superiority.''\n       On January 16, a senior Russian foreign ministry official \n     criticized a recent test of ``a tactical ABM system''; noting \n     that the test occurred ``at a time when both countries were \n     holding discussions . . . on distinctions between strategic \n     and tactical ABM systems,'' the official stated that \n     ``Washington's actions worsen the atmosphere at the \n     consultations and may have a negative effect on the entire \n     complex of security negotiations in general.'' (Interfax)\n       The danger that Russia will interpret the substitute as an \n     intention to abrogate the ABMT is further aggravated by the \n     repeal in both the Committee's bill and the substitute of \n     provisions of existing law that require the United States to \n     remain in compliance with the ABMT (e.g., repeal of the \n     Missile Defense Act of 1991).\n       The substitute includes in a Sense of the Senate certain \n     technical parameters to define the types of BMD systems that \n     are permissible under the ABMT: any system that has not been \n     tested against test targets flying at or above 5 km/second or \n     exceeding a 3,500 km range would be permissible. Though the \n     substitute is an improvement over the SASC bill's provision, \n     in that it is non-binding, it nevertheless places the \n     Congress in favor of adopting a BMD testing standard that has \n     not been agreed by the Parties to the ABMT. The substitute \n     also prevents the President from spending any funds in the \n     next fiscal year to implement any more restrictive standard. \n     Moreover, in establishing a US national policy that a BMD \n     system will be controlled only if it is actually flight \n     tested, the substitute departs from the ABMT's prohibition on \n     developing systems that have inherent capabilities to destroy \n     strategic ballistic missiles. The substitute language would, \n     therefore, put Russia on notice that the United States would \n     have no objection if Russia developed and even deployed \n     sophisticated strategic BMD systems as long as the systems \n     are not flight tested against the unilaterally-defined US \n     target criteria. Any subsequent Russian action to exercise \n     these options would serve to weaken the credibility of the US \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n           IMPACT OF THE SUBSTITUTE PROPOSAL ON THE ABM TREATY          \n [Although the text does not explicitly require the U.S. to abrogate the\n  ABMT, the substitute MDA95 would require the Executive to take steps  \nthat would--if implemented without amending the treaty--violate both the\n            letter and the spirit of that treaty.

Mr. President, I support the Nunn amendment identified as \n``The Missile Defense Act of 1995.'' Last week there was a curious, \ntrumped up suggestion in a local newspaper that, somewhere along the \nline, I had mysteriously changed my position regarding the ABM Treaty. \nI have not, and the reporter who wrote the story knew it. I have always \nquestioned the wisdom of the ABM Treaty, and I still do.\n  In fact, this past April I wrote to President Clinton stating my \nbelief that the current U.S. position on the ABM Treaty is rooted in \ncold war mentality. In 1972, Mr. President, neither United States nor \nSoviet negotiators had any way to envision the security environment of \n1995, characterized as it is by the rampant proliferation of ballistic \nand cruise missile technology.\n  Even former Secretary of State Kissinger--one of the principal \narchitects of the ABM Treaty--recently told me that he too feels that \nstrategic stability in the post-Cold war world has moved beyond the \ncurrent scope of the ABM Treaty. I use the word ``current'' because the \nABM Treaty itself contains provisions for modification or legal \nabrogation.\n  Mr. President, the national security interests of the United States \nshould be our number one priority, and for that reason I have directed \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, in consultation with the Committee \non Armed Services and other appropriate committees, to undertake a \ncomprehensive review of the continuing value of the ABM Treaty for the \npurpose of providing additional policy guidance during the second \nsession of the 104th Congress.\n  In this regard, I reiterate my opposition to the creation of yet \nanother special Select Committee replete with bureaucratic trappings, \nstaff, and cost to the American taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing \nthis treaty. We already have standing committees with the \nresponsibility for making these determinations and recommendations, and \nwe are going to do our job.\n  In conclusion, I support the Nunn amendment for its foresight in \ndeveloping a missile defense system to protect all Americans. Still, I \nconfess having reservations about the amendment because I am convinced \nthat it may compromise some of the decisive language and vision \ncontained in the original bill.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate my support for passage of the Defense \nAuthorization Bill of 1995.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I intend to make a statement concluding the \nfinal passage of the authorization bill outlining some of the \nchallenges I think we have in conference. I do think there have been a \nnumber of improvements made in the bill in the Chamber, most notably \nthe Missile Defense Act, which I anticipate will be approved in a few \nminutes on a rollcall vote.\n  There are a number of other challenges we have in conference if this \nbill is going to become law, and I will speak to that at passage of the \nauthorization bill because I think it is enormously important that we \nwork together in a cooperative way with the administration to make \nevery effort to see that this bill will be one the President will be \nwilling to sign.\n  There are a number of items that are in the bill now which will not \nmeet that definition according to what I have been reliably informed.\n  So I will be working with my colleagues to both identify the \nadministration objections and to see if those can be worked on as we go \nforward.\n  I also think the committee chairman and all those who worked in good \nfaith in the Chamber have a real stake in trying to make sure we get a \nbill that can become law this year, and I know we will work together in \nthat regard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, I \nknow there are Senators on this side of the aisle, particularly \nSenators Kyl and Smith, who likewise feel very strongly about this \namendment about to be voted on, so I am sure their voices will be heard \nas this matter proceeds to resolution in conference.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I was referring both to \nthat matter and to other matters also. My comments were in general \nbecause there are a number of areas where the administration and the \nSecretary of Defense have noted they want to work to see that changes \nare made. So I was not speaking just on the Missile Defense Act but \nthat was included in my remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wanted to make sure I protected the \ninterests of my colleagues who did work on this particular amendment \nabout to be voted on.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has the time arrived now for \nthe vote?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2425\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 9:30 has \narrived and the question now is on the Nunn amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \ndesires about 2 minutes. I suggest he be given 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  During the course of this recess, I averaged about seven events a day \nthroughout the State of Oklahoma, and during that time I did not let an \nopportunity go by without letting the people of Oklahoma know how \nserious the threat of missile attack will be to the United States \nwithin just a very few years, probably as early as the year 2000.\n  I also let them know that we do not have a national missile defense \nsystem, and probably the most significant thing we will do is to keep \nthis system going so that when we have a friendlier \n\n[[Page S 12668]]\nenvironment in the White House we can have this system ready to be \ndeployed by the year 2000 or 2001.\n  We know the threat that exists from North Korea right now. We know \nthe threats that were articulated by Jim Woolsey, the chief security \nadviser to the President, when he said that we know of between 20 and \n25 nations that are working on weapons of mass destruction and the \nmissile means of delivering those weapons.\n  I know the negotiators worked very hard, and I commend the work \nproduct. However, I am a little disappointed it did not come out \nstronger. I intend to support the missile defense portion of this bill, \nbut I think when we used the words that we want to deploy a national \nmissile defense system and they changed it to ``develop for \ndeployment,'' that is too weak. I think that when we are calling for \nhighly effective missile defenses that we now have changed to \n``affordable,'' I suggest to you, Mr. President, there is nothing that \nis more significant going on right now than preparing for a national \nmissile defense system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Nunn amendment No. 2425. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] is \nabsent because of attending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 85, nays 13, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 398 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--85\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--13\n\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Pell\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Akaka\n     Murkowski\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 2425) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am going to vote against this bill as \nI did in the Armed Services Committee. We have had a good debate on the \nSenate floor on the bill and I went into this debate hopeful that we \nwould fix many of the problems I saw in the bill as reported.\n  We have fixed some of those problems. For example, the Department of \nEnergy provisions have been almost completely rewritten and all the \nprovisions I objected to during committee deliberations have been \ncorrected, with the exception of the hydronuclear testing provision \nwhich Senators Exon and Hatfield sought to eliminate.\n  Elsewhere, unfortunately, the improvements have been modest. The \nMissile Defense Act of 1995 has not been changed enough for me to be \nable to support it. I commend Senator Nunn and Senator Levin for their \nefforts to defuse the worst features of the reported bill's missile \ndefense provisions. I voted for their language as a substitute for the \nreported bill. But I believe that these provisions will still \ncontribute to the unraveling of critical arms control agreements that \nwould enhance our security far more than accelerating the development \nand deployment of a limited national missile defense system.\n  Our current policy on missile defense, the Missile Defense Act of \n1991 as amended, makes it a goal of the United States to comply with \nthe ABM Treaty while developing, and maintaining the option to deploy, \na limited national missile defense. That is as far as we should go. We \nsimply do not need to be making a several-hundred-million-dollar \ndownpayment this year for a multitens of billion dollar national \nmissile defense system.\n  The bill has many other provisions which I oppose. Section 1082 \nprohibits retirement of strategic weapons delivery systems that the \nnuclear posture review says we don't need. We cannot afford to keep \nevery nuclear weapon delivery system, even those the Pentagon says we \ndon't need, as bargaining chips for future arms control negotiations. \nWe should not be sending the signal that we expect the START II and \nSTART I treaties to unravel and therefore intend to maintain the \nmaximum nuclear capability possible within the START\n counting rules. If we end up with the nuclear posture review force \nstructure, we will be quite adequately defended and will hardly have to \nsue for surrender if the cold war is revived.\n\n  Mr. President, I fundamentally disagree with the need to add $7.1 \nbillion to the President's defense request. The weapons research and \nproduction funded with that money are only going to make our out-year \ndefense budget problems worse. The committee has admitted that it has \ndesigned a defense bill that will require many billions of dollars in \nadditional defense spending in future years beyond the budget \nresolution levels. Since I didn't support the first $33 billion added \nby the budget resolution, I can't support a bill that assumes even more \nspending in future years. I regret that the Kohl-Grassley effort to \nenforce budget discipline failed.\n  I regret that my efforts to cut spending for unneeded antiarmor \nmunitions and for an amphibious assault ship we don't need to buy \nbefore 2001, if then, were defeated in votes on the companion Defense \nappropriations bill. These are the tip of the iceberg of unneeded \nMember-interest spending in this bill and the companion appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is better than the House bill in most \nrespects. The House bill has terrible provisions on discharging members \nwho are HIV positive and on denying female service members and female \ndependents of service members the right to get an abortion in overseas \nmilitary medical facilities with their own money. The House bill funds \nadditional B-2 bombers with their multitens of billions of dollars out-\nyear funding requirement. The House bill has a fundamentally misguided \nprovision that attempts to lock in the Bottom-Up Review force structure \nof 1.445 million active duty service members in permanent law. The \nHouse bill's combination of force structure and weapons systems \nprovisions would require rapid real growth in defense spending in \nfuture years, even more rapid than the Senate bill's. This is simply \nnot in the cards.\n  Mr. President, we go to conference with two bad bills, each deserving \na veto in my view. It's possible that we will strip the worst of both \nbills in conference and end up with a product acceptable to the \nPresident. But far more likely is a result that the President would \nhave to veto.\n  This is the first time in my 13 years in the Senate that I have voted \nagainst a Defense authorization bill. I do not do it lightly. I regret \nthat I feel compelled to do this.\n  I urge my colleagues who believe this bill spends too much money on \nunneeded and wasteful defense projects or who oppose its cold war \nrevival provisions to join me in voting against this bill.\n                                stratcom\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to bring to my colleagues' \nattention an important initiative by USSTRATCOM to provide the regional \nCINC's with mission-planning analysis for counterproliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. STRATCOM'S mission-planning analysis is of \nproven \n\n[[Page S 12669]]\nvalue to regional commanders charged with responding to proliferation \nthreats.\n  In situations that could require putting American forces in harm's \nway, it is vital that all factors--the risks, benefits, and \nconsequences of contingency plans--are thoroughly understood in \nadvance. Once a crisis breaks out, it is too late to undertake the \nstudies required to assess the potential threats.\n  STRATCOM's unique planning analysis method gives commanders advance \nwarning of danger by helping to identify and characterize current and \nemerging proliferation threats in the region. In cases when \nproliferation activities challenge U.S. interests and military \noperations, this unmatched mission-planning analysis capability allows \ndefense planners to identify a variety of potential military targets; \nassess the effectiveness, consequences, and costs of military \noperations; and develop alternative contingency plans that maximize \nmission effectiveness, while minimizing the risk, cost, and collateral \neffects.\n  Moreover, in the case of countries with embryonic weapons activities, \nSTRATCOM's mission-planning analysis can provide the early and detailed \nalert that will allow policy makers to fashion effective export \ncontrols and other preventative measures to block weapons programs \nbefore they become a threat to the United States or other nations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with Chairman Thurmond's assessment of \nUSSTRATCOM'S mission-planning analysis activities and the importance of \nthis program in supporting the broad spectrum of U.S. nonproliferation \nand counterproliferation goals. Unfortunately, during our markup of the \nfiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill, we were unaware that the \nprogram is not adequately funded in the budget request for STRATCOM.\n  Without funding, analysis that commanders find essential for mission \nplanning will at best be performed on an ad hoc basis or, worse, not at \nall. This issue is too vital and the risks of proliferation are to \ngreat to be ignored by the Senate.\n  I hope the conferees will see fit to include the required funding for \nthis program.\n  disposal of obsolete and excess materials contained in the national \n                           defense stockpile\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to raise an issue with the manager regarding \nsection 3402 of the bill. This section appears on page 587 and is \nentitled ``Disposal of Obsolete and Excess Materials Contained in the \nNational Defense Stockpile.'' I understand that the purpose of this \nprovision is to eliminate the strategic materials in the national \ndefense stockpile with three exceptions. Is that correct?\n  Mr. THURMOND. The provision recognizes that the stockpile contains \nmaterials which are excess to national security needs. At the direction \nof Congress, the Department of Defense conducted a thorough analysis of \nrequirements and reported their findings.\n  Mr. BURNS. And I understand that if the disposal of those materials \nis authorized by the Congress, the actual sales of the materials would \nbe preceded by a recommendation by the Federal Market Impact Committee \nregarding the adverse domestic and foreign economic impacts on the \nprivate sector as a result of the proposed stockpile sales. Is that \ncorrect.\n  Mr. THURMOND. No disposal from the stockpile may occur until the \nMarket Impact Committee has analyzed the DOD plan for annual disposals. \nCongress must then concur with the annual materials plan before DOD can \ndispose of any materials. We maintain very tight control over these \ndisposal and the procedures have worked very well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Our concern is with the proposed sale of palladium and \nplatinum in the stockpile. The national defense stockpile of palladium \nrepresents the equivalent of 20 percent of the annual demand for this \nmetal, and the national defense stockpile of platinum represents 5 \npercent of the national demand. The price of both of these metals is \nquite volatile. There is already some indication that just the \nrecommendation for sale has had a depressive impact on the market \nprice. Did the committee, when it included palladium and platinum among \nthe materials to be disposed, examine the implications of disposition \nof palladium and platinum?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Any disposals of those materials could only occur in \nsmall amounts over a very long period of time, according to market and \nimpact conditions. Although no subcommittee hearing was conducted this \nyear to review stockpile operations, we have been working closely with \nDOD on this matter and the final DOD report has been reviewed.\n  Mr. BURNS. Historically, the National Defense Stockpile was created \nto provide a supply of strategic materials not available from domestic \nproduction or not available in sufficient quantities from domestic \nproduction to meet critical military needs. Since the palladium and \nplatinum that is in the stockpile was acquired, the Stillwater Mine in \nMontana has begun production and, in fact, is the only mine in the \nworld which is a primary palladium producer, platinum representing a \nsecondary metal from that mine. Virtually all other palladium and \nplatinum comes from South Africa and Russia.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The problem from Montana's perspective is that the \nStillwater Mine has only recently begun to recover its costs of \nproduction as the price of palladium has stabilized at a level \nsufficient to justify operation of the mine. Because of the \nimprovements in price, Stillwater Mining Co. has announced an intention \nto double its production of palladium beginning in mid-1997. The \ndoubling of production will increase the number of high-paid \nunderground mining jobs by approximately 400. In Montana, these jobs \nare extremely important to our economic health.\n  Mr. BURNS. We are deeply concerned that there not be some activity \nwith respect to the disposition of palladium and platinum in the \nstockpile which would undermine the basic economics of the Stillwater \nMine and its proposed expansion. The question to the manager of the \nbill is whether the conferees, on behalf of the Senate, will support an \namendment from the Montana delegation which will assure that disruption \nin the price of palladium and platinum not occur.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would emphasize that this legislation would not \npermit DOD to dispose of a single ounce of these materials. Any \ndisposal requires approval by Congress of an annual materials plan and \nI suggest to my colleagues that the AMP is the mechanism we have \nestablished in law to protect domestic industry from disruption. The \nprovision in this bill enables DOD to develop a plan for potential \ndisposals in a manner which will not disrupt the market or disadvantage \ndomestic producers. This procedure has worked very well in the past and \nany disruption has been minimized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. In the course of debate \non this legislation many improvements have been made to what was a \ndangerous piece of legislation.\n  To mention two of these positive changes: The provisions on the \nEnergy Department relating to our nuclear weapons activities have been \ngreatly improved and the National Missile Defense Act of 1995 has been \nsignificantly altered.\n  Unfortunately, these changes have not gone far enough to correct what \nI believe is still a flawed piece of legislation.\n  I will oppose this legislation primarily for two reasons. First, the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995, though much improved over the original \ncommittee version, risks undermining the START treaties. Second, the \nbill provides for an increase of $7.1 billion in spending on programs \nthat the Pentagon does want nor need.\n  At this juncture, I want to make clear that I support a robust \nnational defense. I do not think, though, that spending money on \nweapons systems that the military itself does not want and pursuing a \nnational missile defense which could lead to a new arms race, as this \nbill does, is a good way to promote our national security.\n  Senators Nunn, Levin, Cohen, and Warner worked hard to develop a \ncompromise which altered some of the more egregious provisions of the \ncommittee-reported version of the Missile Defense Act of 1995. I \ncommend them for their efforts, and I supported their amendment as a \nway to improve the original bill language.\n\n[[Page S 12670]]\n\n  The amendment does move us away from the original bill's commitment \nto deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. Furthermore, the \nscope of the Strategic Missile Defense Program has been strictly \nlimited to defending against unauthorized, accidental, and limited \nlaunches as opposed to a more ambitious defense against all types of \nballistic missiles. The Congress is now guaranteed a decisive role in \nthe decision to deploy any missile defenses. Finally, provisions which \nwould have tied the President's hands in negotiating ABM Treaty \namendments have been removed.\n  Despite these significant changes, many problems remain with the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995. In particular, there is a real threat that \nthe Russian Duma will not understand the legislative finessing we have \nengaged in to avoid a head-on collision with the ABM Treaty. The \ndistinction between developing for deployment a national missile \ndefense system versus deploying such a system are subtle at best. They \nmay also be concerned about policy statements referring to the \npossibility of withdrawal from the AMB Treaty should negotiations not \nsucceed.\n  The danger is that these measures on our part will be viewed as \nviolations of the ABM Treaty by the\n Russians. If the Russians believe that we are developing an effective \nnational missile defense system in violation of the ABM Treaty, then \nthey are likely to lose confidence in their offensive strategic \narsenal, which has been shrinking thanks to arms control agreements \nlike START I.\n\n  To overcome that lack of confidence, they will seek to develop the \nmeans to counter our missile defense system. The cheapest way to do so \nis to overwhelm missile defenses. In order to retain the ability to do \nthat they will stop implementing START I and refuse to ratify START II.\n  The progress in arms control which accompanied the signing of the ABM \nTreaty over two decades ago will have been thrown by the wayside, and \nironically we will have the kind of arms race in the post-cold-war \nworld which we were able to avoid in the heyday of the cold war.\n  Instead of focusing on a threat from ballistic missiles reaching our \nshores--a threat which we may never face--we should be concentrating \nour efforts on those areas where a realistic threat does exist. That \nthreat primarily comes in the form of a rogue state or terrorist group \ngaining access to widely scattered fissile material in the former \nSoviet Union, fashioning a crude nuclear explosive device, and \nsmuggling it into the United States by conventional means such as a \nboat.\n  Our focus should be on securing the many tons of nuclear material in \nthe former Soviet Union, and on tracking dangerous terrorist groups who \nmay be potential customers for that material, not on defending against \nthe remote possibility of a ballistic missile attack from outlaw states \nor groups.\n  The second primary concern I have with this legislation is that it \ncalls for wasteful spending. I want to repeat that I stand for a strong \nnational defense. Unfortunately, the additional $7.1 billion in \nspending above the administration's request called for in this \nlegislation does nothing to improve our national security.\n  Not one penny of the increase is going into the operations and \nmaintenance account, also known as the readiness account. The reason \nfor that is that there is not a readiness problem under the Clinton \ndefense budgets as some would like us to believe.\n  Some of the $7.1 billion increase in spending, such as that for \nnational missile defense, could lead to expenditures of tens of \nbillions of dollars in future years if plans are fully carried out. \nThis is an indirect way of forcing enormous increases in future defense \nbudgets which are not included in current budget plans.\n  At a time when many valuable programs are being subjected to \nunprecedented cuts, I find it difficult to support large increases in \nprograms in the Defense bill which were not requested by the military \nand will do nothing to enhance our national security.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I must oppose the Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year \n1996 Defense authorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee. This is an excellent bill, and I want to specifically \ncommend the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, \nfor his able leadership and tireless efforts on behalf of the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces. I also want to thank Senator Nunn, the \ndistinguished ranking member, for his hard work and dedication.\n  Mr. President, when the 104th Congress convened in January, Senator \nThurmond initiated a comprehensive review of our national defense \nrequirements in view of the administration's future years defense plan. \nThe review highlighted some serious deficiencies in military readiness, \nmodernization, quality of life, and investment, and served as a basis \nfor establishing a list of top priorities for the Armed Services \nCommittee in this year's defense program. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I ask unanimous consent that this list of priorities be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Armed Services Committee Priorities\n\n       Guarantee our national security and the status of the \n     United States as the preeminent military power:\n       Maintain FY 96 defense budget at FY 95 levels in real \n     terms.\n       Determine outyear defense budgets based on national \n     security requirements.\n       Reprioritize the President's budgets to ensure appropriate \n     balance of personnel, near-term readiness and long-term \n     readiness (modernization).\n       Ensure a high quality and sufficient end-strength of \n     personnel at all grade levels through effective recruiting \n     and retention policies.\n       Buy the weapons and equipment needed to fight and win \n     decisively with minimal risk to personnel.\n       Eliminate defense spending that does not contribute \n     directly to the national security of the United States.\n       Ensure an adequate, safe, and reliable nuclear weapons \n     capability.\n       Reevaluate peacekeeping roles, policies and operations and \n     their impact on budgets, readiness and national security.\n       Protect the quality of life of our military personnel and \n     their families:\n       Provide equitable pay and benefits for military personnel \n     to protect against inflation.\n       Restore appropriate levels of funding for construction and \n     maintenance of troop billets and family housing.\n       Revitalize the readiness of our Armed Forces:\n       Restore near-term readiness by providing adequate funding \n     to: reduce the backlog in maintenance and repair of \n     equipment; provide adequate training; and maintain stocks of \n     supplies, repair parts, fuels, and ammunition.\n       Ensure U.S. military superiority by funding a more robust, \n     progressive modernization program to provide required \n     capabilities for the future.\n       Accelerate development and deployment of missile defense \n     systems:\n       Deploy as soon as possible advanced land and sea based \n     theater missile defenses.\n       Clarify in law that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty does \n     not apply to modern theater missile defense systems.\n       Reassess value and validity of the Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty to the national security of the United States.\n       Accelerate development, testing and deployment of a \n     national missile defense system highly effective against \n     limited attacks of ballistic missiles.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. The bill before us delivers on each of the priorities that \nwere developed by Senator Thurmond and members of the committee. In \nfact, every element of the list is embodied in direct actions taken by\n the committee. We made a commitment, and we delivered on that \ncommitment.\n\n  The committee bill authorizes approximately $264.7 billion in budget \nauthority for the National Defense Program. Although this represents an \nincrease of $7 billion from the administration's grossly underfunded \nrequest, it still falls short of fully meeting our military \nrequirements. The situation in the outyears is considerably worse.\n  Both the Clinton plan and the recently passed budget resolution fail \nto fund defense at a level that even keeps pace with inflation. We are \non track for a major train wreck between defense requirements and \nresources. If we are to maintain any semblance of a stable defense \nprogram we will need to maintain the spending outlined in this bill, \nand revisit future years funding levels next year.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of very important initiatives \ncontained in this bill, which I would like to briefly summarize for my \ncolleagues. The committee bill:\n  Provides a 2.4-percent pay raise for military members and a 5.2-\npercent increase in basic allowance for quarters.\n\n[[Page S 12671]]\n\n  Equalizes dates for military and civil service retiree COLA's for \n1996 through 1998.\n  Authorizes $1.3 billion to purchase the LHD-7 amphibious assault \nship.\n  Fully funds the F-22 fighter program.\n  Initiates a long overdue upgrade of our airborne electronic warfare \nprograms.\n  Funds critical antisubmarine warfare and countermine programs.\n  Provides $110 million to purchase the second of three ships under the \nMarine Corps Maritime Preposition Ship Enhancement Program.\n  Provides $35 million to begin retrofitting aging Patriot missiles \nwith an advanced seeker to defend against modern cruise missiles.\n  Includes a provision ensuring free and fair competition between \nElectric Boat and Newport News for the new attack submarine program.\n  And perhaps most important, includes the Missile Defense Act of 1995, \na historic and long overdue refocusing of our Ballistic Missile Defense \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, the Missile Defense Act establishes a comprehensive \nprogram to counter the threats posed to our Nation by ballistic \nmissiles and cruise missiles. The program has three key elements that I\n want to bring to the attention of my colleagues.\n\n  First and foremost, the legislation accelerates the development and \ndeployment of national missile defenses to protect all Americans \nagainst the threat of ballistic missiles. The Clinton administration \nhas effectively killed the National Missile Defense Program, leaving \nthe American people totally vulnerable to ballistic missile attack.\n  The committee bill rejects the administration's misguided approach, \nand establishes a specific program and schedule to deploy a multiple \nsite, ground based national missile defense by the year 2003.\n  Second, the committee bill would codify the demarcation proposal that \nthe Clinton administration offered in Geneva some 18 months ago. It \nestablishes a demonstrated standard for evaluating compliance with the \nABM Treaty.\n  The bill specifies that theater missile defense systems would not be \nsubject to the terms of the ABM Treaty unless they are flight tested \nagainst a ballistic missile with a range greater than 3,500 kilometers \nor a velocity in excess of 5 kilometers per second. This is a \nreasonable and appropriate standard that was suggested by the \nadministration, and we have included it in this bill.\n  Third, the committee bill establishes a cruise missile defense \ninitiative to counter the threat posed by existing and emerging air \nbreathing threats. The intelligence community estimates that at least \n12 countries have land-attack cruise missiles under development. \nAlthough the Defense Department has a variety of programs underway to \naddress these threats, there is poor coordination and synergy among the \nDepartment's programs.\n  The bill would direct the Secretary of Defense to better coordinate \nthe Pentagon's cruise and ballistic missile defense programs, prepare a \nplan for prompt deployment of these systems, and provide a substantial \nincrease in funding.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the bill advocates a cooperative \ntransition to a post-cold-war regime that is responsive to the global \nthreat environment. The committee heard testimony from many different \nwitnesses this year urging the United States to move away from the cold \nwar doctrine of mutual assured destruction toward a more flexible \ndeterrent posture that integrates both offensive and defensive weapons.\n  In particular, Henry Kissinger, who was a key negotiator of the ABM \nTreaty and a proponent of mutual assured destruction, indicated to the \ncommittee that this doctrine has been surpassed by events, and is no \nlonger relevant or constructive in\n the post-cold-war world. The committee took this testimony very \nseriously, and has recommended that we work with our Russian \ncounterparts to move cooperatively away from the confrontational policy \nof mutual assured destruction toward a more multipolar oriented \ndeterrent posture.\n\n  The committee bill also recommends the establishment of a select \ncommittee to conduct a 1-year review on the continuing value and \nvalidity of the ABM Treaty. The select committee would conduct hearings \nand interviews, review all relevant documents, and carefully consider \nthe full range of policy issues surrounding the treaty.\n  To support this initiative, the committee bill would require that the \nABM Treaty negotiating record be declassified. This action would be \nconsistent with the classification policy that was established by \nExecutive order on April 17 of this year by the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. President, these initiatives on ballistic missile defense are \nresponsible, measured, and necessary to protect the national security \nof the United States. The American people overwhelmingly support the \ndeployment of national missile defenses and highly effective theater \nmissile defenses.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate now appears poised to completely rewrite \nthe Missile Defense Act. Although the Senate has voted twice to \npreserve key aspects of the legislation, a so-called compromise has \nbeen developed which totally changes the focus and content of the bill. \nAs one who has dedicated a great deal of time and effort on this issue, \nI am deeply disappointed with this sudden change of course. The Armed \nServices Committee bill was the right answer to a very complex and \nurgent problem, and I am troubled that for nothing more than \nconvenience sake, it appears this body is prepared to compromise its \nprinciples and our Nation's security. This is a terrible mistake, and I \nwill not support it.\n  The truth is, that contrary to the assertions of our friends who \noppose missile defense, nothing in the committee bill, absolutely \nnothing, would violate the ABM Treaty. It merely begins preparations \nfor the eventual deployment of a system to defend all Americans against \nthe threat of ballistic missiles.\n  The authors of the treaty expected evolutionary changes and \nincorporated provisions that would encourage cooperative modifications \nor, if necessary, withdrawal from the treaty after a 6-month notice. \nThe Armed Services Committee bill does not prejudge the results of \nnegotiations to amend the treaty, nor does it advocate a unilateral \nwithdrawal from the treaty. It\n merely affirms the moral and constitutional requirement to defend all \nAmericans, and initiates a comprehensive program to counter threats to \nour security.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the fundamental issue at stake here. The \nAmerican people are totally vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. \nThey have no defenses. And the Clinton administration intends to keep \nit that way. The question for Senators today is whether you believe \nthat all Americans deserve to be defended, or you support the Clinton \npolicy which says no Americans should be defended. You can't have it \nboth ways.\n  But, sadly, that is what my colleagues are trying to do with this so-\ncalled bipartisan compromise. In an effort to prevent the President \nfrom vetoing the defense bill, they have agreed to water down the \nmissile defense provisions, to soften the findings, to hedge on \ndeployment dates, and to completely undermine the principles that were \nembodied in the committee bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to try and \nfind common ground, and to seek compromise in order to build consensus. \nBut national security is not something to be compromised, and I refuse \nto associate myself with a policy which perpetuates the vulnerability \nof our citizens. I will oppose the so-called bipartisan compromise on \nmissile defense, and any other amendment which undermines the excellent \nwork of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n                       Acquisition and Technology\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Acquisition and \nTechnology Subcommittee, I have been charged with overseeing of the \ntechnology base programs in the defense budget request for fiscal year \n1996. The technology base budget includes funding for the basic \nresearch, exploratory development, and advanced development accounts, \nthe so-called 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 accounts of the budget.\n  In addition the subcommittee also has responsibility for the so-\ncalled RDT infrastructure accounts. These \n\n[[Page S 12672]]\naccounts fund the maintenance of laboratories, R centers, and test \nand evaluation facilities. The portion of the accounts allocated to the \nAcquisition and Technology Subcommittee in fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest amounted to a total of $9.5 billion.\n  As the incoming subcommittee chairman, I faced a number of \nchallenges. The budget request for fiscal year 1996 was already reduced \nfrom the amounts appropriated for these accounts in fiscal year 1995. \nUnlike other portions of the budget, the technology base programs are \nspread out among 250 separate program elements complicating a \nsystematic review of the programs. Finally, it was clear that we needed \nto undertake a thorough review of each of these programs in order to \nensure that defense relevance be the most important test for their \ncontinued funding. I was determined to understand the details of the \nprograms under my purview.\n  To aid in its review of these programs, the subcommittee conducted \nsix hearings on program categories as well as on relevant policy areas. \nWe began with an overview hearing on the technology programs in the \nSubcommittee's jurisdiction on March 14. This hearing yielded important \ninsights into the relationship of the programs under the purview of the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense and those managed by the services.\n  Over the past several years, there has been a distinct trend in \ntechnology funding shifting from service programs to programs managed \nby OSD. This trend may have serious consequences if we are robbing \nPeter to pay Paul and are thereby reducing service influence on the \ninvestment of our defense technology dollars.\n  The importance of technology to the military in the face of the \nemerging revolution in military affairs was one of the subjects \ndiscussed at length during a subcommittee hearing on May 5. At that \nhearing, Admiral Owens, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nMr. Andrew Marshall of the DOD Office of Net Assessment presented a \npreliminary sketch of the future battlefield and the key role that \ntechnology, especially information technology, will play in bringing \nvictory or defeat.\n  The hearing underscored the need to maintain sufficient levels of \ndefense technology investment to ensure that we are able to exploit the \npotential of future battlefield. Technology issues are only one aspect \nof the revolution in military affairs, and I am hopeful that the full \ncommittee will hold at least one hearing over the next year to examine \nthe implication of this revolution for areas like organization and \ntraining that extend beyond the scope of any one subcommittee.\n  The technology reinvestment project has become one of the more \ncontroversial programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. On May \n17, the subcommittee held a hearing to review this program and other \nso-called dual-use technology programs in the Department of Defense \nbudget request. As a percentage of the budget, these programs have been \ngrowing since 1990. The dual-use designation refers to the fact that \nsuch programs involve technologies that have application in both the \ncommercial as well as the defense sectors of the economy. Dual-use \ntechnologies will be used to an increasing extent in weapon systems as \nthe electronics content of such systems continues to rise.\n  In the electronics industries, for example, the commercial \nmarketplace, not defense requirements, is driving the pace of \ntechnology development. Because the Department of Defense represents a \nshrinking share of the electronics market, DOD leverage over the market \nis decreasing.\n  For that reason, the paradigm for future interaction between the \nDepartment of Defense and the electronics industries is a dual-use \npartnership approach in which both DOD and the industry provide funding \nfor the development of technology. Such partnerships can help to make \nour acquisition process more efficient as we inject commercial \ntechnologies into defense weapons systems.\n  I want to make clear, however, that there are dangers in placing too \nmuch emphasis on this approach. If programs are not managed carefully, \nwe may end up doing dual-use for dual-use sake with only a limited \nemphasis on military utility. Military utility must be the driving \nfactor, and a time of limited funding, we have to ensure that we are \nnot raiding critical technology base programs under the guise of dual-\nuse development. We also need to ensure that Congress maintains the \nproper level of visibility and oversight in dual-use programs.\n  At the May 17 hearing on dual-use programs, we explored these issues \nin depth with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and \nTechnology, Paul Kaminski, and representatives of the defense industry \nand the General Accounting Office. What emerged from the testimony was \nthe potential payoff of some existing dual-use programs, such as those \nunderway in the technology reinvestment project, but also the need for \nimprovements in management and oversight of these programs.\n  An area that is directly related to our investments in technology is \nthe issue of export control. Unless we have in place an effective \nprocess for reviewing licenses for the export of sensitive \ntechnologies, especially those that are dual-use in nature, we will end \nup having to spend scarce R dollars to counter technologies that we \nalready have paid to develop. I am particularly concerned about the \nlicensing for export of technologies for satellites and satellite-\nrelated services.\n  On May 31, I chaired a hearing reviewing current export license \nreview procedures and the relationship among the Departments of \nDefense, State, and Commerce in this process. The hearing uncovered \nsome significant problems of coordination and cooperation among the \nagencies that have directly undermined our national security. I intend \nto continue pursuing these issues in further hearings.\n  Mr. President, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an \never growing threat to our national security. Because of this increased \nthreat, I have made counterproliferation programs and policies a major \narea of new emphasis for the Subcommittee on Acquisition and \nTechnology. On April 14, the subcommittee held a hearing to review the \nfunding request for fiscal year 1996 for counterproliferation programs. \nThe hearing revealed that additional funding would be necessary to \naccelerate development and deployment of military counterproliferation \ntechnologies. The bill before us addresses many significant \ndeficiencies in our counterproliferation program.\n  Upon completion of the hearing process in May, I began a \ncomprehensive analysis of the funding requests for the 250 program \nelements in the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee. As I announced \nat the first hearing in March, my litmus test for funding a program was \nsimple: if there is a defense investment, there must be a defense \nreturn. We put everything on the table. I carried out this review \nindependent of political bias, and without any prejudice toward systems \nor technologies.\n  Because high priority requirements in readiness, modernization, and \nquality of life were severely underfunded in the President's defense \nbudget request, Chairman Thurmond directed me to reduce accounts under \nthe jurisdiction of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee in \nareas of nondefense initiatives or lower priority activities. I agreed \nwith that direction and accepted the guidance to reduce the programs \n$330 million below the President's request.\n  However, in the midst of our review, the subcommittee received \nrequests from Senators for additions to the bill totaling nearly $620 \nmillion. As we clearly could not accommodate even a majority of these \nrequests, I attempted to apply the same litmus test to these requests \nas I applied to the programs in the administration request: direct \ndefense relevance.\n  In preparing the subcommittee recommendation on the President's \nrequest, we endeavored to protect the core, defense relevant technology \nprograms above everything else. We gave programs with defined \ntechnology development a higher priority than those that lacked it. The \nlargest source of reductions was the technology reinvestment project, \nwhich we cut by $262 million. This funding would all have supported a \nnew competition in fiscal year 1996 for which technology thrust areas \nhave yet to even be defined.\n  Mr. President, as the committee report on page 111 indicates, despite \nour \n\n[[Page S 12673]]\ncontinued support of dual-use technology development programs, a new \ncompetition for unspecified technologies in 1996 must have a lower \npriority from a defense standpoint than funding well-defined technology \nprograms in the budget request for the services. We changed the name of \nthe program to the Defense Dual-use Technology Initiative and have also \nchanged the statutory basis for the program to clarify the need for \nclose connection between research and a military mission requirement.\n  Another source of funding reductions was an undistributed cut of $90 \nmillion to the work conducted through the federally funded research and \ndevelopment centers known as FFRDC's. The FFRDC issue has been a \ncontroversial one in recent years due to the perception of some that \nthese institutions lack effective management oversight from the Defense \nDepartment. While the subcommittee is satisfied with the efforts of the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition to review the future role of \nthe FFRDC's, our reduction was made in a manner consistent with overal \nreductions in R, and in anticipation of some redistribution of \nworkload betwen the FFRDC's and the private sector.\n  Another source of significant reductions was in the accounts \nsupporting the research, development test, and evaluation \ninfrastructure. One of the most disturbing trends in the technology \nbudget is the greater and greater portion of R funding that is going, \nnot to programs, but to maintaining facilities and test ranges. The \nbase closure and realignment process has not dealt effectively with the \nneed to consolidate laboratories, research centers and test facilities \nacross the services.\n  As a result, at a time when the R portion of the budget request has \ndeclined by over 10 percent from last year, the RDT support programs \nhave declined overall less than 4 percent. In recognition of this \ntrend, we reduced the infrastructure programs by $85 million. It is my \nhope that we can develop an effective process for consolidating \nfacilities so that we can devote a greater share of our scarce \nresources to programs rather than maintenance. I intend to continue to \npursue this issue vigorously next year.\n  In the midst of these reductions, I am pleased to say that we were \nable to fund some critical gaps in the budget. We added $36 million to \ncreate a counterproliferation support program to accelerate the \ndevelopment and deployment of technologies for military \ncounterproliferation. Our report details the new initiatives in such \nareas as biological agent detection, cruise missile defense, and \nproliferation of space technology. We also shifted $24 million into \nArmy technology base accounts to correct some of the most serious \nshortfalls in the Army's underfunded technology budget.\n  I want to thank members of the staff for all their work in helping \nout the members of the Subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology. \nMonica Chavez, Jon Etherton, Tom Moore, Tom Lankford, and Pamela \nFarrell provided essential support for our review. On the minority \nside, Ed McGaffigan, John Douglass, and Andy Effron were extremely \ncooperative with our staff and members in working through these issues.\n  I especially want to express my appreciation for the support and \ncounsel I received from the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator \nJeff Bingaman. I was privileged to serve as the ranking member under \nhis chairmanship of the subcommittee during the last Congress where \nSenator Bingaman conducted the process with fairness, openness, and \nalways in a spirit of bipartisanship. I know there were recommendations \nin this bill that trouble the Senator from New Mexico, but he has \nremained supportive and helpful throughout our process.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe that the acquisition and \ntechnology portion of the defense authorization bill maintains a strong \ntechnology base program. The core, defense-relevant programs are funded \nat or above the requested amounts, and the bill lays a solid foundation \non which we can build future technology investments for national \ndefense.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I voted against final passage of S. 1087, \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill and S. 1026, the Defense \nauthorization bill. I did not cast these votes lightly. In fact, this \nis the first time in my Senate career that I have voted against a \ndefense spending measure. I supported the authorization bill in \ncommittee in the interest of bringing the bill before the full Senate \nwith the hope that the bill's more problematic provisions could be \neliminated by amendment.\n  A number of factors contributed to my decision to vote against final \npassage.\n  I have always supported a strong defense for our Nation. I have \nsupported increases in defense spending beyond what has been requested \nby Presidents when I believed those programs were the interest of our \nnational security. But, these spending measures add as much as $7 \nbillion in funding for programs that I do not support and do not \nbelieve represent a responsible means of spending limited taxpayer \nfunds. I could have supported additional funding for some of these \nindividual programs, but not the total funding package, particularly at \na time when we are trying to balance the Federal budget and are \nconsidering substantial cuts in domestic funding to accomplish that.\n  The bulk of the additional funds are spent for procurement programs \nfor which the Pentagon made no request: close to $600 million was added \nfor F/A-18's, $361 million for F-15's, $175 million for F-16's, $1.4 \nbillion for DDG-51, $1.3 billion for LHD-7, and close to $800 million \nfor Guard and Reserve equipment.\n  In addition, the two bills add $600 million above the President's \nbudget request for ballistic missile defense, $300 million of which is \nfor national missile defense, bringing total funding for ballistic \nmissile defense to $3 billion. This level of funding exceeds our \nnational requirements and undermines our commitment to the ABM Treaty, \nan agreement critical to our national security needs.\n  With respect to the Department of Energy's nuclear weapon production \ncomplex, several significant improvements were made in the bill since \nit was reported out of committee. However, the bill still contains over \n$120 million in unrequested, unneccessary funds for plutonium pit \nmanufacturing and refabrication capability. The bill also includes $50 \nmillion for low yield, hydronuclear testing purposes, which I oppose.\n  At the same time that these two bills add billions for programs the \nPentagon claims it does not need, they leave unfunded the estimated \n$1.2 billion in costs for our current operations in Bosnia and Iraq, \nfunds which the Pentagon undisputedly needs. So, while these bills \npurport to add funds in the name of long term readiness, they create an \nimmediate threat to our readiness by forcing the Pentagon to siphon off \nmore than a billion dollars in operations and maintenance funding to \nfinance current operations.\n  In addition to the funding issues, I am very disturbed by the \nprovision in the authorization bill related to the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. I will address my specific concerns in this area in a \nseparate statement.\n     huge pentagon spending increases reflect distorted priorities\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this week I am voting against both of \nthe major Department of Defense spending bills for next year. I am \ndoing so for a number of reasons, including the fact that these bills \nprovide about $7 billion more in defense spending than the President, \nthe Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nhave requested for next year. That's right. Congress this year will \napprove spending for about $7 billion more than the Pentagon has \nrequested, or than they have indicated they will be able to responsibly \nuse, next year.\n  Coincidentally, perhaps, this is just about the same amount--in Pell \ngrants for students, in Head Start, in substance abuse prevention, in \nemployment and training, in worker protections, and many other key \ndomestic areas--that was recently slashed by the House appropriators \nfor next year.\n  Since my perspective, these are seriously skewed priorities. And \nsince polls continue to show substantial support for bringing down the \npost-cold-war defense budget, I do not believe they are \n\n[[Page S 12674]]\nthe priorities of the vast majority of Americans. Even worse, the two \nbills increase the President's request for star wars spending by \nhundreds of millions--in one case, about $770 million--which will spell \nserious trouble for future arms control negotiations.\n  Following an unsuccessful bipartisan effort before the recess in \nwhich I joined Senator Kohl, Grassley, and others to amend the bill to \neliminate the overall increase above the President's request, I tried \nto split the difference, offering another amendment to reduce the \nincrease by only about 50 percent. It too was defeated, as were all \nother efforts to modestly scale back overall funding in the bill to \nmore responsible levels.\n  I also tried, through numerous other amendments offered with my \ncolleagues, to scale back or eliminate spending on a number of \nunnecessary or obsolete weapons systems. Most of those efforts were \nunsuccessful. Given tight funding constraints, continued overspending \non defense is unwise, it is irresponsible, and it is a policy which \ndoes not serve our real national security interests. If we fail to \ninvest in our children in order to bolster post-cold-war defense \nbudgets, because we were too afraid to thoroughly rethink our real \nnational security needs, and retool our defense budget accordingly, we \nwill regret it for at least a generation.\n  I believe that a time when we are slashing budgets for hundreds of \nsocial programs that protect the vulnerable, preserve our lakes and \nstreams, and provide for expanded opportunities for the elderly and the \nbroad middle class, such as student loans, Medicare, and job \nretraining, it is wrong to increase, substantially, already bloated \nmilitary spending.\n  In defense, as elsewhere in the Federal budget, there are responsible \nways to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending; by cutting \nobsolete cold war weapons systems, imposing money-saving reforms within \nthe bureaucracy, and streamlining procurement policy to make the system \nmore efficient and more cost effective. I have proposed a number of \nways to do this in recent months, including scaling back bloated \nPentagon travel budgets, which the General Accounting Office has found \ncould provide substantial savings--hundreds of millions of dollars per \nyear. Over and over, these attempts have either been voted down here on \nthe Senate floor, or the bills to accomplish these ends have been \nbottled up in committee.\n  In the end, there is almost no Pentagon streamlining, no elimination \nof waste, provided for in this bill. Instead, when faced with difficult \nchoices between competing weapons systems, basic housing improvements \nfor our troops, and other readiness requirements, the committee decided \nsimply to buy all of the big weapons systems, ships, and planes that \nthey could, larding the bill with special interest funds for defense \ncontractors in Armed Services or Appropriations Committee Members' home \nStates, often accelerating purchases not scheduled to be made for many \nyears, if at all. In fact, the purchase of many of these extravagantly \nexpensive weapons systems is actively opposed by the Pentagon, because \nthey have identified higher national security priorities for the \nfunding that is available.\n  I also have serious concerns about the potentially catastrophic arms \ncontrol consequences of this bill. For example, I voted against even \nthe so-called compromise on the national missile defense or star wars \nsystem because I believe that, even though it was better than the \noriginal bill, the approach urged by the compromise amendment would \nseriously undermine the 1972 ABM Treaty, and is likely to jeopardize \nthe nuclear weapons reductions in the START I and II treaties.\n  While some have argued, I think in good faith, that this compromise \nmeets basic arms control and nonproliferation requirements, I disagree. \nAs a practical matter, there is no question in my mind that enactment \nof this bill would lead us toward near-term deployment of a national \nmissile defense system. It is the latest version of the earlier star \nwars system that was roundly rejected by most knowledgeable scientists, \nand national security experts, as a waste of money and a fraud.\n  Senator Warner has been very clear that he believes this compromise \nwill move us along toward rapid deployment of such a system. Since, \nregrettably, I agree with Senator Warner that that is so, while I \ncommend Senator Levin and others on our side for their efforts to \ndevelop the compromise, I could not support\n the final agreement. I believe that spending scores of billions of \nadditional dollars to deploy an elaborate national missile defense \nsystem that's not likely to work effectively, and thus violating the \nABM Treaty, to defend against a far-fetched scenario in which a \nballistic missile is fired on the United States from a rogue terrorist \nstate, is irresponsible. The more likely means that terrorists might \nuse to deliver such a bomb--in a suitcase placed in some public place, \nor in a Ryder truck, or in a van parked underneath a building--is a far \nmore serious threat. And that is a threat we can combat for a lot less \nthan $50 to $100 billion.\n\n  I also believe that the additional funding provided by the bill for \nhydronuclear testing in Nevada will likely have a profoundly negative \nimpact on the test ban negotiations now underway in Geneva. The French \nnuclear test detonated in the South Pacific yesterday underscores the \nurgency of bringing to a successful close negotiations on a truly \ncomprehensive test ban that is enforceable, and that constrains its \nsignatories from further tests.\n  There are a host of other serious problems with this bill, Mr. \nPresident, some of which we have tried to address during the debate \nthrough various amendments. Virtually none of them have been resolved. \nI believe that this bill in its current form spends vastly more on \ndefense than we can afford, would threaten longstanding arms control \nagreements and nonproliferation efforts, and would not be in our \nnational security interests. I hope the President will follow through \non his threatened vetoes of these bills. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst these huge and unwarranted increases in defense spending, as I \nwill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to final passage of S. \n1026, the DOD authorization bill. And as was the case with the 1996 \nDefense appropriations bill, I do so with a heavy heart.\n  I would inform my colleagues that today marks the first time in my 15 \nyears of Senate service that I will vote against final passage of a \nDefense authorization bill. This is a not so much a vote of \ndisagreement, but a vote of conscience.\n  The 1996 Defense authorization bill contains spending instructions of \nalmost $7 billion above the Pentagon's initial request. Let me clarify \nthat point, neither the President nor the respective service chiefs \nhave asked for these funds. The programs earmarked for these increases \nwere never part of the Pentagon's original budget request. That fact \nweighs heavily in my decision today.\n  I think most of my colleagues know that I have consistently supported \nprudent and necessary spending for our national defense. On more than \none occasion in my career, I have listened carefully to the words of \nvarious Secretaries of Defense when the Pentagon badly needed support \nfor future weapons programs. And on each of those occasions, I \nsupported those requests without regard for party affiliation or \npersonal politics. I did so because it was in the best interest of our \ncountry.\n  However, this is a very different situation. This Defense \nauthorization bill contains almost $7 billion in additional funding for \nDefense programs not contained in the original Pentagon request--$7 \nbillion is simply too much to add to a bill while entire agencies are \neliminating programs that are crucial to working families across this \nNation.\n  As I stated earlier, Head Start, Goals 2000, and other critical \ninvestment programs for our Nation's youth are near extinction, while \nthis bill authorizes increased Defense spending. I cannot rationalize \nthat inequity.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I opposed the increases \nin the Department of Defense spending allocations. Likewise, on three \nseparate occasions during floor debate, I voted to keep defense \nspending at the original levels requested by the administration. I did \nso because it was right, and because to do otherwise would be an \nendorsement of the cuts in other vital domestic programs.\n\n[[Page S 12675]]\n\n  Let me conclude by saying I respect the members of the committee for \ntheir diligent and hard work in bringing this important bill to the \nfloor. But this is an issue of priorities. And I vehemently disagree \nwith those priorities as presented in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 1124) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 1124 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  So, the bill (S. 1125) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 1125 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  So, the bill (S. 1126) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 1126 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, with respect to H.R. 1530, previously \npassed by the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on \nits amendment to the bill and request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees; that the motion to reconsider the above-mentioned \nvotes be laid upon the table; and that the foregoing occur without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent with respect to \nS. 1124 through S. 1126, as just passed by the Senate, that if the \nSenate receives a message with regard to any one of these bills from \nthe House of Representatives, that the Senate disagree with the House \non its amendment or amendments to the Senate-passed bill and agree to a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees and the foregoing \noccur without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the \nprevious order, S. 1026 is indefinitely postponed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have completed many long hours of \ndebate on S. 1062, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Nunn, for his insight, wisdom, and devotion to our \nNation. He and I have always worked to achieve the same objective of \nproviding our Armed Forces with the direction and resources necessary \nto carry out their difficult responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deep appreciation to the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, who has been most helpful \nin every way in bringing this bill to passage. He is a great leader of \nwhom the Senate can be proud.\n  I would also like to thank all the Senators from both sides of the \ncommittee and the entire committee staff, and I commend them for their \ndedication and support. In particular, I would like to thank personally \nmy staff director, Gen. Dick Reynard, for his fine work, and Gen. \nArnold Punaro, the staff director for the minority. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of the committee staff be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. We have achieved a number of important successes in \nthis bill, and I commend my colleagues for their good judgment. Among \nthese are:\n  Adding $7 billion to the administration's budget request to \nrevitalize the procurement, and research and development accounts which \nare the core of future readiness;\n\n[[Page S 12676]]\n\n  Passing the Missile Defense Act which initiates a policy to deploy a \nnational missile defense system, and prohibits inaccurate \ninterpretation of the ABM Treaty which would serve to limit theater \nmissile defense systems;\n  Correcting the erosion in nuclear weapons capabilities by reasserting \nthat the primary responsibility of the Department of Energy is to \nstrengthen the strategic stockpile;\n  Directing improvements and modifications in nuclear weapons \nproduction facilities and supporting important initiatives at the \nnuclear weapons laboratories;\n  Adequately funding current readiness while reducing funding for\n   nondefense programs;\n\n  Significantly improving quality of life programs for our troops and \ntheir families, including funds for housing, facilities, and real \nproperty maintenance;\n  Approving a 2.4-percent pay raise for military members and a 5.2-\npercent increase in basic allowance for quarters, and achieving COLA \nequity for retirees;\n  Providing funding for DOD and DOE environmental programs;\n  Establishing a dental insurance program for the selected reserves and \nan income protection insurance program for self-employed reservists who \nare mobilized;\n  Providing funding for essential equipment for the Active, Guard, and \nReserve components.\n  Once again I thank Senator Nunn, Senator Dole, the members of the \ncommittee, and the staff. I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                MINORITY\n\n       Dick Combs, Chris Cowart, Rick DeBobes, John Douglass, Andy \n     Effron, Jan Gordon, Creighton Greene, P.T.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nhis summation of this bill. As he said, there are many important \nfeatures in this bill. I supported the bill in the final form that it \npassed. I think there have been dramatic improvements made on the \nfloor.\n  The Corps SAM Program has been restored, which is an important part \nof our overall theater missile defense capability. The national missile \ndefense language has been, I think, made much more acceptable and \ncompatible with America's security interests. That has been done on an \namendment we passed this morning. An important program on the junior \nROTC that had been cut has now been restored. The civil-military \nlanguage has been modified and, in my opinion, strengthened, and some \nof the problems there have been corrected. The humanitarian and \ndisaster assistance, which had been cut, has been partially restored, \nwhich is important. And there have been very significant changes made \non the floor in the Department of Energy section.\n  We need to ensure that the conference maintains the Senate approach \nin these areas. We also have other challenges in the conference. I \nthink too much has been cut out of defense research, even in our bill. \nThe TRP Program has been cut in ways that I think need to be reexamined \nin conference, in close consultation with Secretary of Defense Perry, \nwho probably knows more about this program than any person in America \nand has spent an enormous amount of his Secretary of Defense time and \nenergy in making sure that this program is successfully implemented.\n  Also, I think there is too much micromanagement of the ballistic \nmissile defense accounts in our bill and in the House bill, and that \nneeds to be addressed in conference.\n  We have some serious challenges on the House bill that are going to \nbe difficult to work out when we get to conference, including language \non abortion, including language on HIV, including command and control \nof U.S. forces participating in multilateral organizations, including \npeacekeeping and contingency operations, as well as some of their \nlanguage--and perhaps, from their point of view, some of our language--\non missile defense and other programs.\n  My final assessment is that we have a bill here that has been \nimproved on the floor, that we have an opportunity to work on and make \nfurther improvements on in conference, working in good faith with the \nHouse. We have a lot of high hurdles to clear if we are going to have \nthis bill become law this year, based not on what I have been told \nformally but on what I have heard informally from the White House and \nfrom the Department of Defense. But I have seen a lot of high hurdles \nin the past and I have seen those high hurdles overcome by people \nworking in good faith for the national security interests of our \ncountry. So it is my hope that, with a cooperative spirit and a \nconstructive approach, we will be able to work with our House conferees \nand with the administration to see that the Defense authorization bill \nbecomes law this year. That remains a serious challenge, but I think it \nis one that we must all strive to meet.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina and all of his staff and all \nof the staff on the Democratic side and all the members of the \ncommittee for a very, I think, commendable effort. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me first of all congratulate the \nmanagers. This is a major piece of legislation that is always very \ndifficult to bring to a conclusion. But it has been done because of the \nleadership of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, and the cooperation of the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn. They have worked together to bring it together, \nas have other Senators, particularly Senators Warner and Cohen on this \nside, who have just resolved a very important issue by a vote of 85 to \n13. In my view, that compromise should have been passed by that \nlopsided margin. There is still a conference. They can still make other \nchanges.\n  But I congratulate all the members of the committee and members of \ntheir staffs for what I think is an excellent bill. We just heard the \nSenator from Georgia address some of the concerns that were resolved. \nThe Senator from South Carolina addressed some of the concerns earlier. \nNow it goes to conference. I think, again, it indicates we are making \nprogress in the Senate. Plus the appropriations bill will be ready for \npassage as soon as the House acts on it. So as far as the defense area \nis concerned, I think we are in good shape on the Senate side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12649-5", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

If we can work out some agreement \nwhere we can have a vote fairly early tomorrow morning on the \nDemocratic welfare proposal--because it is my hope to \n\n[[Page S 12677]]\ncomplete action on the welfare bill by next Tuesday, and I think we are \nmaking progress on our side and I hope it is going to be a bipartisan \neffort before it is over. I hope we will have Democratic support. But \nwe would like to move forward and dispose of the Democratic proposal--\nby ``dispose,'' I mean either adopt it or not adopt it, that would be \ndisposition; hopefully not adopt it--and then to move on to amendments, \nif necessary, and I assume some will be necessary, and then complete \naction by next Tuesday.\n  I think we have now completed action on seven appropriations bills. \nThere are no other appropriations bills now ready for consideration. We \nmay try a two-track system--I will discuss that with the Democratic \nleader--so we can keep abreast of the House on appropriations bills and \nhave all appropriations bills in the President's hands by October 1.\n  So it may mean some late, late, late evenings.

Mr. President, I wonder if we could all join in thanking \nthe distinguished majority leader for his assistance on getting this \nvery important bill through. There were times just before the recess \nwhen the list of amendments was as long as your arm. Together with our \ndistinguished chairman and the ranking member, and, indeed, the \nDemocratic leader, we were able to condense an almost impossible list \nof amendments and proceed to this bill and set a time certain for a \nvote. I think there is a great value in the Senate when we can \nestablish a time when Senators can expect to have a vote on a major \npiece of legislation like this.\n  I congratulate the distinguished chairman, Chairman Thurmond, of \nSouth Carolina. I think the people of his State can take great pride.\n  This is your first bill--although having served on the committee \nthese many, many years--this is the first bill on which your name is on \nit as chairman of the committee. It was your leadership that enabled \nthis bill to be passed right on time. That leadership started in the \nvery early days of the hearings--first at the subcommittee level, then \nat the full committee, through markup, with the able assistance of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Mr. Nunn of Georgia.\n  So, I congratulate our leadership. We are fortunate, and I think I \nmay say to both, that they carried it on in the finest traditions \nestablished many years ago by your predecessors, both as chairman and \nranking member, in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to add my congratulations \nto the committee chairman and the ranking member of our committee for \nthe superb job they did in this authorization bill. Many people came \ntogether to make this bill happen. I think the chairman provided \nleadership. He stood for a strong national defense. It was a bipartisan \neffort on behalf of the full committee to try to make sure that when \nour young men and women sign up to protect our freedom, they will have \nthe training and the backing of our country to do the job. That is what \nthe chairman decided we were going to do. There was not a week that \nwent by that the chairman did not talk to his fellow members and \ncolleagues about the importance of keeping our strong national defense.\n  So I want to commend him for the great job that he did. I am proud to \nbe a member of the Armed Services Committee. I also want to commend the \nleadership of Senator Warner, the No. 2 person on the committee, who \nwas deputized by the chairman to meet with people on the very important \nissue of theater missile defense, because this is an important long-\nterm issue for our country. Senator Warner led the effort, along with \nSenator Cohen, Senator Nunn, and Senator Levin, to make sure that we \ndid have a strong commitment to our own defenses so that no matter what \nmight happen in the field of technology in the next 10 years, we are \ngoing to protect our country and our shores.\n  So I commend Senator Thurmond, Senator Nunn, Senator Warner, and all \nof those who made this very important bill happen, and I will look \nforward to working with them in the conference committee to maintain \nthe freedom and the protection and security of our country in the fine \ntradition that we have had.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nTexas for her kind remarks. She is a very prominent and able member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and does a great job. We appreciate \nall that she has done in connection with this particular bill.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Warner for the fine job he has done, \nand Senator Nunn for his fine cooperation and assistance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the chairman with respect to our distinguished colleague, \nthe Senator from Texas. I am privileged to have her as a member of my \nsubcommittee. She certainly looks out for the interests of not only the \nUnited States, but certainly the people of Texas.\n  I wish to recognize the occupant of the chair, the Presiding Officer, \nwho was very helpful throughout this piece of legislation, although not \na member of our committee, primarily because the senior Senator is a \nmember and, therefore, he cannot be. But we look forward to working \nwith him in the course of the conference on a number of issues, \nprimarily the issue of missile defense on which he is an acknowledged \nexpert.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Pryor is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

It was an amendment offered by Senator Nunn, \nSenator Bingaman, and myself to restore some common sense to the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995.\n  As my colleagues know, the Missile Defense Act of 1995 contains, \namong other things, an aggressive program to develop and deploy theater \nmissile defenses in the form of sophisticated missile interceptors.\n  Our amendment to the DOD bill will help ensure that these \ninterceptors are tested properly so we know how the taxpayer's money is \nbeing spent on these programs.\n  If we want to protect ourselves from the threat of missile attacks, \nwe should make sure these interceptor programs are capable of \ndestroying incoming missiles.\n  I was disappointed that this bill originally deleted a provision \npassed by Congress 2 years ago that would help us monitor these \nprograms through a series of live-fire tests.\n  I believe it would be dangerous for the Senate to show a lack of \ninterest in monitoring the progress of our theater missile defense \ninterceptors. Our primary concern should be in making sure they are \nmaturing properly.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization [BMDO] and the Pentagon's Director of \nOperational Testing agreed to work together in an effort to help us \nproperly emphasize the importance of testing our TMD interceptor \nprograms.\n  I applaud the Director of the BMDO, Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, and the \nDirector of Operational Testing, Phil Coyle, for working cooperatively \nin this effort.\n  Mr. President, this is a responsible amendment that asks the Pentagon \nto periodically assess the maturity of each interceptor program, and to \nadvise the Congress on the progress we're making. It also asks the \nSecretary of Defense to certify to Congress that these programs work \nproperly before they enter into full-rate production.\n Finally, this amendment will help prevent the wasteful practice of \nbuilding weapon systems that do not work as expected.\n\n  This concept, Mr. President, is commonly referred to as ``Fly Before \nYou Buy.'' Fly Before You Buy means that new weapons must demonstrate \ntheir progress and maturity in operational \n\n[[Page S 12678]]\ntesting so that we do not waste money buying systems that do not work, \nthat give us a false sense of security.\n  I am proud to say, Mr. President, that with this amendment, the \nweapon developers in the BMDO office and the Pentagon's testers have \nworked together to reach an agreement on the proposed language.\n  This is indeed a remarkable accomplishment that the entire U.S. \nSenate and the Congress should applaud.\n  This is exactly the type of productive cooperation that Senator \nGrassley, Senator Roth, and I envisioned when we wrote the legislation \ncreating the independent testing office back in 1983: Developers and \ntesters working together for a common goal. Unfortunately, for many \nyears, the developers have refused to allow operational testers to \nmonitor their progress. Too often in the Pentagon, the word ``test'' is \nconsidered a four-letter word.\n  This is exactly the scenario we should avoid with our interceptor \nprograms.\n  We have already spent well over $5 billion on theater missile defense \ninterceptors. In this bill, an additional $2 billion is authorized for \nthese programs. And the total costs are projected to exceed $22 \nbillion.\n  As we continue spending more and more on ballistic missile defenses, \nlet us not forget the most basic and most important element of these \nprograms--making sure they work.\n  I wish to once again thank Gen. Malcolm O'Neill for his cooperation \non this amendment. Also, special thanks to Mr. Phil Coyle, the \nPresident's testing czar, for his outstanding leadership, and for his \nhelp in seeing that the Pentagon practices Fly Before You Buy by \ntesting new weapons before they are produced.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for accepting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I want to bring special attention to a \ncooperative satellite development program between the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy and Weber State University located in Ogden, UT. Both \ninstitutions, I hasten to emphasize, Mr. President, specialize in \nundergraduate teaching and undergraduate research.\n  The Joint Air Force Academy-Weber State Program is known as \n``JAWSAT.'' The Air Force Academy satellite will be built by Weber \nState, which is the first undergraduate institution in the world to \ndesign, build, and launch satellites. Weber State began building \nsatellites in 1990, and has launched them in low-earth orbits. The \nWEBERSAT is the product of the Weber State University Center for \naerospace technology. The satellite continues to orbit Earth, providing \ninvaluable learning experiences for the student managers at Weber \nState. Currently, WEBERSAT provides the students at the campus command \ncenter with such benefits as color photographs of the Earth, data \nacquired by a high spectrometer on the satellite, and information on \nmicrometeor impacts that is derived from sensor equipment also aboard \nWEBERSAT.\n  It was a natural choice for the Air Force Academy to tap into Weber \nState's expertise for building and deploying a satellite to train our \nfuture Air Force leaders in satellite use and management. We, in this \nbody, in the midst of a debate on Defense authorizations and \nappropriations, recognize the critical importance of satellite \ntechnology in defense systems employment. I especially commend both \nHouses of Congress for supporting JAWSATS.\n  Mr. President, this program is an example of the new directions that \nour universities are taking in bringing undergraduate training, \neducation, and research to the highest possible levels of achievement. \nI thank my colleagues for their support of JAWSAT.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12678-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12678-S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  SMALL BUSINESS AND SUPERFUND REFORM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wanted to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the concerns of several prominent South Dakotans regarding \nthe Superfund Program.\n  Like many of my colleagues, during the August recess, I spend \nconsiderable time back in South Dakota talking to my constituents. \nWhile in South Dakota, one issue came up on a number of occasions: \nSuperfund reform. This issue is important to small business men and \nwomen throughout South Dakota. In fact, several South Dakota small \nbusiness leaders just launched a new coalition, South Dakotans for \nSuperfund reform. Recently, the coalition leadership's comments on \nSuperfund, and an op-ed from Rob Wheeler of Lemmon, SD, were published \nin local newspapers in the State. I ask that these articles be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We all agree that the current Superfund Program does \nnot work. It is one of the most expensive environmental programs on the \nbooks. Despite the vast amounts of taxpayer dollars that are poured \ninto the Superfund, the program has a very low success rate. One of the \nprime causes of this low success rate is a confusing and costly \nliability system. This system is unfair to small businesses and \nencourages excessive and costly litigation.\n  I am encouraged by the draft proposal drawn up by my esteemed \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Smith. As chairman of the \nSuperfund, Waste Control, and Risk Management Subcommittee, he has \nassumed the daunting task of rewriting the existing Superfund law. I \nlook forward to working with him to create a new Superfund law based on \nfairness and common sense. We should not insist on a system that calls \non small businesses that complied with past laws and regulations to \nshoulder the burden of cleaning up our hazardous waste sites.\n  I believe these newspaper articles represent not only the concerns of \nSouth Dakota small business leaders, but of all small business men and \nwomen across the country. They are the innovators who collectively make \nour economic engine run. For that reason, we must take these concerns \nto heart as we reexamine the Superfund Program.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        [From the Argus Leader (Sioux Falls, SD), Sept. 5, 1995]\n\n           Message to Clinton Clear--Reform Superfund Program\n\n                          (By Rob L. Wheeler)\n\n       I attended the White House Conference on Small Business in \n     June--one of about 2,000 entrepreneurs and business owners \n     from across the country invited to Washington by the Clinton \n     administration.\n       At the end of the four-day event, the White House asked us \n     to put together a list of the most important steps the \n     federal government could take to really help small \n     businesses. One of the top recommendations may come as a \n     surprise: overhauling the Superfund program.\n       Superfund was created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the \n     nation's worst hazardous waste dumps. Fifteen years have \n     passed since then and more than 1,300 Superfund sites have \n     been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Over \n     $20 billion in government and private sector funds has been \n     spent. But only 6 percent of those sites have been cleaned up \n     completely.\n       With a record of failure like that, it's no mystery why the \n     Superfund is nearly universally regarded--by \n     environmentalists and business owners alike--as the single \n     most ineffective piece of environmental legislation in \n     history.\n       Why is the Superfund such a hazard for small businesses?\n\n[[Page S 12679]]\n\n       It starts with the Superfund's liability scheme called \n     ``strict, retroactive, joint and several liability.'' \n     Retroactive liability means a small business owner can be \n     held responsible for action that took place before the law \n     has passed. Even if you didn't act negligently, even if you \n     followed every law and regulation completely--you're still on \n     the hook. Joint and several liability means the company can \n     be forced to pay 100 percent of the cost of cleaning up a \n     Superfund site even though it was only responsible for a \n     small fraction of the pollution.\n       With marching orders like that, you can guess the EPA's \n     standard operating procedure: Find any organizations even \n     remotely connected with a Superfund site; then drag them into \n     court to make them pay the clean-up bill. So far, over 20,000 \n     small businesses, hospitals, towns, and community groups--\n     even a Girl Scout troop--have been stamped as ``polluters'' \n     by the EPA and face potentially crippling legal liability.\n       All that litigation costs money--a lot of money. More than \n     20 percent of all Superfund dollars get spent in the \n     courtroom, not to clean up the environment. That translates \n     into an incredible $6.7 million in lawyers' fees and court \n     costs per Superfund site. No wonder the EPA keeps about 500 \n     lawyers on staff just to work on Superfund liability issues.\n       So our first recommendation for Superfund reform is \n     repealing retroactive liability for waste disposal prior to \n     1987, when small businesses were first required to keep \n     detailed disposal records. The conference also recommended \n     changing ``joint and several liability'' to proportional \n     liability, so those liable would only pay to clean up what \n     they're responsible for.\n       Another recommendation was that Congress should require the \n     EPA to use ``sound science and realistic risk assessments'' \n     in identifying toxic sites and establishing cleanup \n     standards. That just sounds like common sense; you'd thing \n     that danger to health and safety would be the only criteria \n     for selecting Superfund sites. But you'd be wrong. Today's \n     EPA standards are so seriously flawed that according to a \n     recent federal government study, more than half of the so-\n     called hazardous sites on the EPA's National Priorities List \n     don't even pose a threat to human health.\n       There are several other reforms on our list, but they all \n     share a common goal: creating a new Superfund that focuses on \n     cleaning up the environment, not harassing innocent \n     businesses. These reforms have a good chance of passing \n     Congress, but the Clinton administration--which asked for our \n     recommendations to begin with--is now resisting.\n       Recently, a group of business and civic leaders from across \n     the state got together to form South Dakotans for Superfund \n     Reform--a grass-roots coalition dedicated to the type of \n     Superfund reform we proposed to the White House. Our goal is \n     to work with South Dakota's elected representatives in \n     Washington to fix Superfund this year.\n       There are currently four Superfund sites in South Dakota, \n     including one that has been on the EPA's list for more than \n     10 years. And 15 small businesses and other organizations in \n     South Dakota have been targeted by the EPA. Unless Clinton \n     and Congress fix Superfund, those busineses--and the jobs \n     they provide to South Dakotans--will remain in jeopardy.\n       The Clinton White House should be on notice. If it's \n     serious about helping small business, it needs to stop \n     blocking Superfund reform. Washington conferences on small \n     business are fine. But real action speaks a lot louder.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Rapid City Journal, Aug. 24, 1995]\n\n                 S.D. Group Criticizes Liability Rules\n\n                             (By Dan Daly)\n\n       The 1980 Superfund law was a good idea gone awry, according \n     to a group of business people who launched a political \n     coalition called South Dakotans for Superfund Reform.\n       The environmental cleanup program has become expensive, \n     ineffective and unfair, coalition members said Wednesday.\n       Just 15 percent of the nation's 1,355 sites on the \n     Superfund priority list have been cleaned up, according to \n     the group's literature, and half of Superfund dollars go to \n     lawyers and regulators.\n       But the group's main complaint was about the retroactive \n     liability rules that place blame for pollution--and the job \n     of paying for cleanup--on companies and landowners ``remotely \n     associated with a hazardous waste site,'' according to the \n     group.\n       ``The reality is that this . . . involves innocent \n     landowners, innocent new businesses that come onto a site \n     unknowing about these things,'' said Carol Rae, state \n     chairman of the coalition's steering committee. ``What we \n     want to do is establish reasonable rules and limits on \n     natural resources damages.\n       ``It's not that any of us here are out to say that we do \n     not want environmental protection or to be responsible \n     corporate or private citizens,'' said Rae, vice president of \n     external affairs for Chiron Corp., parent company of Magnum \n     Diamond Corp. in Rapid City.\n       None of the business people at Wednesday's news conference \n     are themselves liable for Superfund cleanup projects. In \n     fact, only a handful of South Dakota sites have been on the \n     Superfund list.\n       Their interest, said Rae, is as taxpayers and regulated \n     businesses.\n       Rae, Kroetch and Rob Wheeler of Wheeler Manufacturing in \n     Lemmon, who was also at Wednesday's news conference, served \n     together as delegates to the recent White House Conference on \n     Small Business.\n       Rae said the conference delegates identified some 2,000 \n     issues important to small business. Changes in Superfund \n     laws, she said, ranked fifth on the list.\n       She and seven of the group's steering committee members \n     held a news conference in Rapid City Wednesday to outline \n     their position. Members ranged from Richard Krull, manager of \n     the Merillat Industries particle board plant in Rapid City, \n     to Art Kroetch, president of Scotchman Industries in Philip.\n       The group itself was organized by Steve Knuth of Sioux \n     Falls, who is working for the National Coalition for \n     Superfund Reform. Knuth formed a similar group earlier this \n     year to push for changes in product liability laws.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        [From the Argus Leader (Sioux Falls, SD), Aug. 25, 1995]\n\n                Superfund Reformers Start Group in S.D.\n\n       South Dakotans who want Congress to change the nation's \n     hazardous waste cleanup program, called Superfund, have \n     organized to promote reform.\n       South Dakotans for Superfund Reform represents people of \n     various business and community backgrounds with ``the desire \n     to see an end to Superfund's unfair and punitive liability \n     system,'' said committee chair Carol Rae of Rapid City.\n       The group announced its plans Thursday at a Sioux Falls \n     news conference.\n       Congress enacted the Superfund law in 1980.

Mr. President, I join with all Americans to applaud the \ntremendous achievement of Baltimore Orioles shortstop, Cal Ripken, Jr. \nTonight, Cal will play in his 2,131st consecutive major league baseball \ngame, eclipsing the previous record set by the immortal Yankee great, \nLou Gehrig, in 1939.\n  I commend Cal not just for the singular distinction of being \nbaseball's all-time iron man, but the way he achieved it: with class \nand with dignity. His approach to baseball is the approach hard-working \nAmericans take to their professions--each and every day he goes out and \ntries to do his best not just for himself but for his coworkers, his \nteam. He doesn't try to be flashy or flamboyant. He quietly and \nconsistently goes out and gets the job done. And for nearly 13 seasons \nwithout missing a game, he has done just that--he got the job done.\n  Cal also recognizes that being a baseball player also means being a \nrole model to millions of youngsters. Cal plays his life off the field \nthe same way he plays on the field--with tireless energy and quiet \nexcellence. He devotes time to numerous charities in his community. He \nspends countless hours signing autographs and working with young people \non how to be both good ballplayers and good citizens. Most important, \nCal Ripken is a husband and father of two children. When asked about \nhow important this day is to him, Cal was said to have replied that it \nwas indeed a big day because he was driving his daughter, Rachel, to \nher first day at school.\n  I commend Cal Ripken, Jr., and wish him well. Tonight, he will make \nhistory as baseball's most consistent, hardworking ballplayer. For \nmyself and on behalf of all South Dakotans, I applaud him for that. I \nalso applaud him for demonstrating that same consistency, that same \nhardworking spirit off the field as well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12679-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12679-S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to correct a statement which I \nmade on the floor in the course of our previous 2 days of debate, the \nbeginning of debate, on this legislation. I rise to not only correct my \nstatement but to offer an apology to the Senate if I have misled \nanyone, which I certainly did not intend, nor did anyone.\n  On that occasion, I offered a chart, as you see here, indicating the \nproportion of children who received aid to families with dependent \nchildren in 1992.\n  This data was prepared for us at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Mr. Wendell Primus is responsible there, and mistakes were \nmade. He found those mistakes and called them to our attention.\n  In the meantime, the Washington Times had written a very fine \neditorial pointing to this data, saying, ``My God, if there is ever \nevidence this system is failing, it will be found in these tables.'' \nThese bar charts are easily translated into tables. Then we had to \ninform the Washington Times that the numbers were scrambled. At one \npoint, it was no more than a simple typing error in a computer \nprintout.\n  But we now have the correct numbers, and I would like to introduce \nthem to the Senate at this time, as against the data I presented on \nAugust 8. The new figures are the corrected numbers for 1993.\n  The data are the estimated proportion of children receiving AFDC, \nthat is aid to families with dependent children, title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act, in 1993, which is our last count. As you can see, Mr. \nPresident, if you were to recall the numbers originally, the city of \nLos Angeles was recorded as having almost two-thirds of its children on \nwelfare at one point or over the course of a year. That involved a \nmistake between the city and the county, not something I am sure \nhappens frequently. Los Angeles drops to a point where I can almost \nsay, Mr. President, that in 1993 only 38 percent of the children in Los \nAngeles were on AFDC at some point or other in the year.\n  Think what it means to say ``only'' 38 percent, which is to say quite \nliterally, by Federal regulation--and my friend, the distinguished \nchairman, will be talking about some of those regulations. I see he has \nsome stacked on his desk. I am reminded, those are historic desks. If \nthey were to collapse under the load of Federal regulation, the \nhistorical society would have something to say about that.\n  But the idea under AFDC regulations, there are not too many \nrequirements of the AFDC Program. One is a limit on assets, and the \nlimit on assets is $1,000; $1,000 for households, which is to say these \nare households that are paupers and have to stay paupers as a condition \nof staying alive. If you said only 38 percent of the children in our \ncity were paupers during the course of the year, 20 years ago the \npublic would say, ``What?''\n  In Detroit, it is 67 percent. Those figures were adjusted. We found \nthat Los Angeles went down. New York went up; 39 percent of all \nchildren at one point of the year. New York is our largest city with \nabout 7.5 million persons. We have at any given time rather more than a \nmillion persons on welfare, which is AFDC plus home relief, numbers not \nknown in the depths of the Great Depression. During the Great \nDepression, in 1937, when you probably had about as much as 30 percent \nunemployment, there were half a million persons receiving home relief \nin New York City. Today, in the aftermath of 50 years of economic \ngrowth, we look up and there are more than a million. And 39 percent of \nour children are on AFDC at one point or another in the course of the \nyear.\n  In Philadelphia, it is 57 percent. In San Diego, it is 30 percent. \nThe San Diego figures and the Los Angeles figures are close in that \nrange. Texas has, generally speaking, a low rate--San Antonio, 20 \npercent, and Houston, 22 percent. There is a certain uniformity there. \nThe city of Phoenix, AZ, has as prosperous an appearance as any city on \nEarth. It grows, I have been told, by a square mile a day. The southern \nArizona project brings in water. Barry Goldwater provides a welcome and \npeople cannot wait to move out there. There are green lawns where I \nthink there should not be green lawns. That is desert. But that is \nanother matter. In Phoenix, 18 percent of the children are paupers at \none point during the year.\n  These numbers can be elaborated. To what exact purpose, I would be \nhesitant to say. But we do know that Senator Daschle's legislation, as \nwell as Senator Dole's and Senator Packwood's, does address this \nquestion of putting children on supplemental security income as a mode \nof welfare benefits.\n  If you combine AFDC with SSI in 1993, you get yet higher rates. You \nget 67 percent for Detroit. You see that it goes from 54 percent AFDC \nwhen you add SSI. It is a large number. I think it is the case that the \nnumber of children receiving SSI has grown by about 400 percent in the \nlast decade. This is not because there are 400 percent more children \ndisabled. We have had administrative interpretations of statutes which \nincrease the number of children in this category. Philadelphia gets 59 \npercent; San Diego, 30 percent; Los Angeles, 38 percent; Baltimore, 56 \npercent; New York, 40 percent. And so it goes.\n  These are horrendous numbers, and they ask for--they demand--some \nlevel of interpretation. The Washington Times, in a perfectly fair-\nminded editorial--to my mind, a fair-minded editorial--had commented on \nthese numbers that are overstated in the case of Los Angeles and \nunderstated in the case of New York. It had this in its editorial, \n``Welfare Shock.''\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this be printed in the \nRecord at this point, without the table.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 1, 1995]\n\n                             Welfare Shock\n\n       Having spent the better part of the past four decades \n     analyzing the statistical fallout of the welfare and \n     illegitimacy crises enveloping our great cities, Sen. Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan never has needed hyperbole to describe the \n     dreadful consequences of failed social policies. Perhaps that \n     is because the New York Democrat possesses the uncanny \n     ability to develop or cite pithy statistics that shock even \n     the most jaded welfare analyst, case-worker, senatorial \n     colleague or reporter.\n       Several weeks ago, Sen. Moynihan, appearing on one of the \n     ubiquitous Sunday morning interview shows, shocked his \n     questioners (and, undoubtedly, his television audience) by \n     revealing that nearly two-thirds of the children residing in \n     Los Angeles, the nation's second largest city, lived in \n     families relying on the basic welfare program, Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). To illustrate that \n     Los Angeles was not unique, he observed that nearly four of \n     every five (!) Detroit children received AFDC benefits.\n       The accompanying chart details the extent to which \n     residents in the 10 largest U.S. cities have become dependent \n     on AFDC--and the government. After about three decades of \n     fighting the War on Poverty, during which time more than $5.4 \n     trillion (in constant 1993 dollars) has been expended, \n     perhaps no single statistic offers more proof of the war's \n     unmitigated failure than the fact that federal and state \n     governments provide the financial \n\n[[Page S 12681]]\n     support of 38 percent of all children living in the country's 10 \n     largest cities.\n       How does one begin to address such a horrendous problem? \n     for all the talk among Democrats, particularly President \n     Clinton, about the need for increased spending for education \n     to help underwrite welfare reform, it's worth recalling that \n     real (inflation-adjusted) spending for elementary and \n     secondary education has dramatically escalated since the \n     federal government declared war on poverty. Indeed, some of \n     the highest per pupil expenditures occur in the largest \n     cities. Unfortunately, as spending increased, test scores \n     plummeted.\n       In a more serious tone, Mr. Moynihan approvingly cited the \n     1966 report on the Equality of Educational Opportunity (the \n     Coleman Report), which ``determined that after a point there \n     is precious little association between school resources and \n     school achievement. The resources that matter are those the \n     student brings to the school, including community traditions \n     that value education. Or don't.''\n       Sen. Moynihan has offered his own welfare-reform plan, \n     which, unlike any Republican plan in the House and Senate, \n     would retain AFDC's entitlement status without placing any \n     time restrictions on recipients. Despite the underwhelming \n     success of federal job-training and job-placement programs, \n     his plan places great emphasis on more of the same. Attacking \n     the Republicans' proposals to cancel welfare's entitlement \n     status and enforce time restrictions, Sen. Moynihan frets \n     that ``we don't know enough'' to design programs that attempt \n     to influence the behavior of poor people.\n       Take another look at the figures in the chart provided by \n     the senator. They represent a small fraction of the \n     statistical indictment against the failed welfare policies of \n     the liberal welfare state. Tinkering around the edges of such \n     failure without seeking to change the behavior that three \n     decades of the War on Poverty have produced, will surely not \n     solve any of the many social problems that accompany \n     dependency on the scale depicted in the chart. That much we \n     do know.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the point of the editorial is, good God, \nwhat happened to our children? Can the present system be as bad as the \ndata depict? If so, let us be rid of that system directly. I wrote to \nthem informing them that we had new data, and it was not significantly \ndifferent. Well, in the case of Los Angeles, it was; that should be \nmade clear. Otherwise, it was in this range. I wrote a letter in which \nI simply made the point that--well, first of all, I submitted the \ncorrect new data, which took a slightly different view from the \neditorial. It was a very different view from the editorial in the \nWashington Times.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter and the subsequent editorial \nwith the corrected data be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 5, 1995]\n\n             The AFDC Numbers: Bad Enough, But Not That Bad\n\n       Regarding the Sept. 1 editorial ``Welfare shock,'' The \n     Washington Times is entirely correct in stating that the \n     information on AFDC caseloads I presented in the August \n     welfare debate in the Senate was mistaken. We received the \n     data from the Department of Health and Human Services on Aug. \n     4. I found the numbers hard to believe--that bad?--and called \n     the deputy assistant secretary responsible to ask if he would \n     check. He did and called back to confirm.\n       On Aug. 23, however, with the Senate in recess, Mr. Wendell \n     E. Primus, the deputy assistant secretary who provided the \n     data, wrote to say that there had indeed been a \n     miscalculation. It was a perfectly honest mistake, honorably \n     acknowledged and corrected. I will place his letter in the \n     Congressional Record today.\n       The new numbers are sufficiently horrendous. The proportion \n     of the child population on AFDC or Supplemental Security \n     income in the course of a year in Los Angeles is 38 percent. \n     In New York, 40 percent. In Chicago, 49 percent. In \n     Philadelphia, 59 percent. In Detroit, 67 percent. My \n     contention is that things have gotten so out of hand that \n     cities and states cannot possibly handle the problem on their \n     own. Thirty years ago, certainly. No longer. Mr. Hugh Price \n     of the National Urban League suggests that we will see a \n     reenactment of deinstitutionalization of the mental patients \n     which led so directly to the problem of the homeless. I was \n     in the Oval Office on Oct. 23, 1963 when President Kennedy \n     signed that bill, his last public bill signing ceremony. He \n     gave me the pen. I have had it framed and keep it on my wall. \n     Premium non nocere.\n\n                                      Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n\n                                                     U.S. Senator,\n                                                       Washington.\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 5, 1995]\n\n                     Charting the State of Welfare\n\n       Even by the appalling standards and results of U.S. welfare \n     policy, the chart that appeared in this space last Friday \n     exaggerated the depths of the situation that prevails in some \n     of this nation's largest cities.\n       Last month Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York Democrat, \n     appeared on the floor of the Senate citing statistics showing \n     that nearly two out of three children in Los Angeles and \n     nearly four out of five children in Detroit lived in \n     households receiving the government's basic welfare grant, \n     Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). At the \n     request of The Washington Times' editorial page, Sen. \n     Moynihan's office faxed a copy of a chart listing the 10 \n     largest U.S. cities and the percentage of each city's \n     children relying on AFDC, which was developed by the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Regrettably, \n     the information was incorrect.\n       Nearby is a chart with updated, expanded, and presumably \n     correct, information that HHS subsequently sent to Sen. \n     Moynihan's office, which then forwarded it to the editorial \n     page. The revised chart offers both a snapshot of welfare \n     dependency of children in our largest cities (at a ``point in \n     time'') and a more expansive statistic incorporating all \n     children whose families relied on AFDC during any portion of \n     an entire year. Clearly, neither classification places Los \n     Angeles or Detroit in nearly as dreadful a position as \n     conveyed by HHS's initial, incorrect tallies. It should also \n     be noted, however, that the earlier chart understated the \n     problem of pervasive welfare dependency in other cities: New \n     York and Philadelphia, for example. The revised chart offers \n     no solace to anybody intersted in the future of our great \n     cities and the children who live in them.\n\n                    ESTIMATED RATES OF AFDC CASELOADS                   \n                      [In major cities (Feb. 1993)]                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Percentage   Percentage\n                                                of children  of children\n                     State                       on AFDC at    on AFDC  \n                                                 a point in    within a \n                                                    time         year   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew York......................................           30           39\nLos Angeles...................................           29           38\nChicago.......................................           36           46\nDetroit.......................................           50           67\nPhiladelphia..................................           44           57\nSan Diego.....................................           23           30\nHouston.......................................           18           22\nPhoenix.......................................           15           18\nSan Antonio...................................           14           21\nDallas........................................           16           20\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of Health and Human Services.                        \n\n       It's been 30 years since the federal government initiated \n     its so-called War on Poverty. During that time more than $5 \n     trillion was expended fighting it. What has been \n     accomplished? As the Senate reconsiders the various welfare-\n     reform proposals during the next few weeks, let us keep in \n     mind that anything less than revolutionary in scope is likely \n     to have little long-term impact on these depressing \n     statistics and the numerous pathologies and deviancies that \n     derive from them.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, here is the point I made, and some will \nnot agree--probably most will not agree. Yet, I have been at this long \nenough to recognize this. The Times takes the view that any system \nwhich has produced this result is so bad it must be profoundly changed, \ndismantled, and done away with. Indeed, the legislation before us on \nthis side of the aisle--the majority leader's legislation--would in \nfact put an end to this system. It abolishes title 4(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act of 1935. It makes a block grant which is sent down to the \nStates, based on their present Federal benefit, and leaves it that the \nStates are free to do what they will. I will not get into it at this \nmoment.\n  But the States are not free to do what they will, anyway. No State \nhas to have a welfare program. No, you do not have to have a welfare \nprogram. You do not have to provide more than--you can provide $1 a \nmonth per child or $1,000 a month per child. The idea that there are \nbig Federal regulations is mistaken. It is not that the Federal \nGovernment has not sought to do a lot of regulating, but the statutes \nare relatively spare. With a waiver, you can do virtually anything you \nwant. And to say it is your job, now that this system has failed, to \ntake it over, what that does is disengage the Federal Government.\n  No child is entitled to welfare benefits. The State can provide that \na child receives benefits, or it can do otherwise. But under the Social \nSecurity Act, if a State provides welfare benefits, the Federal \nGovernment provides a matching grant. It will match 50 percent, up to \nabout 79 percent, at this point. It used to be as high as 82 percent in \nthe Southern States.\n  My point is that 30 years ago, when we first picked up the onset of \nthis extraordinary demographic social change, you could have made the \ncase: Let the States do it; let the cities do it. You could have made \nthat case. You \n\n[[Page S 12682]]\ncannot make it today, in my view. This is too much. This is beyond the \ncapacity of State governments and city governments. They will be \noverwhelmed, and soon we will be wondering, what did we do?\n  Mr. Hugh Price, the relatively new, recently appointed, director of \nthe National Urban League, made an important comment on the ``Charlie \nRose Show''--not a pronouncement, just a comment. He said if we do what \nis proposed and put time limits--the President, at Georgetown \nUniversity in 1991, when he began his Presidential campaign, put out a \n2-year time limit--he said that we will have an effect similar to the \ndeinstitutionalization of our mental institutions that began in the \n1950's and culminated in Federal legislation in 1963.\n  I am going to take a moment, if I can, just to talk about that, \nbecause I think Mr. Price hit upon a brilliant analogy--the appearance \non our streets of homeless persons sleeping in doorways, sleeping in \nbus stations. You do not have to do more than walk down Constitution \nAvenue from the Capitol, not four blocks from here, and you will find, \nin the dead of winter, people sleeping on grates. It has happened \neverywhere. It has happened, I dare to say, in Portland, OR. I say to \nmy friend, the chairman of our committee, that Portland, OR, will not \nappear on this list. It is a very interesting story, and it is a very \npowerful cautionary tale.\n  I was present at the creation, 1955, in the spring, in the State \ncapitol in Albany, N.Y. Averell Harriman was being introduced to the \nperson who was to be nominated as the commissioner of mental hygiene, a \nwonderful doctor named Paul Hoch. He had been head of the New York \nPsychiatric Institute, a great research analyst. He had been chosen by \nthe late Jonathan Bingham, then secretary to the Governor, later Member \nof the House of Representatives.\n  As has happened before in history, the Governor was playing a role in \na little drama that had been preconceived. Present also was the \ndirector of the budget, Paul H. Appleby, the eminent public servant of \nthe New Deal era, deputy director of the budget under President Truman. \nAlso present, notetaker, if you will, was the Senator from New York. I \nwas an assistant to Mr. Bingham.\n  The Governor greeted Dr. Hoch and said how pleased he was to learn \nthat he was willing to come and do this job, and Jonathan Bingham has \nrecommended him most particularly, as indeed Jack Bingham had done.\n  The Governor asked how were things going in that field. Doctor Hoch \nsaid, well, down at Rockland State Hospital, which is in Rockland \nCounty in the lower Hudson Valley, Dr. Nathan Kline had been working \nwith a chemical substance that had been derived from the root rauwolfia \nserpentina, used in medicine for 5 millennium. It calmed people down in \nthe Hindus Valley. German organic chemists had succeeded in reproducing \nit, and it was used on patients in Rockland State, and it had real \neffects. It was our first tranquilizer. It would come to be known as \nreserpine. The doctor said he thought it should be used systemwide.\n  At that time in the 1950's, mental health was one of our most visible \npublic issues. Every State legislature proposed every year, \nappropriated another bond issue to build another hospital. We projected \nthe time when half the population of New York State would be in a \nmental institution and the other half would be working in a mental \ninstitution--97,000 persons.\n  Today, Mr. President, there are about 6,000. We wanted them out, but \nwe did not care for them after they left.\n  I came to Washington in 1961 in the administration of President \nKennedy, who was much interested in this subject. A report of a joint \ncommission established by the Congress was waiting for us. In effect, \nit said, go with medication and deinstitutionalization.\n  The last public bill signing ceremony that John F. Kennedy conducted \nwas on October 23, 1963. He signed the Community Mental Health Center \nConstruction Act of 1963. He gave me a pen. I was present. I had worked \non the legislation, having had something in the background from Albany. \nWe were going to build 2,000 community mental health centers by the \nyear 1980, and one per 100,000 population, as the population grew.\n  We wanted our mental institutions, but we did not build the community \ncenters. We built about 400, the program got folded into another \nprogram, shifted around, and pretty soon people were thinking about \nsomething else and it quite disappeared from our minds.\n  Then the problem of homelessness appeared. With the unfailing \ncapacity for getting things wrong in my city of New York, an advocacy \ngroup grew up saying we have a problem here of a lack of affordable \nhousing. That is not what it was at all.\n  Schizophrenia--we knew in the 1960's there would be a constant \nincidence of that particular disorder in large populations. We did not \nhave quite the genetic information we have now. I do not speak beyond \nmy knowledge, but the statistical data was sufficient to say this is \nsomething that happens in Patagonia, it happens in Alaska, it happens \nin Bucharest, it happens in Los Angeles, all at about the same rate. \nThere it is. A puzzle, a great public failure.\n  My friend from Oregon will remember that during the brief interlude \nin which I was chairman of the Committee on Finance, the last New \nYorker was in 1849, and it may be another century and a half until the \nnext New Yorker was, but there were 2 years, not necessarily a shining \nmoment, but there it was. We were dealing with health care matters, as \nthe chairman will not soon forget. I had two things on our wall. One \nwas a small portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the \nTreasury, that great New Yorker. The other was the pen certificate \nwhich had the pen that President Kennedy gave me on that day in October \n1963, when we signed the Communities Mental Health Center Construction \nAct of 1963.\n  As I just said, ``Be very careful what you do.'' To cite Hippocrates, \nprimum non nocere. It is my contention, Mr. President, it would be my \nargument, I cannot demonstrate, I can simply make the case with numbers \nthis large, proportions this large, we dare not disconnect the Federal \nGovernment from this problem of our children.\n  The connection we made in 1935 when our resources were vastly fewer \nthan they are today, they will be overwhelmed. In a very little while \nas the time limits comes into effect, I estimate a 5-year time might \nput half a million children on the streets of New York City in 10 \nyears' time, and we will wonder where they came from. We will say, \n``Why are these children sleeping on grates? Why are they being picked \nup in the morning frozen? Why are they scrambling? Why are they \nhorrible to each other, a menace to all, most importantly to \nthemselves?''\n  Well, this is what will have happened, in my view. I can say that 30 \nyears and more of association with this subject makes me feel it would \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, once again, with apologies to the Senate for having \nprovided somewhat misleading data on August 8, without intention, it \nwas received from the Department of Health and Human Services without \nany purpose to mislead, and was corrected by the Department. Having \nplaced the incorrect data in the Record, I ask that the correct table \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              PROPORTION OF CHILDREN RECEIVING AFDC (1993)              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Percent   Percent\n                        City                          at point  within a\n                                                       in time    year  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChicago.............................................        36        46\nDallas..............................................        16        20\nDetroit.............................................        50        67\nHouston.............................................        18        22\nLos Angeles.........................................        29        38\nNew York............................................        30        39\nPhiladelphia........................................        44        57\nPhoenix.............................................        15        18\nSan Antonio.........................................        14        21\nSan Diego...........................................        23        30\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of Health and Human Services, August 23, 1995.       \n\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

I count him as a friend, a \nteacher, a mentor.\n  It is interesting how we sometimes take the same facts, however, and \nreach different conclusions. I went to law school at New York \nUniversity in the center of Manhattan in the mid-1950's. And much as I \nlove New York and Manhattan and find it an exciting borough, when I \nfinished law school I had no desire to stay there. I went back to \nOregon and started to practice law and kept my home and roots there \never since.\n  But I remember public housing in the mid-1950's in New York. The \nFederal Government dictated what public housing would be, and we knew \nbest. Our philosophy was that, if people had a decent roof over their \nheads, all else would flow and follow. Education would follow, crime \nwould disappear; so long as you had a decent shower and a bed. So we \nbuilt, not 5- and 10-story public housing projects, 20- and 25-story \npublic housing projects. And we clustered them together; not one \nbuilding, but three or four, with concrete parks, barely any grass for \nthe kids to play, and thousands and thousands of roughly similarly \neconomically situated poor people clustered together.\n  What we ended up with were 20- and 25-story slums, crime-ridden, \ndrug-infested slums. It did not work. I do not mean this as critical of \nthe thinkers of the mid-1950's. That was the best thought in the \nfifties.\n  Now the Federal Government thinks the best thought is what we call \nscatter buildings. We are not going to put up 25-story buildings; we \nare going to put 60 units in Queens and 30 units in Westchester County \nand some more in Staten Island. We are going to scatter them about. It \nmay be a better decision. It may not be. I am not sure. Yet it is \nanother example of where the Federal Government now says the philosophy \nof 40 years ago was wrong and this philosophy is right.\n  I offer this only to say there is no guarantee that any public policy \nyou adopt will work out exactly as you hope it will work out. It does \nnot mean that you are malevolent in your thoughts or deliberately \nordaining that it would not work out. It is just things you thought \nwould happen do not. How often I heard my friend from New York talk \nabout the law of unintended consequences.\n  So, with that background, I want to go back into the history of \nwelfare in the United States, starting in 1935; what we hoped would \nhappen, what has happened. I think we can say this. If our hope of \nwelfare was to get people off of welfare, if welfare was to be a \ntrampoline so that you could spring back useful to society, it has not \nworked. It has become not a trampoline, but a hammock. And that I think \nwe can say with assuredness.\n  I am not sure we had any witness that appeared before the Finance \nCommittee as we were having hearings on welfare reform that defended \nthe present system as working. Some wanted to simply jettison the \nentire thing. Some wanted to tinker with it but keep it a Federal \nsystem. Others wanted to devolve more power and authority to the \nStates. But nobody defended it as it was. So how did we get to where we \nare?\n  Go back to 1935. My good friend from New York talked about the 1935 \nSocial Security Act. It was passed in 1935. And Social Security, the \nact, had two parts to it. One was the pension that we are well familiar \nwith. The other was a welfare component for widows and orphans. How \noften has the Senator from New York referred to it colloquially, but \ncorrectly, as a pension for the miner's young widow and the miner's \nyoung child.\n  Both provisions, in essence, covered the same people but for \ndifferent purposes. In the mid-1930's if you are the breadwinner--it is \nbasically men that are working--if you lived to 65, you took care of \nyour wife, and probably by that time your minor children had grown up. \nIf you died at age 45 however, and you were the breadwinner, there was \nno survivors' benefits in the original Social Security Act. Suddenly \nthe widow and the child are thrown out onto the street. So the welfare \nprovision of the 1935 Act was designed to take care of the widow and \nthe orphan child. And it was presumed, I think, that if the widow got \nmarried again, she would no longer need any public support, and if she \ndid not get married, she at least got this income while the child was a \nminor and she was a widow. And almost all welfare at this time--1935 \nonward for a fair number of years--was for widows and orphans.\n  Then in 1939, we amended the Social Security Act to include \nsurvivors. The breadwinner dies at 45. It was still usually a man in \nthose days. He has a 40-year-old widow and three children, ages 16, 12, \nand 9. There were survivors' benefits under Social Security. If you \nwere a widow with children, you got 75 percent of what the person who \ndied would have gotten had that person reached Social Security age, and \nyou got 75 percent for each child, though it was capped. You did not \nget 75 percent for every child if you had 15 children.\n  After World War II, we rather rapidly expanded the coverage of Social \nSecurity. My hunch is the biggest single group may have come in in 1953 \nor 1954 under President Eisenhower, when we brought in an immense \nnumber of people: Agriculture----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Self employed.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Self employed. We brought in an awful lot of people.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. State and local.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. State and local. We brought them in and, by 1960, most \npeople were covered by Social Security and that included survivors. So \nif the breadwinner died, the widow and the orphan were taken care of. \nTherefore, welfare--I am not talking about Social Security survivors \ninsurance, I am talking about welfare as we knew it in the 1930's; when \nthe breadwinner dies there is no Social Security survivors' benefits--\nwelfare as we knew it began to disappear because Social Security \nbenefits, survivors' benefits, were usually more generous than welfare \nwould be, and survivors' benefits supplanted what welfare had initially \nbeen for widows and orphans.\n  From about 1950 onward, maybe a little earlier again--the Senator \nfrom New York would know more specifically than I would--aid to \ndependent children, as we now call it aid to families with dependent \nchildren, AFDC, started tilting toward support for unwed mothers and \nchildren who had never had a breadwinner in the house. It was no longer \nthe concept of the widow and the orphan. There never was a breadwinner. \nAnd, instead of emergency financial support for a widow who was \nsuddenly deprived of her breadwinner, AFDC, aid to families with \ndependent children, gradually and then overwhelmingly became a lifetime \nsupport system for many people. And in many cases it became a \ngeneration after generation support system.\n  Today, only 1 to 2 percent of welfare is because of the death of a \nbreadwinner. That is how much it has changed from what it was \noriginally intended.\n  Now, from 1935 onward, but especially from 1960 onward, as we have \nseen this movement toward welfare being for unwed mothers, people who \nnever had breadwinners, the Federal Government has tinkered and tried \nand toyed to make this system work. If the woman dropped out of high \nschool in the middle of her junior year and had a baby and did not go \nback, to try to educate her, to try to help her get a job--and we have \nattached more baubles and geegaws to the Federal welfare system in \nefforts to make it work than the mind can comprehend.\n  But it has not worked. If it was meant to stem the rise of \nillegitimacy, it has not worked. If it was meant to get people back to \nwork, it has not worked. If it was meant to somehow break the \ngenerational cycles, it has not worked.\n  Has it failed because we did not spend enough money? Let us go back \nand take a look over the years of what we have spent. I am going to use \nthe year 1947 as a base for this reason. What we spent in the 1930's \nwas minuscule. During World War II, we did not spend anything for all \npractical purposes. But during the war, from 1944 to 1945, believe it \nor not--we talk about the defense budget now--the defense budget was 40 \npercent of our gross domestic product and 90 percent of our total \nbudget. We did not do anything else. We were a war machine. We were \nborrowing to do it. And we were willing to spend that much on defense \nbecause we \n\n[[Page S 12684]]\nthought it was necessary for the preservation of Western civilization. \nI am inclined to think that was a correct decision.\n  So when I hear people say we cannot afford to spend for our defense, \njust as an aside, a great nation can afford to spend. We are now \nspending 4 or 5 percent over gross national product on defense. We can \nargue, can we afford 4 or 5 percent? Yes, we can. But it did mean in \nthose years we were not spending money for anything else of any \nconsequence except on the war. And the first real budget year, fiscal \nyear, after the war was 1947; 1946 was midway through when the war was \nstill going on.\n  I am going to use the term ``constant dollars'' rather than ``current \ndollars'' because current dollars can be illusory. I will define the \ndifference.\n  A current dollar is $1 today. I spend $100 on a Federal program. Let \nus say you have 100 percent inflation. Next year we spend $200 on the \nFederal program. You have not spent any more money. You have 100 \npercent inflation. The person that gets it has not gotten anything more \nto spend. That is why we have COLA's on Social Security. That is called \ncurrent dollars.\n  To put it in comparison, in current 1947 dollars we spent $2 billion \non what the Social Security Administration basically called welfare. \nThis is 10 or 12 programs. In 1947 we were spending $2 billion. In 1991 \nwe were spending $180 billion. Even if you put it in terms of constant \ndollars--because current dollars does not take into account inflation--\nthe figures are still dramatic. If you assume that the value of the \ndollar today was the same as the value in 1947, and there has been no \ninflation in that period of roughly 45 years, then in 1947, in today's \ndollars, we were spending $10 billion on all of these programs. Today, \nwe spend $180 billion. On AFDC alone, in 1947 we were spending in \nconstant dollars $697 million, today we are spending $18 billion, about \na 2500-percent increase.\n  You want to take a last figure. These programs in the Social Security \nAdministration count as programs for the poor. In 1947, they were 0.7 \nof 1 percent of our gross domestic product. Today, they are slightly in \nexcess of 3 percent. So they have grown dramatically.\n  Welfare has not failed because we did not spend money. We have spent \nmore money by any measure.\n  Has it failed because of inadequate regulations? The 1935 bill when \nit passed was 2\\1/2\\ pages long. This is the section relating to \nwelfare, 2\\1/2\\ pages.\n  There were no regulations initially. The bill really had six \nrequirements of the States as follows:\n  First, the program had to be in effect in all political subdivisions \nthroughout the State. That is an easy enough requirement.\n  Second, there had to be some financial participation by the State. \nThat is easy enough to figure.\n  Third, it had to be administered by a single State agency. That is \neasy enough to figure.\n  Fourth, there had to be an opportunity for a fair hearing for \nsomebody if they had been denied benefits. That is not too difficult to \nfigure.\n  Fifth, although this one becomes a little more ephemeral, the State \nhad to provide such methods of administration as would be necessary for \nan efficient operation of the plan.\n  As I say, I am not quite sure what that means exactly, but I will \nshow you what it means in just a moment.\n  Then lastly, the State had to file reports that would assure the \ncorrectness and verification of basically what they were intending. \nThat was relatively simple.\n  From that has grown what we have in welfare today.\n  The Senator from New York referred to this stack on this desk which I \nshall attempt to lift. These, Mr. President, are the regulations that \nan Oregon caseworker must be familiar with in order to determine just \ntwo things: No. 1, the eligibility of a recipient for welfare; No. 2, \nhow much shall that recipient get. That is what you have to go through \nin order to determine just whether you are eligible. How much do you \nget?\n  Follow me to this chart back here. Here is the eligibility process.\n  You come into the welfare office. ``Hi, I am Johnny Jones. I would \nlike to apply for welfare.'' Initial application. All right.\n  The caseworkers says, ``Give me your proof of identity, age, \ncitizenship. I want your driver's license, Social Security card for \neach person, birth certificate for each person, alien registration, or \narrival and departure record, or any other identification from any \nother agencies or organizations.''\n  This assumes a person coming in for welfare actually has these things \nor knows how to put their hands on it. Assuming you have proved your \nidentity, we now go to proof of relationship and child in the home. \nSigned and dated statement from friend or relative naming each child \nand residence, birth certificate or other documents stating parent's \nname.\n  Assume you have that. Then we go over to proof of residence and \nshelter costs.\n  ``Give us your electric bill, paid or unpaid; give us your gas or \nfuel bills, paid or unpaid; rental or lease agreement; rent receipt; \nlandlord statement; landlord deed to property; proof of housing \nsubsidies.''\n  No wonder this stack is getting thicker and thicker as you go through \ngiving us all of this information. Now we come down to proof of family \nafter you have gone through all of this.\n  Death certificate for deceased parent; divorce papers or separation \npapers showing date, if separated; a statement from a friend, neighbor, \nor relative proving marriage certificates; if in prison, date of \nimprisonment, length of service; if pregnant, a medical statement with \nexpected delivery date; if disabled, name of doctor, name of hospital \nand a doctor's statement.\n  This is just starting to prove eligibility.\n  Does anyone here have any income? No. You have no income.\n  I want you to think about proving a negative.\n  ``No, I do not have any income.''\n  ``Let me see your bank account and savings account.''\n  ``I do not have a bank or savings book. I do not have any bank \naccount.''\n  Well, you have to prove you do not have a bank account. Current \nchecking account statements and real estate documents.\n  I want you to picture Johnny Jones coming in asking for welfare.\n  ``Where are your real estate statements?''\n  ``I don't have any.''\n  ``What do you mean, you do not have any? Can you prove it?''\n  ``No. I don't have any.''\n  ``Prove you don't have any.''\n  ``I do not have any.''\n  Payment books or receipts for all mortgages and land sales.\n  Do you know how much land Johnny sells? He is not really involved in \nbig time in real estate sales.\n  List of all stocks and bonds and current market value; title of all \nmotor vehicles and bill of sale; bank payments or agreement; documents \nshowing life insurance and estate or trust funds.\n  Name me welfare recipients who have trust funds. If they have trust \nfunds, they are not welfare recipients and they will not be in this \noffice at the first stage.\n  Insurance policies? They might have insurance policies.\n  Now, if you have done all that, you make an eligibility decision. \nHowever, this is if you have no income. But if you have income, now we \ncome down here.\n  Proof of income.\n  Uncashed worker's compensation or other benefit check; latest Social \nSecurity or VA benefit award letter; court order stating amount of \nsupport or alimony; notice of unemployment benefits, record of payments \nreceived, or uncashed check; records of income from self-employment, \nfarm income or business income, tax records, profit and loss \nstatements, or income producing contracts; wage stubs or employer's \nstatement of gross wages for the last 30 days.\n  You have to prove all that. But interestingly, what counts as income \nand what does not count as income?\n  Count adoption assistance if not for special needs. That counts as \nincome.\n  Do not count as income adoption assistance for a child's special \nneeds.\n  Now, you are poor Johnny Jones getting these questions, trying to \nfigure it out. You count as income payments under the Agent Orange Act \nof 1991. You do not count as income benefits \n\n[[Page S 12685]]\nfrom the Agent Orange Settlement Fund if it is given by Aetna Life. I \ndo not know why it is limited to Aetna Life.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am not going to go on with the rest of this. \nThis is what welfare has become. It is no wonder that caseworkers are \nfrustrated beyond belief. The caseworkers I have met are perfectly \ndecent people who would like to help the poor.\n  Now I will give you a quote from the former executive director of the \nOregon Progress Board.\n  ``Almost all of the Oregon Option undertakings''--Oregon Options is \nthe welfare plan that we have gotten authorization to try--``require \nthe use of federal funds and, in many cases, the waiver of federal \nrules and restrictions on how the money is used.'' As Wyse said,\n\n       We need the federal government as a partner. But federal \n     programs that provide money tend to be severely prescriptive \n     and riddled with red tape that stifles innovation. In the \n     biggest area of federal aid--welfare--at least 20 percent [20 \n     percent] of our administrative time and money costs have been \n     spent on federal paperwork.\n\n  My classic example, however, does not deal with welfare per se. It is \nHarley, Harley, the Vietnamese potbellied, drug-sniffing pig. This pig \ncan smell drugs like dogs do, so the Portland police bureau applied to \nthe DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, for Federal funds that \nthey allocate for drug-sniffing dogs. The DEA, Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, said no, it only applies to dogs. It does not apply to \npigs. To which the Portland police bureau said: ``This pig can smell \nbetter than a dog, and it is cheaper than a dog.''\n  Now, I have to give Vice President Gore credit. He worked this out by \ndeclaring Harley an honorary dog. That solved our problem. There is \nHarley, the honorary dog, right there. That is the frustration of \ndealing with the Federal Government. Did the DEA mean to be obtuse and \nmean? Of course not. Of course not. It is just that big things of \nnecessity have to be pigeonholed. It is not true just of Government. It \nis true of big institutions. It becomes more and more difficult, the \nbigger you get, to deal with individuality. You have to fit the \npigeonhole whether you are a university with 25,000 students or General \nMotors. It is one of the reasons why small and often family-held \ncompanies are able to do much better and compete against giants that \nare 100 times their size but immobile.\n  About 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago now, there was a story in one \nof the nationwide business publications on who sets the price of \nplywood in the United States. Weyerhaeuser is a big producer. Georgia \nPacific is a big producer. But the article concluded that it was set by \nKen Ford of what was then called the Roseburg Lumber Co. That is now \nRoseburg Forest Products. It was a family-owned company and still \nprivately held, as I recall. They have about 3,000 employees in an area \nof about 15,000 to 20,000. It is the dominant employer.\n  The article said as Mr. Ford's plywood is moving across the country \non the railcars, he can call Chicago and say, ``Cut it 50 cents a board \nfoot,'' and it is cut. And Weyerhaeuser and Georgia Pacific immediately \nfollow suit. But they cannot take the lead because it is a corporate \nboard decision of some kind. They do not have anybody in the \norganization that can say to cut it 50 cents a foot.\n  So Mr. Ford sets the prices for plywood. He is still alive and the \ncompany is still going. And he is still a dominant force in his \nbusiness.\n  You see it in the electronics business today. How many companies are \nthere? Have you ever seen that wonderful list of companies? There are \nover 20,000 or 25,000 companies that did not exist in 1968, either just \ndid not exist or were just getting founded in the 1960's, electronics \nor otherwise.\n  You look at just one facet of communications, personal \ncommunications, the little hand-held phones you use. In 1982, when AT \nand the Federal Government agreed to a consent decree breaking up AT \nand creating what we now call the regional Bells--seven--it was a very \ninclusive agreement. The Justice Department and AT tried to think of \neverything they could to include. Do you know the one thing they left \nout? Personal portable telephones. There was no future in that. There \nwere 18,000 in the country. There are 25 million now. By the end of the \ncentury--there might be 125 million in 10 years. We will have as many \nof those as we have telephones.\n  It is not AT, MCI, and Sprint that are dominating that business. \nThose are long-distance carriers. But the companies that have moved \ninto this business were small, sharp, quick companies that can compete \nwith Bell Atlantic, compete with AT And they move rapidly. They find \na niche. They are good at it. They are small.\n  So when we get to this bill, it is an interesting difference in \nphilosophy, on average--I am generalizing here--on average, between \nRepublicans and Democrats to this extent. On average, Democrats in the \nprovision of social services have a mistrust of it being done by \nprivate enterprise, whether that be a profitmaking private enterprise \nor not. I want to emphasize, I am generalizing. They have less mistrust \nif it is done by Catholic Charities or Goodwill, but they feel more \ncomfortable if the Government is doing it. Republicans are a little \nmore inclined to say let us let the private sector do it or let us give \nsome grants or help with the private sector, but let them take the \nlead.\n  The second difference is that if it must be done by Government, there \nis still a general feeling among most Democrats that it should be done \nor at least directed by the Federal Government. Republicans feel pretty \nmuch the converse, that it should be done and directed by State or \nlocal government.\n  I am delighted we are debating this bill outside of what we call \nreconciliation. Reconciliation is going to be this big-budget bill that \nwill come to us in 2 months--6 weeks, I would say. It is going to have \neverything in it--Medicare, Medicaid, earned-income tax credit, and tax \ncuts--and it is limited under our rules to 20 hours of debate, 10 hours \non a side. Welfare, if put in that bill, would get half an hour's \ndebate. Medicare, I will bet, gets 8 hours of 10 in the debate, and \nthis subject deserves more debate than that because it is an honest \ndifference of opinion. I emphasize ``honest difference of opinion.''\n  The Republicans want to do what we call break the Federal \nentitlement. We are saying we will give to the States as much money as \nthey are getting now--but not as much as they would otherwise get if we \ndid not change the law. And in exchange, we will say to the States, we \nare going to remove most of the strings that have been hampering you \nfor the past if not 50 years, certainly 30 years. We are going to give \nyou certain outlines and guidelines, and you cannot use this money for \nairport tarmacs. You have to use it for the poor.\n But you decide, New York, whether your problems are different than \nSouth Dakota's. You decide, Oregon, whether your problems are different \nfrom Ohio's and attempt to shape your welfare program with the limited \namount of money we give you to what you think your needs are.\n\n  Mr. President, they are different. If you are Florida or Texas or New \nMexico or Arizona and have an immense immigrant population and, in any \ncase, a Hispanic-speaking population--New York has it--virtually you \nhave a problem just of language for many young people. That same \nproblem, but to a much lesser degree, exists in Oregon. My guess would \nbe, I do not know, that it exists not at all in South Dakota. I am \ntaking a guess there is not an immense Hispanic-speaking immigrant \npopulation in South Dakota.\n  So right away, the problems are different.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I will.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Because he is making an important point. Does he recall \nthe occasion on which the Committee on Finance--of course he recalls--\nheld a retreat in Maryland, and the Senator from North Dakota learned \nabout the proposal to deny welfare benefits to mothers of children who \nthemselves were under 18. He returned to his State and checked that out \nto see just how much of a problem it was in North Dakota. Mr. \nPresident, you would be interested to know that there are four such \nfamilies, two of whom had just arrived from West Virginia.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. There is a slight difference in the problems. When the \n\n[[Page S 12686]]\n  Dole bill passes, and I hope it will--I think the amendment of the \nDemocratic majority leader will fail--I hope we go forward with this \nnot in a spirit of, ``Well, the Republicans have won'' and cheer.\n  I want to close with what I said at the start. There is no guarantee \nthat if we pass this bill, as the Republicans are talking about, there \nis no guarantee we will solve the problem. There is a guarantee that if \nwe continue as we have been going, we will not solve the problem. We \nhave not solved the problem and there is no hope we will solve the \nproblem continuing on the line of Federal regulation and control as we \nhave gone.\n  My guess is that many States will experiment with this and will find \ntheir experiments fail. Many others will experiment with it in a \ndifferent fashion and find they succeed. And then some of the successes \nwill be taken to other States and found it does not work in that State \nyet does work in other States. The States are going to become labs over \nthe next 5 years and, by and large, most of them are going to hit upon \nwhat will work in their State with the limited amount of money that we \ngive them, and they will be much quicker to jettison programs that do \nnot work than we are.\n  The last thing we have put in this bill--and I see the Senator from \nMissouri is in the chair and it was his suggestion--we have put in this \nbill, to the extent that it is constitutional, that it is permissible \nfor this money to be given to religious organizations to carry out \nsocial welfare purposes.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. Just because Catholic Charities is \nCatholic should not mean that it is incapable of administering to the \npoor. Just because the Salvation Army may have a cross on the wall does \nnot mean that it cannot run a good sheltered workshop. It will run a \nbetter sheltered workshop than anything the Government might run.\n  As I say, we cannot by law make something constitutional that is \nunconstitutional. I know the fear and the argument: Not only are they \ngoing to minister to the needs of the poor, they are going to try to \nproselytize them, make them Catholics or make them whatever.\n  Mr. President, I think that risk is worth it. I think the risk is \nworth it. If a person goes to a Salvation Army sheltered workshop or a \nmeals program run by a charity that happens to have a menorah in the \nhallway, I am not sure that is going to be so offensive to what we are \ntrying to achieve that it should be prohibited. I will leave it to the \ncourts--and there will be suits--to decide whether or not it is \nconstitutional.\n  I will say this to my good friend from New York, he and I now almost \n20 years ago, not quite, introduced bills to allow tuition tax credits. \nIn the interim, Wisconsin has tried it and now I see the courts have \ndeclared it partially unconstitutional. But it is working. These inner-\ncity kids are getting a good education. We simply wanted to say to the \nparents--by and large, it liberates the poor. It does not liberate the \nrich. They are going to private schools anyway and they are going to \nparochial schools. It was a modest credit.\n  We say a parent can put their child in a religious school and they \ncan deduct part of their cost off of their income tax. For 18 years he \nand I have tried to get that. We have been unsuccessful so far.\n  Every now and then, he will send me a clipping when another inner-\ncity Catholic school has closed or perhaps the whole diocese has \nclosed, I do not know, and say, ``They didn't listen to us, they didn't \nlisten to us.''\n  It was touching when we had hearings on this to have some of the \npoorest women come and testify. These were single mothers working for \nthe Federal Government, often in relatively modest positions, making in \nthose days, the late seventies, $15,000, $16,000 a year, putting their \nchildren in private school, paying for it themselves, religious \nschools, not even of their religion because they wanted an alternative \nto public school.\n  This bill is going to try to permit all of that, not because we want \nto intrude religion on people, but because we do not want to preclude \nreligion having the opportunity to serve people.\n  Mr. President, over the next 4 or 5 days, we will debate the \nphilosophy of this bill. I suppose we will debate lots of itsy-bitsy \ndetails. But the philosophy is infinitely more important than itsy-\nbitsy details.\n  This bill, if adopted, is a watershed, is a turning point from the \nconcept that the Federal Government is be all and know all. I hope we \nare daring enough to take the step. I do not promise it will work, but \nI do promise that with what we are trying now, we will continue to \nfail.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, nearly 35 years ago, the voters of Rhode \nIsland decided to send Claiborne Pell to the U.S. Senate. And in the \nyears that followed, they have made the same decision in five separate \nelections.\n  Yesterday, Senator Pell announced that this term will be his final \none in the Senate.\n  While there are still 16 months left in Senator Pell's term, I did \nwant to take a minute to pay tribute to this dedicated public servant.\n  As all of my colleagues know, Senator Pell has devoted his years in \nthe Senate to many issues of great importance: To foreign relations, \nwhere he has served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee; to bettering the environment; and, of \ncourse, to education, where Pell grants to college students have become \na household word. I listened to the Senator from New York comment on \nthat yesterday.\n  Mr. President, the State motto of Rhode Island is just one word--the \nword ``Hope.''\n  And from serving in the Coast Guard during World War II, to \nrepresenting our country in the Foreign Service for 7 years, to serving \nhere in the Senate for three and a half decades, Claiborne Pell has \nnever given up hope on America.\n  I join with all Senators in wishing Senator Pell all the best as he \nwrites the final chapters in a very distinguished Senate career.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12686-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12686-S12687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CAL RIPKEN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, my mother had a phrase she used to repeat. \n``Can't never could do anything,'' she told us. I have tried to live by \nthose words throughout my life, and I want to pay tribute today to \nsomeone else who doesn't know how to say ``can't.''\n  For over half a century, baseball experts have said that one record \nthat could never be broken was the great Lou Gehrig's record of playing \nin 2,130 consecutive games.\n  As all baseball fans know, that record was tied last night, and will \nbe broken tonight by Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr.\n  In every game played by the Orioles since May 30, 1982, Cal Ripken \nhas taken the field and done his job with dedication and with \nexcellence.\n  No doubt about it, as a baseball player, Cal Ripken is a superstar. \nBut more importantly, he is also a superstar as a human being, a \nhusband, a father, and a role model.\n  Make no mistake about it, like most professional athletes, Cal Ripken \nis very well paid. But you cannot watch him play without thinking that \nhe would still be out there, trying as hard as he can, if he was not \npaid at all.\n  And Cal's commitment to baseball does not end on the field. As a \ngoodwill ambassador for a game that desperately needs one, he freely \ngives his time to countless charities, and throughout this season, Cal \nhas stayed in the stadium for hours after games, signing autographs for \nevery fan who wanted one.\n  I know that all Members of the Senate join with me in tipping our \nhats to \n\n[[Page S 12687]]\nCal. May he have as many years on the field as our ``iron man,'' \nSenator Strom Thurmond, has had in the Senate. He could run that record \nway up there.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12686-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with enthusiasm I rise to support \nthe Democratic alternative on welfare reform. I support it with \nenthusiasm because it is firm on work, provides a safety net for \nchildren, brings men back into the picture in terms of child support \nand child rearing, and at the same time provides State flexibility and \nadministrative simplification.\n  Mr. President, I am the Senate's only professionally trained social \nworker. Before elected to public office, my life's work was moving \npeople from welfare to work, one step at a time, each step leading to \nthe next step, practicing the principles of tough love.\n  This is the eighth version of welfare reform that I have been through \nas a foster care worker, as a child abuse and neglect worker, a city \ncouncilwoman, Congresswoman, and now U.S. Senator. Each of those \nprevious efforts in times have failed both under Democratic Presidents \nand under Republican Presidents. It failed for two reasons. One, each \nreform effort was based on old economic realities, and, second, reform \ndid not provide tools for the people to move from welfare to work, to \nhelp them get off welfare and stay off welfare.\n  I believe that welfare should be not a way of life but a way to a \nbetter life. Everyone agrees that today's welfare system is a mess. The \npeople who are on welfare say it is a mess. The people who pay for \nwelfare say it is a mess. It is time we fix the system.\n  Middle-class Americans want the poor to work as hard at getting off \nwelfare as they themselves do at staying middle class. The American \npeople want real reform that promotes work, two-parent families, and \npersonal responsibility.\n  That is what the Democratic alternative is all about. We give help to \nthose who practice self-help. Democrats have been the party of sweat \nequity and have a real plan for work. Republicans have a plan that only \ntalks about work and can not really achieve it.\n  Democrats have produced a welfare plan that is about real work, and \nwe call it Work First because it does put work first. But it does not \nmake children second class. Under our plan, from the day someone comes \ninto a welfare office, they must focus on getting a job and keeping a \njob and being able to raise their family.\n  How do we do this? Well, first, we abolish AFDC. We create a \ntemporary employment assistance program. We change the culture of \nwelfare offices from eligibility workers to being empowerment workers. \nInstead of only fussbudgeting over eligibility rules, social workers \nnow become empowerment workers to sit down with welfare applicants to \ndo a job readiness assessment on what it takes to move them to a job, \nstay on a job, and ensure that their children's education and health \nneeds are being met.\n  Everyone must sign a parent empowerment contract within 2 weeks of \nentering the welfare system. It is an individualized plan to get a job. \nThe failure of individuals to sign that contract means they cannot get \nbenefits. Everyone must undertake an immediate and intensive job search \nonce they have signed that contract. We believe the best job training \nis on the job. Your first job leads you to the next job. Each time you \nclimb a little bit further out of poverty and at the same time we \nreward that effort.\n  Yes, this is a tough plan with tough requirements. It expects \nresponsibility from welfare recipients. Everyone must do something for \nbenefits. If you do not sign the contract, you lose the benefits. If \nyou refuse to accept a job that is offered, you lose the benefits. If, \nafter 2 years of assistance, you do not have a job in the private \nsector, then one must be provided for you in the public sector.\n  No adult can get benefits for more than 5 years in their adult \nlifetime, but if you are a minor, you are able to stay in school and \nreceive benefits.\n  So, yes, we Democrats are very tough on work. Everyone must work. \nAssistance is time limited and everyone must do something for benefits. \nIf you do not abide by the contract, then you lose your benefits.\n  What else do we do? We provide a safety net for children. We not only \nwant you to be job ready and work force ready, we want you to be a \nresponsible parent. We want you to be able to ensure that as part of \ngetting your benefits, your children are in school and that they are \nreceiving health care.\n  Once you do go to work, we will not abandon you. We want to make sure \nthat a dollar's worth of work is worth a dollar's worth of welfare, and \nwhile you are working at a minimum wage, trying to better yourself, we \nwill provide a safety net for child care for your children, nutritional \nbenefits will continue, and so will health care. We want to be sure \nthat while you are trying to help yourself, we are helping your \nchildren grow into responsible adults.\n  I do not mind telling people that they must work because I do not \nmind telling them that they will not only have the tools to go to work, \nbut that there will be a safety net for children.\n  This is what the Republican bill does not do. It does not look at the \nday-to-day lives of real people and ask what is needed to get that \nperson into a job.\n  People we are telling to go to work are not going to be in high-paid, \nhigh-technology jobs. We know that that mother who wants to sign a \ncontract that requires her to work will be on the edge when it comes to \npaying the bills.\n  She does not have a mother or an aunt or a next door neighbor to \nwatch her kids. She needs help with child care to move into the work \nforce.\n  The Republican bill does not provide enough money to pay for real \nchild care. Suppose that mother lives in suburban Maryland or Baltimore \ncity or the rural parts of my State? She does the right thing; she gets \nabout an entry-level, minimum-wage job.\n  She is going to make about $9,000 a year, but will have no benefits. \nShe might take home, after Social Security taxes, $175 a week. But if \nher child care costs her $125 a week, that leaves her $50 a week for \nrent, food, and clothing.\n  So that means, under the Republican welfare bill, it is like jumping \noff of a \n\n[[Page S 12688]]\ncliff into the abyss of further and further poverty. Our bill wants to \nhelp people move to a better life. The Republican bill will push them \ninto poverty through its harsh, punitive approach.\n  How do we expect this woman to support a family on $50 a week? There \nwould be no incentive to do that. Welfare reform is about ending the \ncycle of poverty and the culture of poverty. Ending the cycle of \npoverty is an economic challenge. It means helping create jobs in this \ncountry and then making sure that our country is work force ready and \nthat welfare recipients are job ready.\n  But it also must end the culture of poverty, and that is about \npersonal responsibility, that is about bringing men back into the \npicture, that is about tough child support, saying that if you have a \nchild, you should support that child and rear that child.\n  We believe that the way families will move out of poverty is the way \nfamilies move to the middle class, by bringing men back into the \npicture, having two-parent households, by ensuring that there are no \npenalties to marriage, to families, or to going to work.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what the Democratic alternative is. That \nis why I support it with the enthusiasm that I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the direction in \nwhich the welfare debate is now headed. I come to the floor at this \npoint in time, not to discuss any specific aspect of welfare reform or \nmy views on it. I come, not to cast aspersions on the Republican \napproach nor to praise the Democratic approach. But I wanted to express \nmy concern that the welfare debate is headed in absolutely the wrong \ndirection, the direction of partisan bickering.\n  As far as I know, there has been no real effort by the other side, or \nby this side, to try to work out a compromise solution. We have had our \ntask force. The Democrats have been talking about their approach. I \nunderstand the Republicans have had their groups talking about their \napproach. We now have a bill on the floor. We have a Democratic \nsubstitute. Then there is the Republican proposal.\n  I must tell you, I think this is absolutely the wrong way to go. I \nthink welfare reform is much too important to the American people and \nto the taxpayers to be caught up in some kind of partisan warfare.\n\n       We are tougher than you.\n       No, we are tougher than you.\n       We care about kids more than you.\n       No, we care about kids more than you.\n       We are going to give the States more flexibility.\n       No, we are going to give the States more flexibility.\n\n  It pains me to see this happen because I believe there is enough \nsimilarity between the Republican bill and the Democratic bill to work \nout a compromise, but not if it is done in the heat of partisan \nbickering, which I believe is starting to take place right now on the \nwelfare bill.\n  Several years ago my State of Iowa decided to do something about the \nwelfare problem in our State. We set up task forces, set up pilot \nprojects around the State to try to find out what would work and what \nwould not work. This went on for several years. As a result of these \nexperiments, the State legislature in Iowa a few years ago pulled \ntogether a welfare reform bill and passed it through the Iowa \nlegislature.\n  That bill was passed with the support of conservative Republicans and \nliberal Democrats. As I have often said, it was supported by Pat \nRobertson conservative Republicans and Jesse Jackson liberal Democrats. \nOnly one person voted against it, because it was put together in a \nbipartisan fashion. Folks from both sides of the aisle worked together \nto fashion a legitimate welfare reform bill.\n  It passed and was signed into law by Governor Branstad. We have now \nhad about 2 years of experience with it and it is working. We now have \nthe distinction in Iowa that we have a higher percentage of people on \nwelfare who work than any State in the Nation--Iowa. We doubled the \nnumber of people on welfare who work. Doubled--went up by almost 100 \npercent. Our caseload is down. And the expenditures per case are also \ndown by about 10 percent.\n  So the number of people on welfare is down. The cost per case is \ndown. The number of people working is up.\n  Last of all, of the States that have gone out and tried to do welfare \nreform, Iowa, according to a New York Times article that I read, Iowa \nis the only State that has actually cut people off of welfare. It is \nthe only State that said, ``Here is a contract. We signed the contract. \nIf you, welfare recipient, do not live up to your part of the contract, \nit ends.'' Iowa has done that.\n  I do not believe Wisconsin or any other State has been touted as \nhaving done such a thing. So it is working in Iowa.\n  I say that because it was not done in a partisan fashion. It was done \nin a bipartisan fashion. I believe for welfare reform to work \nnationally, it must also be done in a bipartisan fashion. That is why \nit pains me to see what is happening on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I was looking in the Congress Daily of Wednesday, August 9. It quoted \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole. It said that Senator Dole said that \nPresident Clinton and he were talking privately a couple of weeks ago \nabout working out a bipartisan solution on welfare reform. Dole said, \n``He pulled me aside and asked me if there was a chance and \nacknowledged that there are some similarities between the Democratic \nand GOP bills.''\n  I took that at face value. So on that same day, August 9, I wrote a \nletter to the majority leader and to the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle. I am going to read for the Record what I said in that letter.\n  I said:\n\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I am writing you regarding our \n     extremely important efforts to reform the welfare system. We \n     clearly have agreement that the current welfare system is \n     failing those on it and taxpayers who have to support it and \n     it needs fundamental reform. You have put forward a \n     comprehensive reform plan, the Democratic leader has done the \n     same, Senator Bond and I have introduced a plan as has \n     Senator Gramm and other of our colleagues. And while there \n     are significant differences between our plans, I feel \n     strongly that there is enough common ground that there is no \n     good reason why we can't fashion a bipartisan approach that \n     would garner overwhelming support in the Senate and among the \n     American people.\n       In Iowa, we did just that. Democrats and Republicans worked \n     together, ironed out their differences and came up with a \n     bipartisan plan. It passed with just one dissenting vote in \n     the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Branstad. \n     And it is working. The number of welfare recipients working \n     and on their way off welfare is up 93 percent. And welfare \n     awards and total payments are down.\n       I feel strongly that we should not let welfare reform fall \n     victim to politics. As I'm sure you agree, the American \n     people don't care what political party reforms welfare; they \n     just want it done. They want to be assured that their tax \n     dollars are being spent responsibly. I'm concerned that if we \n     don't begin now working together to iron out our differences \n     that when we come back in September we may be no closer to \n     agreement than we are now and the chance for bipartisan \n     agreement lost. Therefore, I ask that before we leave for \n     recess you and the Democratic Leader appoint a bipartisan \n     task force to begin work on forging a welfare reform bill \n     that has strong support across party lines. I believe this \n     would be constructive and could well lead to a package of \n     tough, effective reforms emphasizing work of which we can all \n     be proud.\n       Thank you for your attention to my request. I look forward \n     to your reply. I am sending a similar letter to the \n     Democratic Leader.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not hear back from either the \nmajority leader or minority leader. I do not say that in any way \nderogatorily. I know we have been gone. People have been busy. That is \nnot my point. My point is that I still urge the majority leader and the \nminority leader to step back just one step. I request that the majority \nleader appoint six people and that the minority leader appoint six \npeople and that they take the remainder of this week and this weekend \nto see if we can work out a bipartisan approach, to see if they can \nagree on something and bring it back to us the first of next week.\n  I believe this would be the best approach to take. I think we could \nstep back from this partisan bickering that we are going to encounter \nhere in the next few days. It is going to come. I think we already hear \nthe opening strains of it--this bill is better than yours, this and \nthat. The American people are sick and tired of that kind of partisan \nbickering, especially when \n\n[[Page S 12689]]\nit concerns welfare. I believe there are enough similarities that we \ncan work out a bipartisan agreement. It will not be all of what we \nwant. It will not be all of what you want. But I believe it can garner \nenough support to be a truly bipartisan effort.\n  On August 7, I read again for the Record, Senator Breaux from \nLouisiana had the following statement. He said:\n\n       ``I think we ought to work together.\n       So we have a decision to make as to whether we are going to \n     cooperate and work on this together--\n\n  Meaning welfare reform.\n\n     or make political points and get nothing done. That is an \n     option. But if that option is exercised, I suggest the real \n     losers are the American people and the American taxpayer. We \n     will make short-term political points for short-term \n     political gain. But in the long run, the real losers will be \n     the taxpayers and those who are on welfare who will not have \n     had an opportunity to have a program passed in a bipartisan \n     fashion.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, the State of Iowa, of which I am proud to \nrepresent, did it in a bipartisan fashion. It showed that it could be \ndone and showed that it can work.\n  Why is it that we cannot do it here? Why can't the majority leader \nand the minority leader appoint five or six people each? We have \nbusiness on our calendar that we can spend the rest of the week on. We \nhave appropriations bills and other things that we can consider in the \nmeantime.\n  I repeat: There has been no serious effort in the Senate to reach \nsome kind of bipartisan cooperation on welfare reform. I am not blaming \nthat side. I am not blaming our side. I am just saying that it is a \nfact. Neither side has tried to reach across the aisle to form a \nbipartisan consensus. But I think that is what we ought to do.\n  I suppose maybe it is too late now. I do not know. All I can say is, \nI take this time to express my concern about the direction this debate \nis headed.\n  I wish an amendment were possible or something. I guess the tree is \nfull. No amendments are possible. I wish there was some way we could \nexpress ourselves with a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution to get a \nbipartisan group together to work on this.\n  I think it is too bad. I think the losers are going to be the \nAmerican taxpayers and the losers are going to be people on welfare \nbecause it is going to be caught up in partisan bickering. Partisan \nshots being taken here on something I consider to be equally as \nimportant as the health care debate or anything else we debated around \nhere.\n  I guess maybe I would not feel so strongly about it had I not seen \nwhat had been done in the State of Iowa 3 years ago when both sides \nreached across the aisle and worked out a bipartisan welfare reform \nprogram. And the fruits have shown that it is working.\n  I do not think any welfare reform bill can work unless it has that \nsame kind of bipartisan support. So again I call upon the majority \nleader and I call upon the minority leader to step back one step, \nappoint six people from each side, and let us take the rest of the week \nto see whether or not we can reach some kind of bipartisan agreement \nand bring it back on the floor next week. If we could do that, we would \nsave ourselves a lot of time and we would save a lot of partisan \nbickering, and I think the American people could at last be justly \nproud of something that the Senate is going to do this year.\n  Mr. President, I want to take some time here for a second, because I \nwant to demonstrate what happened in the State of Iowa with welfare \nreform. As soon as I get my easel set up here, I want to show it for \nthe record here. I apologize to the President for taking the time, but \nI want to show graphically basically what had been done in the State of \nIowa here.\n  First of all, in the State of Iowa, these lines show what has \nbasically happened with our cash welfare grants. The yellow line is \n1994; the green line is 1993; the blue line is 1992. We can see that \nthe cash welfare grants have basically stayed about stable over these \nyears.\n  Look at what is happening now under the new programs since Iowa \npassed this. It is going down, constantly going down. The total \nexpenditures have gone down considerably since we passed our welfare \nreform bill. This is one measure of how it is succeeding.\n  Now, again, I mentioned we now have the distinction in Iowa of having \na higher percentage of people on welfare who work than any State in the \nNation. Prior to the welfare reform bill passing, we had about 18 \npercent of the people on welfare working. We now have about 35 percent. \nI mentioned it is about a 100 percent improvement on that, people on \nwelfare working. They get the jobs skills they need to get off welfare. \nSo in terms of workfare, it is working. Here is the caseload.\n  I think this chart is interesting, Mr. President, because it shows \nwhat everyone in Iowa understood. Both Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals, understood that in changing the system, \nthere was going to be an increase in the caseload immediately. Everyone \nknew that, and they accepted that. Because, for example, prior to this \npoint in time, if you had an automobile worth more than $1,500, you \nwere not eligible for welfare. We took a lesson from the State of Utah. \nUtah had gotten a waiver to allow persons to have a car valued to \n$8,000 and still be on welfare. We raised ours to $3,000. So there are \na lot of people that maybe had a car worth $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 \nbefore that were not eligible. Now they are eligible.\n  So this is why this caseload went up. We knew that was going to \nhappen in the beginning. But we were confident enough in our bipartisan \napproach that we knew once that happened initially, it would come down \ndrastically. And that is exactly what has happened. Our total caseload \nover the last 2 years has gone from around 36,000 down to around \n34,000. So the number of people, the total number of people on welfare \nhas dropped after that first initial increase.\n  I mentioned the average grants were down. The average grant per \nfamily has gone now from $373 down to $336. That is over a 10-percent \ndecrease, I guess, in the average grant per recipient.\n  So the caseloads have gone down, and the average per family has gone \ndown, and the number of people on welfare has declined. I think this is \nreally the most important one of all: The number of people on welfare \nwho are working has almost doubled.\n  So, again, that is what happened in Iowa. But I think it only \nhappened because people on both sides of the aisle got together and did \nit in a bipartisan fashion. And that is what I hope we will do here. I \ndo not think it is too much to ask that--today is what, Wednesday--\nThursday, Friday, over the weekend, next Monday, a bipartisan group \nfrom both sides of the aisle get together, appointed by the respective \nleaders, and report back a bipartisan approach to this.\n  If not, then I am afraid the remainder of this week and probably the \nfirst of next week, we are going to be involved in some very serious \npartisan bickering--who is going to be toughest, who is going to be the \nbest for kids, and who is going to be the most lenient on States, on \ngiving States flexibility. There will be a lot of hot rhetoric and a \nlot of partisanship. And in the end, the American taxpayers and the \npeople on welfare are going to lose.\n  So I just make one final plea to the majority leader and to the \nminority leader to appoint six people each, work it out in a bipartisan \nfashion, and report it next week. And let us take it off the partisan \ntable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we all would like to have a \nbipartisan approach to welfare reform. I, for one, am a little \ndiscouraged.\n  I remember the President's rhetoric in the campaign when he talked \nabout changing welfare as we know it. For 2\\1/2\\ years, as my \ncolleagues will remember, we waited to see the President's welfare \nreform bill, to see how he was going to change welfare as we know it. \nAnd when we finally, after 2\\1/2\\ years of prodding, got to see the \nbill, it had three characteristics that came as a shock to most people.\n  First, it spent more money; second, it provided more benefits to more \nwelfare recipients; and, third, it hired more Government bureaucrats. I \ndo not believe that is what America has in mind when America is talking \nabout reforming welfare.\n  Now, in my mind, there are really two issues in welfare reform. One \nissue, and the most important issue, had to \n\n[[Page S 12690]]\ndo with the people who are involved. I want to change the system \nbecause never in history have we taken so much money from people that \nare pulling the wagon and given so much to people riding in the wagon, \nand made both groups worse off simultaneously.\n  Since 1965, we have spent $5.4 billion on our current welfare system, \nand since nobody knows what a trillion dollars is, let me try to \nconvert it into English. If you took all the buildings, all the plants, \nall the equipment, and all the tools of all the workers in America, \nthey would be worth slightly less than what we have spent on all means-\ntested welfare programs since 1965.\n  What has been the result of this massive expenditure of money? Well, \nthe result has been that we have made mothers more dependent, we have \ndriven fathers out of the household, and we have denied people access \nto the American dream. If we love these people, if we want them to be \nour equals, not just in theory but in fact, it seems to me that we have \nto reform the welfare system. And I am hopeful in the end we will have \nbipartisan votes in making that happen.\n  Here are the reforms that I think we need. I think we need a \nmandatory work requirement. I think able-bodied men and women on \nwelfare ought to get out of the wagon and help the rest of us pull. If \nthe best job somebody can get in the private sector pays $4 an hour--\nthere is dignity in working at $4 an hour--we can supplement their \nincome, but they will be contributing toward their own independence, \ntoward their own well-being.\n  If somebody cannot get a job in the private sector, then they can \npick up trash along our streets, they can help clean up our parks, they \ncan wash windows on our public buildings. But, again, they will be \nparticipating in the communities they live in. They will be part of \nbuilding a better country. And I believe that they will be richer, \nfreer, and happier for it. I think able-bodied men and women ought to \nhave to work the number of hours that their welfare check will bring at \nthe minimum wage.\n  When we started this debate, which has largely been a debate among \nRepublicans, unfortunately, we did not have a binding mandatory work \nrequirement in the bill, we did not have a pay-for-performance \nprovision in the bill. So from the point of view of the Federal \nGovernment and a mandatory work policy, we had a peculiar situation \nwhere we asked people to work; but if they did not work, we did not \nhave a mechanism that took away their check.\n  I am proud to say that has been changed. We now have a very strong \nwork requirement. I am very proud of that. I am very supportive of it.\n  The second thing we need to do is to stop inviting people to come to \nAmerica to go on welfare. People ought to come to America with their \nsleeves rolled up ready to go to work, not with their hand held out \nready to go on welfare.\n  The original bill that came out of the Finance Committee continued to \ninvite people to come to America to go on welfare and literally would \nhave allowed someone to come to America today as a legal immigrant and \ngo on welfare tomorrow.\n  I am proud to say that after a tremendous amount of work, that that \nis something that we have changed. Our bill now has people come to \nAmerica to work, not to go on welfare, and I think it is a dramatic \nstep forward.\n  We do have a dispute about how large the scope ought to be of block \ngranting. Should we just give AFDC back to the States and a few \ntraining programs, which is what the current bill does, or should we \ngive food stamps, housing subsidies, all training programs back to the \nStates and let the States run them? That is something we are going to \nhave to settle on the floor of the Senate. I think the more leeway we \ngive to the States, the more flexibility we give to the States, the \nbetter we are going to do.\n  The remaining issue that prevents us from having a consensus among \nRepublicans in the Senate--which is an indispensable ingredient, in my \nopinion, to building a bipartisan consensus and passing this--bill, is, \nwhat do we do about illegitimacy? I believe this is the biggest problem \nin the bill.\n  One-third of all the babies born in America last year were born out \nof wedlock. Under the current trend, illegitimacy could be the norm and \nnot the exception in America by the turn of the century. I think \nanybody who is not frightened by this prospect fails to understand that \nno great civilization has ever risen in history that was not built on \nstrong families. No civilization has ever survived the destruction of \nits families, and I do not believe America is going to be the first.\n  We have a system today that subsidizes illegitimacy. If someone is on \nwelfare and they take a job, they lose their welfare. If they marry \nsomeone who has a job, they lose their welfare. But if they have \nanother baby, they get more cash payments.\n  I am totally committed to the principle that we have to break the \nback of illegitimacy in America. We have to give people incentives \nunder the welfare system to be more responsible. We have to stop giving \npeople more and more money to have more and more children on welfare. I \nthink this is an indispensable ingredient.\n  No one is saying that when children are here and they are needy that \nwe are not going to help them. No one is saying we are not going to \nprovide children with services and with goods. But what we are saying \nis, it is suicidal to go on giving larger and larger cash payments to \npeople who simply have more children on welfare in return for more and \nmore cash money. That is a system that has to be changed.\n  We also have to do something about the perverse incentives that exist \ntoday where a 16-year-old can escape her mother, can get almost $14,000 \nin pretax equivalent worth of income simply by having a baby. By having \na baby, they can qualify for AFDC, food stamps, housing subsidies, gain \nindependence of their mother and then gain additional cash payment by \nhaving more and more children.\n  This is a system that has to be changed, and, again, the objective is \nto change behavior. When babies are born, we want to help them. We want \nto give them services, we want to give them goods, but we are not going \nto continue to pay people cash money in return for having more and more \nchildren on welfare.\n  This is an area where there is a deep division in our party. I \nbelieve there is room for consensus. I am willing to work with other \nRepublicans and with Democrats to find that consensus. But we are not \ngoing to end welfare dependency in America unless we want to deal with \nillegitimacy. This illegitimacy problem creates a permanent demand for \nwelfare, and if we are going to deal with the problem, if we are going \nto end welfare dependency in America, we are going to have to do it by \naddressing illegitimacy. You cannot reform welfare, you cannot, in the \nPresident's words, ``end welfare as we know it'' unless you are going \nto deal with illegitimacy.\n  I am committed to the principle that we have to end welfare as we \nknow it. I share the President's commitment. His program does not \nfulfill his commitment, something not unusual in Washington, DC, but I \nbelieve illegitimacy has to be addressed. A welfare bill that does not \naddress illegitimacy is not worthy of its name.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to improve the welfare reform bill \nbefore us by voting for this very important amendment known as ``Work \nFirst.''\n  Before the August recess, it was a relief that the majority leader \nagreed to wait until September for us to debate welfare reform so we \nhave some time. This is not a subject where we should pretend that \nlegislating is like ordering fast-food. Welfare reform is about very \nserious issues--the budgets for the States we represent and how many \nbillions of dollars will be spent or cut from those budgets; the rules \nqualifying families for assistance or denying them assistance; the \nsafety net for children, and whether it will survive; and other \ndifficult questions about taxpayers' dollars, people's lives, and yes, \nvalues. The Senate should take the time to produce legislation that \njustifies the word ``reform'' next to the word ``welfare.''\n  I hope that the recess provided time for each Senator to reflect on \nthese \n\n[[Page S 12691]]\nmajor questions that we have to answer when we act on welfare reform. I \nhope we will do that with our heads and our hearts. I hope we will \nthink about the stakes involved in welfare reform, for the people we \nrepresent, for our States, and for children.\n  For a long time, I assumed welfare reform would be one of history's \nendeavors that both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate would \nproduce together. After all, we presumably want changes in the welfare \nsystem to take root and bring about real, long-lasting results that \nmost Americans expect from all of us.\n  And let me be clear, the Congress and President should deliver on \nwelfare reform. It has been 7 years since we enacted any kind of \nsignificant change to the welfare system. We know it is time to attack \nthe problems with welfare again, with much more emphasis on personal \nresponsibility and on work. This is our chance, but with an obligation \nto deal with realities.\n  When I think of what West Virginians expect from welfare reform, the \nanswers are in this amendment, the Work First plan. It does something \nDemocrats sometimes have a hard time doing. We want to bury the past. \nOut with the confusing name for welfare assistance, AFDC. Out with \nwelfare's invitation to some people to live on the dole forever, while \ntheir fellow citizens struggle to make ends meet by working and \nscrimping. Out with the excuses for not working when you can work.\n  Simply put, Work First ends welfare as we know it, and creates a new \nbut temporary assistance program for parents with children. A \nfundamental change will be made from the first day: Work First requires \nparents to sign a tough contract--a Parental Empowerment Contract--in \norder to get benefits. This way, every parent will know from the \nbeginning that the rules and expectations are completely different. \nWork First will require work from every able-bodied parent, but also \noffer job placement, training when necessary, and child care so that \nthe work requirement can be met in the real world.\n  Work First is tough, but fair. We expect parents to work, but we also \nexpect America to still be a place that protects its children--the \nmajority of our population that gets help through welfare spending, and \nwho are getting forgotten and ignored in the political halls and talk \nshows where welfare is debated. As any parent knows, children need \ndecent shelter, clothing and food, and Work First includes the \nmechanism--through vouchers--to care for some of these needs. We should \nnot be punishing innocent children because of their parent's \nirresponsibility or bad luck.\n  Work First also retains the partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and States. The country as a whole has a stake in the future \nof each and every child regardless of where a poor child is born--in \nthe hollows of West Virginia or the neighborhoods of Houston, Chicago, \nor Kansas City.\n  Also, simply converting welfare spending into 50 or more block grants \nfor the States is not exactly real reform. I can completely understand \nwhy some Governors in office for the next few years are eager for the \nmoney. I was a Governor for 8 years, but I also remember what happened \nin my State when the block grants created by Congress in the early \n1980's stopped keeping up with need, by design. That is when Governors \nhave to find other programs to cut or raise local taxes or just watch \npeople and small children show up on the grates.\n  Having been a Governor, I want to see a welfare reform bill pass that \ngives States a lot of flexibility. But I also think some basic \nprinciples should hold in every State. The entire country should take \non the same challenge to promote work, responsibility, and protect \nchildren.\n  This alternative before the Senate, Work First, is tough where \nAmericans say they want welfare to be tough. Actually, back in 1982, \nwhen I was Governor, I struck a tough, but fair deal with many of the \nadults getting welfare in West Virginia. With our high unemployment \nthen, I said if you cannot get a paying job but still need a welfare \ncheck, fine, work for that check. The term is ``workfare.'' West \nVirginia's experience is also a reminder that we do not have to \ndemonize everyone on welfare. Many of the West Virginians in my State's \nworkfare program said they liked the approach. They hated having to \nresort to welfare, and with something productive to do--from cleaning \nstreets to jobs in government offices--they felt better about \nthemselves. Again, let us be sure we remember that a lot of people are \non welfare out of desperation. If they can get the basics--certain \nskills, some information, some child care--they are going to work.\n  I know it is tempting to just pretend that everything will get better \nif we just send a check, with no-strings attached, to Governors. It \nwould be nice to pretend that Governors will just take care of it. It \nis not that easy.\n  I do not think we should talk down to Americans about what it takes \nto get real results from welfare reform. Poor mothers and fathers need \nchild care just as much as the middle class. Think about it--we put \nparents in jail for leaving their children alone at home.\n  Some poor Americans simply have to get more education and job skills, \ntoo, so they qualify for jobs that earn a decent living for the rest of \ntheir lives. And when it is time to cut off the parents, it is not \nright to pretend children do not exist.\n  There are differences between the majority leader's bill before the \nSenate and this Work First amendment. Differences with real, human \nconsequences. Differences in how honest we are willing to be about what \nit will take to deliver on the promises and the political rhetoric of \nwelfare reform.\n  Americans are not exactly crusading for block grants as the \nprescription for welfare. They are expecting more than just a different \nplace to send the money. We are here to think about the kind of country \nwe can be and should be. We are here to be honest about what it will \ntake to move millions of poor Americans from welfare to independence. \nAnd I think we are here to regard every child in this country as \nimportant as the next one, no matter what State he or she happens to \ngrow up in.\n  The Democratic plan, Work First, has some essential elements, \nincluding honesty about what it takes to achieve real change in the \nwelfare system and how to keep children from being the ones punished. I \nhope it will get a serious look from everyone in this body over the \nnext days or however long it takes us to finish this legislative debate \non welfare. If there is a middle-ground, let us find it and work out \nour differences. And I urge every Governor to take a close look at \nthese issues again--and think about the next 10 to 20 years in our \nStates, not just the next couple of years. If welfare reform turns out \nto be Congress' slick, painless way to slash the Federal budget and \nleave States holding the bag, we are leaving some painful work for our \nsuccessors and for the people in our States.\n  We still have a chance to pass a bill to be proud of and one that is \nhonest about welfare, poverty, parental responsibility and other \nvalues, what it takes to work, and the children, who are two out of \nthree people on welfare. That is what should determine our votes and \naction before reporting to Americans that we have passed a bill that \nactually reforms welfare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask the Presiding Officer, what is the order of the day \nat this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no restrictions on debate.\n  Mr. BREAUX. No one is in charge of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will take this time in order to make \nsome comments about where we are and what I hope the ultimate result \nwill be.\n  I want to start off by saying there is no disagreement that the \nwelfare situation in this country is a mess. There is no argument from \nany Democrat that I know who would stand up on the floor of the Senate \nand say welfare programs are just fine and we should not do anything to \nchange any of them.\n  I think most Americans, whether they be independents, Democrats or \n\n[[Page S 12692]]\n  Republicans, would agree with the statement that welfare does not work \nvery well for those who are on it, nor does it work very well for those \nwho are paying for it. It is a program that really cries out for major \nreform. I think that is what this body is charged with doing, coming up \nwith a reform package that we can send to this President that he will \nsign, so when this Congress draws to a closure, we can say one thing \nthat we did that will benefit future generations and the very stability \nof this country is that this Congress, when we had a chance, was able \nto come together in a bipartisan fashion to reform the current welfare \nsystem, which we all agree does not work.\n  It does not work, as I said, for the people who are on it nor for the \npeople who are paying for it. Therefore, there is no disagreement on \nthe fact that we have a major problem facing us and that we should do \nsomething about it.\n  Then, of course, the question that divides us is how do we go about \nreforming the system? Some have said we in Washington, working with the \nStates in the past, have not solved the problem so we are going to give \nit all to the States. We are just going to walk away from the problem. \nLet us think of a phrase we are going to call it. How about block \ngrants? That sounds pretty good. People like that term. Let us say \nwelfare reform is going to be a block grant. I think most Americans \nwould say, ``What do you mean?'' They will say, ``The Federal \nGovernment has not solved the problems, so we are going to let the \nStates do it.'' I guess most people would say that makes sense. The \nFederal Government has not solved it so let the States do it.\n  Let me talk for a moment about that. This is a problem that cannot be \nsolved by the Federal Government here in Washington by ourselves, nor \ncan it be solved by the State governments, nor the county governments \nnor the city governments, nor in my State of Louisiana by the parish \ngovernments by themselves. This is a problem that cries out for all \nbranches of government, Federal, State and local, working together, to \ncome up with a real solution.\n  Block grants are like taking all the problems that we have with the \nwelfare program and putting them in a box, then wrapping it all up, \ntying a bow around it, and then mailing that box of problems to the \nStates, saying: Here, it is yours. It is a block grant.\n  It is a block grant of problems with less money to help solve those \nproblems. That, I think, is not a solution. It is an additional \nproblem. The real solution is to say that each State, of course, is \ndifferent. I have heard my Republican colleagues say that. I totally \nagree with that. States should have the authority to be innovative. \nWhat works in my State of Louisiana may not work well in the State of \nCalifornia. What works well in New York may not work well in Florida or \nLouisiana or any other State. So, clearly, each State has an absolute \nright and a need to be able to be inventive and to be able to come up \nwith solutions to the problems that are unique and will work in that \nState that may not work in some other State.\n  But that does not mean the Federal Government walks away from any \nresponsibility to participate in solving the problem. What some would \nsuggest is that a block grant means we in Washington are going to have \nto raise the money and pass the taxes and then ship the money to the \nStates and say, ``Do what you want with it, it is a block grant; no \nrestrictions, almost no guidelines, and spend it as you want.'' That is \nan abdication of our responsibility as legislators who are looking \nafter the interests of the American taxpayer.\n  I admit we in Washington have certainly not solved the problem by \nourselves very well. I admit the States have not solved the problem by \nthemselves. Therefore, I would argue that any solution has to be a \njoint venture, if you will, a partnership, if you will, between the \nStates coming up with their best ideas about what fits and the Federal \nGovernment coming up with our ideas and the financial help in order to \nsolve those problems. It has to be a partnership. It cannot be a \nwalking away and shipping the problem to the States. That is the first \npoint I want to make.\n  The second point is that the States have to participate. We use this \nphrase, ``State maintenance of effort.'' There are some, particularly \nmy Republican colleagues, who advocate we are going to let the States \npretty well do what they want with this block grant but then we are not \ngoing to require them to put up any money.\n  States have always, in the true partnership, had to participate in \nsolving the problem. That means raising local money through their tax \nsystem, putting up a portion of the money going into the welfare \nprogram so it can be used to help solve the problem, matching it with \nFederal funds. The Republican proposal, as I understand it, says no, we \nare not going to do that. The State does not have to put up anything if \nthey do not want to. They can just walk away from the problem \nfinancially and say, ``We are going to take all the money from the \nFederal Government. We are going to do what we want with it. And, by \nthe way, the money we used to spend on welfare, maybe we will pave the \nroads this year, or maybe we will give all the State employees a raise \nthis year. Maybe we will build some bridges this year. But we are not \ngoing to use it for the people who are in poverty in our own State.''\n  That is not a partnership. That is an abdication of the \nresponsibility that I think that we have, as Federal legislators and \nState legislators, to work together to solve the problem.\n  There should be a clear maintenance of effort by the States. We in \nWashington cannot say you have no obligation to do anything. That is a \ndefect that I think is very clear in their proposal which needs to be \nworked on. We will offer amendments to say the States have to be able \nto participate in helping us solve the problem. We cannot be \nresponsible for raising all the money and the States have no \nrequirement to do so and expect that to solve the welfare problem in \nthis case.\n  In addition, one of the other concerns I have is that the legislation \nthe Republicans are proposing takes middle-income job training programs \nand makes them into welfare programs. Why, I ask, is it appropriate for \nprograms that work to help dislocated workers, to help in vocational-\ntechnical training schools that train people, students in this country, \nprograms that are used for dislocated workers who everyday are finding \ntheir job is taken away from them through downsizing, and we have \nprograms to help retrain and relocate those people--why are we taking \nthose type of programs, which are basically programs that have done a \nwonderful job to help middle-income families in this country, and make \nthem into welfare programs? I think that is a serious, serious mistake.\n  Do we need to reform those programs? Do we need to consolidate them? \nAbsolutely. But we do not need to turn job training programs into \nwelfare programs. It does not fit. It cannot be forced to fit. You \ncannot put a round peg in a square hole no matter how hard you push, \nwithout doing grave damage to the block that you are trying to push it \ninto. And the same thing, I think, happens here.\n  Their proposal tells middle-income families that have had to get \nretraining because of dislocation and being laid off that all of a \nsudden those programs that were meant for you are going to be used by \nwelfare recipients and you are going to be left out. What about the \nmiddle-income families that those programs were designed for when they \nfind out these programs all of a sudden are going to be turned into \nwelfare programs? I think it is bad policy. It needs to be corrected. \nIt is not a solution to the problem. In fact, it aggravates the \nproblem, and it needs to be addressed.\n  Child care is another concern I have that I think we have to address \nvery seriously. How do you tell a teenage mother with two children, we \nare going to make you go to work but, by the way, there is no money for \nchild care? There is not a Governor that we have talked to, Republican, \nDemocrat, independent, or maybe not certain what they are, that has not \nsaid that this is a very serious problem. It is a serious defect in the \nRepublican proposal, to require the States to put three times more \npeople to work but to give them less financial assistance in order to \nmake it happen, to give them less money or in fact no additional money \nwhatsoever to pay for child care. \n\n[[Page S 12693]]\n\n  What is going to happen to the children? Who is going to take care of \na 2-year-old or a 1-year old if we put the mother into a job, which I \nthink is absolutely essential? The best social program we can pass is a \ngood job. But with that requirement that someone goes to work, there is \ngoing to be an obligation somewhere that somebody does something with \nthe children. Are they going to be left home alone, unsupervised, \ngetting into trouble, or causing more problems from the standpoint of \nhealth than they were before?\n  So they have a very serious defect in the sense that the child care \nprovisions are very deficient. It is one thing to say we are going to \nput three times more people to work. But you cannot do that unless you \naddress what is going to happen to the child care provisions. That \nneeds to be addressed. It needs to be worked on. It cannot in fact be a \nreal reform bill unless child care is addressed.\n  Another issue is the so-called family cap. I have heard some Members \ngive speeches that it is time for people who have been riding in the \nwagon to get out of the wagon and start helping pull the wagon. That is \na nice little phrase, and it sounds pretty good. But when you are \ntalking about throwing babies and children out of the wagon into the \nstreet, that is not what America is all about. That is not what this \ncountry stands for. Sure, make the people who can afford to pull the \nwagon, who are strong enough to pull the wagon, go to work. There is no \nproblem with that. But do not throw babies and children out of the \nwagon into the street and say that is welfare reform. That is not.\n  Children and babies do not ask to be born. They did not ask to come \ninto this world. There is a parent somewhere--in fact, two--that had \nsomething to do with bringing that child into this world. Punish them. \nRequire them to go to work. Require them to take training. Require them \nto be responsible. Force them to live in adult supervision. Force them \nto live with their parent or parents if there are some. But do not \npenalize the innocent child who did not ask to be born. What kind of a \ncountry are we that we are going to say if you are a teenage mother and \nyou have another child, you are not going to get any help for the \nchild? Why penalize the child? That is creating more problems, not \nsolving any problem.\n  So I suggest that this is a major defect with the Republican proposal \nthat has to be addressed. I cannot imagine any Member of this \ninstitution saying they are going to reform welfare by telling a \nnewborn baby that it is not going to get any help because its mother \nmade a mistake and it has been born into this world, and they cannot \nafford to take care of it. So it is out of luck. Go into an orphanage, \nor be put up for adoption. I think we have to be wiser than that in \nseeking solutions to what welfare reform ultimately has to be all \nabout.\n  So that does not solve the problem. That is a defect in their \nproposal to say that we are going to solve the illegitimacy problem in \nthis country by terminating any assistance to people with babies who \nare born into this world. That does not stop illegitimacy. That does \nnot help solve the problem. It creates more problems, not less. It \nabsolutely has to be addressed.\n  While I said what I think is wrong with the pending Republican \nproposal, I do think that there is a recognition in a bipartisan \nfashion that we have to do something. Our plan is called Work First. It \nabolishes AFDC. It starts off by saying there is no more AFDC. Every \ntime a person comes into a welfare office, they have to sign an \nemployment contract in order to receive any benefits. That contract is \ngoing to require them to do certain things. It is going to start moving \nthem into the work force.\n  We put time limits on how long someone can be on welfare assistance \nin this country, but we protect the child. We protect the children. We \nprotect the babies who are born into this world. Require the mother to \nlive at home, or require the mother to live in an adult-supervised home \nif there are no parents. Require them to move into the work force. Put \non time limits. Yes, do all of those things. But, yes, also provide \nchild care as we require people to move into the workplace, as we do \nthat.\n  So it is one thing to sound tough and to talk tough. But as we all \nknow, talk is cheap. It does not solve the problem. This problem is not \ngoing to be solved on the cheap. It is going to be solved only with \nthoughtful ideas and tax dollars being spent more wisely than we have \nspent them in the past in a recognition that we do need to make some \ndramatic changes.\n  I want to say something else, too. I will conclude with this: As I \nsaid in the beginning, this is a problem that the Federal Government \ncannot solve by itself and the States cannot solve by themselves. This \nis a problem that Democrats cannot solve by ourselves and Republicans \ncannot solve by themselves because we do not have enough votes, quite \nfrankly, to pass our bill without some help from the other side. On the \nother hand, I suggest that the Republican Party does not have enough \nvotes to pass this bill that will be signed into law without our \nparticipation.\n  So we are sort of joined together because we have to be. We have a \nchoice here. We can start talking to each other. We can start \ncooperating on some of these key issues that I mentioned. We can see \nwhere we can come together and devise a proposal that makes sense that \ncan be adopted. It may not be everything that I want or the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the \nmanager of the bill, wants; or it may not be everything that the \nRepublican leader or Senator Chafee, who is on the floor, wants. But I \nthink there is enough common ground here to help address these \ndifferences in a way that we get a compromise that works. By the way, \ncompromise is not a dirty word. It is a coming together of different \nopinions in order to accomplish something that makes sense.\n  Therefore, when we talk about fair compromises in the interest of \nsolving the ultimate problem, that is what this body is supposed to do. \nVery few times in this world in anything do we get our way all the way \nall the time. And this legislation, welfare reform, which is so \nimportant, is an area that cries out for some bipartisan cooperation, \nworking out our differences, because I am afraid that if we do not do \nthat, we will do nothing. If we are not willing to meet somewhere in \nthe middle on these difficult problems, we will have accomplished \nabsolutely nothing.\n  Some will say, ``But we have a good issue for the next election.'' I \nsuggest that the best issue for all of us is passing a real welfare \nreform bill that gets the job done.\n  I think all of our colleagues on this side are ready, are willing, \nand I think we are able to sit down in the sense of compromise and come \nup with a proposal that in fact gets the job done.\n  With that, at this time, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I just express the appreciation of \nall Members on this side, and I think on both sides, for the thoughtful \ncomments of the Senator from Louisiana. He has worked so very hard on \nthe bill now before us as a second-degree amendment that Senator \nDaschle and he and Senator Mikulski have put together. It is an effort \nto meet concerns that are shared on both sides of the aisle. He is \nright. We have succeeded in moving this subject forward when we have \nbeen together.\n  The Family Support Act passed out of this Chamber 97 votes to 1. We \nhad a clear consensus, a clear set of agreements. And we have been \nhearing repeatedly on the floor of programs that State governments have \nput in place which seem to be taking hold.\n  The Senator from Iowa was speaking just a few minutes ago about the \nproposal of Iowa, which passed, as he said, 98 to 2 in their \nlegislature. That is the program under that Family Support Act with \nbipartisan support that came from this Chamber out to the States. We \nhave something to show. It would seem such a loss to give all of that \nup at this point.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to join with the Senator from New York. Those were \nvery thoughtful remarks by the Senator from Louisiana. I hope we can \nget a bill out of this Senate that will really \n\n[[Page S 12694]]\nmake some real progress in welfare reform. So I think the Senator from \nLouisiana has made a constructive contribution. I express my \nappreciation to him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to add my kudos to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana for his comments. I share his sentiment that welfare \nreform needs to be bipartisan in nature. And we have had discussions \noff the floor that both sides have moved from the initial introductions \nof legislation, even here in the Senate, and have moved more together.\n  I think the Dole bill, as introduced, comes more toward a common \nground. And I hope--in fact, I am optimistic--that with some \nrefinements, we can get bipartisan support for the Dole package. I \nadmit that the Democratic leader's package has moved significantly from \npast welfare reform efforts that we have seen here on the Senate floor \nfrom the other side of the aisle. That is a constructive move in the \ndirection of real reform.\n  I have a few questions, if the Senator from Louisiana will just take \na few questions, about the bill that is on the floor. I know he was \nvery involved in drafting it.\n  I guess it is more of a concern that I have where I sort of see that \nthe bill falls a little short, and where we might be able to move again \nin a more constructive way forward.\n  Let me start out with three basic areas. One is the exemptions to the \nnew Temporary Employment Assistance Program. The Temporary Employment \nAssistance Program is a new program replacing the old AFDC program, \nwhich is the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program, which \ngenerally is conceived as welfare, the cash grant to a mother, in most \ncases, single moms with children. That program is eliminated under the \nDemocratic leader's bill and replaced with what is called the Temporary \nEmployment Assistance Program. But in the bill, there is provided a \nwhole laundry list of exemptions to the time limit on that program.\n  I guess I have a problem that the exemptions are so broad that it \nlooks, to me, that there are very few people who would actually be \nlimited in time, under this program, to the 5 years. And let me just \nread through some of the major exemptions.\n  No. 1 is an exemption for high unemployed areas. High unemployed \nareas in the bill is defined as an area that has an unemployment rate \nof 7.5 percent or higher. I believe just about----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  It is 8 percent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. OK.\n  Mr. BREAUX. We changed the date.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is under the revised legislation. I know even at 8 \npercent, because I have seen figures, most major communities, at least \nin 1994, would not have met that criteria, and would have been over the \n8 percent. So no recipient in that city, for the period of 1994, \nanyway--and my staff is now looking to see how far back that goes--no \nperson who lived in the city of New York, for example, would have had \nany of that time they spent on welfare count toward that 5-year limit.\n  I know there are many cities that have had unemployment rates of over \n8 percent far back for many years, and none of the people would be \nconsidered as time limited.\n  Many of them would----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I see that as a problem.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think the discussion is good. What our Work First bill \nsays is we require people to go to work. We know that if you live in a \nhigh unemployment area--we pick 8 percent because that is the same \nnumber that applies in the food stamp program. That is why we adjusted \nit to 8 percent. But we do not think it makes any sense to push a young \nmother out into the street if there are no jobs available in that area. \nThese people, however, would operate under the same rules as everybody \nelse. They are expected to engage in job search. And if, after 2 years, \neven in this high unemployment area, they are not working, they are \nthen expected to perform workfare, community service in return for \ntheir welfare benefits.\n  So when we are saying there are some areas where there are not any \njobs available, these people still have to engage in job search. And \nthen, after 2 years, if they are unable to find a job, they have to \nperform community service or engage in workfare in their local \ncommunity. They still have to do something, in other words, to get the \nbenefits.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would that be part of what we would consider your--I \nguess it is called the Work First employment block grant? Would that be \nunder the Work First employment block grant, after the 2-year \ntransition in that program?\n  I am just trying to understand.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is a legitimate question.\n  The short answer is yes, it is a requirement that after the 2 years, \nthey have to engage in community service, workfare programs, located in \nthat community.\n  In other words, what we are saying is there is no free lunch. They \nare not going to be able to continue receiving benefits for not working \nif they are capable of working.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Even if they are in a high unemployment area--I am \ngoing through the other exceptions here--even if their children are \nliving with other than a parent; even if you have a child who is ill or \nincapacitated, irrespective of all of these exemptions, after 2 years, \nyou have to go into some sort of community work program?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would say this is one of the areas that perhaps we \nagree on, State flexibility, because the State would have the \nflexibility to make that determination on what best fits the people in \ntheir State, would have the flexibility to determine the conditions and \nthe time restraints that would be effective in their particular States. \nSome States may be different than others.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does that apply just to those exemptions or the high \nunemployment exemption also, so if the State of New York, for example, \ndid not want the people to go to work in New York City? Or is that an \nautomatic? Is there no State flexibility there?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The point I make in response is that in the high \nunemployment areas, the 8 percent or above, they have to go to work. I \nmean, that is a requirement. They would have to engage in workfare or \ncommunity service or whatever.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Now, my understanding is also that one of the \nlimitations on this workfare program is that after 2 years, you then go \ninto the Work First employment block grant program, which requires you \nto perform--is it 20 hours, is that correct, 20 hours of some sort of \nwork?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Twenty hours. It actually goes into effect not after 2 \nyears; it goes into effect after 6 months. So that is a requirement \nthat starts from the very beginning of the program after 6 months, not \nafter 2 years. The community service, the 20 hours of community work or \nworkfare in their local community, is something that is kicked in very \nearly in the program, not after 2 years, but after 6 months.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I guess then my question is, let us say you have \nsomeone who is a single mom with a couple of children, and she is on \nthe program for 2 years and has been in job search and doing things \nthat are required under the temporary employment assistance part. She \nhits her 2-year limit and then is required, to continue on with those \nbenefits, to work.\n  Now, my understanding from the participation requirements is that 30 \npercent of your caseload would be in that situation, is that correct, \nin the year 1996? So you are talking about 30 percent would be in this \ntransition program, temporary program, and then would eventually get \ninto the block granted work program? Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am not sure I understand the direction the question is \nleading to in the sense that----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is you have participation rates. We \nhave participation rates in our bill and you have participation rates \nin your bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If I can respond to the Senator, I think the Senator may \nbe misreading the amendment that is pending with regard to \nparticipation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Now I ask maybe a broader question.\n  How many people who go into the welfare program have to participate \nin \n\n[[Page S 12695]]\nthis new program as designed by the leader's amendment? What is the \nparticipation--I know what it is in our bill. We eventually get up to \n50 percent, but we do not have exemptions.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think the Senator will find what we are trying to do in \nboth our bill and his is similar in that regard. We are talking about \nparticipation rates. We are talking about really work rates, not \nparticipating in a program.\n  We feel we have enough programs out there. We are not judging the \nsuccess of our bill on people participating in programs, but on \nparticipation in actual work. We go from 20 percent up to 50 percent in \nactual work, in jobs, in earning their benefits that they are \nreceiving--not participation in the sense of participating in a job \ntraining program, but actually require working; they move from 20 \npercent up to 50 percent in a work program, actually working.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So, again--and my analysis here may be a little dated \nbecause I know you have revised your bill and I may not have the \ncurrent analysis. That is why I am trying to understand.\n  So those who are required to work, in 1996, at least according to our \n30 percent of the State caseload, would have to be working in 1996?\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is correct. That is working; not in a program, \nactually working.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That goes up to 50 percent by the year 2000.\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And it is up to the State to determine who those people \nare that should be working or should not, which 50 percent. It is a \nState flexibility issue?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Very similar to the Republican proposal.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is the point I was trying to make. On this issue, \nit seems like there is some agreement that 50 percent is a fair figure \nand allows for some State flexibility in considering the fact that \nroughly a third of the parents who are on the current AFDC caseload are \ndisabled in one way or another. They have a disability or their \nchildren are disabled or there is some problem where they would not be \na good candidate for work and, therefore, would not be required under \nthe bill to have a work requirement. We allow the States the \nflexibility to determine that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. We allow the States flexibility because we believe, \nagain, in maximum flexibility, but we have exemptions that are \nexemptions with which I think most people would agree. You are talking \nabout people who are ill, incapacitated, someone with a child under 12 \nmonths old. There are certain exemptions we feel should be there and \nspell those out, but we still have the work requirements from 30 to 50 \npercent. That is locked in with some exemptions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me understand this. Maybe we are a little more \ndifferent than I thought we were. What you are saying is you take the \nentire caseload of people that are on welfare, and you say a certain \nnumber of them are ineligible because of an incapacity. I think that is \nthe term the current welfare law uses, ``incapacitation.'' We figure \nthat that number is roughly a third. So you take them out of the mix \nbefore you apply the 50 percent standard?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Well, it is 20 percent. That is correct. It would start \nfrom 20 percent up to 50 percent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thirty. I think it is 30 in 1996, up to 50 percent in \nthe year 2000, just according to the numbers I have here.\n  Mr. BREAUX. On the work rates; the Senator is correct on the work \nrates.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Right. So what you basically take is, let us say, 65 \npercent of the people who come into the program, and then by the year \n2000, half of the 65 percent must be in some sort of work program.\n  On the Republican side, we do not make that initial separation. What \nwe say is that 50 percent of the entire caseload, and it would be up to \nthe States' discretion, and I am sure they, in all likelihood, because \nof the expense of someone who has an incapacity of some sort, would not \nrequire them to work.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Does not the Republican bill have an exemption for moms \nwith children under 1 year old?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That would be the one exemption, but there is no \nexemption for someone who has a disability or something like that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will you disagree with that being a viable exemption?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My feeling is we should allow the States complete \nflexibility to deal with this issue instead of the overall goal of what \npercentage of the entire caseload should be in work. I think 50 percent \nis fair of the entire caseload, given the fact that we know a \nsubstantial number cannot work. It is usually around a third. That is \nwhat we found. We are even giving more of a fudge factor of another 15 \npercent or more of people who can work, but we are not going to require \nthem to work or the State required to put them to work.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield? Apparently you made some \ndecisions that exemptions from the national level are acceptable.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I said that would not be my preference. My preference \nwould be to have no exemptions at the Federal level. We allow the \nStates the ultimate flexibility to determine who is going to work and \nwho is not, given the standard of half, which is a fairly generous \nstandard where usually only around a third has a disability problem \nthat would make them ineligible for work.\n  We do allow, I think, a fair amount of flexibility. I just want to \nunderstand the difference, and the difference is that you would require \nhalf of two-thirds to work. We would require half of the entire \ncaseload.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I respond to the Senator by saying under our bill, we are \neven tougher on those who are capable of working, because we are \nrequiring by the year 2000, 50 percent are required to work. That is 50 \npercent of those eligible.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is saying his 50 percent is looking at \nthe whole broad range, a larger group saying 50 percent of them. We are \nsaying that when you find the people who are able to work, let us make \nsure you get them to work. I think we are even tighter than you are on \nthat particular point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know how you can be tighter if you have a \nmillion people--let us assume we have a million people in the welfare \nsystem in Pennsylvania, which is high, but let us say we have a million \npeople, and we say 50 percent of those people have to go to work. That \nis 500,000 people.\n  Under your standard, we say 667,000 are technically under your new \nprogram because the other 333,000 are ineligible right from the start, \nand if you take half of 667,000, you are now down to 333,000, not \n500,000. So we are going to have, in the case of a million, we are \ngoing to have 120,000-some more people working, required to work than \nunder your bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think what we are establishing by our conversation, and \nI think it is helpful in understanding the two approaches, is that we \nboth have requirements of people who are now on welfare to go into the \nwork force. Even the percentages, I think, are ultimately the same: 50 \npercent by a date certain.\n  We both have exemptions as to who should not be forced to work. Ours \nare more broad. We have people who are incapacitated, mothers with \nchildren under 1 year old. You have fewer exemptions.\n  I think the key point that needs to be made here is that we require \nthese people to be put to work, and we are going to help the States \nfund the programs that put them to work. The concern that I and other \nDemocrats have about the Republican proposal is that it is an unfunded \nmandate in the sense you are telling the States they have to meet these \ngoals, but not providing them any financial assistance in order to meet \nit. That is a bigger question, and I think is a legitimate question for \ndiscussion: How are the States going to meet these goals with less help \nthan they are getting now?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to answer that question. I would really \n\n\n[[Page S 12696]]\ndefer to the Governors of the States that have come to us and have been \nvery strongly in support of what we have been putting forward. How they \nare going to do it is, we are going to release them from all the \nFederal strings attached to the current program.\n  What Governors will tell you is they can run a much more efficient \nprogram than we can out of Washington through the States. I happen to \nbelieve--I had a conversation just this past week with my Governor from \nPennsylvania, Tom Ridge, a former Member of the House, who feels very \nstrongly if given the opportunity to design their own program, given \nthe existing amount of AFDC dollars coming through, existing amount of \nwhat was the Jobs Program coming through, which is what is in the \nRepublican bill, they cannot only design a better program, put more \npeople to work, get more people off the rolls, get people back into \nproductive work in Pennsylvania at less money, that without the hoops \nthey have to jump through here at the Federal level--I know the Senator \nfrom Oregon put up a chart earlier today about all the things you have \nto do to process someone through the system--we now provide that \nflexibility for them to be able to design their own system, which we \nhope and I believe will be a lot more efficient.\n  It is a good question. It is one I think most Governors would say \nthey would like the responsibility, the opportunity to design a program \nbased on. I know the Senator from Iowa was up here just within the last \ncouple of hours talking about what they have done in Iowa and the fact \nthey have cut caseload, they have cut the amount of money in the \nprogram. Why? Because they got a waiver to allow them to run their own \nprogram. So we have seen, even with the limited waivers that have been \nallowed already, programs that have spent less money, that have put \nmore people to work and have been better for the taxpayers and people \nin the system. I think we have seen a history that we can do this if \nthe States are given the opportunity to design a program.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield on that point, Governor \nThompson, who I think has done a good job of trying to reform welfare \nin Wisconsin, when he testified before the Finance Committee, made the \npoint very clearly that some States are able to do some of these things \nbecause they have the financial wherewithal to do it. But there are an \nawful lot of States, when they face a 50-percent requirement of putting \npeople to work with less money coming from the Federal Government, they \nare simply not going to be able to do it.\n  That is why the concept of a partnership, where the Federal \nGovernment puts up a certain amount and the States put up a certain \namount, a requirement that the States participate financially, is so \nimportant.\n  I think the discussion is good. I think there are some areas for us \nto meet in the middle. When I talk about a compromise, I am talking \nabout not just agreeing with the Dole bill. A compromise is your side \nmoving a little over to the middle of this aisle and our side moving \ntoward the middle on some of these things--we have some common goals \nand we are close, I think--in order to reach an agreement that the \nPresident can sign and that will ultimately be reform. I hope to \ncontinue to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania to reach that goal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. While the Senator from Louisiana is here, I want to say \nI very much appreciated this exchange. It made me feel like we are back \nin 1988.\n  There are two things to say. One is that there is a participation \nrequirement in existing law of 20 percent. It was put in the law in \n1988--to be phased in to 20 percent--with the clear expectation that as \nthe program took hold, the jobs program, it would move forward. In a \nbill before the Finance Committee--which the administration has \nabandoned, and I grant that--we moved that rate from 20 percent, as \nanticipated, on schedule just about, to 35 percent in 1998, to 40 \npercent in 1999, to 45 and then 50 percent in the year 2001.\n  What we lose in so much of what is on the floor right now is the \nspecific Federal funding to do this. Governors and mayors will look up \nin despair in 5 years.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, there will be on the desk very \nshortly now the estimates for the proportion of children on AFDC, \nwelfare, in 1993. These are estimated, but they are fairly accurate. In \nPhiladelphia, at any point in time, 44 percent of the children are on \nAFDC. In the course of a year, 57 percent are.\n  Now, those numbers overwhelm the system. Thirty years ago, when it \nwould have been 10 percent at one time and 13 over a time, you could \nsay, all right, Philadelphia, PA, you take care of this problem. I have \nwatched it come that these numbers overwhelm the city. These problems \nare so much deeper.\n  On last Saturday in Baltimore--the Senator from Connecticut will be \ninterested in this--there was a kind of public celebration as they blew \nup the Lafayette Public Housing Complex in downtown Baltimore. It \nhappened in Newark a year ago. It first appeared in St. Louis, where \nthe Pruitt-Igoe Houses were blown up in 1972. In the city of Baltimore, \nit was announced, and the mayor had the plunger, and they had T-shirts, \nand they made the most of it. They described the housing as \n``warehousing the poor.'' When it was built, it was a model complex. It \ngot awards everywhere. What a nice way to live, right downtown, and I \nthink they could see the harbor. They are going to replace them now \nwith townhouses. Eighty-five percent of the persons in the townhouses \nwill be on AFDC. Each will have a case manager from the Johns Hopkins \nSchool of Social Work. They will be very carefully attended to and all \nthese things. There will be townhouse case managers. How many \ntownhouses? There will be 317.\n  Those are the realities. How many hundreds of thousands of children \nin Baltimore will be eligible? I plead to a Senate that does not hear \nme on this. These numbers of people receiving welfare benefits are \nbeyond the capacity of the States and local government. Cutting off the \nFederal commitment that we have had for 60 years is an action bordering \non mindlessness. And I make the case with no very great expectation of \npersuading anyone.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. This \nmorning, the Senator from Oregon and I were going over these numbers. \nIf Philadelphia is 57, Detroit is 67. New York, which is larger, is 39.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New York that \nI think he makes a strong point that work programs are expensive to \nadminister. They are very expensive to administer.\n  I chaired the Republican task force last year in the House as a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee that drafted a bill that was \ndifferent from the bill that passed the House, but it provided a \nsubstantial amount more money for work programs. In fact, I think over \nthe 5-year period in the bill that I, in a sense, authored, we spent \n$12 billion more, understanding the expense of doing so. So I have some \nsympathy with what the Senator is saying as to the problems States are \ngoing to confront.\n  I am telling you, from the perspective of governors who I have talked \nto, they feel comfortable that if we removed all of the restrictions, \nwhich in a sense in the Republican bill we do--there are some, but very \nminimal--if we remove the restrictions in place, they believe they can \nget sufficient savings to be able to run a work program in addition to \nthe current AFDC program. I am hopeful that they can. I have my own \nskepticism. I hope they can. Given the budgetary realities, I think \nthat is going to be something we are going to challenge the Governors \nto do.\n  If we did nothing with the AFDC program--that program is not doubling \nevery couple of years or so. This is not a program projected to \ndramatically increase, and it is not that we are not keeping up with \nthe skyrocketing costs. I do not have the numbers in front of me--and \ncorrect me if you have them--but my understanding is that I think, in \nthe next 7 years, AFDC was to go from $16 billion to maybe $18 billion, \nsomething like that--maybe $19 \n\n[[Page S 12697]]\nbillion. It is an increase, but it is not like the numbers on AFDC are \ngrowing like we have seen on SSI and some other programs. In fact, we \nare seeing a lot of people on AFDC moving over to the SSI.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Which is 100 percent Federal money.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And more, because the benefits are more generous. I \nsuspect we will see more people moving from the AFDC rolls, in an \nattempt to claim some sort of disability to get into the SSI.\n  I suggest that given the fact that this program is not rapidly \nincreasing in many States--maybe New York and Pennsylvania being two of \nthem--we will see a leveling off and maybe even a decline where we have \nin those States an opportunity to get work into these programs and get \nsignificant cost savings. And we have provided in this bill a growth \nfactor of $1.5 billion, I think, over the next 7 years for the higher \ngrowth States to tap into more money to be able to deal with the \nincreases in AFDC population. So we have not completely turned our \nbacks to the possibility of growth.\n  We hope that with the combination of the Governors being able to \nredesign programs with some limited additional assistance from the \nFederal Government, we can handle those States that are having growth \nproblems in AFDC.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Here is my problem with the Republican proposal. We both \nhave the requirement that States put 50 percent of the welfare \nrecipients into work by the year 2000. We are the same on that \nessential provision. But the difference is that your proposal does not \nprovide the States with the funding to do that.\n  Here is my concern. It is that if they do not have the funding to do \nthat, they are not going to be able to meet that target. Your response \nto that, as I understand it, is that we are going to eliminate the \nredtape we now have imposed upon the States.\n  Now, my question is, what type of redtape are we going to be \neliminating that would give the States the extra funding that they need \nin order to put 50 percent of the recipients to work?\n  What type of redtape elimination is going to add up to those type of \ndollars in order to meet the 50 percent requirement that we both agree \nis an appropriate target?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Obviously, they can redesign the entire program. They \ncan redesign eligibility criteria. They can do a whole host of things \nthat put requirements in that we do not have now.\n  For example, you mentioned the work requirement. Several States have \nput in an immediate work requirement. I think it is Wisconsin that did, \nand we saw the number of people on welfare drop, by some enormous \nnumber like 20 or 30 percent, like that because people did not want to \nsign up and work.\n  I think we will see, and I think Governors believe if you make \nwelfare into a system that is a dynamic system where people are going \nto have their lives changed, turned around, back out, it is sort of--I \nthink of the Wizard of Oz. When Dorothy got to the Wizard of Oz, before \nthey saw the wizard, they went in and the scarecrow got stuffed full of \nhay and the tin man got all shined up.\n  If you see this as this program where you come in and try to change \npeoples lives as a dynamic process, in a shorter scope as opposed to \none that is more of a long-term maintenance kind of system, you will \nsee people opting out in some cases, so we have lower caseloads.\n  We have seen that happen in States that put those kind of \nrequirements in place, and we will see people on for less periods of \ntime, because if the system works well--I remember debating this in the \nHouse--if the system works well, people will not end up in the welfare \nsystem, because if it works well, we will get them ready for jobs and \nget them back into job placements.\n  That, to me, is what we have to sort of change--the entire psychology \nof what is going on here. I think what we have done is give States the \nflexibility to do that in a way that we have seen in other experiments \nworks very, very effectively.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield for a comment, I appreciate the \nWizard of Oz analysis. I am afraid it is more like an Alice in \nWonderland approach.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have small children.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Hopefully, we will see the merits of each other's \napproach before the day is over and reach an accommodation that does \nget the job done.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  I was enjoying and benefiting from the thoughtful colloquy between \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Louisiana, and, of \ncourse, as always, benefiting from the thoughtful comments of the \nSenator from New York.\n  I will say two things about what I just heard. One is that it is from \nthis kind of thoughtful colloquy that, hopefully, a bill will emerge \nthat has a strong bipartisan base of support. We will see whether that \nhappens.\n  Second, I say to my friend from New York who raised the question a \nmoment ago of whether anybody is listening, I am listening. I have \nalways found the Senator from New York to be right on target on these \nmatters. Sometimes the role of the prophet is not to have the masses \nbehind him, but if you speak the truth, ultimately they will come to \nyou. I think that is where we are today.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the substitute that is now pending \noffered by Senator Daschle, Senator Breaux, Senator Mikulski and many \nothers. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the so-called Work First \nplan, which really represents a genuine attempt at welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, before I speak about this pending substitute, I do \nwant to say a few words about the colloquy that we have just heard and \nthe comments of the Senator from New York.\n  This is a real test for this Chamber, for the body politic, as to \nwhether we can do what is right and what is reasonable on the question \nof welfare. I have yet to find, and I will be glad to present an award \nto, anybody who can present to me an elected official who will support \nthe status quo regarding welfare in America today. No one does. \nEveryone is for reform of one kind or another. The question is what \nkind will it be.\n  Do we have the capacity to break out of the business of competing \nimages, even our own perspectives--sometimes accurate, sometimes \nskewed--on what is causing this dreadful problem not just of poverty \nbut of the underlying problem of babies being born in increasing \nnumbers to mothers who are not married, and who do not have fathers?\n  That is the main way people get on welfare, because it is aid for \ndependent children. One of the most frequent ways that one qualifies \nfor welfare, is when one is born in a situation where one's parents \ncannot support them. Over and over again in the millions--not the \nthousands, but the millions--there are children being born to parents \nunmarried and therefore needing welfare.\n  These are central challenges, not just to our capacity to be \nreasonable and to break through the competing images and politics and \nto do something thoughtful, to prove that Congress can legislate, break \nthrough the politics, shake up the system, make it work, make it \nreflect the values of the American people as the American people are so \nconvinced it does not now--that is, the welfare system does not now \nreflect their best values.\n  Mr. President, this is a welfare program that started with such good \nintentions in the 1930's and now is disparaged by those who benefit \nfrom it and by those who pay for it. It is a program that has grown \nvery, very large--billions and billions of dollars every year.\n  Part of what is at work here is our ability to prove as elected \nrepresentatives of the people of this country that we are capable of \nchanging the status quo if they are not happy with it. A problem that \ntook 60 years to get into will not be solved in 6 days or maybe not \neven in 6 years. The effort did begin with the Family Support Act, \nwhich I consider to be an act of genuine welfare reform. I believe that \nthe Daschle substitute which is before the Senate continues that work.\n  To me, with the prevailing mood in this country of questioning the \ncredibility, the legitimacy, the effectiveness \n\n[[Page S 12698]]\nof Government to step out and deal with real problems, part of the test \nthat we are facing in this welfare reform debate is a more general one, \nwhich is, are we capable of truly dealing with this program that has \ngone off the course, bringing it back to be cost effective, to be \nhelpful to people who are beneficiaries of the program, and to better \nreflect our values?\n  Let me deal with that second point. Part of the great public anger \nabout welfare is the perception, too often accurate, that it does not \nreflect the best of American values. When programs of our Government, \nparticularly ones as central and large as this one, do not reflect the \nvalues of the American people, we lose their support. It is as simple \nas that.\n  What is a great basic American value? We speak about it so much it \nloses its meaning. It is work. It is work in the broader sense, in the \nsense that this is an impulse that drove so many of our parents and \ngrandparents and great grandparents before them to come to this \ncountry. Not just, of course, the dream of political freedom which \nimpelled millions of Americans--millions--to emigrate to America, but \nthe dream of economic opportunity, the understanding of people who came \nfrom feudal, oligarchic, unfair economic systems where they had no \nopportunity that America was the country where, if you worked hard, \nthere was nothing you could not achieve.\n The welfare system seems to have turned this on its head, motivated by \ngood intentions, charitable intentions at the outset, and created a \nsystem that does not encourage work, that seems at times to reward the \nopposite, and that offends the great majority of people who are out \nthere, working hard, who, too often in the last decade or two, do not \nsee their standard of living going up but do see themselves paying \nlarge tax bills and believe in their minds, understandably, that a lot \nof that money they worked hard for goes to people who are not working \nas hard, not reflecting the values of work in this country.\n\n  Family, in this society and other societies, the core unit, the \nbasic, primal sense of responsibility, the kind of natural division of \nfamilial labor between man and woman, mother and father, is destroyed \nin our society in numbers, as the Senator from New York has pointed \nout, that we do not find--I have heard him say this--in other \nsocieties. Increasing numbers, more than a third of the babies, as I \nsaid before, are born in this country every year with no family, a \nmother living alone without a father, a desperate situation causing all \nsorts of problems for our society including contributing greatly to the \nproblem of crime and violent crime.\n  But the point I make here, as I speak about values, is that of the \nbasic value of parents caring for their children. Let me focus on the \nfathers, whose absence is the cause of so many millions of mothers \nhaving to go on welfare, fathers not accepting and carrying out what we \nwould think would be the most fundamental, uncomplicated, natural sense \nof obligation: to take care of their children.\n  So, this program, as it exists, offends some basic American values. \nIt challenges us to bring the program into line with those values, to \ngather more support, to open the way for the American people to return \nto their basic nature, which is to be charitable, which is naturally to \nwant to help people who cannot help themselves. But the majority of \nAmerican people, I am afraid, feel that welfare, as it exists now, \ntakes advantage of their good natures. I think part of the challenge \nthat we have is to break through and reform this program, genuinely \nreform it so it reflects the values held by most Americans and once \nagain liberates their better natures to care for those who cannot care \nfor themselves.\n  I will make one final point in this opening, general part of my \nstatement, Mr. President, which is this. The Senator from New York \ntouched on this as he talked about the extraordinary percentages of \nchildren in various of our cities who are at one time or another on \nwelfare, AFDC: 47 percent, 67 percent. These are astounding numbers, \nbut they bring me to make this point.\n  I want to urge my colleagues here to go forward with a certain sense \nof humility and caution, understanding that as we reform welfare we are \nnot dealing here with widgets. We are not dealing here with constructs \nof wood and metal and paper. We are dealing here with people, and \nparticularly with millions of children--if I may say so, millions of \nGod's children--whose fate it was, through no act of their own, to be \nborn poor, to be born, in the majority of cases, with only one parent \naccepting any responsibility for them.\n  So, as we go forward, understandably in the direction of reform, I \nhope we will remember that it is these children who are going to be \naffected and that they are innocents. Let us innovate, let us demand, \nlet us come down hard on those whose misbehavior is the cause of this \nsystem that in so many ways has failed. But let us not punish the \nchildren. And let us not leave the streets of our cities and towns full \nof children for whom no one will take responsibility. We do not want a \ncountry like that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for just a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Certainly I will.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I know he would be aware, he is speaking so well, so \nfeelingly and wisely, that in 1992 the number of children born to \nunmarried women was 1,224,876 souls, one and a quarter million children \nin 1 year.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say to the Senator, the numbers are overpowering. Of \ncourse, remember, as we think of the accumulated welfare rolls, we are \ntalking about those children, in a sense, times 18--it comes out to a \nlittle bit less--but until they reach the age of majority. That tells \nus two things. One is the extraordinary number of children involved \nhere. And second, the extraordinary cost of the program. I saw a number \nabout a year or two ago that said in any given year we spent $34 \nbillion on children born out of wedlock. That is an amazing number, $34 \nbillion. That is the accumulation of funding to support children from \nbirth to 18.\n  So this program needs reform, but let us do it with a sense of \nhumility and understanding about the human impact of what is happening \nhere.\n  Mr. President, let me come now to the so-called Work First plan, \nintroduced by Senator Daschle and many others of us. I think this is \nreal reform that would improve the lives of welfare beneficiaries, \nbreak the cycle of dependency, better serve the taxpayers of this \ncountry, and better reflect the values of the American people. The \nprimary welfare program in this country, AFDC, is failing in what ought \nto be its most important task--moving welfare beneficiaries into the \nwork force. We have seen some improvement as a result of the jobs \nprogram coming off of the Family Support Act. This Work First plan \ncontinues that improvement by changing the strategy and devoting the \nresources for moving real people into real jobs.\n  This proposal would also give welfare beneficiaries some genuine \nincentives to break the cycle of poverty, give them the same incentives \nthat we have associated with characteristic American values instead of \ntrapping them, enslaving them in dependency by discontinuing current \nprograms that reward single parents who do not work, do not marry, and \nhave children out of wedlock.\n  These are steps that many of us on this side are united in taking \nbecause the existing system really does contradict our most cherished \nvalues and contributes to society's most serious problems. The Work \nFirst plan actually replaces the AFDC program, so welfare as we have \nknown it will not exist if the Daschle substitute is adopted. It \nreplaces AFDC with a Temporary Employment Assistance Program that is \nfocused on putting people to work. It gives States the flexibility and \nthe incentives they need to successfully move people into the private \nsector for jobs.\n  It also addresses two of the key causes of welfare dependency that I \nhave spoken about. Through child support enforcement it finally forces \ndeadbeat dads to assume at least their financial responsibility, and it \nstarts a major national campaign to reduce out-of-wedlock births, \nparticularly to teenagers.\n  Mr. President, others have said it but I will say it again, and it is \nvery important to say. While preserving the kind of guarantee that \nthose who are genuinely poor and unable to work will receive some \nbenefits, the minimum assistance consistent with what I have described \nas America's best charitable \n\n[[Page S 12699]]\nnature, the Work First substitute ends unconditional welfare benefits. \nEach person receiving assistance will have to sign an individualized \npersonal empowerment contract. This is something new that has come up \nfrom the States.\n  As the Senator from Iowa indicated earlier, if the recipients do not \ncomply with the contract--in other words, you do not just get the \nbenefit but you have to promise in a signed contract to do some things \nin return, including, of course, looking for work from day one on \nwelfare--then the beneficiaries will lose some, and ultimately could \nlose all of their benefits if they do not comply with their end of the \nbargain--mutual responsibility.\n  While the contract may include some training for education, the \nemphasis is going to be on work experience. All recipients will be \nrequired to search for a job from day one. Eligibility for benefits is \ngoing to be limited to 5 years, although children whose parents reach \nthis time limit will still be eligible for vouchers to enable them to \nreceive basic sustenance. This I think reflects the principle, the \nvalue, that I described earlier, which is that these are kids. These \nare innocent kids. Let us not punish them more than they deserve while \nwe are trying to solve this problem, and unintentionally create a \ngreater problem for our society.\n  States under this Daschle substitute must focus this program directly \non placing people in private sector jobs. As has been discussed in a \ncolloquy between the Senators from Louisiana and Pennsylvania, the bill \nrequires States to have at least 50 percent of their caseload working \nby the year 2001. It moves away from telling States how to succeed and \ninstead rewards results. States that have high private sector job \nplacement rates will receive a financial bonus.\n  Mr. President, the work requirements in this bill are tough, and just \nas important, they are funded. We understand that child care assistance \nis the critical link between welfare and work. Unlike the alternative \nproposal, this substitute gives States the child care funding they need \nto put people in jobs and move them off welfare.\n  Mr. President, I noted a discussion among my colleagues a short time \nago about the importance of trying to achieve a bipartisan result. I \ncould not agree more. I recall the Senator from New York indicated the \noverwhelming bipartisan support for the Family Support Act of 1988.\n  As you look at these bills, as I have, there is a lot that holds them \ntogether. There is a lot in common. I hope we can build on that common \nbase in the next week as we move toward passing legislation. In some \nways, it has actually been quite gratifying to watch the bills change, \nand in this sense, watch Senator Dole's bill as it has evolved. The \nfirst major change, as I see it, was related to the so-called \nparticipation requirements in the original version of Senator Dole's \nbill. These requirements for the States did not require the States to \nmove beneficiaries into jobs, as I read the original proposal. That has \nnow changed. And work standards very much like those included in the \nDaschle substitute are now included in the Dole bill. And there, I \nhope, is one common basis from which we can build.\n  Mr. President, the Daschle substitute also tackles the critical \nproblem of teen pregnancy. Unmarried teen parents are particularly \nlikely to fall into long-term welfare dependency. More than one-half of \nwelfare spending goes to women who first gave birth as teens.\n  This legislation, among other things, requires teen mothers to live \nat home and helps communities establish supervised group homes for \nsingle teen mothers; that is, second-chance homes.\n  Mr. President, within the last couple of years, I have been so \nperplexed by this problem of babies being born to unmarried mothers. I \nhave spent some time visiting programs in Connecticut, visiting with \nteens, trying to understand how this has happened, how these numbers \nhave skyrocketed as they have. I do not have any conclusive answer. But \none thing I found in some of my conversations with young women who have \nhad babies while they were teenagers is when you ask them, ``Why? Why \ndid you do it,'' it is very interesting. Almost every time I have had \nthis conversation, the mothers will say, ``I love my baby, but I wish I \nhad waited.'' Of course, in that, they are acknowledging that it is not \nonly the child born to the unwed mother in poverty that suffers. It is \nthe mother, whose dreams are severely restricted as a result of \nsuddenly having a child to care for.\n  But once you get beyond that, and they say they wish they had waited, \nand you ask why this happened, some just give the obvious answer. ``I \ndid not use birth control.'' I found others saying that they did it \nintentionally. They had the child because they wanted to get out of \ntheir homes. They wanted to be independent. And they knew that if they \nhad a baby, they could receive welfare payments and that would be the \nbasis for establishing their independent residency. Obviously, that is \na sad and sorry commentary--I shall leave it at that--as a motivation \nfor bringing a child into the world.\n  But this Daschle substitute gets to that problem by removing that \nmotivation, by requiring teenaged mothers to live at home or live in \nthe supervised group homes, if their home is not a suitable \nenvironment, and by requiring teenaged mothers to remain in school or \nin a training program, all as a condition of receiving welfare \nbenefits. No longer will there be a blank check regardless of the \nbehavior of the recipient. Instead, we will demand mutual \nresponsibility. Society will try to take care of your child. We will \ntry to help you out of dependency, but only if you make the effort \nyourself.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this Daschle substitute incorporates very \nstrong child support enforcement legislation which Senator Bradley and \nothers introduced earlier this year. I was privileged to be a cosponsor \nof it. I was attorney general of the State of Connecticut, before I was \nhonored to be elected by the people of my State to serve in this body. \nOne of my responsibilities was enforcing child support orders. I was \nstartled, as I went through the files--thousands of them--to see the \ndegree to which men who had fathered children refused to accept fiscal \nresponsibility, financial responsibility for those children, and found \n100 different ways to try to avoid or make excuses for not doing so.\n  The legislation that is part of the Daschle substitute will make it \neasier for States to locate absent noncustodial parents; that is, \nparents not having custody of the children, almost always the fathers. \nIt will also make it easier for States to establish paternity. Science \nhas been a great help here in facilitating the establishment of \npaternity through blood tests, and also establishing a court order and \nenforcement of court orders. The tough child support enforcement system \nwill help keep millions of children out of poverty and off welfare. It \nis a simple statement. It is as simple as the fact that when babies are \nborn to unwed mothers, they are much more likely to end up on welfare. \nBut the fact is that if fathers took care of the children, society \nwould not have to do so and the welfare rolls would go down.\n  Of course, these tough child support enforcement laws will send a \nmessage of responsibility to would-be deadbeat parents, deadbeat dads. \nIn an era of skyrocketing out-of-wedlock births and rising teen \npregnancy rates, child support payments must become a clearly \nunderstood, highly visible, and unavoidable fact of life for absent \nparents. In other words, these absent parents must live in fear of \ntheir local prosecuting attorney or attorneys general coming after them \nto make sure that any money they earn will go in a substantial degree \nto supporting the children they have fathered.\n  Mr. President, I will have an amendment that I will introduce later \nin the proceedings that expands the effort to deal with teen pregnancy, \nbuilding on some work done by Kathleen Sylvester of the Progressive \nPolicy Institute\n establishing a highly visible national campaign to cut the rate of \nteenage births, setting goals for States, giving them some money to \ninnovate with programs to cut the rate of teen pregnancies, and \nrewarding them as we do with regard to placement of people in private-\nsector jobs when they achieve a reduction in teen pregnancies.\n\n  One of the dreadful facts that comes out as we go over this problem \nof teen pregnancies is that a remarkable percentage of the babies born \nto teenage mothers have been fathered by men \n\n[[Page S 12700]]\nwho are considerably older. So the vision that we may have of two \nreckless teenagers casually creating a baby is not the norm. As I \nunderstand it; it is men who are typically older than these teenaged \ngirls who, in a setting that is often abusive, exploitive, or \noverpowering, are fathering these children in acts that from a legal \npoint of view are pure and simple statutory rape.\n  And there is not much we can do from Washington to deal with that \nexcept to--and my amendment will have some element to it that will--try \nto encourage the States, the local prosecuting attorneys, the district \nattorneys to be very aggressive in working with the welfare authorities \nto once again take statutory rape as a serious crime and to prosecute \nit, understanding that this is done to deter adult men from committing \na sexual act that will result in a child born to poverty, who to a \ndevastating degree is likely to end up a part of the criminal problem \nin society.\n  So I hope we can begin to take from these statistics of the ages of \nthe men who are fathering too many of the children born to teenaged \nmothers, some attempt to build a genuine national effort among \nprosecuting attorneys to look at the seriousness of a crime that in an \nage of permissiveness has been winked at, which is statutory rape.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I think this Daschle substitute, the \nWork First plan, is true welfare reform. It does demand responsibility \nfrom parents while providing continued protection for children, and it \ndoes address the two key causes of welfare dependency--teen pregnancy \nand unpaid child support. It does reflect the values of the American \npeople. And it does take on the welfare status quo, building on the \nwork of the Family Support Act, and really does amount to genuine \nwelfare reform. I understand that over the next week we will hear \nconflicting views on this subject. But I can only echo the sentiments \nexpressed earlier in this Chamber, let us cut through the politics, let \nus get to the heart of the problem. And let us see if we can, as \nhappened in 1988, resoundingly adopt a true welfare reform proposal. I \nthank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \nextraordinary, moving, judicious, serious comments. I know his capacity \nfor sometimes biblical patience, and I also know his capacity for \nindignation when things have gone on for too long. We have been too \nlong on the subject.\n  In 1971, a Republican President, President Nixon, had proposed a \nguaranteed income as a substitute for this subject. It was H.R. 1 in \nthe House of Representatives. And it happened that on February 8, 1971, \nall three of the then major news magazines--and still those--had the \nsubject of welfare on their covers. News Week on its cover had welfare. \n``WELFARE: There Must Be a Better Way,'' it said of the President's \nprogram, ``It will constitute a humanitarian achievement unrivaled \nsince the New Deal.'' It was not humanitarian enough for Democrats; too \nhumanitarian for some Republicans.\n  The cover story of Time was devoted to ``The Welfare Maze.'' It \nbegan: ``The U.S. welfare system is a living nightmare that has reached \nthe point of the involuntary scream and chill awakening.'' That is how \nTime began its issue.\n  The cover story of US News & World Report: ``Welfare Out of Control--\nStory of Financial Crisis Cities Face.''\n  Now, in that year, sir, the illegitimacy ratio for the nation was \n11.2 percent. It is now three times that, the number of children born \nin that circumstance. Where we have 1,225,000 today, in 1971 it was \n400,000. It is three times, almost, that ratio. The ratio has increased \nby a factor of three, the number of children by a factor of three. That \nis the central phenomenon.\n  I think the Progressive Policy Institute has been very helpful in \nthis regard. There is this phenomenon of statutory rape. As deviancy \ngets redefined, we do not think much of that anymore. But it is still \nlaw.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is right.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. What would the Senator hypothesize? Would the Senator \nhypothesize that the households in which the children grow up no longer \nhave anyone who will defend them? ``You can't come in here. And you \nwill please go out there and close the door behind you.''\n  Lee Rainwater, a whole generation ago studying the public housing in \nPruitt-Igoe in St. Louis, wrote an essay on the feeling within a \nhousehold, ``Can you say no to someone who wants to come in?'' A \nthought that perhaps would not occur to many persons here. Close your \ndoor at night, and that is it. Close yours, and I close mine.\n  The French sociologist, Henri Bergson spoke at the turn of the \ncentury of society becoming a dust of individuals--no ties. I think \nthis new data on ages of the fathers suggests that. I think you are \nabsolutely right; if anybody could mobilize the attorneys general, the \nSenator from Connecticut could. I will certainly support that \namendment. I look forward to it. And I thank you for your comments. I \nknow the Senator from Pennsylvania would agree we are trying to reach \nsome understandings here. We have understandings. And where we have \ndifferent assessments, well, that is why we have the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I very briefly want to thank the Senator from New York \nfor his kind words. He has made here what is to me a very important \npoint, a very stunning point, and I just want to repeat it if I may, \nwhich is that there is a way in which the collapse of the family opens \nthe door, in the metaphor that the Senator has used, to the further \ncollapse of the family. And we are, of course, generalizing here. There \nare many circumstances where this does not take place. But if you have \na situation where babies are born to unmarried women and there is no \nfather in the house, then as the baby, if it is a girl, grows up, will \nthe mother be able to alone protect the child from a man who may be a \npredator? And I understand it is much more complicated in many cases \nthan that.\n  But there is a way in which nature has created this unit, and we all \nhave our roles to play in it. The single, poor mother may be ill-\nequipped to alone defend her child, against a man whose intentions are \nnot good. The Senator is right, we do not enforce these statutory rape \nlaws anymore, but they are statutory. These acts are illegal, and they \nare illegal for a good reason. The consequences are disastrous, and I \nthink if we can put some fear out there by more vigorously enforcing \nthese laws, we not only will be doing what is right, but we may \nactually have an effect on the rate of out-of-wedlock births.\n  I thank the Senator from New York. I personally thank the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, not only for the thoughtfulness of his earlier \ncomments, but for the kindness of yielding the floor to me. I went on a \nbit longer than I expected to, but I appreciate very much his kindness \nto me.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut, for his thoughtful comments and for his kind \nremarks about me. I look forward to working with him and others in, \nagain, trying to craft what I believe will be a bipartisan solution to \nthis problem. We may not get the resounding vote that we got in 1988 in \nthis Senate on this measure, but I think the measure that passes in the \nSenate this year will be quite significantly more dramatic than what we \ndid in 1988. When you stretch the envelope, you leave more people \nbehind. There is, in a sense, less consensus.\n  I think it would be easy to craft something that is watered down that \ncould get everybody's vote here, but I do not think we would accomplish \nwhat we set out to accomplish, which is truly reforming the welfare \nsystem.\n  I am hopeful we can stretch the envelope, be bipartisan and really \nhelp millions of Americans get out of poverty.\n  I rise to just finish up on some of the comments and discussion I was \nhaving with the Senator from Louisiana. He asked, really, the question \nthat is asked probably most about the Republican proposal, which is how \nare States going to be able to put people to work and run these work \nprograms and, at the same time, do that, which is very \n\n[[Page S 12701]]\nexpensive, with a flat amount of funding, given that some States are \ngoing to see increases in poverty population? I mentioned the fact \nthose States that do experience increases, we do have a pot of money \nthere that would help them.\n  What about just dealing with the increased cost of providing for a \nwork program? I cite an example of Riverside, CA. The Senator from New \nYork, on many occasions, has cited Riverside, CA, as an example of an \nexisting program that seems to be having some good results in a work-\nrelated program, the GAIN program, and other Members on the floor have \ndone the same thing.\n  I just state for the Record that in Riverside, and I will add Grand \nRapids and Atlanta, those three programs combined, which have gone into \na program that is a work program that requires a substantial investment \nof time and energy on the part of the welfare recipient, is this \ndynamic program that I believe the States would go to under the \nRepublican proposal.\n  In those areas, what we have seen is a dramatic cost savings. So, \nassuming that this could be replicated on a State level, we are seeing \nflat funding, yes, but in these three communities that put this program \nin place, this work requirement and other kinds of dynamic turnover off \nthe welfare roles back into productive society, there was a 22 percent \nreduction in AFDC--22 percent reduction in AFDC. Not flat, not an \nincrease. They saved 22 percent in costs. Their caseload went down 16 \npercent overall. Food stamps went down 14 percent.\n  So to suggest that we have to pump in more dollars to accomplish this \npurpose of putting people to work I do not think meets with the \nnumbers. And, by the way, Riverside, CA, had a 9 percent unemployment \nrate at the time. So we have the exemption for anything over 8 percent \nthat you do not have to go to work, you do not have to go to work in \nthe temporary assistance program. You can do it.\n  I can tell you, I come from southwestern Pennsylvania. We have had \nsome very tough economic times and continue to have them. I can tell \nyou there are lots of people who say, ``Look, there are jobs out there, \nyou just have to go out and find them and be willing to work and go do \nit. It proves the case that, No. 1, there are jobs out there and you \ncan save money in the process and run a better program that is being \nlauded by both sides of the aisle.\n  So the numbers of what we have seen of what has been successful in \nthis country prove that you can run a program with less money, get \npeople off welfare into work even in high unemployment areas. I think \nwhat we have seen is you have these programs that really do focus on \nthe individual, and they provide what the individual needs. That is not \na check the first of the month and, ``Thank you, ma'am,'' and out the \ndoor, but it is care and concern and cooperation and an intensive \ndesire by the people in the system to see that person who walks through \nthat door who has had a tough run of luck in a problem situation get \nthat kind of assistance they need to turn themselves around.\n  I have another comment I want to make about the discussion I had with \nthe Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just to make a \nunanimous consent request for staff on the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Debra Wirth, \na fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of the welfare debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what we talked about was the 8 percent \nfigure as any area of what I thought was a Bureau of Labor Statistics \narea, which is a geographical area defined by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics as an area they will then determine the number of people, \nthe percentage of people in that area that are unemployed.\n  If those areas are above 8 percent, in the Democratic leader's bill, \nthose people who reside in those areas that have an unemployment rate \nof over 8 percent, that time in which they live in those areas of high \nunemployment does not count toward their 5-year limit. In fact, it can \nbe indefinite.\n  What I found out was that, yes, it was 7.5, they raised it to 8, but \nthey eliminated the requirement that they had to be a defined Bureau of \nLabor Statistics area, that the State could now define what the area \nwould be. It could be an entire State. It could be a portion of the \nBureau of Labor Statistics area. It could be a neighborhood.\n  What it does is it makes this determination completely arbitrary on \nthe part of the State, potentially even indecipherable, because you \ncould have literally neighborhoods picked out or communities picked \nout.\n  I think it is poor policy, but I think it creates a huge loophole in \nthis whole area of exemptions from the time limit on welfare, not a \nstep in the right direction. They gave with one hand and took away with \nthe other. They gave by increasing the unemployment rate from 7.5 to 8 \npercent, and then they said we will define where the area is, we will \nnot use the current Bureau of Labor Statistics area, we will let the \nStates determine what they mean. That really does take away any real \nchange in that policy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does not the Bureau of Labor Statistics--who does the \nsurvey right now on unemployment, officially?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And the Senator is concerned they continue to do the \nsurveys? I do not quite understand the Senator's position.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, no. In the Democratic leader's bill, what they have \ndone with their most recent modification is eliminate the boundaries \nfor determining who would be eligible for the exemption from the 5-year \nlimitation. And so----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to address the Senator from Pennsylvania directly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will check this out and have an answer for you \ndirectly, but I believe the actual surveys of household unemployment \nare done by the Bureau of the Census and the data is analyzed by the \nBureau of Labor Statistics.\n And I think you are on to a point which should be resolved. I will do \nmy best to do so. I thank the Chair.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New York. There are two \nadditional points I wanted to make. No. 1, I stated before there would \nbe many cities that, for potentially the foreseeable future, \nunfortunately, people in those cities would not be subject to the time \nlimit under the Democratic leader's bill. I point to the cities of New \nYork, which has an 8.7 percent unemployment rate; Los Angeles, which \nhas a 10.6 percent unemployment rate; there is an 8.2 percent \nunemployment rate in Washington, DC; Detroit has a 10.8 percent rate. \nThose are a few cities where the unemployment rate exceeds 8 percent. \nAs a result, under the bill put forward by Senator Daschle, none of the \npeople living in those cities would have any of their time limit being \nworked off during those periods of high unemployment.\n  So you could have, potentially, in a city like Detroit, which has \nhistorically had very high unemployment rates, no time limit for people \nwho live in those cities. You are not talking about small or \ninsignificant welfare populations. You are talking about New York, Los \nAngeles, Detroit, Washington, Miami, and many others. You are talking \nabout a very large percentage of the caseload that will never, \npotentially, be time limited or will be time limited to 10 or more \nyears. That is a big loophole in this bill, let us make no mistake \nabout it. I believe that needs to be addressed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What the exception is saying--I agree that in the big \ncities you have an unemployment rate at 8 percent and many higher. That \ndoes not tell us anything about self-employment, part-time workers, \ndiscouraged workers, which is much higher. Why is the Senator so \ntroubled by \n\n[[Page S 12702]]\nthis when it could be a mother with small children who could be \npenalized if they live in a community with high levels of \nunemployment--unofficially defined unemployment? You keep calling that \na loophole? Why does he see it that way?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I think is important in this whole debate is an \nunderstanding that the work requirement provision in the bill is not a \npenalty, it is an opportunity. It is an opportunity for people who have \nnot had the chance to go out to find work, in many cases to be placed \nin a work program so they can go out and be productive and learn skills \nand, in many cases, because you have people who have never had jobs \nbefore, they can learn what it is to get up in the morning and get \ntheir children ready for day care, or for someone else to come into the \nhouse, and get yourself to a work site, work an 8-hour day, and get \nhome and again provide for their children. That is an experience that, \nunfortunately, many people in our society have not experienced. That is \na very valuable one. I add that it is something many people in our \nsociety have never seen a parent do. They have no idea what it means to \ngrow up in a house where they never saw that happen.\n  So it is important that we provide to everyone the opportunity to \nwork and that we require it, in a sense, and that we say that this is a \ntemporary program; this is not a program that is going to go on and on. \nWelfare is not a maintenance system where we provide for people in \npoverty for indefinite periods of time, but it is a dynamic \ntransitional program that prepares people to get from a position where \nthey cannot work, or they are not prepared to work, to a position where \nthey will and do work. That is lost if you provide what I call \n``impoverishment zones,'' not ``empowerment zones,'' where you \nbasically tell a group of people that because you are in a big city \nthat has high unemployment, we have no expectation that you will ever \nbe able to find work, and therefore you can stay on welfare. But the \nrest, everybody else, we will change the system for you. But you in \nDetroit and you in the City of New York, you cannot make it, and we do \nnot believe you can, so we are going to sort of write you off.\n  I do not want to write anybody off. I think everybody should have the \nsame level of expectations. As I cited before the Senator from \nMinnesota came to the floor, the Riverside, CA, example, where during \nthe period of time of the GAIN program they experienced a 14 percent \ndrop in food stamps, a 16 percent drop in caseload, and a 20 percent \ndrop in AFDC, and they had in excess of 9 percent unemployment. People \nwere getting off the rolls, getting to work, doing the things that many \non both sides of the aisle said is a successful program.\n  So I believe it must happen. I think to write off particular areas of \nthe country because of difficulties in unemployment is an unwise move.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In making a thoughtful point and comment, he would be \naware that the GAIN program in Riverside, CA, is a program developed \nunder the Family Support Act?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There have been many experiments done under waivers \nunder the Family Support Act.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may put it in question form. He might know that in \nthe summer of 1992, President Bush visited Riverside and was making a \npoint that it seemed to be working and is catching on. I rushed to the \nfloor with a photograph of President Reagan signing the Family Support \nAct and shaking hands with then-Governor Clinton, who was head of the \nGovernors Association at that time. He and the Governor of Delaware, \nnow our colleague in the House, worked together on a bipartisan basis. \nI just wish that we would be conscious of this. I do not ask the \nSenator to agree. But I am saying we have something working, and we may \nmiss it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can, I say to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork that there are isolated instances where the current law is working \nand, I think, from social science evaluations, modestly working. We \nhave come in welfare to expect that modest improvement is as good as we \nwill ever get. Maybe that is the case. I am not satisfied with that as \na benchmark for the ceiling. I think what we need to do is, as I said, \nto stretch the envelope.\n  While the Family Support Act of 1988 did create a window of \nopportunity for certain areas to get waivers and to try new things and \nto engage in work and other kinds of things, which we believe on this \nside and I know many on the other side believe is the way to go, we \nbelieve it needs to be more dramatic, that we need to do more and try \nnew things. That is what this Dole-Packwood bill does, I think, and \ndoes it in a very dramatic way.\n  The final point I want to make is on the cost side. I know the \nSenator from Minnesota is here. I say to my colleagues on the \nRepublican side, it is getting rather lonely over here. There are \nplenty of opportunities to speak on this issue. I hope that those who \nhave comments will come to the floor and make their comments and debate \nthis very important issue. There are no speakers on this side at this \npoint. I say to those listening, if you have statements you would like \nto make, this is a good time to come down and make those.\n  I say, with respect to the cost estimates on this program, what we \nsee is really a cost-neutral program on the part of the Democratic \nleader's bill when it comes to welfare spending. The bill saves, over 7 \nyears, roughly $20 billion. But $19 billion of the $20 billion in \nsavings is in food stamps. So what we see is what most on that side \nwould consider welfare and SSI and AFDC and child care. A lot of \nthose--in fact, most of those go up in spending. What we see is most of \nthe savings really being gathered out of the Food Stamp Program. I say \nthose, over a 7-year period, are rather modest compared to what the \nRepublicans suggest. I think we had about 50 percent more in savings \nunder the Food Stamp Program.\n  So it does not meet with what I think most would see as what is \nnecessary to get Government spending under control.\n  I say that even under the Republican bill, spending goes up \ndramatically in virtually all these programs. I know the block granted \nAFDC Program does not go up and the child care program does not. But \nthe rest of the programs--the SSI, Food Stamp Program, everything \nelse--goes up at very dramatic rates. In fact, we are talking about a \nvery minimal reduction in the spending on welfare in this country. If \nthis was being judged solely based on how much money we are saving on \nwelfare, I think both proposals in the eyes of the American public \nwould be considered a failure. This is not a big cut in welfare \nspending. We are just barely curving the rate of increase in welfare.\n  I think given the dramatic nature of these proposals, that may be the \nbest we should do. As I had the discussion with the Senator from New \nYork, transitioning people, making the program a dynamic system is \nexpensive. We are turning a system where you basically have someone \nbehind a computer cranking out checks to people who come and show up \nand verify certain things, and they get a check or stamp and leave. \nThat is not a lot of time consumed by that person, not a lot of effort \ninvolved.\n  When you are taking that system from a maintenance processing system \nand turning it into a system where you actually sit across the table \nfrom someone and try to figure out what their problems are and how you \ncan help them and what we need to do to change their lives, that takes \nenergy, it takes time, it takes resources.\n  To suggest that we can change welfare at the time that we can slash \nit or cut it dramatically, I think would be unwise. We have not done \nthat on this side. In fact, I have not heard a lot of comments on the \nother side about how we are slashing welfare. The reason is because we \nare not. Welfare is going to grow fairly dramatically over the next 7 \nyears.\n  It will be different. It will be different than anything we have ever \nseen. I think it is worth a try. We may come to the point in time where \nwe look at what has happened with this bill, if it is successful, and I \nbelieve it will be, and all the attempts will be made and all the \ndifferent projects will be tried by the different States, you might \nfind out we get modest gains at best, or we get no gains. \n\n[[Page S 12703]]\n\n  We may have to step back and say, is it worth it? You have some \nwriters in this town who are suggesting that we should just give up. \nThat it is not worth trying any more. It is not worth spending the \nmoney. We may be there.\n  I think it is worth a try of a different way, and what we have \nsuggested here in this bill is a dramatically different way of dealing \nwith this problem. It is truly ending welfare as we know it. Welfare \nwill no longer be the image of someone showing up and receiving a \ncheck, but almost go back to the image of the Depression when we had \nthe WPA--can the Senator help me?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The WPA and PWA.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And programs where you saw it more as a dynamic program \nwhere people were there to do things, to make a positive contribution \nto their community.\n  I am hopeful that is what will result in this. I am very optimistic \nthat we can find, I think, very solid support from the Republican side \nand a significant number of Democrats to pass this Dole bill or \nsomething very similar to it and do it while being very kind, I think \ncompassionate, in the truest sense of the word, compassionate with the \npeople who find themselves involved in this system, and at the same \ntime respectful of the people who work hard and pay taxes to fund the \nsystem. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Carolyn \nClark, who is a fellow, be admitted for the duration of the debate on \nwelfare reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, I \nwill be relatively brief. I wanted to analyze the Daschle bill and I \nwanted to talk about why I think the differences between the Daschle \nbill and the Dole bill make a difference. I also wanted to talk about \nsome of the weaknesses in the minority leader's bill, or at least raise \nsome questions.\n  Again, I think there is hardly any comparison when I look at the two. \nI think--and it is hard when you ask a Senator to yield, and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania certainly did that--it is difficult to really \nget into the debate, so let me try and first try and respond to some of \nwhat was said.\n  When I hear Senators come to the floor and talk about how optimistic \nthey are and how they think this will be such a huge change, I sort of \nthink to myself that part of the problem is they are not really passing \nlegislation that is going to affect them or their children.\n  I think part of the problem, and I will try and stay away from the \nharshness, I think the point can be made we would do better if we had \nless hate and more debate. I do not come here to the floor with malice.\n  But, it does seem to me, Mr. President, that some of my colleagues \njust want to ignore some unpleasant facts, some unpleasant realities.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania talked about opportunities. Well, we \nwill take the minority leader's bill. If there is an 8 percent \nofficially defined unemployment, there are many more people who are \nworking part-time who are not counted. There are many people who are \ndiscouraged workers who have dropped out. If you have that high of an \nunemployment rate--by the way, in some of our cities it is higher than \nthat, than there is not really an opportunity for a single parent, \nusually a mother, to find a job, but she gets cut off welfare anyway, \nregardless of the employment conditions in the community.\n  How can that be called an opportunity? That is not an opportunity. Of \ncourse, part of what is bogus about this reform effort is that if you \nlook at the job opportunity structure and you look at some of the \ncommunities where we have large numbers of welfare mothers, the \nunemployment level is so high, the under-employed level is so high, \nthat, as a matter of fact, there is no evidence whatever that the jobs \nare going to be there that these women can support their families on.\n  So in the absence of that evidence, with those kind of high rates, it \nis hardly unreasonable to say if you cannot obtain the opportunities, \nthe employment opportunities, because they are not there, then we are \ncertainly not going to cut you off of assistance for yourself and your \nchildren. That is what this is about. That is really what this is \nabout.\n  Mr. President, as I look at the Daschle bill on the floor, I do think \nthere are some very significant and positive features about this piece \nof legislation. I think the main feature, Mr. President, that I want to \nzero in on has to do with maintaining the commitment to children to \nmake sure that there will be benefits for some of the most vulnerable \ncitizens in this country.\n  Today at caucus, and my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, is \nfree if I say this and as he listens it seems that it was too personal \nand he did not mean for this to be public, I want him to cut me off. He \nsaid something that has stayed with me most of this afternoon. Senator \nMoynihan said the last piece of legislation that President Kennedy \nsigned publicly, was a piece of legislation we all had high hopes for: \nThis was deinstitutionalization.\n  It made sense as a philosophy. We would take people in the mental \nhospitals and we would basically move them out and then there would be \ncommunity-based care. But we never did that. What we wound up with in \nall too many communities in this country was an ever larger population \nof homeless people. We see that all over the country.\n  Then the analysis was there that it was a lack of affordable housing. \nWhat Senator Moynihan said today during the caucus meeting was really \nthe answer to the question: We did it. We passed that legislation. But, \nwe did not follow through on the commitment, and that is what happened.\n  He then went on to say, and this is exactly how I feel about this \ndebate, that we should not pass a piece of legislation that ends the \nbasic commitment that there will be support there for families, for \nsingle parents and children. The support has got to be there, it will \nnot just be block granted to States who can pretty much do what they \nwant to do.\n  It does not matter whether there is a recession or not or what kind \nof resources are invested,\n if we end that kind of commitment, that is a commitment we made as a \nnation, then I will tell you exactly what is going to happen. It is \neasy for Senators to tell us this is an experiment. ``Gee, we think \nthis is going to do a lot better.'' It is not them. It is not their \nfamilies. I will tell you what is going to happen. I will predict it. \nWe will have many more children among the ranks of the homeless. And \nthen we are going to ask ourselves the question: How did that happen?\n\n  We did it. That is exactly what the Dole bill does. I do not think it \nis the intention of the Senators, but that is exactly, that is \nprecisely what the effect of this are going to be.\n  To the credit of the minority leader, that commitment is maintained \nin his bill, at least for 5 years. And it is important.\n  There is a second issue which is, I think, maybe one of the most \nimportant features of the Daschle bill, the Work First bill. The \nDaschle bill provides childcare. That is, if you are going to say to a \nsingle parent--almost always a woman; quite often men who should be \nthere with support are not there--you work, and she has small children, \nwhat about the children? Where is the commitment of resources to child \ncare? Actually, what we are doing here in the Congress, for those \ncitizens who are watching this debate, is we are cutting investment in \nchild care.\n  So, we are saying to parents: You go to work. You have small \nchildren. That is it. And we do not provide any support for child care. \nBy definition, please remember, in spite of all of the scapegoating and \nall of the stereotypes, there is not a welfare benefit in this country \nthat is even up to the official definition of poverty, and now we are \nsaying to single parents, almost always a woman: You go to work and we \ndo not invest any resources in child care. The Daschle bill does make \nthat investment.\n  You cannot have welfare reform--all you have out here right now, at \nleast with the Dole bill, is reverse reform. You are saying to a \nparent: You go to work. It does not matter if you have small children. \nWe know you are poor. You work, and there are no resources \n\n[[Page S 12704]]\nfor child care so you can afford decent child care for your children.\n  That is antifamily. That is antifamily. I challenge any Senator in \nhere, how would you like it if you were the single parent of low \nincome, told you had to work--and you wanted to work. There is more \ndignity in work. And you hoped it would be a decent job. There is \nnothing you would like to do more, but there was no way--let us not kid \nourselves. In a lot of these communities where we have large \npopulations of welfare mothers, there are not an abundance of jobs that \npay anything near what Senators make, or even middle-income salaries. \nSo we are not going to be talking about, by and large, high-wage jobs. \nYou are told, ``You take the job. It does not matter.''\n  And you say, ``OK, I want to work in that job, and it is $6.50 an \nhour and I will do it and I want to.'' And then you are told, ``By the \nway, but when it comes to your two children who are under 3, there are \nno resources for child care. You figure out what to do.'' And you \ncannot afford it. That is why many mothers get off welfare and then go \nright back on.\n  The minority leader's bill makes a commitment to child care. I do not \nknow how my colleagues on the other side, in all due respect, can deal \nwith that contradiction.\n  The third feature I think is important is that, in the minority \nleader's bill, there is the transition so people are not immediately \ncut off Medicaid. I do not remember the precise provision of the \nmajority leader's bill. I ask the Senator from New York, is there a \ntransition period of time for Medicaid in the Dole bill?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would say I do not know. There is, of course, a 1-\nyear transition in the current law of the Family Support Act. We will \nfind that out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Because my understanding is the Daschle bill allows \nfor the currently provided year of transitional Medicaid, plus an extra \nyear of transitional care on a sliding scale basis to ease the \ntransition.\n  I do not think that in the Packwood-Dole bill, there is such an \nallowance for that second year of transition.\n  It seems to me, now we have a situation where we are saying it does \nnot matter what the unemployment level is in your community and, in \naddition, it does not matter from State to State, what States decide to \ndo. It does not matter whether there is a recession. It does not matter \nhow many children are born into poverty. It does not matter what the \npopulation growth is going to be. It does not matter whether or not \nthere is going to be a commitment of resources to child care. By and \nlarge, we are ending our commitment to low-income children. And in \naddition, you have 6 months, that is it, that is the only guarantee you \nhave of being able to keep your Medicaid.\n  This is called reform? These women and their children are in a worse \nposition than when they all started. The Daschle bill is a significant \nimprovement over that.\n  I say to my colleagues, we should not be so reckless with the lives \nof children. That is what I do not understand. I have colleagues, on \nboth sides of the aisle, who are friends. I understand the political \nclimate in the country. I understand some of the scapegoating. But I \ncannot understand how men and women of such good will can be so \nreckless with the lives of children.\n  The minority, the Daschle bill, as I understand it, does not block \ngrant food stamps. There is a reason for that. The Senator from New \nYork knows this history well. What happened--and it was President \nNixon, as I remember, who really took the final initiative in making \nsure there was a national standard. Although the Federal Government was \ngoing to pay that bill, States got to decide what would be the level of \nbenefits and many States had the level of benefits pegged at an \nextremely low level. Much to the shame of the United States of America, \nwe saw it on television with documentaries about Hunger USA. We saw \nchildren with distended bellies, and we learned about scurvy and \nrickets and malnutrition and hunger among children in America.\n  Therefore, President Nixon led the way and we set national standards \nand we had a national food stamp program. We are a national community. \nWe made a national commitment to children. Now we are going to back \naway from that? The minority leader's bill does not back away from that \ncommitment, nor should it, Mr. President.\n  Questions to raise. Maybe my colleague from New York, or colleague \nfrom Tennessee, can help me out on this. Again, I raise these questions \nmore in a constructive way. This is just out of intellectual integrity \nthat I want to raise these questions about the minority leader's bill. \nI cannot cheerlead on everything.\n  There still is this feature in this legislation that, as I understand \nit--we can get technical--it is in the Dole bill, it is in the Daschle \nbill, that now counts LIHEAP benefits as income, low-income energy \nassistance. So what happens is, for the purpose of calculating food \nstamp benefits, LIHEAP benefits, low-income energy assistance, gets \ncounted as income and this becomes this classic choice of eat or heat.\n I do not know why we are doing that. That is the question I raise.\n\n  The second question somebody has to ask on the floor of the Senate, I \ntalked about earlier the importance of making sure we do not back away. \nIt is my understanding--and I quote from an Urban Institute study--of \nall families that have become dependent on welfare systems, about 43 \npercent receive benefits for less than 24 months. But at any point in \ntime there are many more long-term recipients, for example, more than \n75 percent of families on welfare, at any point in time, are on for \nmore than 60 months.\n  So if it is an aggregate 5-year period, I have some very serious \nconcerns about what we are doing because I think quite often the \npattern is that a mother--by the way, mothers do not need Senators to \ntell them that they ought to work. Most are--75 percent within 2 \nyears--are off welfare and are working.\n  Now, the problem is that all too often what happens is, think about \nthis: You go to work, and you try to work out a child care arrangement. \nBut you cannot afford it. Then you go back to welfare. By the way, for \nthe low-income people, the monthly expenses of child care is not like 7 \npercent. It is 35 percent, or 40 percent of income. Or you go to work \nagain.\n  When Sheila and I were younger, we did not have much money at all. We \nhad this experience. You find out. It is the most horrifying thing in \nthe world when you leave your child, whom you dearly love, with a child \ncare center and the conditions are awful.\n  By the way, according to the national reports on the state of child \ncare, we are not investing resources in child care--not just for low \nincome, but for middle income. You get paid more money to work the zoos \nthan you do to take care of children in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, so what happens? You are supposed to be there at 5 to \npick up your child. You show up at 4, and you find the conditions are \nawful. So it did not work. Now you are back to welfare. Or, Mr. \nPresident, remember, you are a single parent. You get sick or your \nchild gets sick, and your child is sick more than a week. You get laid \noff work. This happens all the time.\n  So I will raise three questions and then get a response. I am really \nvery worried about this 5-year period because it seems to me that if, \nin fact, the Urban Institute is right and more than 75 percent of \nfamilies on welfare at any point in time will receive welfare for more \nthan 60 months, we are cutting a lot of people off, who are mainly \nchildren, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the children who do \nnot give the big campaign contributions, the children who are not the \nbig players, the children who are not the heavy hitters, the children \nwho do not get on television with their ads. They are the ones that \nsome of these proposals treat so harshly, though I must say again I \nbelieve that the minority leader's bill, thank God, is at least a \nsignificant improvement over Packwood-Dole.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, does the Senator wish to have these data \nat this point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be. I will yield for that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may address the Senator \ndirectly. \n\n[[Page S 12705]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It happens that we presented this data in the debate \nthat was a truncated debate in August. The Senator is exactly right in \nwhat he has said. But there is more to say. This was the work of Donna \nPavetti at the Urban Institute--the Urban Institute was established \nunder the auspices of President Johnson in the 1960's--of \n``distribution of total time on welfare.''\n  The Senator is absolutely right. About 27 percent of welfare \nrecipients are on for less than 1 year. About 40 percent are on for \nless than 2 years.\n  We do not know as much as we should. We have been very poor about \ngathering data. We, in the last Congress, enacted a Welfare Indicators \nAct, which I spent 14 years trying to get passed, that will start \ngiving us an annual report on the subject.\n  So this is data from the Urban Institute. A number of people who go \non AFDC are two groups. There is this group that is on for 2 years or \nless, 40 percent, 41 percent. We know who they are. They are married \nwomen whose marriages breakup. They need some time to get their affairs \ntogether. And they do. A very refreshing counsel of the Manpower \nDemonstration Research Corp., when we were drafting the Family Support \nAct, was to say, do not bother with these good people. The Senator is \nabsolutely correct--at any given time 76 percent, three-quarters, of \nthe persons on welfare have been there more than 5 years.\n  The Urban Institute also went on to estimate the number of families \naffected by a 60-month time limit, a 5-year time limit. Between the \nyear 2001 and the year 2005--2001 you can reach out and touch that--1.4 \nmillion families will have exceeded the 5 years. By 2005, 10 years from \nnow, 2 million families will have exceeded the 5 years. This assumes \nthe caseload does not grow. That is half the caseload.\n  You were kind enough to mention what I had said in our caucus today. \nI said it earlier on the floor. In 10 years time we will wonder where \nthese ragged children came from. Why are they sleeping on grates? Why \nare they making life miserable for themselves and others? What \nhappened? We will have a city swarming with pauper children, penniless \nand without residence. You said it could not happen. It happened to the \nmentally ill. And half the families in 10 years will have been dropped \nby a 5-year time limit.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator so hugely. And this is the point.\n  Mr. President, I would ask these tables be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL TIME ON WELFARE                 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             All current\n                                                             recipients \n         Time on welfare (in months)          New entrants   at a point \n                                                (percent)      in time  \n                                                              (percent) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1-12........................................         27.4           4.5 \n13-24.......................................         14.8           4.8 \n25-36.......................................         10.0           4.9 \n37-48.......................................          7.7           5.0 \n49-60.......................................          5.5           4.5 \nOver 60.....................................         34.6          76.3 \n                                             ---------------------------\n  Mean Duration (in years)..................          6.10         12.98 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Urban Institute, 1995.                                          \n\n\n  NUMBER OF FAMILIES AFFECTED BY A 60-MONTH TIME LIMIT, FY 2001-FY 2005 \n                              [in millions]                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             Families                                   \n                             currently                                  \n       Fiscal year           receiving     New entrants   Total families\n                             benefits                                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001....................            1.34             .08            1.42\n2002....................            1.41             .24            1.65\n2003....................            1.37             .43            1.80\n2004....................            1.29             .61            1.90\n2005....................            1.19             .77            1.96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: This table assumes that the caseload remains at its current level \n  of 4.35 million families headed by an adult over the next 10 years.   \n                                                                        \n Source: Urban Institute, 1995.                                         \n\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the President for allowing me to ask the \nSenator to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have more to say, more of a critique. \nBut I think that what the Senator from New York just said was very \npowerful. I cannot add to that at this time.\n  I would yield the floor to the Senator from Rhode Island. I ask the \nSenator from Nevada, will the Senator from Rhode Island then speak?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I believe the Senator from Rhode Island was told he \nwould be in sequence after Senator Wellstone, and that our good friend \nfrom Nevada knows that. We look forward to our most distinguished, \nrevered colleague.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleagues and my friends, one and the same.\n  I am very glad that the Senate has resumed debating the matter of \nwelfare reform. And I am encouraged that the first few days of this \ndebate--both before the August recess and again today--have been \ncomposed largely of thoughtful concerns and constructive suggestions \nabout what can be done to make the current system work better and cost \nless.\n  In reviewing the legislation before us, however, we must each decide \nfor ourselves what it is we believe about the current welfare system \nand how it can best move people from dependency to self-sufficiency, \nand from poverty to a living wage.\n  I continue to believe that our welfare system should provide \ntemporary-- I emphasize the word temporary--financial assistance to \nthose in need. There are millions of people who fall on hard times; \nlosing a job, getting divorced, or becoming widowed should not be a \nticket to poverty. Welfare is there largely to help women and children \nget back on their feet--and to protect them from hunger, homelessness, \nand desperation in the interim. In this respect, welfare is a \ncompassionate and needed social program and I support its continued \nexistence.\n  But there is also no question that the system has, at times, been \nabused, and that it has been viewed by some welfare recipients as a \nfree ride with no concomitant responsibility. These individuals, whom I \nbelieve to be a minority of welfare recipients, have nevertheless \nprompted understandable wrath in many other Americans who work hard, \nplay by the rules, and do not receive any Government assistance. I \nunderstand their anger at what they perceive as a Government handout, \nand I think there is considerable merit to their claim that this abuse \nmust stop.\n  In fact, many of us who believe that welfare has a role to play in \nhelping people get a hand up also believe that certain responsibilities \ngo along with Government help. I strongly believe that those welfare \nrecipients who are able to work should work, and that every American \nshould understand that our Nation's welfare system provides a safety \nnet, and not a way of life.\n  But with that said, the question arises ``how do we get people to \nwork?'' Do you simply impose a requirement that they must work to \nreceive benefits or they will no longer receive them? And what do we do \nif they try to find a job but can't due to high unemployment, a lack of \nskills or education, or an inability to find anyone to care for their \ninfant child? Do we simply say that if they do not work they will \nreceive no benefits?\n  To me, Mr. President, that approach is too harsh and far too unlikely \nto produce the results we seek. What we want to do, what we need to do, \nis create a system that moves people off of welfare--for good. A system \nthat gives them the tools they need to find a job, get employed, and \nstay employed at a living wage. Only then--and perhaps it will take \nsome additional investment by both the Federal Government and the \nStates--can we end the cycle of dependency and poverty that keeps \ngeneration after generation on welfare and discouraged from seeking to \nwork.\n  The Democratic alternative--the Work First bill--addresses many of \nthese issues in a thoughtful and comprehensive way. It fosters the \ntransition from welfare to work by providing health care, and, when \nneeded, access to affordable child care services. And it provides a \nreasonable period of time for people to move into the workforce.\n  In fact, the Democratic alternative involves welfare recipients in a \nfull-scale, full-time search for real employment; a job they can be \nproud to have. Its Work First Employment Block Grant makes one and only \none demand on States: an increasing number of their\n welfare recipients must find a job and keep the job. How the State \ndoes that is up to the individual State.\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I am distressed to see that the \nDole bill lumps vocational and adult education \n\n[[Page S 12706]]\nwith welfare reform. Simply put, education is not welfare. Vocational \nand education programs are not, and should not be considered welfare. \nAnd while I certainly endorse enthusiastically the idea of a welfare \nrecipient undertaking education as a means of obtaining a good job to \nmove off of welfare, I do not think that this welfare legislation \nshould tinker with existing education or vocational education programs, \nand shall oppose their inclusion in this legislation. In fact, we have \nalready reported a comprehensive education and training bill from the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, which I supported. It is a very \nimportant bill, and ought to be considered independently and in its own \nright.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other parts of the Democratic \nbill that I think are crucial to our effort to reform the welfare \nsystem. I strongly believe in ensuring the ability of all who \nfinancially qualify to receive welfare, and thus do not support the \nconcept of a limited block grant. Such an approach, adopted by the Dole \nbill, would leave millions of women and their dependent children with \nno financial assistance at all. And further, it would prevent them from \nparticipating in the new system we hope to create--which will give them \nthe tools to get off of welfare once and for all.\n  Mr. President, as we undertake the very difficult task of reforming \nour Nation's welfare system, we may be tempted to seek simple answers \nto complex questions or be moved by rhetoric rather than fact. In my \nview, two basic principles should guide us in these discussions: \nfairness to taxpayers and compassion to those in need. I hope that my \ncolleagues will share this view and spend the time and care necessary \nto make the right changes, not simply any changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just once again say it is a great pleasure to \nhave the opportunity twice in one week to express my great appreciation \nto the Senator from Rhode Island, who has very cogent remarks on \neducation and carries weight in this Chamber. None has done so much as \nhe in a generation of legislating. He is revered, respected. I hope and \ntrust he will be listened to.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I see the majority leader on the floor.\n  Before the Senator from Rhode Island leaves, may I say a few words in \nhis direction?\n  Mr. DOLE. I just want to get a unanimous-consent request.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, I will just ask him to stay.\n  If the Senator from Rhode Island would stay at his desk for a couple \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say this has been cleared by the Democratic leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the Daschle amendment \nnumbered 2282 at 4 p.m. Thursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. That will be tomorrow.\n  For the information of all Senators, there will be no further votes \ntoday. However, Members who wish to debate the Daschle amendment are \nurged to do so this evening.\n  Also, Members should be aware, prior to the close of business \nThursday, the two leaders will ask consent to limit the remaining \namendments in order to the welfare bill to finish the welfare reform \nbill by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.\n  And there will also be after the vote, depending on the vote on the \nDaschle amendment, additional votes and debate tomorrow evening.\n  But we are trying to accommodate a number of our friends who want to \nattend the very historic baseball game tonight in Baltimore to see Cal \nRipken, Jr., break the record of Lou Gehrig. So we hope that all those \nwho are able to go will be very cooperative the rest of the week.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12687-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity, as \nunprepared as I am, to say a few words about the senior Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  I had been planning the last couple of days to prepare a statement \nand come to the floor and give a speech that reflected my feelings \nabout the Senator from Rhode Island. But, coincidentally, we are on the \nfloor at the same time, and I want this time to be used while the \nSenator is on the floor and direct these remarks to him personally.\n  I cannot recite a great deal about the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nknow the Senator from Rhode Island graduated from Princeton University, \none of the premier schools of this country, cum laude. He also attended \nColumbia University. It is my understanding he has about 50 honorary \ndegrees that have been awarded to him over the years. He served in the \nU.S. Coast Guard. He is an author.\n  I often, after having come from the House to the Senate, tried to \ndetermine how this Senator from Rhode Island had the ability to \ncommunicate in the way he does, in such a gentlemanly way but yet with \nso much authority and wisdom. Probably the basis for that, more than \nany other thing, is his service as a member of the U.S. Foreign \nService.\n  In my time in Washington, being a Member of the House and the Senate, \nif there is a group of people that I think represent this country \nbetter than any other group, it is those people who are in the Foreign \nService. Wherever I go, whether it is here in Washington meeting with \nthem, or around the world, I find a group of people who are \ntremendously underpaid and highly educated and overworked and do a \nbetter job than anyone else representing our country as Foreign Service \nofficers. Senator Pell served for 7 years in the U.S. Foreign Service.\n  I think that is the foundation, the background that has allowed him \nto do the many things he has done in the way he has done them.\n  It has been said many times on this floor that it is an honor to be \nable to serve with a man of Claiborne Pell's ability, and certainly \nthat is true.\n  Mr. President, it is also true that it is not only an honor to serve \nwith him, but to be associated with him. I was in the Senate dining \nroom with some constituents and, of course, people walk in who are \nknown all over America. But the person sitting with me asked me if they \ncould meet Senator Pell. Why? Because he felt his ability to go to \ncollege was made possible as a result of his having obtained a number \nof Pell grants. I took him over. The only Senator he wanted to meet was \nClaiborne Pell of Rhode Island, because it was his feeling that he is \nresponsible for his having been able to get a college education.\n  That is the way, Mr. President, that not only thousands but millions \nof young Americans would feel if they would direct their attention to \nWashington; that is, their ability to be educated as a result of the \nforesight of Senator Pell setting up Pell grants, allowing young people \nwho ordinarily would not have the ability to go to college to be \neducated.\n  I, 6 years ago, on more than one occasion, went to Senator Pell and \nsaid: ``I think that your service is needed here in Washington and we \nneed you very badly.''\n  I am one of many, many people that went to Senator Pell and told him \nthat. I was right; we did need his service for another 6 years, and his \nservice has certainly been as dedicated these past 6 years as it was \nthe prior 24 years.\n  I appreciate the Senator waiting on the floor to allow me to impart \nmy admiration and respect and love. There is no one in the Senate that \ndeserves more attention and credit than the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. As I go through life, there will be no one who has given me \nmore pleasure serving with in any capacity of Government than the \nSenator from Rhode Island. So on behalf of the Senate and the people of \nAmerica, I extend my appreciation to you.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague and friend for his kind words and \nappreciate them more than I can say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12706-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12707-S12710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 12707]]\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not have the experience of the \nDemocratic manager of this bill, the senior Senator from New York. On \nthis occasion, and others, I heard him talking with President Nixon and \nPresident Kennedy on matters of importance dealing with measures that \nare now before this body. He has written numerous articles. He has \nwritten books dealing with welfare, so I cannot match that.\n  But as I told the Senator from New York, I have done something he has \nnot done, and that is, I have spent a night in a homeless shelter in \nLas Vegas. Truly one of the remarkable experiences of my life--I do not \nknow if ``remarkable'' is the right word--but interesting and \neducational experiences of my life.\n  And I just want to confirm what the Senator from New York has said on \na number of occasions--that the homeless problem did not come about \naccidentally.\n  The homeless problem came about as a result of the Federal \nGovernment, in effect, emptying what we used to refer to as the \n``insane asylums,'' mental institutions, as we now refer to them. We, \nin effect, emptied them. There were prescriptive drugs, and the \nPresiding Officer, who is a medical doctor, knows more about the \ndifferent compounds that were developed to allow us to get people out \nof these institutions. But as part of the program, after having gotten \nthem out of the institutions, we were to provide community health \ncenters where these people would have the opportunity to come back and \nget new medicine and be evaluated and, in effect, not make them \nhomeless people wandering the streets, as we see so often now.\n  Mr. President, one of the things we have to be aware of as we begin \nwelfare reform, which we all acknowledge is needed, is that we do not \ncreate more problems, like the problems created when we decided to \nempty the mental institutions. The Senator from New York is concerned \nthat 10 years from now, we are going to have a half a million children \non the streets competing with the adult homeless. I hope he is wrong.\n  I think that almost every Member of this body agrees welfare reform \nis needed. The question is, How should we reform welfare? We all \nacknowledge that we must do something to change the present system. The \ncurrent system, in many respects, is out of control. In fact, today, \nMr. President, the name ``welfare'' itself invokes certain perceptions \nof which we are all aware. Presently, it is assumed that people on \nwelfare are lazy, that they do not want to work and are simply looking \nfor a handout. Our current system tends to foster these perceptions, \nhowever invalid they may be. I think what we need to do is to go back \nto the original intent of the welfare system.\n  We have had welfare systems in this country that are legendary in \ntheir success: the WPA, Works Progress Administration. When I do town \nhall meetings in Nevada, many times I take pictures of what the WPA did \naround Nevada: built schools, built roads, planted trees, built \nbridges, helped with grasshopper infestations. And I, with these \npictures, tell my constituents that here is a Government program that \nwas a success and, yes, a Government welfare program that was a \nsuccess.\n  I was born and raised in Searchlight, NV, a small mining town when I \nwas growing up there of a couple hundred people. Not much in the way of \nmines but it was a mining town. At that time, the gold was about gone.\n  But all around the area of Searchlight we had evidence, when I was \ngrowing up, and it is still there, of the welfare recipients having \nbeen to Nevada. They did not know they were welfare recipients, but \nthey were. They were part of the Civilian Conservation Corps. They came \nto the deserts of southern Nevada. They came to all over Nevada, but \nthe deserts of southern Nevada I am familiar with. They came to all \nover southern Nevada.\n  What did they do? They built corrals, watering holes, fences. They \nbuilt trails. There is still evidence of these welfare recipients' work \nin Nevada. This was a welfare program that was successful. So because \nwe have a welfare program, it should not mean that it is demeaning, \nthat it is bad, that it is negative. There are reasons we have welfare \nprograms.\n  This great society of ours must help those people who need help. We \nknow that welfare covers the infirm, the blind, the handicapped. Who \nwould say we do not need welfare programs to help people who, for \nwhatever reason, find themselves in that condition or position? There \nare also people who are able-bodied that, for reasons, need help.\n And that is what this welfare reform is all about--to do something \nabout people who are down on their luck and need help.\n\n  There is no reason that welfare should foster a perception of people \nbeing lazy and worthless. We need to go back to the original intent of \nthe welfare system. Welfare was initially developed as a temporary \nassistance, not a way of life. I believe that we all agree on this. \nReform of the current welfare system should be as bipartisan as we can \nmake it. Both sides of the aisle, I hope, have the same goal: to make \nwelfare temporary and to move people currently on welfare into jobs.\n  The bill that the Democrats have sponsored, the Democratic \nalternative, of which I am a cosponsor, recognizes this intent. It \nclearly recognizes this intent and has a prepared plan, tightly \ntailored, to not only succeed in moving people off of welfare and into \njobs but to keep them in those jobs. The Democratic substitute \nstreamlines the current system and addresses the problems people now \nface. It addresses the major barriers to getting a job, keeping a job, \nand getting off welfare. In contrast, while the Dole bill has the same \nobjectives, it falls short in its plan on how to achieve these goals.\n  I must say, Mr. President, that the Dole bill is a moving target. It \nhas changed many, many times. I am doing my best to understand the Dole \nbill and to give it as fair an interpretation as I can.\n  I have a number of problems with the Dole bill. I am going to focus \ntoday on block grants. As U.S. Senators, we deal with Federal dollars. \nThat is the way it should be. We cannot simply hand the States a fixed \namount of cash with no direction or requirements. I think this would be \nirresponsible. Welfare is a national concern. That is why we are here \ntoday debating reform of the system. It is important that the Federal \nGovernment have some control over the funds it disburses.\n  Mr. President, under the majority's legislation, there is going to be \na race to the least. Who can get to give the least the quickest? Who \ncan provide the least amount of benefits? Because who does that is \ngoing to win the battle because they are going to have no money to do \nanything else with.\n  A favorite criticism of the Democratic Party by some is that we throw \nmoney at projects. That is exactly what the Republican block grant does \nin this legislation. It throws money at the problem. It throws moneys \nto the States and tells them to deal with the problems without giving \nthem sufficient money. That is, the irresponsibility is compounded by \nthe fact that the money States are going to get in the block grants is \nsignificantly insufficient. Many of the Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle who have spoken on behalf of the Dole plan have emphasized \nthat block grants allow the States to decide how and where to spend the \nmoney it is given, the logic being that the State knows best where they \nmust focus the money. I do not disagree with the basis of that \nargument. Individual States should know where their weaknesses lie and \nwhat their States need. However, those speaking on behalf of the \nunderlying bill have failed to emphasize that there are Federal \nrequirements States must meet in order for the States to receive these \nblock grant moneys. They are not automatic. States, for example, would \nbe required to double their participation rates. Yet, they will not be \ngiven the necessary resources to carry out this work.\n  The Republican block grant plan is not truly a block grant plan, but \nan unfunded mandate to the States. One of the first bills we worked on \nin this Congress, and one of the first we passed--and there was \nagreement with the Contract With America--is that we should not have \nunfunded mandates. We agreed with that. Here is an unfunded mandate. In \nfact, the head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which \n\n[[Page S 12708]]\nis bipartisan, called the Republican plan ``the mother of all unfunded \nmandates.'' This is not something I dreamed up or the Democratic Policy \nCommittee came up with in some cute little phrase. This comes from the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, which is a bipartisan group. He called the \nplan ``the mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  For example, in order for States to meet the new work requirements \nprescribed in the Republican bill, by the year 2000--fiscal year 2000--\nthe Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates that the States \nwould have to find up to $4.3 billion extra--more than the current \nState and Federal expenditures--to meet the new child care costs alone. \nOverall, the unfunded work requirements would result in $35 billion in \nadditional cost to the States over the next 7 years; $35 billion. \nEverybody within the sound of my voice should understand that this is a \nlot of money that is going to be picked up by State and local \ngovernments. For the State of Nevada, the unfunded mandate will result \nin costs upwards of $110 million, as we now see it, at least.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a majority of \nthe States will not be able to meet the work requirements included in \nthe bill. In fact, CBO assumes that given the cost and administrative \ncomplexities, States would choose to accept a penalty of up to 5 \npercent of the grant rather than implement the requirements.\n  My primary concern with the underlying bill and the block grant plan \nin it is its unfairness and insufficiency. The plan simply shifts the \nproblems of the current welfare program to the States, with limited \nFederal funding. This plan is inadequate for high-growth States like \nNevada. In fact, Nevada may be the best example of how unfair a block \ngrant frozen at fiscal year 1994 will be--frozen for 5 years. Nevada is \nthe fastest-growing State in the country, with the fastest-growing city \nin the country, Las Vegas. It will not take long for high-growth States \nlike Nevada to run out of money. And then they will be forced, under \nthe terms of this bill, to borrow money from a so-called ``emergency \nloan fund'' which this plan provides. The loan is limited to 10 percent \nof the State's grant, and the State is required to repay the loan, with \ninterest, within 3 years.\n  Of course, if the State does not have the money to repay the loan, \nwhat happens? We know what happens. The costs will be shifted to the \nState's residents in the form of increased taxes. There is no other \nalternative. This plan has a very real potential of forcing States into \nplaying a catch-up game that they will never win. This is not my \ndefinition or, I think, anyone's definition of State flexibility. It is \nthe definition of State destruction.\n  To add to this disturbing scenario is the fact that the underlying \nbill cuts back on welfare funding in order to give $270 billion of tax \ncuts. The block grant method proposed is particularly harsh on a State \nlike Nevada. Nevada, I repeat, is rapidly growing. From 1993 to 1994, \nClark County, NV, which is Las Vegas, grew by 8.2 percent. That is \ntremendous in 1 year.\n  This equates to about 75,000 new people coming to Las Vegas in 1 \nyear. Our growth rate is on the rise and shows no sign of slowing. The \ngrowth rate in Clark County is expected to increase 23 percent over the \nnext 5 years. We are going to have moneys frozen at the 1994 level for \n5 years?\n  Meanwhile, this block grant under this underlying bill would freeze \nfunding, as I said, at the 1994 fiscal level. As Nevada's population \nsoars, the funding for welfare will remain fixed with no consideration \nof changing it under conditions of population growth or even inflation. \nThis rationale simply does not make sense and is not fair.\n  I have been listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nspeak about giving the States flexibility and that one size does not \nfit all. Well, I agree. States should have flexibility, but the plan \nthat is now being debated here, that is, the underlying Republican \nplan, does not allow this flexibility. They provide an insufficient \namount of money to the States expecting to fill the requirements tied \nto that money. This is not flexibility. This is an unfunded mandate. I \nagree that one size does not fit all. We do not live in a static \nsociety. Each State is changing rapidly.\n  The City of Las Vegas grows 75,000 a year. Why does this Republican \nplan keep the funding level at the 1994 level for 5 years? Block grants \nare not fair and they do not make sense.\n  Some would have us believe that this block grant program is some new \nidea. We are going to do the right thing, and we have come up with the \ngreat idea of block grant. I do not know when block grants first \nstarted, but in the Nixon years they had block grants. We tried them in \na number of different areas. Most of them we got rid of, for reasons \njust like I talked about, because block grants are an easy way to do \nthings.\n  It is like we talked about balancing the budget. It is easy to \nbalance a budget if you use welfare, Social Security moneys, and do not \nmake some of the hard choices we have been forced to make this year \nwith the balanced budget resolutions that now have passed. Those are \ntough decisions.\n  Block grants are an easy way, a buck passer for the Federal \nGovernment. Bundle up all the problems in a nice little bundle and ship \nthem to the States. That is what we are doing with welfare.\n  Another primary concern of mine is the so-called child exclusion \nprovisions. Under the majority's plan, States would have the option to \ndeny assistance to unmarried minor parents and their children. States \nwould also be given the option to deny additional assistance to \nfamilies who give birth to a child while on assistance or who have \nreceived assistance any time during a 10-month period.\n  These provisions directly punish and hurt children for merely being \nborn, over which they of course have no control. The concept behind \nthese provisions seems to be that if women know they will not receive \nmoney for additional children, they will not get pregnant.\n  This simply is not the case. To quote the Senator from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, ``Anyone who thinks that cutting benefits can affect \nsexual behavior does not know human nature.''\n  The family cap provisions were enacted in New Jersey, I think in \nabout 1992. After a study of mothers who are penalized if they had more \nchildren while on welfare, a Rutgers University study recently found \nthere is no reduction of birthrate of welfare mothers attributable to \nthe family cap. Further, last month New Jersey officials announced that \nthe abortion rate among poor women has increased since the passage of \ntheir policy.\n  I do not know the precise cause of this increase, but I think common \nsense dictates that it could be a result of the message which is sent \nto poor women under these provisions which is, ``Do not get pregnant. \nBut if you do, you better do something about it because you will not \nget any money to feed that child.''\n  Obviously, many young people will turn to abortion rather than having \na child that they will not be able to feed and clothe. Withholding \nwelfare benefits to prevent pregnancy is not the answer to illegitimacy \nproblems.\n  The Democratic proposal does deal with teenage pregnancy--and we will \ntalk about that a little later--in a firm, concise, and compassionate \nway.\n  Furthermore, the family cap provisions are focused on the actions of \nwomen. What about the father of these illegitimate children? Should we \ntalk about them at all? Should they be part of this major legislation \nreform? Of course they should be.\n  National Public Radio this morning had on its program Prof. Richard \nMoran of Mount Holyoke College. Now, I ask my learned friend from the \nState of New York, is this a New York institution, Mount Holyoke?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Massachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you. Professor Moran stated what most believe is \nsimply common sense. He said if we can change the behavior of adult men \nwho father illegitimate children, we could make a substantial dent in \nthe rate of teenage illegitimacy. Instead of trying to limit teen \npregnancy by reducing welfare benefits for the girls, public policy, \naccording to Moran, should focus on holding adult males financially \nresponsible for their children.\n  I think that is pretty sound reasoning. It is common sense and our \nbill does that.\n  Professor Moran went on to explain that 25 years ago, two-thirds of \nexpectant teenage mothers married. Today, \n\n[[Page S 12709]]\nless than a third marry. Of course, no one is saying that early \nmarriage is a solution to out-of-wedlock births.\n  A new national study indicates fully one-half of the fathers of the \nbabies born to mothers are adults. This is not a situation of teenagers \nhaving sex. The facts are that these young girls are being impregnated \nby adult males, and they should be held responsible for their actions. \nThey should pay.\n  These statistics show that the problem of illegitimacy is not going \nto be solved in an easy fashion. We must focus on the family and do it \nin a way that is intelligent.\n  The Democratic Work First program is called Work First--that is the \namendment pending before the body at this time--because that is what it \nis about. The Democratic Work First welfare plan will change the \ncurrent welfare system dramatically by replacing the current system \nwith a conditional entitlement program of limited duration requiring \nall able-bodied recipients to work, guaranteeing child care assistance, \nand requiring both parents to contribute to the support of their \nchildren.\n  The Work First plan is a plan where assistance is continual. \nAssistance is time limited. I think it is important that after 2 months \nwe recognize clients who have signed the contract, the Parent \nEmpowerment Contract, are working toward objectives and can continue to \nreceive assistance.\n  After 2 years, if the individual is not working, States will be \nrequired to offer workfare or community service. Again, tough sanctions \narise to those who refuse to participate in this welfare program.\n  The Democratic plan requires work and establishes the Work First \nemployment grants if States focus on work, providing the means and the \ntools needed to get welfare recipients into jobs and to keep them in \nthe work force. All able-bodied recipients must work.\n  There are successful programs now. We do not know how successful; \nthey have not been in existence long enough. We have a great program in \nRiverside, CA. They have sorted clients into two streams. Most programs \nput everybody in the same stream. What they have done is they sort \nclients into two streams: one, those that need educational assistance; \nand those that are job ready.\n  It is a program we can look to see if it will have long-term \nbenefits. We have a program in Iowa that has received some rave \nreviews. It is a family investment type program designated to move \nfamilies off welfare into self-sufficient employment. The State of \nOregon has a program. There are a lot of programs that States, if they \nhave resources, which will be given in this bill that we have submitted \nin the form of an amendment, States can do some type of innovative \nprograms.\n  Our program does not say, States, you must do it this way. But we are \nsaying people must work and that we are going to give you some \nfinancial assistance so that you can accomplish some of these things.\n  I repeat, States are provided resources for the work requirement. \nUnder our plan, States are given the resources so welfare recipients \nnot only get a job but remain in the work force. See, getting a job is \nnot the key to everything because you have to keep them in the job. \nStates have the flexibility that I have outlined before.\n  One of the key facets of the Democratic proposal that is not in the \nRepublican proposal is child care. That is, to help recipients keep a \njob, child care assistance will be made available to all those required \nto work or prepare for work. There are three current child care \nprograms. They would be consolidated into one program. We have had good \nwork by Senator Dodd and Senator Hatch on this in years gone by. I \nconducted hearings in the State of Nevada on child care and how \nimportant it was. I learned firsthand, in hearings I held in Reno and \nLas Vegas, how critical it is, if we are going to have a successful \nwelfare program, to have some child care components.\n  We also have to encourage clients to stay in jobs by making \nemployment more attractive than welfare. We have talked about the \nimportance of child care. We also have to talk about the importance of \nhealth care. Under our program, an amendment we will vote on tomorrow \nafternoon at 4 o'clock, Medicaid coverage will be extended by an \nadditional 12 months beyond the current 1-year transition period. It is \nneeded. If you are going to give people incentives to keep working and \nsave the Federal Government money, then they must have the ability to \nhave child care and health care.\n  Also, we have to make sure the statistics are not phony. Our program \ncounts actual work. As I have indicated earlier, the underlying bill is \nkind of a moving target because it keeps changing for reasons we have \nall read about in the newspapers. But we must have a work performance \nrate that is a real work performance rate.\n  I have talked about fathers, how they also must be part of the \nprogram if we are going to do something about absent parents. The \nburden has been on women. We have to divert the attention to make it a \nresponsibility of parents, and parents includes the man. That is \nusually the one who avoids responsibility. Absent parents who are \ndelinquent on child support payments, under our legislation, must \nchoose to enter into a repayment plan with the State, community \nservice, or try jail. That is in our legislation, and I think that it \nis fair.\n  Under our legislation, we are going to try to keep families together. \nUnlike the current system under which women and children receive more \nassistance if parents are separated or divorced, the Work First plan \nencourages families to stay together to work their way off welfare. Our \nplan eliminates the man-in-the-house rule, which prohibits women from \nreceiving benefits if they have a spouse living in the same house who \nis working full or part time. Let us have this a family friendly \nwelfare package.\n  We have talked about teen parents. Under our plan the message to teen \nparents is clear: Stay at home and stay in school. Stay at home and \nstay in school. No longer will a teenage parent be able to drop out of \nschool and establish a separate household, creating the cycle of \ndependency that is difficult to break. Custodial parents under the age \nof 18 would be required to live at home or, if there is some reason \nbecause of an abusive situation or whatever other reason that is \nmeritorious that they should not live at home, then there would be an \nadult-supervised group home where parenting skills would be taught, \nwhere there would be employment opportunities available.\n  I say to my friends, a program like this is not impossible. A few \nmonths ago I went to Fallon, NV. Fallon, NV, is about 60 miles from \nReno. It used to be an agricultural community and it still is. The \nlargest naval training facility for airplanes in the world is there, \nFallon Naval Air Training Center. It is a great facility.\n  I had been asked to visit a Lutheran Church in Fallon, because it was \npart of the AmeriCorps project. I went there and met with the priest \nwho had moved to Fallon several years before. He was contacted first by \nthe school across the street from his church, saying we have all these \nteenage pregnancies, could you help us? He did not know how to help. He \nsaid, ``I cannot. I do not know what to do.'' Then he was contacted by \nthe State Welfare Department. Finally, somebody said, ``We have this \nAmeriCorps project. Why do we not make a grant and see if we can get a \nprogram to help teenage pregnant girls.'' They made an application. \nThere is an AmeriCorps project there.\n  It brings tears to your eyes to go there. Mr. President, there is not \na single person now on welfare who has been through this program. It is \nright across the street from the high school. The pastor, who came \nthere to care for his flock, has now become devoted. His whole church \nis involved in taking care of these teenage girls who become pregnant. \nThey are being educated. They are getting their high school diplomas. \nThere are people who are working in the program, earning money so they \ncan use the money to go to college. It is a wonderful program.\n  There are programs we can come up with to help teenage pregnant \ngirls. But these programs require funding.\n  So I ask everyone to take a close look at our bill. It is a good \nbill. If this amendment is defeated tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, I \nhope we will have an opportunity to vote on an amendment dealing with \nchild care and the many other problems involved in \n\n[[Page S 12710]]\nwelfare reform, which are not properly addressed by the Dole bill.\n  The Democratic plan addresses the problem of teenage pregnancy by \nincluding grants to States for design and implementation of teen \npregnancy prevention programs. I will not go into more detail right \nnow, but it is extremely important.\n  Paternity establishment is in our bill. We cannot let these men \nescape their responsibility, as they very often do. Child support \nenforcement is in our legislation.\n  Also, I want to talk a little bit about the provision in our \nlegislation dealing with food assistance reform--food stamps--major \nprovisions. We have one strengthening compliance, reducing fraud and \nabuse. It is an effort to clamp down on the egregious abuses of the \nprogram. The Work First Program provides the following:\n  The Secretary of Agriculture may establish specific authorization \nperiods so that stores have to reapply to continue to accept food stamp \ncoupons and may establish time periods during which stores have their \nauthorization revoked or, having had their application for \nauthorization denied, will be ineligible. Stores may be required to \nprovide written verification of eligibility. The Secretary shall be \nrequired to issue regulations allowing the suspension of a store from \nparticipation in the program after the store is initially found to have \ncommitted violations.\n  Now they commit violations and, in effect, thumb their noses at the \nauthorities because nobody can stop them from taking food stamps. Our \nbill changes this.\n  Stores that are disqualified from the WIC Program shall be \ndisqualified from participation in the Food-Stamp program for the same \nperiod of time. Retail stores are disqualified permanently from the \nFood-Stamp Program for submitting false applications. There are other \nthings that are important to strengthen this provision: enhancing \nelectronic benefit transfer, strengthening requirements, and penalties. \nThere are a number of things that really make this legislation more \nimportant.\n  I want to close by talking about a couple of things, in effect, to \nset the record straight. People who oppose this amendment charge that \nthe Work First plan is weak on work. This claim comes from the same \npeople who only a short time ago approved and reported a plan out of \ncommittee with no participation requirements.\n  So I say in response to that charge that their plan was not even \nabout workers; it was about shoveling people from one program to \nanother with no emphasis on work, with no emphasis, no work requirement \nat all, and now they have dropped their participation requirements and \ninstead have adopted our work standards, the standards in this \namendment pending before this body. So try to explain to me how the \nDemocrat plan is weak on work when the underlying Dole amendment picks \nup our plan.\n  There is also a charge that the Democratic substitute is weak on \nState innovation. The Democrat Work First plan provides States \nunprecedented flexibility. The States set benefit levels. States set \nallowable asset limits. States set income. Disregard policies. States \ndesign their own work programs. In fact, there is a lot of similarity \nhere between the Democratic and Republican plans. So why do they charge \nWork First as being weak on State innovation? It simply is not true.\n  Another charge: The Democrat plan is weak on savings.\n  Mr. President, the Democratic Work First plan saves over $20 billion. \nIt is not weak on savings. The Breaux-Mikulski plan saves as much as \nthe Republican plan, or as close. But it also does not include a $23 \nbillion unfunded mandate to the States; that the States are going to \nrue the day that this underlying legislation passes. They will rue the \nday. As the Conference of Mayors said, this will be the ``mother of all \nunfunded mandates.'' The Democratic plan will result in deficit \nreduction without unfunded mandates to the States.\n  Let me close by saying, yes, we should change the present way welfare \nis handled. But we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. We \nhave to do a better job of being compassionate but also have a bit of \nwisdom in what we are doing with so-called welfare reform.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a recent paper by the Progressive Policy \nInstitute leveled three criticisms at the Republican welfare reform \nplan. It is to generate short-term budget savings, the first charge \nleveled; to satisfy GOP Governors' demands for flexibility; and, \nlastly, to avoid making tough decisions.\n  Now, obviously, that last statement is most ludicrous that the \nProgressive Policy Institute leveled against us because we have seen \nthe Federal Government fail on welfare reform. You know, there was a \nmassive effort made in 1988 at the Federal level to move people from \nwelfare to work, to save the taxpayers money. We have seen 3.1 million \nmore people on welfare now than before we passed our so-called welfare \nreform plan in 1988.\n  In the meantime, we have seen States like Missouri, my State of Iowa, \nthe States of Wisconsin, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey--and I \nsuppose there are a lot of others that ought to be named--reform \nwelfare in a very ambitious way and in an ambitious way that we have \nnot had the guts or the will to do here in Washington, DC, at the \ncongressional level. And we have seen through State action people move \nfrom welfare to work and saving the taxpayers money. In my own State of \nIowa we have 2,000 less people on welfare than 3 years ago when we \npassed the welfare reform plan. We have seen our monthly checks go from \nan average of $360 down to $340. And we have seen the highest \npercentage of any State in the Nation of people who are on welfare \nmoving to work, at 35 percent.\n  So can you believe it, Mr. President, that the Progressive Policy \nInstitute would level a charge that we are trying to avoid making tough \ndecisions when we have failed at tough decisions or we \n\n[[Page S 12711]]\nhave not made the tough decisions that should have been made and we \nhave seen States make those tough decisions and be very successful in \nthe process?\n  Also, that second criticism that is leveled, to satisfy the GOP \nGovernors' demands for flexibility, well, the history of welfare reform \nproves that when we have given States waivers so that they can do \ncertain welfare reform things that we could not do here, we have seen \nthat flexibility move people from welfare to work and to save the \ntaxpayers money.\n  So, obviously, it is ludicrous that we would have these sorts of \ncharges leveled against us. But those three criticisms do reveal very \nkey differences between Republican plans for welfare reform and \nDemocratic plans for welfare reform.\n  One of the things that sets the Republican effort apart from the \nDemocrats is our unwillingness to apologize for our desire to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002. We want to balance the budget because it \nis the right thing to do. By not having a balanced budget, we are \nliving our lives at the expense of our children and grandchildren. \nEvery child born today already owes $18,000 to the Federal Government, \nand will pay 80 percent of his or her lifetime income in taxes if we do \nnot balance the budget and do it as soon as we said we were going to do \nit as well.\n  Of course, not balancing the budget and passing on the costs to our \nchildren and grandchildren--and if one of those were born this very \nminute, and there are some at this very minute being born, they have \n$18,000 a year debt before they ever get out of the hospital.\n  It is immoral, it is irresponsible, and it cannot continue. \nRepublicans acknowledge that and we were elected to do something about \nit, and so part of the process of balancing the budget is to make sure \nthat there are no sacred cows, to make sure that every program in the \nbudget, every geographical section of the country contributes toward \nbalancing that budget.\n  So one of those programs that must be affected is the welfare program \nof the Federal Government, a program that we thought we reformed in \n1988, a program that has produced 3.1 million more people on welfare, \nand that is after increases in welfare had leveled off dramatically \nduring the 1980's.\n  Some people in this body would say that we have had the dramatic \nincrease in welfare numbers, the 3.1 million I referred to, because we \nhad a recession in 1991 and 1992. But not so, because if you go back to \nthe recessions of 1975 and 1976, which were much deeper than the \nrecession of 1991 and 1992, you will not find dramatic increases in \nwelfare. In fact, you will find a decline in the number of people going \non welfare.\n  But if you study very deeply the reason why we have 3.1 million more \npeople on welfare than we did when we passed the 1988 Welfare Reform \nAct, it is directly attributable to some of the changes that were made \nthere.\n  Welfare must be affected then. Welfare reform must come as part of an \neffort to balance the budget, even though welfare reform is a worthy \ngoal in and of itself, even if we were not trying to balance the \nbudget.\n  Why is it worthy in and of itself? Because we have had 40 or 50 years \nof Federal AFDC programs that have encouraged dependency, discouraged \nindependence, ruined the family, besides costing the taxpayers a lot of \ndollars.\n  Are we saying that people who have problems that need help to get \nover a hump in their lives should be disregarded by Government? Not \nwhatsoever. But we are saying that the program of helping people over a \nbump or a hump in their life, a period where maybe they were destitute \nand needed some short-term help, we are saying that should not become a \nway of life, and a program that provides that short-term help should \nnot lead to greater Government dependency and lack of personal \nresponsibility.\n  So, in the effort to balance the budget, as we acknowledge that, we \ndo not see reducing the budget as the reason for welfare reform, but we \nsee that as a result. If we change welfare from a trap to a trampoline, \nwe will spend less on the program in the long run. If it is a system \nthat springs people to independence and removes generational effects of \nthe current program, it will cost less. That is a result, that is not a \nreason for welfare reform.\n  Another difference, after saying that a major difference between the \nRepublican plan and the Democratic plan is that we believe in balancing \nthe budget, but that is a result, that is not a reason for welfare \nreform, then another difference between our plan and that of our \nopposition is that we Republicans believe State leaders are more than \ncapable of making good decisions on how to help the needy. We believe \nthat Governors and State legislators and other State leaders, people \ncloser to the grassroots, can create more innovative systems that \nactually work better to meet the needs of those who need some short-\nterm help over a hump, over a bump in their life. We do not believe \nthat States should have to come, hat in hand on bended knee, to some \nFederal bureaucrat for permission to try some new idea. That is a very \nkey difference between Republicans and Democrats.\n  Thank God there have been some waivers given, and maybe that is one \ngood aspect of the 1988 legislation, it did give States some leeway. \nBut can you believe it? My State of Iowa adopted a program, and it was \n8 months before the Federal bureaucrats got done playing around with it \nso we got the approval to move ahead with a program that has 2,000 less \npeople on welfare, reduced the monthly checks from $360 to $340 and has \nraised from 18 percent to 35 percent the percentage of people on \nwelfare moving to jobs.\n  Republicans think that States should have the flexibility to create \nsystems that work for each State's population. We do not believe, as \nRepublicans, that you can pour one mold in Washington, DC and out of \nthat mold have a program that attempts with success and with good use \nof the taxpayers' dollars to handle the welfare problems of New York \nCity the same way that we would in Waterloo, IA or, in the case of the \nPresiding Officer, Cleveland, OH.\n  We think that leaders at the local and State level are going to get \nus more for our taxpayers' dollars, spend less of those dollars and \nprobably move more people to work and have less dependency than what we \nwill if we try to solve this with one uniform program that treats the \nwelfare problems in New York City exactly the same way they are treated \nin Waterloo, IA.\n  We Republicans acknowledge that the old one-size-fits-all approach of \nWashington, DC has been a disaster. It has not worked. It will not \nwork, and Republicans are simply living with reality to want to change \nit, change it based upon the successes of States who have had more guts \nto experiment, to try dynamic new approaches to moving people from \nwelfare to work than what we were willing to do at the Federal level.\n  There is one more thing that I want to point out of this particular \ncriticism, Mr. President. I believe Democrats are failing to realize \nthat the American people have elected 30 Republican Governors. They, \nobviously, are saying that the Democrats have had their chance at \nworking out these problems and nothing happened. Now Republicans are \nbeing given the opportunity, and we are taking it and we are making the \nmost of it.\n  The President ran on a platform promising to end welfare as we know \nit. Well, he failed. With a Democratic President in 1993, 1994, with a \nDemocratic President for the first time in 12 years, a President who, \nin his opening speech to the Congress, reiterated what he said in the \n1992 election, that we are going to end welfare as we know it, we never \nhad a proposal. So that administration has failed. That Congress has \nfailed. The people chose the Republicans for a new Congress, and so we \nare giving the people what we said we would in the last election and \nwhat they said they wanted.\n  Finally, Republicans are making tough decisions. We are admitting \nthat we at the Federal level do not have a lock on ingenuity, or a lock \non wisdom, and obviously we do not have a lock on compassion. We are \nacknowledging that there is creativity, that there is wisdom, and there \nis concern at the State level. We are humbly accepting that maybe we at \nthe Federal level do not have all of the answers. There is an old \nsaying, Mr. President, which is that insanity is doing the same old \nthings and expecting different results.\n  Well, that is what the Democrats are doing, I believe, with their \nwelfare reform program. Republicans recognize that by giving up some of \nour power to the States and the people, we will have \n\n[[Page S 12712]]\nbetter results both in terms of meeting the needs of low-income \nfamilies and in terms of our efforts in balancing the budget. The \ncriticisms of the Progressive Policy Institute are, of course, out \nthere in the public with the intention of shaping us into changing our \nperspective. On the contrary, I think they simply let us know, as the \nmajority party in this new Congress, that we are headed in the right \ndirection by getting the Federal Government basically out of the \nwelfare business, turning it over to the States, for the track record \nof the States in recent years has been a tremendous success compared to \nthe failure of the last reform out of this Congress which, instead of \nproducing savings, is costing much more. Instead of moving people from \nwelfare to work, we have 3.1 million more people on welfare, a greater \ndependency on the Government, less personal responsibility, and \nobviously a great cost to the taxpayers.\n  That is why I hope this body will ratify the work of the Finance \nCommittee on the welfare reform proposal that came out of that \ncommittee. It came out of the committee with some bipartisan support--\nall of the Republicans and a few of the Democrats--because I think that \nthere is going to be a bipartisan effort on final passage, if we can \nget there. I believe, quite frankly, that whatever passes this body is \ngoing to be signed by the President. I do not think, even if he does \nnot get the welfare reform that he wants--with the public cry for \nwelfare reform and for moving people from welfare to work and saving \nthe taxpayers dollars, and an understanding of that at the grassroots--\nthat this President would dare veto anything that we send.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I know that the day has almost ended. \nPrior to the time that it does, I want to have just a few minutes to \naddress one more time the Work First legislation, the pending piece of \nlegislation, and my reasons for believing it ought to be adopted by our \ncolleagues tomorrow.\n  Before I describe again those reasons and our goals in drafting the \nlegislation, let me reiterate my gratitude to the many Senators who \nhave had much to do with the tremendous effort put forth by our caucus \nin proposing this legislation. Thirty Members of the Senate have \ncosponsored this bill, and that, in large measure, is due to the \nleadership of Senator Mikulski, Senator Breaux, and the remarkable \nefforts of a number of our colleagues who have had special interests in \nvarious pieces of the bill, and were instrumental in bringing us to the \npoint of introducing the bill prior to the August recess.\n  Let me also express my gratitude to the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Moynihan, for his unparalleled leadership in this \narea, for all of the work he has done on this issue, for the many years \nhe has provided us guidance, and for the terrific legislative \naccomplishments we have been addressing as we have debated this bill.\n  The Family Support Act is really the foundation of our welfare reform \nsystem. And, as many have indicated throughout the day, were it not for \nthat, we would not have made the progress that has already been well \ndocumented already in this debate.\n  Madam President, there are four fundamental goals, as I see it, as we \nlook to what we hope to achieve by the enactment of this legislation.\n  First, we want real welfare reform. Second, we want to recognize that \nproviding people with skills, providing people with new opportunities, \nand providing people with the wherewithal to get off welfare is really \nthe primary objective of what we are doing. Work is a goal that I hope \nwould unite all Senators, Republican and Democrat, as we attempt to \naccomplish our goals in this area.\n  Third, and perhaps equally as important in many respects, we want to \nprotect children. Of the 14 million AFDC recipients in the 5 million \nfamilies who receive assistance through AFDC, 9 million are young \nchildren dependent upon the services and the resources that we provide \nthrough the infrastructure that exists today. Protecting children, \nensuring that they have the opportunities to become productive adults, \nand ensuring that they can acquire the skills necessary to break the \ncycle of dependency if their parents cannot--protecting children ought \nto be a goal for everybody here, and certainly that is the goal of the \nWork First plan.\n  Finally, we recognize that you simply cannot have meaningful welfare \nreform if you do not provide the funding. It is one thing to set goals. \nIt is one thing to lay out a new infrastructure. It is one thing to \nassert objectives and to expect the States in some way to respond to \nall of those objectives and requirements within any new piece of \nlegislation; but if they are not funded properly, we cannot expect any \nof those goals to be realized. Regardless of how elaborate and how \npleased we may be with whatever infrastructure we create, we cannot \nexpect those goals to be meaningfully realized without adequate \nfunding.\n  We want to ensure that, whatever it is we do, we understand up front \nhow we are going to pay for it. Those are the goals.\n  We want real reform. We want to emphasize work. We want to protect \nchildren. We want to ensure that, as we do those three things, we \nprovide the necessary resources to do so.\n  Madam President, I want to talk briefly tonight about each of those \nfour goals and what it is we believe is so important and essential as \nwe consider the strategies to achieve those goals. There are four \nspecific strategies we have laid out in the Work First plan that we \nhope will convince any skeptic we are serious in our strong desire to \nbuild upon the things that have worked well, and to replace those \nthings that have not worked as well as we would have hoped.\n  Part of this effort involves changing the culture of welfare. We need \nto have people in those welfare offices who are there to provide more \nthan just financial resources, who can be there to provide the kind of \nopportunities that people want as they walk into a welfare office--\npeople with an expectation that they want more than just money, with an \nexpectation that they want to acquire skills, with an expectation that \nthey want to break the cycle of dependency, with an expectation that \nthey truly can change their lives.\n  To do that we have to make welfare offices employment offices, \nrecognizing that it is through employment and through opportunities to \nuse acquired skills that people can acquire a dignity and a confidence \nabout their lives that they do not have today. If we are going to do \nthat, indeed, we have to retrain staff and refocus the whole concept of \nwhat the welfare office is about. We need to refocus this concept on \nwork, on providing the training and opportunities necessary to make \nthese services meaningful for the people who walk through those doors.\n  We want to encourage States to consolidate and streamline the welfare \ninfrastructure to ensure that, through a one-stop mechanism, we can do \nall that is possible with a visit to that particular office so that we \ndo not require people to go from one office to the next to the next to \nthe next in search of help.\n  We also need to restore some common sense to this process. Common \nsense would say that yes, a father ought to be part of this process. \nYes, we want to welcome the man back into the family. Yes, we recognize \nthat two parents are better than one. Yes, we recognize the current \nsystem, in some respects, is penalizing families for staying together. \nWe want to restore common sense to the system.\n  We want to do all of this, not by boxing up the current system and \nshipping it to the States, not by simply saying to the States, ``You do \nit with fewer resources, with less real ability for Federal-State \npartnership. You do it.'' That is not the solution. That simply is \nshifting the problem to somebody else.\n  We really hope we can avoid doing that with whatever course we choose \nto take during this debate. However we finally achieve our goal of \nchanging the welfare culture, it is certainly our hope \n\n[[Page S 12713]]\nthat we simply do not expect the States to do it by themselves.\n  To accomplish real reform, we have to start by changing the culture \nof welfare. We also want to redefine it--not just change the culture, \nwe want to redefine it. We want to give it a new meaning, a new \nunderstanding, a new definition from that which has existed in the \npast.\n  That is why we eliminate the program commonly referred as AFDC. We \nreplace it with what we call temporary employment assistance. That is \nmore than just a name change. Temporary employment assistance is a \nconditional entitlement. It says to welfare recipients that there is no \nmore unconditional assistance. We will provide assistance subject to \nyour willingness to take responsibility. If you are willing to take \nresponsibility, we are willing to provide you with the tools to enable \nyou to achieve change in your life, to achieve new opportunities for \nyourself and for your family.\n  All recipients would be required to sign a parent empowerment \ncontract, which puts into writing this reciprocity in a way that \neveryone understands, so there is no misinterpretation. It is in black \nand white. ``Yes, I will go find work. Yes, I will acquire the skills. \nYes, you will help me do so. You will provide me with opportunities \nthat I do not have today.'' It is all going to be written out so there \nis no misunderstanding.\n  We require all able-bodied recipients to do as much as possible to \nachieve their goals in work. Even those who are not able-bodied would \nbe required to take some responsibilities, even if they are not \nworking. But there would be an appreciation of the need to take \nresponsibility.\n  So we do redefine the system. We try to break it out from past \npractice and clearly define what it is we are trying to do.\n  Part of what we are trying to do is limit the length of assistance. \nWe say that 5 years ought to be enough. Five years is applicable in \njust about all cases, but there are some very clear cases where that is \ninappropriate or not prudent.\n  Certainly, children who live with someone other than their parent \nought to be exempt. Certainly, those who are disabled, or caring for \nthe disabled, need to be exempt. We both agree that mothers with \nchildren under the age of 1 ought to be exempt. Women in the third \ntrimester of pregnancy, I believe of all people, ought to be exempt. \nThose living in high unemployment areas, that is above 8 percent--and \nthere was a good colloquy this afternoon about what that means--should \nnot be thrown into the street. You cannot expect someone to go out \nthere and find a job when there are simply no jobs available.\n  So we base all of those exemptions, Madam President, on set criteria, \nand that really is a fundamental difference between our bill and the \nbill introduced by our Republican colleagues. What the Republicans do \nis simply exempt a flat 15 percent. It does not matter if any of these \ncategories would take the population in any given area beyond 15 \npercent. If you are a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy and we \nhave hit the 15 percent threshold, you are out of luck. If you are a \nchild living with someone other than your parent and you need help and \nyou are in an area where 15 percent has already been realized, you are \nout of luck. I really do not believe my colleagues on the other side \nwant to do that, but that is what the bill says.\n  So, Madam President, we understand the need to set a lifetime limit \nin most cases. But we also recognize the necessity of addressing the \nreal needs and concerns and problems of individuals, the practical \nproblems associated with real lives of people who do not fit any neat \nlittle box, any neat little description.\n  We also recognize that you cannot dictate all this from Washington. \nIt does not work. And, as we have seen already with the Family Support \nAct, providing opportunities for States to become workshops, become \nprototypes, become environments within which new ideas can be explored, \ncan be very valuable.\n  Giving States flexibility is absolutely essential, so we allow States \nto set benefit levels and eligibility and asset rules and income-\ndisregard policies. We recognize we are not going to require a one size \nfits all, that South Dakota is different from New York and Maine. So we \nwant, as much as possible, to give States latitude, to give States \nflexibility, to give States the opportunity to experiment. And the Work \nFirst plan ensures that States are given that flexibility.\n  So, Madam President, that is our first goal, to engineer real reform \nby creating a new infrastructure that allows us to provide assistance \nin a way that we have not done before. So we began with that.\n  Then, as I said, our second goal is to give as many people as \npossible the opportunity to work. We prescribe five strategies to do \nthat by attempting, in part, to reflect the values that many of us had \nthe good fortune to learn early on. We call it Work First because that \nis really what we want to do. That is what we were all, hopefully, \nbrought up to think--that in order to live our lives fully as American \ncitizens, in order to achieve all that we want to do, we have to take \nresponsibility, and part of taking responsibility means acquiring \nskills to work in whatever endeavor we may choose. That is part of what \nit is to become a productive citizen in this country. Whatever luxuries \nwe may enjoy, whatever opportunities we may have, whatever benefits we \nhope to acquire, in part is dependent upon our ability and our desire \nto work. Those are not just South Dakota values, as ingrained as they \nare in most people in my State, but they are values that we find in \nevery State of this country.\n  So we require recipients to work. The goal is not simply to create \njobs that do not exist today. What we want, as much as we can achieve \nit, is to ensure that we create those opportunities in nonsubsidized, \nprivate sector employment. We want people to be employed for the right \nreasons--not simply to occupy their day, not simply to pay off a \nGovernment debt, but truly to become involved in an activity, in a job \nfunction for which there is a reward other than the money they receive. \nSo finding private sector employment is our first objective.\n  So we require an intensive job search for the first 2 months. If no \njob has been achieved at the end of 6 months, we go to the second \noption: we require community service. We work with them to develop the \nkind of job skills and the discipline through community service that \nmay ultimately give them the chance to apply those skills in private \nsector opportunities later on.\n  There is a difference, as others have alluded to today, between our \nbill and the Republican bill in that regard. Our bill requires that \nthis effort take place in 6 months. The Republican plan has no work \nrequirement for 24 months.\n  But again, Madam President, as I said just a moment ago with regard \nto our goal of real reform, when it comes to work we also recognize the \nneed to give States flexibility--the flexibility of putting people to \nwork through placement services or vouchers, by creating micro-\nenterprise or self-employment concepts, by using work supplementation, \nby implementing a program like the GAIN program in Riverside, CA, the \nJOBS-Plus Program in Oregon, the Family Investment Program which has \nworked so well in Iowa--all of those options and many more would be \navailable to any State that would so choose. We do not want to limit \nthem. In fact, we want to expand the short list that I have already \nprovided, giving States the flexibility to put people to work in \nwhatever way they find to be the most appropriate.\n  I could imagine in South Dakota there would be a lot of rural-related \nwork, a lot of agriculture-related work, perhaps in some cases work \nhaving to do with forestry or tourism. But clearly every State would \nhave definitions, different expectations, and certainly different \nstrategies.\n  We give States bonuses for putting people to work, bonuses for \nexceeding the work threshold, and bonuses based on job retention, not \njust placement. It is not enough just to acquire a job. We want to \nensure that those people have the opportunity to stay in that job, to \ngo beyond just the first month or 2 months or 3 months. We want to give \npeople careers--not just jobs--careers that give them satisfaction and \nreward beyond just a check.\n  Finally, and perhaps this is the most important--certainly our caucus \nfeels that it is the most important-- if we \n\n[[Page S 12714]]\nare going to create incentives for work, we have to abolish the \ndisincentives that exist today. And there are two profound \ndisincentives. The one that troubles me the most is to tell a young \nwoman, we want you to work, but you have to leave your children \nsomewhere to do so. We are not going to help you pay for it. We are not \ngoing to really make much of an effort to help you find adequate child \ncare. We want you to work, and you have to take care of your children \nregardless of cost. We do not care if you only net $1 an hour. We want \nyou to work. We cannot accept that.\n  If we want real reform, then we owe it to those families to do our \nlevel best to help them find a way to take care of their children. I do \nnot want to see 10 million children on the streets 10 years from now \nand everybody asking the question, as the distinguished ranking member \nsaid so eloquently in our caucus, ``How did it happen?'' I do not want \nto see more broken homes. I do not think any one of us ought to ask the \nquestion, How is it so many people today do not have the appropriate \nupbringing, and we are filling our prisons with people who do not know \nbetter, when there is no one at home to teach them right from wrong?\n  It is no mystery to me why crime is going up, when two people in the \nsame household have to work night and day to make ends meet, and \noftentimes, because they cannot afford child care, rationalize that \nmaybe it is OK to leave their children at home unattended day after \nday, night after night. That is unacceptable.\n  Today 60 percent of AFDC families are mothers with children under \nsix-- over half. And we are going to ask them to go out and get a job \nand somehow miraculously have an angel appear somewhere to take care of \ntheir kids while they do so. We cannot do that.\n  Child care is critical. It enables people to work. It is an \ninvestment in our kids. But the Republican plan has no money for \nchildren. There is none in there right now. So I do not know how they \nexpect to cope with that problem, if, indeed, they want to solve the \nwork problem.\n  As I said, it is great to lay out all these goals, and it is great to \nset up a new infrastructure that looks wonderful on a chart. But how \ngreat is it when you get down to the real issue, when you are going to \ntell someone they better find a job in a 6-month period of time, but \nthere is no money for your children.\n  Health and Human Services said that we need an additional $10.7 \nbillion to do it right over a 7-year period of time--$10.7 billion if \nwe are going to do it.\n  The second issue is health care. I do not blame anybody for not \ntaking a job at a minimum wage in a McDonald's restaurant if all they \nget is $4.35 an hour and lose the health care their children have \naccess to through Medicaid today. I do not blame them for doing that. I \nmust tell you that if I were in that situation, I would do exactly the \nsame thing. How can we say, ``We do not care if your kids get sick; you \ngo out and flip hamburgers, and somehow your kid will get well without \nhealth insurance.''\n  Madam President, we are better than that. Those kids deserve better \nthan that. And providing them with transitional Medicaid coverage is \njust common sense.\n  So that is how we handle work. Five strategies, five very specific \nideas on how we get people out the door, confident that their children \nare cared for, confident that they have some real opportunities to \nchange their lives.\n  The third goal is protecting children, and so much of work and \nprotecting children is interrelated. But ensuring that child care and \nhealth care and maintaining the safety net we have created for children \nis essential. If you are going to protect children, child care is a \nhigher goal than simply the money we save, as important as that is, and \nI do not want to minimize it.\n  Health and Human Services estimates the Republican plan has a \nshortfall of over $16 billion in protecting children, $10 billion in \nchild care costs alone. That is the shortfall.\n  Now, maybe somebody someday can give us a projection on what that \nsavings will ultimately generate in additional costs. How much more \nwill we pay later on for what we have saved today?\n  Madam President, we have to protect children, so we put an exemption \nto the time limit for children in our plan. There ought not be any time \nlimit for children. We want to give them all the time they need to grow \ninto productive citizens. We want to provide them with every \nopportunity for rent, for clothing, for whatever other needs they have \nbecause it is not their fault they are in the position of needing \nassistance. It is not their fault that their parents do not have a job. \nIt is not their fault that they were born into families that may or may \nnot have any real chance of success. But I can tell you this: If we do \nnot care for them, their chance of success is gone.\n  We recognize as well that teenage pregnancy is something we have to \naddress, so we ask that teen mothers be required to live at home or in \nsome supervised group home. We require that teen parents stay in school \nso they have the skills they need to succeed in life.\n  I have had the opportunity on occasion to talk to teen mothers who \nhad no home and who were out there all by themselves, despondent, \ndesperate, rejected. The chance for them is even less than all those \nwho may have had some other opportunity.\n  This is one area in which there ought not be a lot of State \nflexibility, in my opinion. I think it is critical that we address the \nteenage pregnancy problem, given our limited understanding of what is \noccurring there. No one has all the answers. But we recognize that we \nhave to provide a safety net to the extent that it can be provided. We \nalso recognize that we have a right to expect some responsibility. And \nit is that balance between a safety net and responsibility that always, \nin my view, has to be considered as we make our decisions with regard \nto policy options.\n  We also have tough child support enforcement provisions. We base our \nprovisions on those proposed by the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nthe Presiding Officer, to improve interstate and intrastate collection.\n  We require that noncustodian parents take responsibility, pay up, \nenter into a repayment plan or choose between community service and \njail. I am told that the default rate on used cars is 3 percent. The \ndefault rate on child support is 50 percent in this country.\n  We can do better than that, Madam President. And it is going to take \ntougher enforcement requirements, a realization that we can do a lot \nmore than we have done so far in bringing people to the responsibility \nthat it is going to take to make families families again, to give \nchildren the chance to be protected. That ought not just be a Federal \nor State responsibility; it must be a family and a parental \nresponsibility. And the provisions of the Work First Act allow that to \noccur.\n  Finally, as I said, Madam President, our fourth goal is to ensure \nthat we do not have the unfunded mandates, that we all lament here from \ntime to time. And I am deeply concerned--of all the concerns I have, \nother than child care and the protection for children in the Republican \nbill, the greatest second concern most of us have with the bill as it \nis now written is this requirement for States to do so many new things, \nbut the absolute absence of resources to do so.\n  We are not going to address the root causes of our problems if we \nsimply rhetorically address them in new legislation without providing \nthe resources. And there has to be an understanding of partnership. The \nFederal Government and the States can work together, local governments \ncan work with the Federal Government, but there has to be a sharing of \nresources and an acquisition of resources in the first place to make it \nhappen.\n  The Republican bill increases requirements on the States \ndramatically, all kinds of new requirements that the States are going \nto be expected to do--a huge unfunded mandate. As I said, Health and \nHuman Services says over the next 7 years that unfunded mandates will \nexceed $16 billion. So States are going to be left with one of two \noptions: ignore them or cut benefits and increase taxes to pay for \nthem.\n  The costs are being shifted to the States and ultimately they will be \nshifted to localities and to the taxpayers, and in a mishmash of ways \nto acquire the resources that I think would be very unfortunate. We \nneed to provide a guaranteed funding stream to \n\n[[Page S 12715]]\nmake this happen correctly. We do not want the Federal Government to be \nthe biggest deadbeat dad of all. We do not want this bill to be the \nmother of all unfunded mandates. And yet I fear, Madam President, that \nis exactly what we are going to do unless we address the concerns that \nmany of us have raised in this debate already. So that is really what \nwe accomplish with this bill: No. 1, real reform; No. 2, an emphasis on \nwork; No. 3, a desire and a mechanism to ensure that we protect \nchildren; and No. 4, the assurance that we are not going to create \nsomething that nobody wants, a huge new unfunded mandate.\n  Madam President, I sincerely hope that tomorrow when the vote is \ntaken, this can be a bipartisan vote, that a number of Republicans who \ncare as deeply as any of us do about all that we have addressed tonight \nwill join with us in passing a bill we believe can accomplish all that \nwe want in changing welfare reform and changing the culture of welfare, \nin creating jobs, in protecting children. We can do that. We can do it \ntomorrow afternoon. We can do it by voting for the Work First bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

App. 2, 6(c)), I am submitting my second Annual \nReport on Federal Advisory Committees covering fiscal year 1994.\n  This report highlights continuing efforts by my Administration to \nreduce and manage Federal advisory committees. Since the issuance of \nExecutive Order No. 12838, as one of my first acts as President, we \nhave reduced the overall number of discretionary advisory committees by \n335 to achieve a net total of 466 chartered groups by the end of fiscal \nyear 1994. This reflects a net reduction of 42 percent over the 801 \ndiscretionary committees in existence at the beginning of my \nAdministration--substantially exceeding the one-third target required \nby the Executive order.\n  In addition, agencies have taken steps to enhance their management \nand oversight of advisory committees to ensure these committees get \ndown to the public's business, complete it, and then go out of \nbusiness. I am also pleased to report that the total aggregate cost of \nsupporting advisory committees, including the 429 specifically mandated \nby the Congress, has been reduced by $10.5 million or by over 7 \npercent.\n  On October 5, 1994, my Administration instituted a permanent process \nfor conducting an annual comprehensive review of all advisory \ncommittees through Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-\n135, ``Management of Federal Advisory Committees.'' Under this planning \nprocess, agencies are required to review all advisory committees, \nterminate those no longer necessary, and plan for any future committee \nneeds.\n  On July 21, 1994, my Administration forwarded for your consideration \na proposal to eliminate 31 statutory advisory committees that were no \nlonger necessary. The proposal, introduced by then Chairman Glenn of \nthe Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs as S. 2463, outlined an \nadditional $2.4 million in annual savings possible through the \ntermination of these statutory committees. I urge the Congress to \npursue this legislation--adding to it if possible--and to also follow \nour example by instituting a review process for statutory advisory \ncommittees to ensure they are performing a necessary mission and have \nnot outlived their usefulness.\n  My Administration also supports changes to the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act to facilitate communications between Federal, State, \nlocal, and tribal governments. These changes are needed to support this \nAdministration's efforts to expand the role of these stakeholders in \ngovernmental policy deliberations. We believe these actions will help \npromote better communications and consensus building in a less \nadversarial environment.\n  I am also directing the Administrator of General Services to \nundertake a review of possible actions to more thoroughly involve the \nNation's citizens in the development of Federal decisions affecting \ntheir lives. This review should focus on the value of citizen \ninvolvement as an essential element of our efforts to reinvent \nGovernment, as a strategic resource that must be maximized, and as an \nintegral part of our democratic heritage. This effort may result in a \nlegislative proposal to promote citizen participation at all levels of \ngovernment consistent with the great challenges confronting us.\n  We continue to stand ready to work with the Congress to assure the \nappropriate use of advisory committees and to achieve the purposes for \nwhich this law was enacted.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nintroduce a broad package of legislation motivated by a single \nconviction. That conviction is that we will never have a strong society \nif our civil society is weak. The order of our streets, the character \nof our children, and the renewal of our cities all depend directly on \nthe health of families and neighborhoods, on the strength of grassroots \ncommunity organizations, and on the vitality of private and religious \ninstitutions that care for those in need because it is these \ninstitutions that transmit values between generations, that encourage \ncooperation between citizens, and make our communities seem smaller, \nmore friendly, and more manageable.\n  In nearly every community, rich and poor, they once created an \natmosphere in which most problems--from a teenage girl in trouble to \nthe rowdy neighborhood kids--could be confronted before their \nrepetition threatened the very existence of the community itself. It is \nan increasingly clear fact of social \n\n[[Page S 12717]]\nscience, and I think something evident to all of us in teaching of \ncommon sense, that when this network of civil society is strong, there \nis hope, hope in communities, hope in families, hope in America. And \nwhen it is weak, we find a destructive form of despair that pervades \nour land.\n  This fact is a challenge to the left which tends to concentrate on \nindividuals and their rights, not communities and their standards. But \nit is also a challenge to the right which seems to overconcentrate on \nsimply transferring funds from one bureaucracy to another and changing \nthe incentives of the current welfare system.\n  Make no mistake. I support the goal of limiting government and of \ntransferring resources and authority to levels of government closer to \nthe people. But our deepest social problems, especially illegitimacy \nand violence, are not rooted in economic incentives or the level of \ngovernment where spending takes place. I suggest they are rooted in the \nbreakdown of value-shaping institutions. Government has always depended \non these institutions. It does not create them. There is no legislative \npackage that I or anyone could offer that would rebuild them. And there \nis no legislative package that could ever be written to replace them, \nalthough we have had an experiment here for the last 30 years or so \nwith failed bureaucratic government approaches to these problems.\n  There is, however, I would suggest, an urgent need for Government to \nrespect, recognize and, wherever possible, encourage this network of \ninstitutions that creates community. This, I am convinced, is the next \nchallenge for this Congress and the next stage of the Republican \nrevolution.\n  After the reach of government is limited, as it must be, the question \nis how do we nurture the caring safety net of civil society? How do we \ndepend on it rather than undermine it or attempt to replace it? This \nconcern should reorient our thinking and our efforts. Our central goal \nshould be to respect and reinvigorate those traditional structures--\nfamilies, schools, neighborhoods, voluntary associations--that provide \ntraining in citizenship and pass morality from generation to \ngeneration.\n  I hope this is a specific debate--that is what I want--not a general \ndiscussion. So I have made and will offer this morning a series of \nspecific proposals. They are not, and I do not pretend them to be, a \ntotal solution to the problems that we face in society. But it is on \nthese issues that I believe a constructive argument can begin.\n  I have 18 specific pieces of legislation. People can take these 18 \nbills as a blueprint or as a target. But my goal is to start a debate \non items that I believe matter. I will not take the time this morning \nto describe each of these proposals, but in the next few days every \nMember of the Senate and the House will receive material summarizing \nthem. However, I do want to take a few moments to describe the theory \nbehind these proposals. Each one is designed to encourage in the margin \nwhere it is possible three levels of society.\n  First, eight of the bills are directed at strengthening the role of \nfamilies and specifically fathers and, in their absence, providing \nmentoring programs. This is the most basic level of civil society and, \nI would suggest, the most vulnerable level of civil society today.\n  Second, six of the bills I am introducing are aimed at encouraging \nprivate, local, grassroots organizations that are renewing their own \ncommunities: community development corporations, neighborhood watches, \nmaternity group homes, small businesses.\n  And, finally, four of the bills are designed to encourage private and \nfaith-based charities in individual acts of compassion. They have an \neffectiveness denied to government because they have the resources of \nlove and spiritual renewal that no government can or even should \nprovide.\n  This legislative package is part of a larger report and larger \neffort, which I have titled the ``Project for American Renewal.''\n  I have undertaken this project with Dr. William Bennett. I intend to \ncall a series of hearings on these themes. We intend together to speak \nout on the goals, the theory behind the goals, and the specific \nelements of the proposal.\n  We attempt to highlight the extraordinary success of some of these \nprivate and faith-based charities and the corresponding failure of \nGovernment bureaucracies to address some of our most fundamental, \nunderlying social problems. Two hearings are already scheduled for the \nend of September.\n  We also intend to raise this debate with Presidential candidates and \nin the Republican platform. It is my conviction that the Republican \nrevolution will fail unless we have a message of hope that our worst \nsocial problems are not permanent features of American life, that these \nchallenges are and can be confronted not by failed Government efforts \nbut by private community faith-based institutions that nurture lives \nand bring renewed hope.\n  I want to assure my Republican colleagues I believe in devolution, \nlimiting government, giving authority and resources to State \ngovernments, but there is a bolder form of devolution that I think \nshould take place beyond government. We should not only transfer \nresources and authority to States but beyond government entirely to \nthose private institutions that humanize our lives and reclaim our \ncommunities.\n  This I believe is the next step for Republicans. It is also a theme \nthat I think will challenge the creativity of both parties and may \nlikely cross party lines. We should adopt this approach because the \nalternative, centralized bureaucratic control, has failed. But I think \nthere is another reason we should adopt this approach. We should adopt \nit because it is profoundly hopeful. These institutions do not just \nfeed the body but they touch the soul. They have the power to transform \nindividuals and renew our society. There is simply no alternative that \nholds such promise.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the text of these 18 bills and ask \nthat they be printed in the Record, and I hope that my colleagues will \nlook at them carefully.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I congratulate the Senator from Indiana. He and I are \non exactly the same wavelength on this. When we were debating the \nwelfare bill initially a few weeks ago before the recess, I cited from \na little pamphlet called ``To Empower People--The Role of Mediating \nStructures in Public Policy.'' It is 20 years old and it is by Peter \nBerger and Richard John Neuhaus, two quasi-philosophers. One has some \nbackground in religion. I will quote just the first page:\n\n       Two seemingly contradictory tendencies are evident in \n     current thinking about public policy in America.\n\n  Bear in mind, this is 20 years ago.\n\n       First, there is a continuing desire for services provided \n     by the modern welfare state . . . The second tendency is one \n     of strong animus against Government bureaucracy and bigness \n     as such.\n\n  And then here I might even disagree with this sentence.\n\n       We suggest that the modern welfare state is here to stay, \n     indeed that it ought to expand the benefits it provides--but \n     that alternative mechanisms are possible to provide welfare \n     state services.\n\n  And then they just leapfrog even State and local governments and they \nidentify for us neighborhood, family, church, and voluntary \nassociations. And that is why we have put in our bill to the extent we \ncan make it constitutional that there is no prohibition about giving \nmoney to the Goodwill or Catholic Charities or a Jewish home for the \naged if they are administering social services that we deem relevant.\n  And just because there happens to be a menorah in the hallway or a \ncross on the wall should not make them ineligible to deliver the kinds \nof services that they deliver better than any government we have ever \nseen. I am sure the Senator, as I have, has been to shelter workshops \nand has seen the Salvation Army or Goodwill and what they do with a \nminuscule amount of money and lots of volunteers and community spirit \nthat cannot be bought. If you try to buy it, you lose the spirit. And \nso I am delighted with what the Senator had to say today. And we are on \nexactly the same wavelength. I hope we are successful.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his remarks, and I \nlook forward to the analysis of the legislative items I put forward. \nAgain, I \n\n[[Page S 12718]]\nwant to say there is no legislation that necessarily can adequately \naddress this underlying problem, but there are certainly things that I \nthink we can do to encourage and to nurture, to provide respect and, \nhopefully, some measure of support to these institutions which, as the \nSenator from Oregon has said, just do remarkable jobs because they go \nbeyond providing mere material needs and meeting those needs, which is \nimportant, but they also can transform lives.\n  It is something that government cannot do to the extent that we can \nconstitutionally. And we had the same concerns as we drafted this \nlegislation. Can we constitutionally encourage these mediating \ninstitutions? I think our society will find that source of hope that so \noften is absent from our discussions.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. It is interesting. Maybe the only constant in history \nis change. In the early common law, 13th, 14th, 15th century, juries \nwere picked on the basis that they knew the defendant, not that they \ndid not know the defendant or did not know the facts. These were \nneighborhood institutions. And who better to judge somebody than a \ngroup that knew somebody.\n  We moved totally away from that. Now we sequester the Simpson jury \nfor months and months and months so they do not know anybody, \nhopefully. But that was an attempt by the law 500 years ago to say, \n``We think neighbors are better judges of people than anybody else.'' \nWe moved away from it, maybe wisely, maybe not.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assets for Independence \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) traditional welfare programs in the United States have \n     provided millions of low-income persons with critically \n     needed food, health, and cash benefits, and such programs \n     should be improved and continued;\n       (2) while such programs have sustained millions of low-\n     income persons, too rarely have such programs been successful \n     in promoting and supporting the transition to economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (3) millions of Americans continue to live in poverty and \n     continue to receive public assistance;\n       (4) in addition to the social costs of poverty, the \n     economic costs to the Federal Government to provide basic \n     necessities to the poor exceeds $120,000,000,000 each year;\n       (5) poverty is a loss of human resources and an assault on \n     human dignity;\n       (6) poverty rates remain high and welfare dependency \n     continues, in part, because welfare theory has taken for \n     granted that a certain level of income or consumption is \n     necessary for one's economic well-being when, in fact, very \n     few people manage to spend or consume their way out of \n     poverty;\n       (7) economic well-being does not come solely from income, \n     spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, \n     investment, and accumulation of assets, since assets can \n     improve economic stability, connect people with a viable and \n     hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other \n     capital, enable people to focus and specialize, yield \n     personal, social, and political dividends, and enhance the \n     welfare of offspring;\n       (8) income-based welfare policy should be complemented with \n     asset-based welfare policy, because while income-based \n     policies ensure that present consumption needs (including \n     food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, \n     asset-based policies provide the means to achieve economic \n     self-sufficiency and, accordingly, to leave public \n     assistance;\n       (9) there is reason to believe that the financial returns, \n     including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased \n     welfare cash assistance, of individual development accounts \n     will far exceed the cost of the investment;\n       (10) the Federal Government spends more than \n     $160,000,000,000 each year to provide middle- and upper-\n     income persons with incentives to accumulate savings and \n     assets (including tax subsidies for home equity accumulation \n     and retirement pension accounts), but such benefits are \n     beyond the reach of most low-income persons;\n       (11) under current welfare policies, poor families must \n     deplete most of their assets before qualifying for public \n     assistance;\n       (12) the Federal Government should develop policies that \n     promote higher rates of personal savings and net private \n     domestic investment, both of which fall behind the levels \n     attained in other highly developed industrial nations; and\n       (13) the Federal Government should undertake an asset-based \n     welfare policy demonstration project to determine the social, \n     civic, psychological, and economic effects of asset \n     accumulation opportunities for low-income persons, families, \n     and communities, and to determine if such a policy could \n     provide a new foundation for antipoverty policies and \n     programs in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, earlier this summer the Clinton \nadministration released its report on affirmation action. The \nPresident's report devotes considerable attention to the Small Business \nAdministration's 8(a) Minority Contracting Program. The report details \nthe 8(a) program's failings and abuses, but in the end the President \nconcludes that the program should be saved in the name of affirmative \naction.\n  As the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have first hand \nfamiliarity with the 8(a) program. It is a program that gives a very \nvaluable government contracting preference to members of certain \nminority groups without requiring proof of specific discrimination or \nsocial disadvantage.\n  The 8(a) statute requires proof of economic disadvantage. But in \npractice, even those who have accumulated substantial wealth are still \nwelcomed into this program. An applicant to the 8(a) program is deemed \neconomically disadvantaged if the applicant has a net worth less than \n$250,000, excluding the value of his or her home and the value of the \nsmall business owned by the applicant.\n  Let's focus for just a minute on what this economic disadvantage test \nreally means. According to data provided to me by the Administrator of \nthe Small Business Administration, 81.6 percent of all small businesses \nowners in the United States have a net worth under $250,000.\n  But the 8(a) limit for economic disadvantage doesn't stop at \n$250,000. Once you are in the program, net worth can grow to $750,000 \nwithout jeopardizing participation in the 8(a) program. The SBA \nAdministrator has informed me that 91.6 percent of all small business \nowners have a net worth below this level. And President Clinton's \naffirmative action report correctly notes that business owners with \nexcessive wealth even above these levels have managed to avoid \ndetection and wrongfully remain in the 8(a) program.\n  So let's review where we are on the 8(a) program. We have a program \nsupposedly for small business owners who are socially and economically \ndisadvantaged. But an applicant is eligible for the 8(a) program \nwithout an individual showing of specific discrimination. Then, under \nthe economic disadvantage test, over 80 percent of all small business \nowners in the United States would be small enough to be eligible. And \non top of that, an 8(a) participant's wealth can triple in size once in \nthe program and still remain eligible for special government contract \npreferences.\n  It doesn't surprise me that participants in the 8(a) program are \nfighting to save it. It is a good deal for anyone who can get in.\n  In April 1995, I chaired a hearing before the Committee on Small \nBusiness, and we heard a great deal of passionate testimony about the \n8(a) program--both in favor of and opposed to the program. One of the \nwitnesses was Josh Smith, founder of Maxima Corp., one of the best \nknown companies to have participated in the 8(a) program. Mr. Smith\n discussed how the 8(a) program fails to benefit low-income communities \nand low-income minorities.\n\n  Mr. Smith testified that 8(a) companies were not locating in and \nhiring people from needy neighborhoods and distressed inner cities with \nlarge numbers of unemployed members of minority groups. To the \ncontrary, too often 8(a) firms can be found in northern Virginia or \nsuburban Maryland. I think its wrong that the important objective of \nthis program--bringing economic opportunity and jobs to historically \ndisadvantaged areas and small businesses--has been lost.\n  Today, the 8(a) program builds wealth among a small group of \nindividuals who own small businesses and who gain acceptance into the \nprogram. The program makes no effort to encourage hiring of minorities \nor residents of distressed areas, nor is there any requirement that the \n8(a) company assist community redevelopment effort by locating in or \nperforming work in distressed areas. The social disadvantage \nrequirement of the 8(a) program is satisfied merely if the owner, who \ncontrols 51 percent of the company, is a member of a prescribed racial \nor ethnic group.\n  I believe the 8(a) program as we know it today should be replaced \nwith a race neutral program specifically designed to use Federal \ncontracting expenditures to help attract small businesses and \nemployment to distressed areas with low income and high unemployment. \nSuch areas might be located in the inner city, on an Indian \nreservation, or in Appalachia.\n  I suggest we call these areas historically underutilized business \nzones or \n\n[[Page S 12746]]\nHUBZones. My proposal will allow any small business located in a \nHUBZone and employing people in the HUBZone to obtain a reasonable and \nmeaningful preference in competing for Federal Government contracts \nagainst other businesses not located in a HUBZone.\n  My proposal begins to return the idea behind the 8(a) program to its \nroots, when it was targeted to inner city areas after the riots \nfollowing the assassination of Martin Luther King. In this case, \ngovernment contract set-asides were used to bring in new businesses to \nareas trying to recover from the dramatic damage and tension that \naccompanies a riot, such as those that occurred in 1968.\n  The HUBZone replacement for today's 8(a) program should not be \nlimited, however, to inner cities. My program creates hope and \nopportunity for all cities, rural areas, and Native American \ncommunities that have not prospered while other more affluent areas of \nour country have flourished.\n  For too long, we have overlooked programs to bring jobs and wealth to \neconomically distressed areas of our Nation. We now have an opportunity \nto take a positive step to provide long overdue help where help is \nneeded in our country. The HUBZone proposal will create a powerful \nprivate-public partnership to give opportunity to small businesses who \nlocate in economically distressed areas and to give hope to people who \nhave not had much chance until now to pull themselves up the economic \nladder.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12745-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE NATIONAL SECURITY EDUCATION PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this Defense appropriations bill \nincludes $7.5 million for the National Security Education Program. I \nwant to congratulate my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for \nensuring funding for this important program.\n  The National Security Education Program has enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport. President Bush signed the National Security Education Act, \nwhich established the National Security Education Program, in December \n1991. The chief Senate sponsor of the bill was Senator David Boren, who \nis now president of the University of Oklahoma. Senators Nunn and \nWarner were cosponsors.\n  The National Security Education Program was designed to support study \nabroad by U.S. students. The program emphasizes the study of foreign \nlanguages and preparation for possible careers in national security. \nFunds go to U.S. institutions, undergraduate scholarships, and graduate \nfellowships.\n  The program guarantees a return on the Federal investment by \nrequiring that recipients of fellowships and scholarships be obligated \nto serve in a Federal Government agency or an educational institution \nin the area of study for which the scholarship or fellowship was \nawarded.\n  According to CRS, this is the only major Federal program that \nsupports study abroad by U.S. citizen undergraduate students.\n  The program operates from interest on a trust fund, based on a one-\ntime 1992 appropriation of $150 million. In fiscal year 1995, the trust \nfund yielded $15 million.\n  Pressured to find savings in these tight budget times, the \nAppropriations Committee voted to cut funding for the program and \neliminate the trust fund in the Defense supplemental bill we considered \nearlier this year. I offered an amendment on the Senate floor that \nrestored funding for the program. The amendment was accepted on a voice \nvote.\n  A compromise was reached in conference whereby all 1995 funding was \nsaved but the trust fund was reduced from $150 million to $75 million. \nThis was a fair compromise given that the House also had originally \nvoted to eliminate the program.\n  I am pleased that for fiscal year 1996, the Appropriations Committee \ndecided to continue funding for the program, even though it is \nnecessarily based on a smaller trust fund which yields less interest \nthan it had previously. This is an effective program that addresses a \nserious national interest and I commend the committee for its wise \naction.\n  Foreign language proficiency is crucial to our national defense and \nsecurity but there is much that needs to be done. Of the 500,000 \nAmerican troops the United States sent to the Persian Gulf, only five \ncould translate Iraqi intelligence documents. The United States has the \nonly foreign service in the world you can get into without the \nknowledge of a foreign language.\n  Foreign language proficiency and knowledge of other cultures is also \nimportant for our economic competitiveness. There is a simple rule of \nbusiness: ``You can buy in any language, but if you want to sell you \nhave to speak the language of your customer.'' The fact is that four \nout of five new jobs in the United States are created through foreign \ntrade.\n  An article that appeared on the front page of the business section of \nthe Sunday Los Angeles Times on August 28, 1994 noted that: ``In a \nglobal economy, study and business experience abroad are critical. Yet \nAmericans stay home while 400,000 foreign students come here to \nlearn.''\n  Last year, the National Security Education Program supported 317 \nstudents from 150 U.S. institutions who studied in 48 countries with 34 \ndifferent languages. The average award was $8,000 per student. Cutting \nthe program would yield very small savings. But the dividends from such \nprograms are very real.\n  I hope the Senate can maintain support for this program when the bill \nmoves to conference.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12746-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12746-S12748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n COMMEMORATION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORMAL SURRENDER OF THE \n                            EMPIRE OF JAPAN\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to offer my thoughts on the occasion \nof the 50th anniversary of the formal surrender of the Empire of Japan \nand the end of World War II.\n  Mr. President, September 2, 1995, marked the day, 50 years ago, that \nthe Empire of Japan signed documents of surrender aboard the U.S.S. \nMissouri in Tokyo Bay, formally ending World War II. It is fitting that \nAmerica commemorated the anniversary of this most pivotal event in \nhuman history--the victory of the free world over three irredeemable \nregimes in which human evil was institutionalized and directed toward \nworld conquest: Germany's naziism, Italy's fascism, and Japan's \nmilitaristic imperialism.\n  In the 2,194 days of World War II, more than 50 million human beings \nlost their lives. This horrific total includes nearly 300,000 Americans \nkilled in combat, six million Jews murdered in Europe, and one million \nChinese slain in the Japanese rape of Nanking.\n  Fifty years ago, a vicious war had finally ended, but ancient cities \nlay in ruins. Mighty armies had been vanquished. Proud cultures had \nbeen decimated. But today, one overriding truth has gradually become \nclear: Though much was lost, far more has since been gained.\n  In the European theater, World War II saw the indescribable bravery \nof American teenagers at Normandy and Pointe du Hoc, and the \nunfathomable butchery of the Third Reich. In the Pacific, the hallowed \nplaces of valor, suffering, and self-sacrifice continue to echo down \nthe halls of American history: Bataan, Corregidor, Midway, Iwo Jima, \nOkinawa.\n  The vast scope of World War II encompassed the final cavalry charge \nand the first wartime use of the atomic bomb. It is fitting and proper \nthat, 50 years after the end of this conflict, all Americans quietly \nreflect upon the meaning of the war, and, in particular, upon the \nawesome destructive power unleashed by these bombs dropped on Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki from a U.S. Air Force B-29, killing 200,000. This act of \nAmerican servicemen, done in our name, does not make them--or us--\nwarmongers. On the contrary, the soldier, sailor, and aviator above all \nyearn for peace--even while obeying all moral and reasonable orders of \ncivilian leaders--because he or she endures the greatest fear and \nanguish from war.\n  Mr. President, our ongoing national debate over the propriety of \nAmerica's use of these weapons reflects an active national moral \nconscience. It is an indication that Americans continue to care about \nwhat was done by their Government in their name. It signals our \nappreciation that national choices have moral consequences for which \nall Americans are responsible. In the case \n\n[[Page S 12747]]\nof Hiroshima and Nagasaki, these consequences continue to reverberate \nthrough American and world history.\n  Fifty years after the fact, it is difficult to recapture the national \nmood and historical context of August 1945. The temptation of latter-\nday historians is to narrowly focus on only these two events--as \ndestructive and horrible as Hiroshima and Nagasaki were--apart from the \nhistorical context in which they occurred. This is sometimes done with \nthe intent to advance a particular agenda or political point of view. \nThis tendency, known as historical revisionism, was recently seen in \nthe controversy over the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian, and in \nthe debate over changing ``V-J Day'' to ``Victory in the War of the \nPacific,'' to avoid offending Japanese sensitivities.\n  Hiroshima and Nagasaki cannot be accurately assessed in the abstract. \nThese events are directly linked to Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Bataan, and, of \ncourse, Pearl Harbor, where the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial bears silent \nwitness to the memory of 1,177 American sailors who died on the morning \nof December 7, 1941. The average age of the 1,102 who, to this day, \nremain entombed in the Arizona's watery grave, is 18. These teenaged \nsailors were heroes before they were men.\n  Some armchair historians, safely ensconced in ivory towers, issue \nmoral condemnations of the very acts of war that saved American lives \nand, in large measure, preserved their freedom to issue those \ncondemnations. They enjoy the benefits of freedom--particularly, the \nfreedom to dissent--with little appreciation of its costs. They don't \nadequately appreciate that freedom is not free, but has been purchased \nwith the blood of young Americans whose names they will never know. In \nre-writing the events that preserved their freedom, and the freedom of \nmuch of the world, they engage in more than dubious scholarship; they \ndishonor the memory of those of whom General MacArthur said, ``they \nfought and died * * * and left the air singed with their honor.''\n  A credible historian must endeavor to learn the lessons of history. \nTo learn these lessons, he or she must know the facts on which the \nlessons are based.\n  Mr. President, to fairly evaluate Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the \nhistorian must strive to see the world as Truman saw it, and to fully \nembrace the objective facts that he confronted. In this evaluation, all \nare entitled to their own opinions; none are entitled to their own \nfacts. And facts can be stubborn things. What were the facts on which \nTruman based his fateful decision to use the atomic bomb?\n  Truman, as Commander in Chief, was responsible, not only for \ndetermining and prosecuting military strategy, but also for the lives \nof his troops. As a World War I combat veteran, he knew well the \nbrutality of war, and regarded his duty to minimize American casualties \nto be a sacred moral obligation. One can only imagine the firestorm of \ncriticism if, in 1947, it was revealed that America had a weapon--no \nmatter how destructive or horrible--that just might have saved American \nlives had it been used. George Elsey, a young naval intelligence \nofficer in constant contact with Truman prior to and at the time the \ndecision was made, believes that ``the answer is impeachment.''\n  Truman knew well the high cost already paid in taking back the \nPacific islands: Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Midway. At Iwo Jima--\nwhere, in the immortal words of Adm. Chester Nimitz, ``uncommon valor \nwas a common virtue''--more marines were killed than in the entire \nKorean war.\n  And then, there was Okinawa, the bloodiest battle of the Pacific War \nand the last great engagement of World War II. Okinawa demonstrated \nwith brutal clarity how viciously the Japanese would fight to defend \ntheir home islands. Nearly 190,000 Army and Marine combat troops and an \narmada of 1,200 ships--second in size only to the Normandy invasion--\nbegan the assault. In less than three months of battle, 12,000 \nAmericans were killed, a total representing nearly 25 percent of all \nthe American deaths from 9 years of war in Vietnam. A 19-year-old \nsoldier wrote of the butchery of Okinawa in his last letter home 2 days \nbefore he was killed: ``the fear is not so much of death itself * * * \n[as it is] the terror and anguish and utter horror in the final moments \nthat precede death in this battle.''\n  The losses suffered by American ships and sailors at Okinawa remain \nthe greatest in world naval history: 30 ships sunk, 368 damaged, and \nmore than 5,000 sailors killed by kamikaze attacks during a battle \nfought after it was clear to the world that Japan had lost the war.\n  Mr. President, using Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a measure, according to \na Pentagon briefing received by Truman, a minimum of 250,000 and as \nmany as 600,000 American lives would be lost in an invasion of the home \nislands, predicted to be fought out for over a year, island by island, \nbeach by beach, cave to cave, and, in the end, hand to hand. Douglas \nMacArthur and Winston Churchill both estimated that one million allied \nsoldiers would be killed in an invasion of Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, \nand Kyushu, the Japanese home islands.\n  The Pentagon predicted 20,000 Americans would die in the first month \nalone. For Truman, this potential human cost was intolerable. If there \nwas a way--any way--to avoid such bloodshed, it seemed worth taking. \nHistorian David McCollough said the explanation for why Truman used the \nbomb was one word: ``Okinawa. He wanted to stop the killing.''\n  I believe this one fact, standing alone, fully justified Truman's \ndecision to use the atom bomb on Japan: Not one American life was lost \nin an invasion of the heavily fortified home islands of the Empire of \nJapan.\n  Additional facts also support Truman's decision. Some revisionists \nargue that the bomb was unnecessary because Japan was planning to \nsurrender. This is plainly refuted by the facts. Three days after the \nEnola Gay dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, killing 70,000 people and \nvirtually destroying the city, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, \nGen. Yoshijiro Umezu, assured the Supreme War Council meeting in Tokyo \nthat his troops could ``turn back the invading American force and get \nbetter terms than the unconditional surrender'' demanded by the Allies. \nOn August 9, in a meeting in his bomb shelter, Umezu was interrupted by \nan officer who announced that a second nuclear weapon had been dropped \non Nagasaki. The General's response: ``I can say with confidence that \nwe will be able to destroy the major part of an invading force.''\n  The Japanese leadership was caught between a realization of the \ninevitability of defeat and their cultural tradition in which suicide \nwas honorable, and surrender was sacrilege. They did not want a \nnegotiated peace. They chose, instead, to commit national suicide. As \nthe Japanese War Minister, General Anami, said, ``would it not be \nwondrous for this whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful \nflower?''\n  Emperor Hirohito's war-ending statement confirmed the role the atomic \nbombs played in ending the war. Hirohito cited the atomic bomb, which \nJapan was then hurriedly developing, in his taped broadcast to the \nnation announcing Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945. ``The enemy has \nbegun to employ a most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is \nindeed incalculable. To continue would result in the collapse and \nobliteration of the Japanese nation.''\n  So, in assessing whether the atomic bomb was needed to shorten the \nwar and to save the lives of American and Allied soldiers, let us not \nforget: The surrender of Japan did not occur until 5 days after the \nsecond atomic bomb was dropped.\n  Americans must not glorify in what was done at Hiroshima and \nNagasaki, but neither should we apologize for it. It is indeed a \nparadox of the 20th century that the weapons of war are, at times, \nnecessary to end war, to prevent war, and to advance the cause of \npeace. But, in view of the war's end and the 50 year peace that has \nensued, Pacific war veterans can take pride in just that.\n  In August 1995, Japan is endowed with political stability and is a \nthriving nation of human freedom and enterprise. The rubble of war has, \nphoenix-like, arisen from the ashes as an international center of \ndemocracy, culture, and learning. It is a historical aberration that \nthe vanquished of August 1945 arguably benefited more than the victors. \nWorld War II freed the Japanese and German people from evil, \ndestructive regimes and re-directed their national potential in ways \nthat have brought their people, and the world, \n\n[[Page S 12748]]\nunquantifiable economic, political, and cultural benefits. Japan, with \nfew natural resources, now produces over 10 percent of the world's \ngoods and services, and has become our friend and ally, our partner in \npeace and economic enterprise, a source of stability in the bustling \nPacific rim, and a major engine of international commerce.\n  So, as we commemorate the 50 years of peace and stability that began \nat the end of World War II, let us not forget the ultimate sacrifice \nmade by 300,000 young American soldiers, sailors, and aviators who \naccomplished the redemption of the Earth.\n  Surely, these young men and women from Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, \nMissouri, and every other State of the Union, realized the risks they \nran and the ultimate price that they might pay. But they also knew \nthat, while the price of freedom is high, the price of oppression is \nfar higher. With the courage of this conviction, they willingly offered \ntheir lives to defend transcendent principle and to preserve the \npromise of freedom for fellow human beings born and yet unborn. They \nfought for neither power nor treasure, and the only foreign land they \nnow revere lies beneath countless crosses and Stars of David where \ntheir fallen comrades rest.\n  America's World War II veterans embody all that is strong, noble and \ntrue about this Nation. They and their departed friends--and all others \nwho have protected the United States in peacetime and in war--served as \ngood soldiers and good citizens. Their high standard of allegiance has \nenriched our national consciousness and has cultivated and sustained a \nsense of purpose and patriotism in Americans across this great land. In \nselflessly laying their lives on the line, they helped ensure that, \nthroughout the world, the strong are just, the weak secure, and the \npeace preserved for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, in this year of commemoration, I know I share the \nsentiments of all Americans in saying to World War II veterans and \ntheir families: I salute you. Your country thanks you. God bless each \nof you.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12746-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      CENTENARIAN THOMAS STAVALONE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a great \nAmerican, Thomas Stavalone. On September 14 of this year, Thomas \nStavalone of Saratoga Ave., Rochester, NY, will be celebrating an event \nfew others have been privileged to achieve; he will be 100 years old.\n  Born in a suburb of Naples, Italy, in the village of Peturo in 1895, \nTom emigrated to America in 1904 at the tender age of 9. Together with \nhis family, he originally settled in the Scio Street area, later \nrelocating to the old 9th Ward section of Rochester, which he still \ncalls home. He attended No. 5 School, where he met the girl he would \neventually marry.\n  On June 30, 1917, Tom married his sweetheart, Immaculate LaMarca. She \nlived to the age of 90, passing away in 1987, after they had celebrated \ntheir 70th wedding anniversary. They had four children, Lawrence, \nAmelia, Margie and Thomas, Jr., who died in infancy.\n  As a sports enthusiast during his youth, he preferred to be an active \nparticipant rather than an observer. Tom is also an avid outdoorsman, \nenjoying both hunting and fishing. He would always share his bountiful \ncatch with neighbors and friends.\n  Tom worked in several Rochester shoe factories over the years, but \nwhen he retired in 1962 it was from a position with the Rochester \nTransit Authority.\n  Tom's chief activity today is gardening, but he also enjoys playing \nbocce and watching Yankee games. No matter what the weather, he walks \ndaily to the Stardust Room at Edgerton Park to share in their senior \ncitizen lunches. There he also enjoys the camaraderie of both neighbors \nand friends.\n  Tom has witnessed 17 men rise to become the President of our country \nextending from Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton. During his 100 years, \nTom has seen the progress in transportation go from the horse and buggy \nage to man landing on the Moon; mass communication has evolved from \njust the printed word to radio, and even computers; entertainment has \nextended from vaudeville to video. Times have certainly changed and Tom \nStavalone has been there to witness these many changes.\n  His family and friends will honor him with a gala celebration on \nSeptember 17, 1995, at the Mapledale Party House in Rochester, NY. I \nwant to thank Tom for his many contributions to the betterment of our \nworld and with him a very happy 100th birthday.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12748-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            RICHARD TISSIERE\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, on Friday, September 8, following \nclosely on the heels of our national celebration of the American \nworker, a prominent labor leader in my State will be honored for his \nmany achievements on behalf of all New Jerseyans and my State's labor \nmovement. Richard Tissiere, the business manager and president of the \nLaborers' Union Local 472, AFL-CIO, has devoted a lifetime of energy, \nenthusiasm, and hard work to both the local 472, his community and our \ncountry.\n  Richie Tissiere's commitment to his union, exemplified by his perfect \nattendance record at union meetings for the entire 43 years of his \nmembership, has contributed to the hard-won achievements of the \nAmerican work force. Today's American worker enjoys a living wage, \ncompany paid health benefits, safe working conditions and a 5-day \nworkweek as a direct result of the fruits of the labor of America's \nunions. This uniquely American compact between labor and management has \nrightly been the envy of the world. As the role of unions in today's \nwork force undergoes growing pains, we must remember that we all--rich \nand poor, management and worker--are in this together. For most of our \nhistory as an industrialized nation we have understood this fact. We \nunderstood that workers were not interchangeable parts but partners in \na quest for productivity and partners in a community. Richie Tissiere \nunderstands this compact and has devoted himself to ensuring that \nAmerica's unique partnership between worker and employer remains a \nvibrant part of our society.\n  Richie Tissiere's contributions to New Jersey have been many and they \nhave been varied. I have had the pleasure of working with Richie when \nhe served on my Labor Advisory Board in the State which is only one of \nthe ways that Richie has touched so many of his fellow New Jerseyans. \nGenerations of young soccer players have Richie and area labor unions \nto thank for supporting their leagues, boys and girls in Newark can tip \ntheir hats to Richie for his support of their youth clubs, and \nthousands of construction, highway, and mass transit workers appreciate \nthe role Richie has played in the booming construction industry in the \nState.\n  It is indeed fitting that the Essex-West Hudson Labor Council, AFL-\nCIO will pay tribute to Richie Tissiere, a fine New Jerseyan and a \ndedicated union supporter at their annual Labor Day Parade.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12748-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12748-S12749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    THE VISIT OF COMTE RENE DE CHAMBRUN TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS \n              CELEBRATING MICROFILMING OF LAFAYETTE PAPERS\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library of Congress, I want to bring to the attention \nof this body an agreement between the Library of Congress and the Comte \nRene de Chambrun of France to microfilm the Lafayette papers. In June, \nthe Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, agreed to begin \nmicrofilming the collection and make it available to scholars from all \nover the world by 1996. Rene de Chambrun, the great-great grandson of \nthe Marquis de Lafayette, will be honored this evening, Lafayette's \nbirthday, at a dinner sponsored by Congress and the Library.\n  Many will remember Rene de Chambrun who, like his ancestor Lafayette, \nwas held in high esteem by his American counterparts during World War \nII. Through a web of connections in the United States, Chambrun was \nable to convince President Roosevelt and others to send much needed \nmilitary equipment to Britain in mid 1940. The assistance, instigated \nby Chambrun, was no small factor in the Battle of Britain--the first \nbattle \n\n[[Page S 12749]]\nfought for control of the air and a battle which Hitler eventually \nretreated from.\n  In 1956, the Count de Chambrun, exploring La Grange, the 15th century \nchateau he had recently acquired near Paris, discovered a large \ncollection of personal papers of Lafayette. Since its discovery, this \ncollection, which has been carefully preserved and organized, has \nremained virtually inaccessible to historians and archivists and today \nremains one of the great scholarly mysteries of the 20th century.\n  LaFayette played a central role in both the American Revolution and \nthe French Revolution. Agreeing to serve without pay in the American \narmy, Lafayette was present at Valley Forge in the harsh winter of \n1777-1778. In France, he worked to make his country a constitutional \nmonarchy and held in his heart a strong desire that France would one \nday become a pure republic. Throughout his life he championed, \nsometimes at great personal cost, the ideas of liberty, equality, human \nrights and national self-determination that today are still cause for \ninspiration.\n  Approximately one-quarter of the 18,000 items in the Lafayette \ncollection contain information about the American Revolution and the \nestablishment of the new national government. The collection contains \nextensive correspondence with leading American political and military \nleaders. The ``hero to two worlds,'' as Lafayette was called, knew many \nof America's Founding Fathers well, particularly Presidents Washington, \nAdams, Jefferson, and Monroe. A preliminary examination of the papers \nindicates that some of this correspondence may be the only existing \nrecords of lost original letters. There is substantial documentation on \nthe American Revolution, including a secret code used by Lafayette and \nWashington and Lafayette's handwritten accounts of his 1781 campaign in \nVirginia and of the siege of Yorktown. There are important documents \nconcerning the participation of the French Navy in the war. Also of \ninterest are notes from visits to Monticello after the war where \nLafayette and Jefferson discussed the subject of slavery.\n  In addition, the collection contains original material regarding \nLafayette's role in the French Revolution and his imprisonment and \nexile from 1792-1799. It records his interactions with every major \nFrench leader from Louis XVI to Napoleon and his activities during the \nNapoleonic and post-Napoleonic period. It also contains significant \ncorrespondence with leaders of national liberation movements in Poland \nand South America, including Simon Bolivar. Furthermore, the Lafayette \npapers reveal his private life--the father, husband and farmer.\n  Through the process of microfilming, important pieces of the \nLibrary's collection are protected from extensive and damaging \nhandling. Microfilmed presidential papers are used quite often--I have \nfound occasion to explore the papers of President Herbert Hoover \nseveral times myself. I commend the Library of Congress for its \ndiligent efforts to see that the Lafayette papers are made available to \nthe public where they will join the papers of other prominent founding \nfathers such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, \nand James Madison.\n  As a body, the voluminous Lafayette papers promise to shed new light \non American history and our view of Lafayette--one of those rare \nfigures who decisively influenced the affairs of two great nations, the \nUnited States and France.

Mr. President, today, I would like to call my \ncolleagues' attention to an important issue of the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, which examines violence as a public \nhealth issue.\n  As too many Americans know, violence has become an epidemic in our \ncountry. Despite some admirable efforts, the problem has unfortunately \nnot been successfully addressed by congressional action. Given the \nscope of the problem, it is important for all Americans to focus on \nthis issue and contribute to the solution. I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend the American Medical Association for taking a \nleadership role in drawing public attention to this issue.\n  The June issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association \n(JAMA) is a prime example of the AMA's commitment. This issue focuses \non the recent emphasis in the medical community on addressing violence \nas a public health issue. Putting violence in this context raises the \nprofile of the issue and, I believe, greatly contributes to creating \nbetter solutions.\n  For example, an editorial entitled ``The Unrelenting Epidemic of \nViolence in America'' lists grim statistics about the prevalence of \nviolence in our society, and estimates the tremendous social and \nmedical costs to society caused by this violence. The editorial then \ncalls upon physicians to take an active role in working to reduce the \nmagnitude of this problem, and offers advice on ways to proceed:\n\n       Patient centered interventions may include education that \n     emphasizes primary prevention, such as discussing the hazards \n     of firearms and encouraging safe firearm storage practices, \n     appropriately screening for child abuse, domestic violence, \n     and elder abuse, and identifying and initiating proper \n     counseling for harbingers of violence such as alcohol and \n     other substance abuse, behavioral problems, emotional \n     disorders, and inadequate social support.\n\n  JAMA also encourages physicians to become antiviolence advocates by \nparticipating in community, State, or national public health policy \ndebates on violence, influencing public attitudes in favor of violence \nprevention initiatives, and supporting legislative and regulatory \nmeasures intended to reduce violence, such as those that limit the \navailability of handguns.\n  Because the causes of violence are so complex, we sometimes feel \noverwhelmed before we even begin the work to find solutions. To \nencourage its members, JAMA relates the story:\n\n       . . . of a stranger walking along a beach at noon on a \n     brilliant sunny day. As the tide has receded, a large number \n     of starfish have been stranded on the hot sands, baked by the \n     noonday sun. They surely will not survive until the next tide \n     returns. An older woman skitters about the beach, gently \n     picking up the starfish and tossing them back into the ocean. \n     As the stranger approaches and notices the tens of thousands \n     of starfish on the miles of sandy beach, he stops to ask the \n     woman, ``How can you possibly make a difference, with the \n     vast number of starfish that are stranded?'' The woman \n     replies, gently picking up a starfish next to her and showing \n     it to the stranger, ``For this starfish, it makes all the \n     difference in the world.''\n\n  To further encourage its readers, JAMA then relates the work of John \nMay, a physician with Cermak Health Services in Chicago, who is making \nan important difference in his community. According to JAMA, Dr. May \nhas received local and national attention for his work to develop \npatient screening and counseling techniques, study risk factors \nassociated with firearm violence, and promote violence prevention \nawareness. May has developed a simple mnemonic device involving the \nword ``guns'' to assess whether someone is at risk for a firearm \ninjury: Is there a gun in your home? Are you around users of alcohol or \nother drugs? Do you feel a need to protect yourself? Do any of these \nsituations apply to you: Seen or been involved in acts of violence? \nSadness? School-aged children at home? Furthermore, May believes that \nphysicians must work to deglamorize the gun, as they have done with \ncigarettes: Unfortunately, guns and violence are promoted as powerful, \nsexy, and effective. It's no wonder that young people are drawn to them \nand, tragically, killed by them.\n  The June issue of JAMA is not, however, the first example of the \nAMA's commitment to exploring the issue of violence. In 1994, the AMA \njoined with the American Bar Association and nearly 100 other groups in \npresenting the National Conference on Family Violence: Health and \nJustice. This important conference focused on the disturbingly \nwidespread problem of family violence, and made specific \nrecommendations, such as primary prevention through education, early \nintervention in at-risk families, and the development of community-\ncoordinated efforts to address this problem.\n  My colleagues, the Nation's physicians, and all Americans, can learn \nfrom the articles in the June issue of JAMA. But more importantly, we \ncan all learn from the AMA's example of \n\n[[Page S 12750]]\ncivic responsibility. I applaud their efforts and encourage my \ncolleagues to review the June issue and share it with medical \nprofessionals in their communities.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12749-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-19, TREATY \n          DOCUMENT NO. 104-20, AND TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-21\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, our friend and colleague Bill Bradley has \nsaid that he has always preferred moving to standing still. When the \n104th Congress adjourns around a year from now, the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey will move on to new challenges in his life and career, and \nwe will feel the loss of one of the most principled and thoughtful \nMembers of this body. While Senator Bradley has expressed a deep sense \nof disappointment in the country's current political climate, I know \nthat he will be able to look back on his career in the Senate with a \nlasting sense of pride in his accomplishments on behalf of the people \nof New Jersey, and of the Nation.\n  Bill Bradley's work in the Senate has been remarkable for the breadth \nof its legislative range, and for the depth of its intellectual \nfoundation. Whether addressing the intricacies of tax policy or the \nbroad impact of international trade proposals, his grasp of the subject \nmatter before him is unrivaled. Ask any Senator who has stumbled \nunprepared into a debate with him. Bill Bradley has been a legislative \nforce to be reckoned with, as he will continue to be until his last \nvote is cast in this Chamber.\n  Senator Bradley is often recognized for his mastery of technically \nintimidating issues. But I will always remember him more for the \npassion he can bring to a debate than for his oft-cited professorial \nprowess. In the last decade, some of the most socially important and \nemotionally powerful statements on the subject of racial strife in \nAmerica have been delivered from the heart and soul of Senator Bradley.\n  When Senator Bradley takes the floor to speak, or offers a \nlegislative solution to a national problem, he comes armed with \nformidable arguments and effective insights. When Bill Bradley takes up \nan issue or takes on a cause, he will likely succeed in what he's set \nout to achieve. This is the result of a rare combination of the \ncompetitiveness with which he was clearly born, and the credibility he \nhas earned through a life in public service.\n  If you are a working-class American, then Bill Bradley has served you \nwell. If you are poor or disadvantaged, Bill Bradley has made your \nconcerns his cause. Through the din of violence and divisiveness in our \nsociety, Bill Bradley has been a voice of healing. In the face of \nmonied special interests, Bill Bradley has been a fighter for fairness \nand economic justice. Bill Bradley has been a credit to the Senate, to \nthe Nation, and to public service. He has been a powerful advocate for \nthe values that so many of us share, and I look forward to working with \nhim on the vital matters we will face together in the months remaining \nin his term.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12751-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CLAIBORNE PELL: A TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in his commencement address at Syracuse \nUniversity in 1957, Senator John F. Kennedy called American politics \none of this country's ``most neglected, most abused, and most ignored \nprofessions.''\n  ``As one who is familiar with the political world,'' Senator Kennedy \ntold the graduates: ``We stand in serious need of the fruits of your \neducation. Bear in mind, as you leave this university and consider the \nroad ahead, not the sneers of the cynics or the fears of the purists.'' \nInstead, he urged us to bear in mind that politics has been a home as \nwell as a noble career to America's best and brightest.\n  In the early days of our Republic, there were George Washington, \nThomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and \nGeorge Mason, to name but a few.\n  John Kennedy had a way of making you feel good about yourself as well \nas your country, and he inspired many of us to look for ways to serve \nour country to preserve its strengths and address its weaknesses. This \nis one of the reasons so many of us look back on the Kennedy \nadministration with fondness and respect, and with a knowledge that we, \nas individuals, and we, as a country, are forever indebted to President \nKennedy for nurturing that spirit.\n  We are also indebted to another man who has dedicated his life to \nthat spirit: Senator Claiborne Pell.\n  Through the years it has been my privilege to work with the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, I have only known him to stress the \npositive, never the negative. He has always looked for the best in us, \ninstead of dwelling upon our faults. Never once have I heard him berate \nan opponent, or disparage this institution.\n  He has sought to bring us together instead of divide us. To make the \nsystem work better, instead of despairing it.\n  To Senator Pell, as it was with President Kennedy, politics is an \nhonorable profession, an enriching experience and meaningful service. \nThe political arena is where ordinary people can accomplish great \nthings. Claiborne Pell understood that.\n  In announcing his intention to leave the Senate, this gentle and good \nman remarked:\n\n       I continue to believe that government, and the Federal \n     Government in particular, can and should make a positive \n     impact on the lives of most Americans.\n\n  Through his efforts, the Federal Government has made a positive \nimpact.\n  In his 34 years in the Senate, Senator Pell used the system, with all \nof its faults and limitations, to make our country a better place to \nlive, a better place to work, and a better place to raise a family. He \nhas taken a leading role in passage of much of the landmark education \nlegislation of the past three decades, including reducing financial \nbarriers to higher education, with the educational grants that bear his \nname. He has taken a leading role in the creation of the Nation's most \nimportant educational and cultural institutions, including the National \nEndowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n  He has also sought to make not only the country, but also the world, \na better place in which to live and work. As a U.S. Senator and \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he has worked \ntirelessly to promote international cooperation through his work on \nbehalf of arms control agreements and international environmental \ntreaties. As Senator Moynihan pointed out yesterday, Senator Pell has \n``brought to the Senate floor two of the most important treaties for \nthe control of nuclear weapons in our Nation's history.''\n  Just this year, he proudly represented the Senate at the 50th \nanniversary of the United Nations. This was fitting, as Senator Pell \nwas at the United Nation's opening ceremonies 50 years ago, and he has \nbeen instrumental in the effort to further the noble goals that \ninspired the United Nation's creation in the first place.\n  Mr. President, this is statesmanship at its finest. It is the quest \nof peace--for international cooperation for the benefit of the United \nStates and the benefit of humankind.\n  Although Claiborne Pell is leaving the Senate, he has pledged to \ncontinue ``to fight for the values and programs'' that he considers \nvital.\n  How pleased I was to hear that promise. We will continue to need his \nspirit, his energy, and his dedication to making the good fight. \nTherefore, instead of saying goodbye, I will simply thank him for the \nyears he gave to the people of Rhode Island and to the people of this \ngreat country.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, and those \nin other great political arenas, to be a bit more like Senator Pell, to \nlook for the high roads, not the lowest ones. We should summon \nAmerica's best to step up onto the political stage, not scare them away \nfrom it. That is something Claiborne Pell has done remarkably well for \n34 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/06/senate-section/article/S12751-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
