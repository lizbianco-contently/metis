I thank the President pro tempore. This morning the leader \ntime has been reserved and there will be a period for morning business \nuntil the hour of 9:30 a.m.; and I just urge my colleagues--many always \nask for a period of morning business, so we have 30 minutes this \nmorning. I hope Senators will show up here in that time if they have \nanything to say. Then at 9:30 the Senate will resume consideration of \nS. 21, the Bosnia legislation. I assume rollcall votes can be expected \nthroughout today's session of the Senate. Also, under the provisions of \nthe agreement reached last evening, after a call for the regular order \nis made by the majority leader, the Senate may resume consideration of \nS. 343, the regulatory reform bill, and rollcall votes can be expected \non that bill as well, including a third cloture vote on the Dole-\nJohnston substitute. But I do not anticipate any votes on S. 343 today. \nI think there will be an effort--in fact, I know there is an ongoing \neffort already in progress of some on each side of this issue--to try \nto work out some compromises. I am not certain whether any will be \nachieved, but there is an effort made to do that.\n  I hope that everybody understands the importance of the regulatory \nreform bill. In my view, it is probably the second or third most \nimportant piece of legislation we have considered this year. It affects \nalmost every family, every small business man or woman, every rancher, \nevery farmer, every big business. And we have tried to make the case. \nWe made a number of concessions. We believe we have a real regulatory \nreform bill. We believe that it should be supported by 75 percent of \nthe Members of this body. And we did not understand, or at least this \nSenator does not understand, the reluctance of some on the other side \nto come to the table, because this is important legislation. It is a \nbattle between those in the private sector and the bureaucracy and \nthose who believe in more regulation and more Government and more \nmicromanagement from Washington, DC.\n  That is what is at issue here. Win or lose, it will be the issue. It \nseems to me that it is our obligation to try to put this together so \nthe American people are the winners. We did not have debate on this \nfloor as to whether we lost or they lost or somebody else lost. But \nobviously, there are some who cannot be satisfied, some who would gut \nthe so-called Dole-Johnston proposal. This is not what it is about. It \nis about real regulatory reform. So I hope that those who will be \nmeeting today will keep in mind the importance of this for the American \npeople, not the Senate, not the Senators, not somebody's ego, but the \nimportance to the American family where it has been estimated the cost \nof regulation is about $6,000 per year, which in most cases is more \nthan people pay in Federal income tax. So it is very, very important.\n  I will also give a report on welfare reform. We are making progress \non welfare reform, and we will have other meetings today throughout the \nday on welfare reform. It is still the hope of the majority leader that \non the week of August 7, we will take up welfare reform. And again it \nis not easy. Everybody has a different view on welfare reform. We \nbelieve we made some progress. And I hope, if we can resolve some of \nthe issues, we can start the process of drafting that legislation.\n  It also will be our intent to take up gift and lobbying reform next \nMonday. We are hoping to get a time agreement. We have a draft of a \ntime agreement that has not yet been given the Democratic leader. Also, \nthe Ryan White bill is supposedly coming up next Monday. And then also \nwe hope to have some \n\n[[Page S 10260]]\nappropriations bills tomorrow and Friday. So, I just state to my \ncolleagues, as far as we can determine at this point, there will be \nvotes throughout the day on Friday and there will be votes on Monday. \nWe will try to accommodate people on Monday by having votes occur later \nin the afternoon, but there will be votes on Monday.\n  So, again, I hope we can move ahead on reg reform. It seems to me, \nrather than to just stand in recess, we might as well move on to the \nBosnia resolution, which is highly important, as noted by the Chaplain \nthis morning. There are no easy answers when it comes to this conflict. \nBut it seems to me the best option at this point is to lift the arms \nembargo, give the Bosnians a right to defend themselves. They are an \nindependent nation. They are a member of the United Nations. And under \narticle 51, they have the right, or should have the right, of self-\ndefense. This is not involving American ground troops. In my view, it \ncertainly does not Americanize the war. If anything, it moves us \nfarther away from the conflict. I believe that would be in our interest \nand would satisfy the concerns of most Americans.\n  I reserve the remainder of my leader time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10259-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Madam President, earlier this month, in homes, \nneighborhoods, and communities across the country, Americans celebrated \nour Nation's 219th birthday.\n  There was, of course, much to celebrate. Over two centuries after the \nsigning of the Declaration of Independence, America remains what she \nhas always been--the beacon of freedom, and the last best hope for all \nmankind on Earth.\n\n\n                      remembering american history\n\n  But as we celebrate these freedoms, and commemorate those who have \nsacrificed so much along the way, we must also remember that American \nhistory is not always a tale of progress and dreams fulfilled.\n  American history is a history of hope mixed with tragedy--\ninstitutionalized slavery, a Constitution which said that African-\nAmericans were only three-fifths human, Jim Crow and ``separate but \nequal.''\n  This legacy is a source of great shame for us precisely because so \nmany of these outrages contradicted one of the founding principles of \nour republic--that all men are created equal and that we are all \nendowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, including the \nright to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Today, in the America of 1995, the evils of discrimination and racism \npersist. They may not be as blatant as they once were. They may not be \nas fashionable. But they are out there, lurking in the corners, \npoisoning young minds, and yes, harming real people in the process.\n  Over the years, Americans of goodwill have tried to make a \ndifference. We have enacted an array of antidiscrimination laws. And in \nthe 1960's and the early 1970's, the concept of affirmative action was \nborn, the product of a heartfelt desire to rectify past injustices and \nexpand opportunity for all Americans. Many Republicans, acting with the \nbest of intentions, were directly involved in this effort. I, for one, \nnot only supported the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, but have also endorsed certain race- and gender-\nconscious steps to remedy the lingering effects of historic \ndiscrimination. That is my record, and I am proud of it.\n                        only a temporary remedy\n\n  Few of us, however, believed that these policies would become a \nseemingly permanent fixture of our society, but that is exactly what \nthey have become today.\n  During the past 30 years, we have seen the policies of preference \ngrow and grow and grow some more, pitting American against American, \ngroup against group, in a bitter competition for a piece of the \nGovernment pie.\n  Somehow, somewhere along the way, fighting discrimination has become \nan easy excuse to abandon the color-blind ideal. Too often today, the \nlaudable goal of expanding opportunity is used by the Federal \nGovernment to justify dividing Americans. That is wrong, and it ought \nto stop. You do not cure the evil of discrimination with more \ndiscrimination.\n\n\n               the president's review: lack of leadership\n\n  President Clinton had the opportunity today to stand up for principle \nby stating--in the clearest possible terms--that it is wrong for the \nFederal Government to discriminate against its citizens on the basis of \nrace, color, ethnic background, or gender.\n  Without hesitation or ambiguity, he could have said ``yes'' to \nindividual rights, and ``no'' to group rights; ``yes'' to the principle \nof equal opportunity and ``no'' to the perversion of this principle \nwith the divisive policies of preference.\n  Instead of clarity--and I have just finished listening to the \nPresident--the President has chosen confusion. He has chosen to \ncomplicate an uncomplicated issue with an avalanche of words and fine \ndistinctions.\n  This is not a difficult issue: discrimination is wrong, and \npreferential treatment is wrong, too. Our Government in Washington \nshould unite the American people, not divide us. It should guarantee \nequal opportunity, not divide Americans through the use of quotas, set-\nasides, numerical objectives, and other preferences.\n  And that is why I will introduce legislation next week designed to \nget the Federal Government out of the group preference business. The \nPresident says he is against quotas. Quotas are only a small part of \nthe entire regime of preferences. It is not enough to oppose \n``quotas,'' as if the label is what might be offensive. It is the \npractice of dividing Americans through any form of preferential \ntreatment that is objectionable.\n  The President also denounces preferences for ``unqualified''--\n``unqualified'' individuals, when the real issue here is not \npreferences for the unqualified, which virtually every American \nopposes--why have preferences for the unqualified?--but preferences for \nthe ``less qualified'' over those who are ``more qualified.'' That is \nthe debate. This distinction is critical. But it is one that the \nPresident conveniently ignores.\n  Madam President, leadership is about making the tough choices. It is \nabout staking out a clear and crisp principle and holding firm to it. \nAnd, yes, leadership can sometimes mean putting a little distance \nbetween yourself and your political allies. Regrettably, the President \nis trying to have it both ways.\n\n\n                  A Civil Rights Agenda For The 1990'S\n\n  Madam President, 2 years ago, I convened a meeting in my office with \na distinguished group of African-American leaders with the goal of \ndeveloping a civil rights agenda for the 1990's, one that is relevant \nfor the needs and challenges of our time. A relevant civil rights \nagenda means enforcing the antidiscrimination laws that are already on \nthe books--enforcing the antidiscrimination laws that are already \n\n[[Page S 10261]]\non the books. It means removing regulatory barriers to economic \nopportunity--something we are in the throes of trying to do right now \non the Senate floor--including the discriminatory Davis-Bacon Act. It \nmeans school choice for low-income, inner-city people and means \nmeaningful welfare reform that will transform lives from ones of \ndependence to ones of independence. And it means making our streets \nsafer and renewing the war on drugs. After all, our first civil right \nis freedom from the fear of crime.\n  This is the real civil rights agenda of our time. Not preferences, \nnot set-asides, not quotas, but the dreams that are built on real \nopportunity.\n  Madam President, I would hope when I introduce my bill it will become \nat least a focus of dialog because I know different people have \ndifferent views. But none of us believes that discrimination is \nappropriate. It is wrong. It has always been wrong. It should be \npunished. And I think that is what this debate is all about.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10260-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10261-S10266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        DANGEROUS TRENDS IN DOWNSIZING MILITARY HEALTH SERVICES\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I would like to bring to your attention \na matter of serious concern to me regarding the future of our currently \nsuperb military forces--and the inextricable link between a quality \nvolunteer force and an equally robust, quality, military health care \nsystem.\n  I have followed closely the downsizing of our military forces over \nthe past several years. The Active Force will have come down from 2.1 \nmillion service members in 1990 to 1.45 million by 1997, a 32-percent \nreduction from cold war levels. The Navy will see its fleet reduced \nfrom 546 battle force ships to 346 in the same time period with only 12 \naircraft carriers in commission by the end of the century. The Army \nwill go from 18 to 10 active divisions and the Air Force from 24 to 13 \nactive fighter wing equivalents. The Marine Corps will likewise be \nreduced from a force of 200,000 men and women in uniform to a force of \n174,000.\n  We have repeatedly promised that there will be no more Task Force \nSmiths--a tragic result of that period of time just prior to the Korean \nconflict in the early 1950's when we truly had a hollow force. Yet, I \nsee us slowly but surely moving toward this state of readiness--or \nshould I say, unreadiness. Although it causes me great sadness to even \ncontemplate the repeat of such a tragedy, I must tell you that in the \nnot-too-distant future, I envision us once again being called upon to \nanswer to our brave service members and the American people, ``Why did \nwe let another Task Force Smith occur?''\n  I have been here long enough to know what is meant by a hollow \nmilitary. In the 1970's, 25 percent of new recruits were category IV--\nthe lowest recruitable mental group--and, as a result, 30 percent of \nour ships--brandnew ships with brandnew equipment--were not fit for \ncombat due to a lack of sailors to man them. For although our military \npossesses superior technology and superior weapons systems, it is the \npeople who really determine the readiness of our forces. And these \npeople, the men and women in uniform, are recruited from and reflect a \ncross-section of the American population. Although the services met \ntheir recruiting goals last year--and keep in mind that these goals are \nmuch lower than they were a few years ago--the military has had to \ndramatically increase their recruiting budget as well as the number of \ntheir recruiters to do so. Even so, it now takes 1.6 times the number \nof recruiter contacts to achieve one recruit. The reality of our \nnational culture today is that the propensity for young people to join \nour military is at a 10-year low, down 39 percent among 16- to 21-year \nold males just since 1991, according to the Army.\n  While it concerns me to watch the reduction of our forces, I \nunderstand and support the need to balance the size of our military \nservices with the threats facing us today and in the near future. \nHowever, we must not lose sight of the reality that major armed \nconflicts are still a very real possibility and could come at any time \nin the form of aggression by regional powers such as Iraq and North \nKorea. In his recent testimony before the Senate Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Vice Admiral Macke, the commander in chief of the United \nStates Pacific Command, called North Korea the nation with the highest \nthreat potential today. Dr. Henry Kissinger, in his testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in February, warned that ``more and \nmore states are coming into being that feel no responsibility to any \nglobal international system or international stability.'' He also cited \nthe North Korean situation, the proliferation of nuclear and other \nweapons of mass destruction, and the growth of Islamic fundamentalists \nas serious threats to our national security that could involve us once \nagain in armed conflict.\n  More recently and more frequently, however, we have seen a \npreponderance of internal regional and national conflicts that require \nour armed services to respond with operations short of war. These \noperations not only strain our defense capabilities but drain current \nyear defense budgets. When taken into consideration with other security \nthreats, I become gravely concerned about the speed and direction of \nour force reductions.\n  Of particular concern to me is the downsizing of the services' \nmedical structure--both peacetime and wartime personnel and units. \nWhile I do not wish to tie the hands of the Department or the service \nchiefs as they restructure their forces, I am increasingly concerned \nover the severity of reductions to the services' medical departments. \nIn my opinion, the military health service system is being taken down \ntoo far, too fast.\n  The military leaders and decision-makers have a tendency to see \nmilitary health care as less important than the men and women who fly \nairplanes or who drive tanks. However, I caution you that our military \nis essentially a team, and if one member of the team is weak, the \nentire team is weak. Although the medical departments might seem less \ncrucial to the preparation for or the outcome of war, I assure you that \nto the men and women in combat, they are absolutely essential members \nof the team. To be effective fighting forces, the servicemembers must \nbe able to concentrate on combat and keep their minds completely \nclear--free from worry about their own well-being and, even more \nimportantly, free from worry about the health and well-being of their \nspouses and children at home. Without the knowledge and security that \ntheir families are well cared for, our military personnel will lose \nmuch of their effectiveness that they have so ably demonstrated during \nthe past decade.\n  First, I will address combat medicine--caring for the soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and airmen who risk injury and death around the \nworld. When I was injured in World War II, it took 9 hours for me to \nget to medical care--9 hours. But in 1945 that was not too bad--\nAmericans probably did not expect any faster battlefield evacuation and \ncare. Today, when a soldier or marine is wounded in combat, he or she \ncan be at the hospital within 15 minutes. In fact, we learned in Korea \nand Vietnam that if we could get wounded soldiers to hospitals within \n15 to 30 minutes--and we did that pretty regularly--we could save most \nof those who survived their initial wounding.\n  Because of our experiences in these wars, Americans now have come to \nexpect emergency medical services [EMS] systems, 911 phone lines, \nparamedics with highly technical skills, and advanced EMS and air \nflight ambulances with sophisticated emergency medical equipment. Most \nof these capabilities also exist in our military combat health support \nsystems and soon they will have more advanced combat medical \ntechnologies such as telemedicine, filmless x rays, and other new \nmedical innovations that will further improve battlefield survival \nrates. Americans have come to expect this level of care and our service \nmembers and their families deserve it.\n  Trauma experts talk of the golden hour--the first hour after initial \ninjury--when the greatest percentage of patient lives can be saved. Let \nme give you one example. In March 1994, there was a horrible training \naccident involving soldiers of the 82d Airborne Division on the green \nramp--the area where the paratroopers wait to take off--at Pope Air \nForce Base, adjacent to Fort Bragg, NC. Many soldiers were saved by the \nexpert buddy aid training that \n\n[[Page S 10262]]\nall soldiers receive as part of their combat training. However, many \nmore were saved by the quick response of medical and non-medical \npersonnel who quickly evacuated their comrades to Womack Army Hospital \nthere at Fort Bragg. Several of the most seriously burned soldiers were \nevacuated to the outstanding Institute of Surgical Research, frequently \nreferred to as the Burn Unit, at Brooke Army Medical Center in San \nAntonio. And, of course, our world-renowned Air Force evacuation system \ncomposed of DC-9 Nightingale aircraft equipped with sophisticated \nmedical equipment and staffed by top-notch flight nurses handled the \nevacuation of these critically injured soldiers.\n  All of this takes a lot of medical personnel--trained and experienced \nin emergency care, in trauma care, and in combat medicine--and a lot of \nmedical resources such as ambulances--helicopters, wheeled and tracked \nground ambulances, and, yes, even fixed wing ambulances--as we plan for \neven longer evacuation lines in future conflicts. It means a lot of \nmedical facilities--especially hospitals--located throughout the \nevacuation pipeline--combat theater and elsewhere. This requires a \nrobust, quality, flexible, military medical force.\n  During Operation Desert Shield/Storm, the military medical operations \nplan called for emptying almost all of the military hospitals in the \ncontinental United States as well as some of those in Europe of medical \npersonnel to deploy with the field hospitals to the Middle East. And \nthat was before downsizing was implemented in the medical departments. \nToday, the medical departments have lost more than 30 percent of their \npersonnel, but are still expected to provide the same level of support \nto\n  defense plans that call for conducting two nearly simultaneous major \nregional contingencies [MRC's], possibly in conjunction with one or \nmore operations-other-than-war [OOTW] scenarios. I would like someone \nto tell me how this is to be accomplished with 30 percent fewer assets. \nI would also like to know who will provide care for the military family \nmembers in such a situation.\n\n  As a result of having such a superbly trained and equipped military \nmedical capability, an interesting, but potentially dangerous, \nprecedent has become evident in recent years. Whenever large numbers of \npeople are in need of health care services, whether in this country or \nelsewhere in the world, the United States military medical departments \nare requested. You might not be aware of this, but the first U.S. \nmilitary units to be placed under the command of a foreign nation were \nmedical units. Why? Because we have the most sophisticated, \ncomprehensive, state of the art combat medical capability in the world \nand other nations sending their sons and daughters off to danger want \ntheir soldiers to have the best too.\n  More than just providing combat health services to our deployed \nservice members, a robust health care system is critical to maintaining \nour quality volunteer force. When the draft ended in 1973, many people \nboth here in Washington and throughout the United States doubted the \nsuccess of an All Volunteer Force. After all, given the history of the \ndraft and the need to force our citizens to serve their country, how \ncould anyone reasonably expect that there would be enough young men and \nwomen who would volunteer to serve--and at a quality that would be \nacceptable. A great many people were very surprised when the All \nVolunteer Force not only met previous recruiting standards, but \nactually exceeded them.\n  I believe we were able to do this in large part because one of the \nbenefits promised to the potential recruits was world-class quality \nhealth care, not only for themselves but also for their family members \nthroughout their career and even after retirement. No one said, \n``unless we have to downsize.'' I doubt that very many recruiters \nexplained or even understood themselves the fine distinction between \n``entitled to'' and ``eligible for'' that separates the statutory \nprovision for health care services for family members of active duty \npersonnel from the retirees and their military dependents. Or that \nanyone explained about space available care. What the soldiers and \nsailors and marines and airmen heard, what they were promised, was \nlifetime health care for themselves and their dependent family members.\n  And how have the services been able to meet their recruiting goals? \nBy continuing to promise lifetime health care for themselves and their \neligible family members. Why? Because the military knows that without \nthis benefit, the recruitment of, and particularly the retention of, \nquality, career service members would be nearly impossible.\n  Now our retirees and service members see us breaking our promises to \nthem. Space available care in our peacetime medical facilities in some \ncases has already disappeared or is rapidly disappearing for our \nretirees and, in many places, even active duty family members are \nforced out on the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed \nServices [CHAMPUS] because of drastically downsized or closing medical \ntreatment facilities. If we continue to cut retirement benefits, we \nwill have a difficult time recruiting soldiers, sailors, marines and \nairmen for our next war. As Maj. Gen. Jim Pennington, U.S. Army, \nretired, said, ``If we do not stop this constant effort to renege on \nthe promises to those who have served and kept their part of the \nbargain, we will destroy the Volunteer Force and consequently our \nnational defense.''\n  How important is military health care to the service member? I can \ntell you, it is very important. I have traveled to a great number of \nmilitary bases and posts and invariably the first or second question I \nam asked is about health care--usually not for service members \nthemselves so much as for their family members. Much as we would like \nto believe that there are millions of patriotic Americans willing to \nserve their country without any additional incentives, the reality is \nthat our service members want pretty much the same thing most Americans \nwant--including families and the ability to take care of their family \nmembers. In World War II, only 4 percent of the soldiers had \ndependents. In 1973, when the draft ended, 40 percent of our military \nforce had dependents. Today, more than 60 percent of our military \npersonnel have family members. When our troops are deployed away from \nhome--and we are asking them to do that more frequently now--their \nforemost concern is their families. This is just as true, and perhaps \neven more so, during times of armed conflict. I cannot overemphasize \nthe importance of the military health care system in providing peace of \nmind and security for our service members and their families, \nespecially when faced with the possibility of deployments and combat as \nthese men and women are every day.\n  Madam President, my concerns with the drawdown of our medical forces \nare in three areas: The civilian workyear reductions directed at the \nDepartment of Defense--DOD, medical readiness, and the continual \nerosion of retiree health care benefits.\n\n\n                      Civilian Workyear Reductions\n\n  The DOD is committed to streamlining its civilian workforce in \naccordance with the National Performance Review [NPR] and the \nadministration's guidance to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. \nThe DOD seeks to do this without sacrificing quality or compromising \nmilitary readiness. Between 1993 and 1999, the DOD projects a 32-\npercent reduction in civilian positions. In accordance with the fiscal \nyear 1996 President's budget, the DOD has targeted headquarters, \nprocurement, finance, and personnel staffs. Downsizing the \ninfrastructure in this way should not affect the military services' \nability to carry out their mission nor to respond quickly and \neffectively.\n  The Military Health Service System's [MHSS] share of these 272,900 \ncivilian reductions is more than 11,000 spaces. However, these \npositions are predominantly in the business of delivering health care--\nnurses, lab technicians, and other medical technicians. Less than one-\nthird of the MHSS civilian work force are in the targeted job series. \nAlthough the medical ward clerk or medical transcriptionist might \nappear to be optional, they are as critical to the health care team \neffort as are the health care providers.\n  The Congress has been concerned about the adverse impact of \ndownsizing both the military and civilian work force for a number of \nyears. To insure that this downsizing and civilian conversion does not \ncost the American \n\n[[Page S 10263]]\ntaxpayers more in contract and other costs, a number of Federal laws \nhave been enacted in recent years.\n  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, Public Law 103-225, \nprohibits agencies from converting the work of employees included in \nthe 272,900 civilian reductions to contract performance unless a cost \ncomparison demonstrates that such a conversion would be to the \nfinancial advantage of the Government.\n  Section 8020 of the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1995, \nPublic Law 103-335, provides specific guidance prohibiting the \nconversion to contract of any DOD activity ``until a most efficient and \ncost-effective organization analysis is completed on such activity or \nfunction and certification of the analysis is made to the Committees on \nAppropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate.''\n  Section 711 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1991, Public Law 101-510, prohibits reductions of medical personnel \nuntil the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Congress that the \nnumber of personnel being reduced is excess to current and projected \nneeds of the services and that CHAMPUS costs will not increase.\n  And, finally, section 716 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1991 requires congressional notification before any \nmilitary medical services are terminated or facilities are closed. \nThese restrictions have all been placed on the DOD to ensure that \nreductions to the MHSS have been thoroughly analyzed for their impact \nnot only on costs, but also on military readiness and preparedness.\n  In my own State, Tripler Army Medical Center staff can expect to pay \n30 percent more for child and maternal health care contract personnel \nto replace existing civilians. And that is for just one medical unit in \none hospital. I understand that the U.S. Army Medical Command's \n[MEDCOM] experience in contracting for health care services indicates \nthat direct hire civilian employees--the same civilians that the DOD \nhas been mandated to cut--are almost always the most cost-effective \nalternatives when hiring on the margin one for one.\n  For instance, a civilian nurse costs $40,000 per year compared to \n$60,000 for a contract nurse. At Fort Drum, NY, where contracting care \nis required because there is no\n  inpatient medical facility on post, the per beneficiary costs are 56 \npercent higher than costs at similar military installations. In fact, \nthe MEDCOM's experience with commercial activities [CA] studies has \nshown that it is almost always considerably less expensive for the \nmilitary system to provide health services than it is to contract for \nthem.\n\n  The inevitability of these mandated civilian cuts affecting nursing \npersonnel is particularly worrisome, especially in the Army where \ncivilian nurses comprise approximately 50 percent of the work force and \nwhere military nurses are being consistently cut more than any other \nhealth care profession. As the medical departments downsize, careful \nconsideration must be given to the health professionals such as nurses \nwho are actually providing care. The integration of health promotion, \nhealth maintenance, and wellness should be at the forefront of \nproviding quality health care. However, the steep cuts in the \nendstrength of Army nurses jeopardize the ability of the Army Medical \nDepartment [AMEDD] to deliver on its promises to increase access, \nmaintain quality and improve cost-effectiveness of the health care \nservices provided in both peacetime and wartime facilities and \nsettings. With the drastic losses of both military and civilian nurses, \nthe AMEDD has few options other than massive contracting arrangements.\n  If these contract costs were applied across the full spectrum of the \nMHSS-directed civilian reductions, what would be that cost? I hope that \nthe appropriate DOD personnel are prepared to answer that question, if \nindeed, we are to draw down medical civilian personnel. It just does \nnot make good business sense to contract out services that can be \nprovided just as well, and far less expensively, in military \nfacilities. Yet, we continue to subject our medical departments to a \ncivilian work force reduction that is intended largely for \nadministrative positions.\n  In addition to the experience of the MEDCOM, I understand that the \nRAND Corp., in a study commissioned by the DOD to comply with section \n733 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 1992, Public Law 102-\n190, concluded that medical treatment facilities' in-house care is more \ncost effective than their civilian counterparts by 24 percent overall \nand even more in some areas such as primary care. The Civilian Health \nand Medical Program of the Uniformed Services [CHAMPUS] has not been \nthe preferred cost-effective alternative to either the medical \ndepartments who bear the major costs of the program or to the \nbeneficiaries who share the cost. The simple fact is that medical \ninflation in the private sector has skyrocketed over the past several \nyears.\n  These civilian reductions are all the more disturbing given not only \nthe studies indicating that the MHSS is the most cost-effective \nalternative, but also given the great strides that the MHSS has made in \nreorganizing and re-engineering toward a business-like culture. For \nexample, the activation of the U.S. Army Medical Command [USAMEDCOM] in \n1994 marked a major milestone in re-engineering the Army Medical \nDepartment [AMEDD]. In phase I of that re-engineering, the Army Surgeon \nGeneral's staff in the Washington area has already been reduced by more \nthan 75 percent. We are all very proud that DeWitt Army Community \nHospital at nearby Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia was a recent \nrecipient of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review Hammer \nAward. The DeWitt Army Hospital's Primary Care Reinvention Plan will \ndramatically improve the way health care is provided to the more than \n140,000 beneficiaries in DeWitt's catchment area. The plan includes the \nestablishment of six new satellite clinics, expanded clinic hours to \naccommodate working parents, a 24-hour nurse advice system, expanded \nchild and adolescent psychiatric services, and the creation of a \nspecial Well-Woman clinic. These initiatives increase primary care \naccess and decrease expensive tertiary care costs. In fact, the MHSS \nabounds with examples such as these cutting-edge innovations in all of \nthe services.\n  Another long recognized example of the military's enormous \ncontribution to America is the military medical research and \ndevelopment community which is composed of more than 50-percent \ncivilians. These contributions have benefited military readiness, \nmilitary preventive and curative care, and have impacted tremendously \non the kind of civilian health care that has come to be expected by all \nour citizens. For example, the Army's Medical Research and Material \nCommand [USAMRMC] has unique expertise and facilities for all phases of \nvaccine development. This includes a hepatitis A vaccine that was \nrecently developed, tested, and demonstrated safe and effective by Army \nscientists working with SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. To health \ncare providers, hepatitis A has proven to be a pervasive, but \ndifficult, disease to treat with recovery taking anywhere from several \nweeks to several months. Hepatitis A is a serious health risk for more \nthan 24 million U.S. citizens that will visit endemic areas this year. \nIn the United States, there are an estimated 143,000 cases occurring \neach year at a cost of $200 million. This vaccine was the first \nlicensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United \nStates.\n  The MHSS has long been acknowledged as a leader in research and an \nexpert on many diseases throughout the world. Military units deploying \nto Somalia, the Persian Gulf, Macedonia, and Haiti received \ncomprehensive advice books prepared by USAMRMC on avoiding local health \nhazards ranging from disease-carrying insects and poisonous snakes to \ncontaminated food and water, heatstroke, and frostbite. This military \nunique research and expertise has made, and continues to make, massive \ncontributions to our civilian medical capabilities. In fact, as noted \nin a recent edition of the television program, ``Dateline'', the U.S. \nmilitary has the only capability in our Nation to deal with an invasion \nof potentially lethal infectious agents, such as the filoviruses, to \nthe United States.\n  In the area of peacetime medical research, the Medical Research and \nMateriel Command has led a very successful effort in breast cancer \nresearch, HIV-AIDS research, defense women's \n\n[[Page S 10264]]\nhealth research, and malaria research, to name a few. In fact, the \nArmy's successful management of $236.5 million for breast cancer \nresearch in 1993 and 1994 has won high praise from both scientific and \nadvocacy groups. Additionally, they have been able to apply 91 percent \nof the funds directly to research, thus restricting the administrative \noverhead to a mere 9 percent. Their success has prompted the Congress \nto ask the DOD to manage another $150 million for breast cancer \nresearch in fiscal year 1995.\n  Other MHSS treatment facilities have similar initiatives underway. \nMany of these initiatives serve as force multipliers by reducing \nattrition and enhancing soldier confidence. The U.S. Army Center for \nHealth Promotion and Preventive Medicine [CHHPM] led the effort to \ndevelop an outside-the-boot parachute ankle brace that has \nsignificantly reduced jump-related ankle sprains common in airborne \nsoldiers. All of these research and preventive medicine initiatives are \ndone for the purpose of improving soldier readiness, providing quality \nhealth care for beneficiaries, and improving cost efficiencies.\n  These successful efforts are possible because of the blending of \ncivilian and active duty medical personnel as a team. The active duty \npersonnel infuse new energy and fresh ideas gleaned from their many \nvaried experiences and provide the mobilization force; the civilians \nprovide institutional memory, continuity, stability, and invaluable \nexpertise gained from years of specialized concentration in highly \ntechnical fields. To lose either perspective would severely handicap \nthe ability of the MHSS to continue to produce their outstanding \nresults.\n  My final, but by no means least important concern, is of the impact \non the morale of the dedicated MHSS civilian employees. Preliminary \nfeedback from Tripler Army Medical Center and other health care \nfacilities indicates that the civilian work force continues to see \nmedical military personnel departing as part of the military drawdown. \nYet, the workload has not diminished. The beneficiaries--active duty, \nretired, and family members--continue to come for the health care they \nwere promised and expect.\n  At the same time, the civilian employees see their own jobs at risk \nfor contracting, probably at greater expense. Our dedicated medical \ncivilians at Tripler and all the MHSS facilities deserve so much better \nfor their dedicated service to their customers--the men and women in \nour Armed Forces, both present and past.\n\n\n                               Readiness\n\n  I am also deeply concerned about the medical readiness of our \nmilitary units and the impact that downsizing will have upon them. The \npersistent reductions to the military medical structure from \ndownsizing, civilian reductions, base closures, and bottom-liners--\nthose faceless men and women who make decisions without having any idea \nof how it affects people--have\n resulted in the instability of the medical system. The MHSS is looking \nat reductions in medical personnel of more than 30 percent at a time \nwhen the beneficiary population is decreasing by about 10 percent.\n\n  Medical readiness is a service-unique responsibility with each \nservice focusing on its mission essential requirements. I applaud joint \nservice cooperation as a means of more efficiently utilizing scarce \nresources. The medical departments of the services have demonstrated \nthat they can work together in many areas--TRICARE--the DOD's managed \ncare program, telemedicine, research, training and more. However, I am \nconcerned with the increasing pressure to centralize medical readiness \nand eliminate the individual services' autonomy and flexibility. Each \nservice has a unique culture and specialized roles and missions that \ncannot be accommodated in an entirely purple suited DOD system. Each \nmust preserve a large degree of autonomy.\n  There is no compelling reason to centrally manage the medical \nresources of each service under a DOD civilian umbrella. The structure \nthat was created to implement the MHSS's managed care program, TRICARE, \nis not suited to manage the services' medical readiness assets nor \ntheir respective mobilization missions. I, and all of the Congress, \nwill continue to hold each of the service chiefs responsible for \nmilitary medical preparedness in accordance with their title 10 \nauthority.\n  The military trains for its readiness mission by caring for all \ncategories of beneficiaries in peacetime. This type of training can not \nbe obtained exclusively in a field environment. However, the needs of \nboth the peacetime health care system and the field health care system \nmust be met, in many cases, by the same personnel who must be able to \ntransition quickly and effectively from one system to the other as the \nmission requires.\n  I am also concerned about the premises upon which several ongoing \nstudies are based for decisions on how downsizing will be accomplished. \nThe Nation and even many of our senior policymakers seem to believe \nthat the recent Persian Gulf war and the Somalia peacekeeping \noperations are evidence that any future military conflicts will be \nbloodless affairs--that is, wars where there will be no, or at least \nvery few, casualties. Well, I have been in combat and I can assure you \nthat there is no such thing as a bloodless war. We were very lucky in \nDesert Storm--just plain lucky. There is no reason to assume that we \nwill be that lucky again or that any adversary will again miscalculate \nso badly. We must not become complacent and delude ourselves that we no \nlonger need medical personnel, hospitals, ambulances, and other medical \nassets for combat health care or the resources to enhance and to \npractice combat medicine. That naive belief is irrational and \nirresponsible in an age of high-technology weapons of mass destruction \nand global instability.\n  In the Pacific rim, we need look no further than North Korea to see \nevidence of a potential conflict that would create thousands of \ncasualties in the first hours of operation. Major military medical \ncenters--like Tripler in Hawaii; the Naval Medical Center, San Diego; \nMadigan in the State of Washington, and Willford Hall in Texas--must be \nmaintained if we are to be prepared for these conflicts. Any \nrecommendation to downsize these facilities displays ignorance of the \nlifesaving role these facilities would play.\n  A recent RAND Corp. study titled, ``Casualties, Public Opinion, and \nU.S. Military Intervention: Implications for U.S. Regional Deterrence \nStrategies,'' concluded that once deterrence and diplomacy fail and war \nbegins, public opinion demands that the conflict be escalated to bring \nfinality to the operation. Such was the public opinion in the Persian \nGulf war. Many Americans would have preferred that United States forces \nhad continued on to Baghdad to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and many still \nfeel that the operation was not completed when it stopped where it did.\n  Assuming that such a view is correct, the resulting military \ndecisions to escalate the measures deemed necessary to win a decisive \nvictory could well lead to more, not fewer, casualties. Our military \nmedical facilities must be structured for such an occurrence. \nTherefore, other recent study recommendations to downsize or close many \nof our peacetime medical facilities and to greatly reduce military and \ncivilian medical endstrengths imperil military preparedness.\n  Every day, the dedicated men and women of the military medical \ndepartments train in peace for their war mission. To believe that this \ncapability can be contracted out, accomplished in civilian medical \ninstitutions, and be made ready for war given a certain amount of time \nis a certain recipe for disaster.\n  I have heard the argument that we can park our tanks in motor pools \nwhen training dollars are short, but we cannot park our eligible health \ncare beneficiaries outside our hospitals. We have seen what happens to \nreadiness when we do so. Not only do the beneficiaries not get the care \nthey deserve, but medical readiness suffers as well. The Nation can no \nmore sacrifice our medical readiness than we can our combat \npreparedness.\n  I believe the basis for a sound medical readiness posture lies in the \nmedical centers. The medical centers function in much the same way as \ndoes a Navy battle group. A modern Navy battle group usually consists \nof an aircraft carrier, surface warships, support ships, and \nsubmarines. The medical centers are somewhat like an aircraft carrier. \nThey are very large and do not \n\n[[Page S 10265]]\ndirectly engage in combat. They serve as command and control and \ntraining centers for the task force and stand ready to launch their \nexpert systems forward as needed.\n  Just as the expert systems of the aircraft carriers are its jets and \npilots, a medical center's experts are its military personnel, who work \nin the medical center during peacetime but staff the field hospitals \nduring wartime or operations short of war, and its telemedicine \ncapabilities. The surface warships and submarines are like smaller \nhospitals, field hospitals, clinics, and field medical units that \ndirectly support the combat mission.\n  These escort ships need the carrier for command and control of its \nunits as well as training for augmentation personnel. Much in the same \nway, smaller base and installation hospitals and field medical units \nrely upon medical centers for the establishment of medical policy and \nprocedures--command and control, a pool of qualified and trained \nclinicians, and projection of its medical expertise forward via \ntelemedicine.\n  The importance of medical centers cannot be overstated. Much of the \nsuccess of the MHSS is due to its medical centers. They serve as a \nmedical boot camp for health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, \nand corpsmen; research and development for new medical procedures, \nprograms, and materials; reference centers for world-class medical \nknowledge and expertise; and the state-of-the-art inpatient care \ncapabilities of modern medicine.\n  One essential type of medical boot camp is Graduate Medical Education \n[GME]. As with other components of the MHSS, GME has also come under \nattack. Although it is true that certain segments of military medical \nGME can be restructured and consolidated, the underlying premise of a \nmedical center-based GME program cannot be refuted.\n  The MHSS benefits tremendously from in-house GME. These benefits \ninclude providing specialty and subspecialty care and increases in \nphysician productivity due to the teaching environment. Other benefits \ninclude lower patient care expenses, the attraction of more qualified \nphysicians to the academic environment of teaching hospitals, and a \nhigher retention rate of physicians, especially for those trained in \nmilitary facilities, that leads to lower acquisition and training \ncosts.\n  Opponents of the MHSS would argue that the need for in-house GME \nwould be removed if older, nonactive duty beneficiaries were not \ntreated in MTF's. Again, studies have consistently shown that military \nin-house care is less expensive than the civilian sector. If we could \nget Medicare reimbursement legislation passed, the MHSS could continue \nto provide low-cost care to retirees and ultimately lower the cost of \ntotal Federal expenditures.\n  Eliminating GME in the military would force military hospitals to \nrely on the civilian sector for recruiting physicians--the same system \nthat is currently overproducing specialists and underproducing primary \ncare physicians. Current research literature indicates that only 26 \npercent of those completing residency training go on to primary care \npractice. The current mix of specialists is inappropriate for \naccessible and cost-effective care. We should not force the MHSS back \nto the high-cost U.S. national average.\n  Our medical centers have also been the projection platforms for \ntelemedicine initiatives. Using commercial off-the-shelf equipment--a \ndigital system camera and a video teleconferencing system, telemedicine \nenables medical personnel at remote locations to consult with \nphysicians at a medical center and to quickly obtain expert advice on \ncritical or unusual cases. Telemedicine puts the diagnostic firepower \nof Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Naval Medical Center \nin Bethesda,\n  Maryland, or Tripler Army Medical Center into the hands of the \ndeployed physicians in Somalia, Zagreb, Macedonia, or Haiti.\n\n  Just this past December 1994, the life of a 26-year-old soldier was \nsaved in Macedonia. This is not so terribly unusual, except that two of \nthe physicians contributed their diagnostic and treatment expertise \nwhile observing the patient on a television monitor at the Casualty \nCare Research Center in Bethesda, MD. Through Operation Primetime, the \nbattalion surgeon with the 1/15th Infantry Battalion, part of the \nUnited Nations Observers in Macedonia, maintained telemedicine links \nwith military medical specialists in Europe and the United States.\n  The military medical personnel saved that soldier's life by employing \nmedical care forward--once again demonstrating their function as force \nmultipliers. I am very enthusiastic about the possibilities of \nexpanding telemedicine initiatives even further both in our military \nsettings as well as in appropriate civilian settings.\n\n\n                        Retiree Health Benefits\n\n  The last area of military medicine I will address is the continuous \nerosion of health care benefits for our military retirees and their \neligible family members. As the services strive to improve the access \nand quality of health care through innovative, business-like plans, the \nmassive civilian and military cuts combined with the decreasing health \ncare dollars seriously threaten their future ability to provide health \ncare services to the full spectrum of beneficiaries.\n  The MHSS has embarked on a new managed care plan for non-active duty \nbeneficiaries called TRICARE. The comprehensive health care benefit \nunder TRICARE will maintain or enhance the scope of services that \neligible beneficiaries receive today. The MHSS's capability to provide \neveryday health care will improve with TRICARE, a plan centered around \nmilitary hospitals and clinics and supplemented by networks of civilian \ncare providers.\n  TRICARE presents an opportunity to clearly define military medicine \nas essential to force readiness, as well as to improve benefit security \nand choice of delivery for military beneficiaries. There are parts of \nthis plan, however, that concern me. The TRICARE plan requires our \nretirees to share in the cost of care, and the greater the choice of \nphysicians they desire, the greater the degree of cost-sharing.\n  This is wrong for two reasons. First, it violates the contract we \nmade with these former servicemembers when they agreed to serve their \ncountry in our Armed Forces. We promised them access to free care in \nour military treatment facilities in exchange for lower wages and often \na career of sacrifices during the time of their service. There was no \nfine print about modest enrollment fees and lower out-of-pocket costs.\n  Second, I pick up the Wall Street Journal and read that, ``HMOs Pile \nup Billions in Cash, Try to Decide What to do With it,'' as was \nreported on December 21, 1994. I am outraged that our military \nretirees, many on fixed incomes, will contribute to these \norganizations' dilemma. The largest of these are for-profit \norganizations, growing so fast that they overtook nonprofit HMOs as the \ndominant force in managed care, as reported by the New York Times, on \nDecember 18, 1994.\n  The Nation owes our military retirees and veterans what they were \npromised. Soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, their families, \nretirees and their families, veterans, and surviving family members--\nthese are the people who comprise the military family. Despite \npressures to take a short-sighted view, we must honor our obligations \nto those who have served faithfully. The Congress and the citizens of \nthis country must do so not only because it is the right thing to do, \nbut because if we do not, we will soon be facing a far more serious \ncrisis--another truly hollow force.\n  We cannot, must not, have contracts that ask more of our retirees and \nveterans. Any such contract today that does that must be declared null \nand void with the contract we made with them in years past. We cannot \nhave contracts that restrict access, compromise care, or ask them to \nmake more of a contribution. We placed no such restrictions on our \nservice men and women when we sent them to foreign shores.\n  Lest we think that our servicemembers' tours of foreign shores are a \nproduct of days gone by, let me remind you that today we have more than \n300,000 servicemembers serving overseas in 146 countries and 8 U.S. \nterritories. In fact, deployments for the Army have increased threefold \nsince 1990 and more than 700 Purple Hearts and two Medals of Honor have \nbeen \n\n[[Page S 10266]]\nawarded since November 1989. The military is growing yet another \ngeneration of veterans and retirees who have served their country when \ntheir country called upon them.\n  I commend the MHSS for their advances in a standard benefit for all \nbeneficiaries, for their commitment to medical advances such as \ntelemedicine, and for the hard work in which they are engaged as they \nattempt to right size military health care. However, I caution them \nthat I am watching. I will not tolerate a health care system sized on \nthe backs of our retirees, a system that listens more to short-sighted \nbudget analysts than to good business practices, and to any contract \nthat violates the contract this country made with the men and women who \nserved when called and have already paid their dues.\n  Madam President, the real bottom line is that the overall health of \nthe entire voluntary military depends on the health of the Defense \nHealth Program. A compromised military health system will rapidly lead \nto a compromised military capability. I greatly fear that we are \nheading down that course. For example, I find it truly alarming that \nfor the first time in our Nation's history, the emergency defense \nsupplemental bill is being offset dollar for dollar from its own \ndefense budget. How long will it be before the Department gets wise and \nwhen the President says go to Haiti or Bosnia or wherever, the military \nsays, ``No, thank you, we can't afford it''. I have been involved in \nour Nation's defense for more than 30 years as a Member of Congress and \nI have traveled extensively around the world during those many years \nand I absolutely believe that the best way to prevent war is to prepare \nfor war. The only way to prepare for war is to maintain a healthy, \nrobust military. And absolutely critical to that endeavor is a healthy, \nrobust military medical health system. Let us not forget the painful \nlessons learned in the past; let us not have another Task Force Smith; \nlet us not repeat the same mistakes. Let us work to ensure a safe and \nsecure future for this great Nation of ours.\n  I would like to acknowledge the contribution of my Congressional \nNurse Fellow, Lt. Col. Barbara Scherb, who prepared this statement. \nColonel Scherb is an Army nurse who is currently assigned on a 1-year \nfellowship in my office.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10261-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  REPRESENTATIVE RICHARDSON'S SUCCESSFUL HUMANITARIAN MISSION TO IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, on another issue, I rise to \ncongratulate my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Representative \nBill Richardson, for his recent trip to Iraq that resulted in the early \nrelease from prison of two Americans, David Daliberti and William \nBarloon.\n  Madam President, we have all been affected by this story. We agonized \nwith the families of these two Americans since their arrest in March \nwhen they inadvertently crossed the Iraqi border while trying to visit \nfriends at the United Nations observer post in Kuwait. We recoiled when \nwe learned that their sentence would be 8 years in prison. We watched \nas others tried to negotiate a solution to the crisis, including the \nwives of Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon, who visited their husbands in a \nBaghdad prison. And we worried as a nation when we received reports \nthat both men were experiencing heart trouble that required \nhospitalization while in the prison.\n  We have now learned, however, that Representative Richardson has been \ndoing more than simply listening to the news coming out of Iraq like \nmost of the rest of us. He met eight times with the Iraqi Ambassador to \nthe United Nations in New York, sometimes catching a flight from \nWashington early in the morning so that he could return before votes \nwere cast in the House.\n  These visits established a feeling of trust that allowed \nRepresentative Richardson to travel to Iraq, where he pressed Saddam \nHussein for the release of the captive Americans on humanitarian \ngrounds. As with any negotiation, we now know that there were moments \nof disagreement and misunderstanding with the Iraqi President. \nRepresentative Richardson persisted in arguing that releasing these men \nat this time was the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, in a world with a seemingly endless number of \nintractable conflicts and troubles, from Bosnia to Rwanda to North \nKorea, it is with a sense of relief that as a result of Representative \nRichardson's successful humanitarian mission to Iraq, we have one less \ncrisis hanging over our country and over the two families that have now \nbeen reunited.\n  All Americans should be proud of Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon for \ntheir courage and strength over the past 5 months. I am especially \nproud of my friend and colleague from my home State of New Mexico for \nhis remarkable achievement in winning their release.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10266-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10266-S10269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, on a matter that the Senate has been \ndebating over the period of the last 9 days, regulatory reform bill, it \nhas been temporarily laid aside for now, but I rise at this time to \ncall the attention of my colleagues that the bill contains an \nunfortunate and unwarranted provision that would drastically undermine \nfundamental food safety standards in current law. I intended to offer \nthis amendment yesterday prior to the time that the bill was set aside.\n  I want to speak briefly to this issue. I hope the issue would have \nbeen addressed by those in the process of considering the regulatory \nreform bill, or have an opportunity to address it when the legislation \ncomes back. It addresses one of the very serious failings of this \nlegislation. I want to take a few moments of the Senate time to address \nit.\n  This is a different issue than the meat inspection question we \ndebated last week. It involves the unfortunate and unwarranted \nprovision that would drastically undermine the fundamental food safety \nstandards that exist in current law.\n  America has the safest food supply in the world. Families go to a \nsupermarket to purchase meat or vegetables, to buy baby food or apple \nsauce for young children they do so, secure in the knowledge that what \nthey buy, and any additives contained in them, meet strict safety \nstandards enforced by the Department of Agriculture and the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  When contaminated food inadvertently reaches the public, these \nagencies have the power they need to protect the public health. The \nbasic food safety standards were enacted into law many years ago. \nToday, they are relied on and taken for granted by the American public. \nThat is absolutely how it should be. No one has to give a second \nthought to the safety of the food that they eat today--and they should \nnot have to start to worry about it tomorrow.\n  The safety of American food not only benefits consumers, it provides \na competitive advantage to the U.S. food industry in the global \nmarkets. The label ``Made in the USA'' on a can or jar of food is a \nsignal to people everywhere that the product meets the highest \nstandards of safety and cleanliness.\n  Two of the cornerstones of the Federal food safety law are contained \nin section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The \nrelevant language of that section reads as follows: A food additive \nshall not be approved ``if a fair evaluation of the data before the \nSecretary fails to establish that the proposed use of the food \nadditive, under the conditions of the use to be specified in the \nregulation, will be safe: Provided, that no additive shall be deemed to \nbe safe if it is found to induce cancer in man or animal * * *.''\n  This provision is known as the Delaney clause. This simple statement \nis the basis for the establishment of safety for the food supply in the \nUnited States. These two provisions together deal with food safety and \nalso the limitation of carcinogens in pesticides, in food coloring, and \nin other areas as well, but food additives primarily.\n  What we have done in this proposal that is before the Senate is \nchanged both of these standards. I wonder why? I wonder where the call \nis across the country for people that say our food is too safe? I think \nfew would ever have had the circumstance where anyone \n\n[[Page S 10267]]\ncame up and said ``Senator, one of the overwhelming problems we are \nfacing in our country is the food supply that is too safe. Do something \nabout it.''\n  It is very interesting, Madam President, that when the regulatory \nreform bill was submitted, it repealed, effectively, the Delaney clause \nthat provides restrictions on food additives primarily, into the food \nsupply.\n  We commented on that in the course of the Judiciary Committee markup. \nLo and behold, when that measure was reintroduced here on the Senate, \nthe Johnston-Dole amendment, we found changes not just in the Delaney \nclause, but we found changes in the food safety, as well--dramatic \nchange.\n  It just happened between the time it got out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the time it was reintroduced here, without any hearings, \nwithout any notification, without any real explanation in reviewing the \nrecord about what was the reason for the changing in our food safety \nlaws. I think that is wrong, and we will have an opportunity in the \nSenate, should that legislation come back to address it.\n  Now, as I mentioned, the first paragraph here requires that any \nadditive to food safety must be safe. The second proviso is the Delaney \nclause, first enacted into law in 1958 and expanded in 1960. The \nDelaney clause prohibits the use of food additives, food colorings, \nanimal drugs, and in some circumstances pesticides if they are found to \ncause cancer in humans or in animals. The Delaney clause provides a \nzero-tolerance standard for cancer-causing substances in food.\n  In recent years, critics have claimed that the Delaney clause is \nunscientific and overbroad. Clearly, there has been a revolution in \nfood science and biochemistry since 1958, when the Delaney class was \nenacted. We now have the technology to identify cancer-causing \nchemicals in foods, in far smaller trace amounts than possible 40 years \nago. We also understand that animals may develop tumors from certain \nchemicals through pathways of animal biology that humans do not have.\n  Zero tolerance, therefore, means something different today than it \ndid in 1958. Tiny amounts of substances that could not be detected at \nall in the 1950's can be detected today. In 1958, testing equipment \nmight have considered zero risk to be a 1 in 100,000 chance of causing \ncancer. Today, we have scientific instruments that can detect risk \nlevels as low as 1 in 1 billion. Clearly a modern standard of risk is \nwarranted.\n  Responsible voices have argued for reform of the Delaney clause. The \nNational Academy of Sciences first recommended Delaney reform in a 1987 \nreport. In 1993, the Academy called for a more scientific health-based \nsafety standard for approving pesticides.\n  Senator Leahy and I and others have introduced detailed legislation \nin each of the last three Congresses to implement the Academy's \nrecommendations, and we would welcome the opportunity to continue that \ncomplex sensitive task in the committees of jurisdiction.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before the Senate takes an irresponsible \napproach to a subject with such grave implications. It contains \nhaphazardly drafted lines in a 97-page bill on regulatory reform that \nemerges from two Senate committees without any expertise in food \nsafety, without any hearings, and without any public input from the \nscientific community.\n  These 10 lines would wipe out the Delaney clause, and in its place \nthey insert a vague standard of negligible or insignificant risk. The \nphrase ``negligible or insignificant risk'' is not defined in the bill.\n  This is on page 71 of the Dole proposal, on lines 21 and 22, where \nthey say:\n\n       . . . shall not prohibit or refuse to approve a substance \n     or product on the basis of safety where the substance or \n     product presents a negligible or insignificant foreseeable \n     risk to human health.\n\n  And, if you look at the top, at line 15, it applies not just to \nDelaney, but it applies to all of this provision.\n  What is the significance of that? Does negligible or insignificant \nrisk mean a risk of 1 in 1 million? Or 1 in 1,000? How many additional \ncases of cancer are acceptable under a negligible risk standard? \nPerhaps a negligible risk means any level of risk that will not cause \nan immediate health disaster. Codification of such a vague standard \nwould cause a major uncertainty for both consumers and industry. Its \ninterpretation could vary from one administration to another.\n  In addition, the proposed language does nothing to ensure adequate \nprotection of infants and children who are uniquely susceptible to \nfoodborne toxins because their diets are so different from those of \nadults.\n  Madam President, this chart indicates what the current law is. Under \nthe current law the language is, as I mentioned earlier, will be safe, \nwhich means a reasonable certainty of no harm. It is a no harm \nstandard. Effectively that is the food standard now in the United \nStates and effectively has been there for a period of some 40 years. \nHow that is being changed at the present time under S. 343 is that food \nadditives may cause negligible or insignificant risk of harm--not too \nmuch harm.\n  So now anyone who goes into the supermarket knows that in whatever \npart of the supermarket they go to, their food will be safe--the \ncertainty of no harm. That is the current standard and that is the \nstandard that is defined at FDA in their statute. It is defined, \nunderstood. It has been tested and it has been court tested and is \nbeing adhered to. And that is why we have the safest food in the world.\n  But in this proposal, in S. 343, it says, ``not too much harm,'' \nwithout defining the standard. Whose interest is that in? Is that in \nthe public's interest? Is that in the family's interest? Is that in \nchildren's interest, or parents' interest? It is not. But it is in \ncertain of the food industries' interest. Certain food industries want \nthose changes.\n  They have not testified. They have not submitted the scientific \ninformation. They have not come on up here and debated that issue with \nscientists and other food experts who understand the importance of \nthese kinds of changes. All they have done is had the political muscle \nto get it into the current bill without any hearings. Madam President, \nthat is not right to think we ought to be moving ahead on that without \nthat kind of consideration of scientists and researchers, understanding \nthe full implications about it, and without any adequate explanation or \ndefinition of what is insignificant risk. I have been listening out \nhere on the floor of the Senate to those supporting the Dole-Johnston \nproposal saying, ``We want to have this more specific. We want to \nreally understand what your proposal would be.'' We would like to ask \nthem to define what is the insignificant risk? It is not defined in \ntheir bill and it is not time to play Russian roulette with the health \nand safety of our food supply by including that into a measure that \ncould become law.\n  Let us just think about this language in another way. The proposed \nlanguage in the legislation, also, with the changes in the Delaney \nprovisions which I mentioned which restrict any food additives that can \nhave any cancer-causing products in them, the proposed language does \nnothing to ensure adequate protection of infants and children who are \nuniquely susceptible to foodborne toxins because their diets are so \ndifferent from those of adults. This issue is the central conclusion of \nthe 1993 National Academy of Sciences report. Dr. Philip Landrigan of \nMount Sinai Medical Center, who chaired the committee of scientists \nresponsible for the NAS report said, ``[i]f you're going to throw \nDelaney away, you're going to have to replace it with something equally \nprotective of children.''\n  Perhaps Delaney has its flaws, but its zero tolerance for cancer-\ncausing substances clearly and unequivocally protects children, and the \nDole-Johnston proposal would clearly and unequivocally expose children \nto more hazards of cancer.\n  We know that cancer now kills more children under 14 than any other \ndisease. The incidence of childhood brain cancer and childhood leukemia \nhas increased 33 percent since 1973.\n  Why would anyone thoughtlessly permit industry to put more \ncarcinogens in the food supply at a moment in time when we are already \nlosing the war on childhood cancer, and adult cancer, too? The \nincidence of cancer has increased 48 percent since 1950--and that \nstatistic excludes lung cancer, which has also increased dramatically \ndue to smoking. Environmental toxins are already taking a heavy toll on \nthe health \n\n[[Page S 10268]]\nof Americans. This is no time to recklessly open the floodgates and \npermit cancer-causing additives to enter the food supply for the first \ntime in 37 years--the first time in 37 years.\n  This legislation is irresponsible. It repeals the existing zero risk \nstandard without providing for a clear, scientific measure of risk. It \nignores the rising risk of cancer faced by infants and children. This \nis not a Contract With America, it is a Contract With Cancer.\n  Madam President, let me just put up here a chart that reflects what \nthe National Academy of Sciences has pointed out that is something that \nought to be obvious to all parents. That is, very small children's \nimmune systems, respiratory systems, and nervous systems are all in the \nearly development through childhood and through their teens, and these \nsystems are much more sensitive, as a result of body weight and growth, \nto the various kinds of environmental toxins in our society. That is \nunderstood by any cancer researcher and has been documented by the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  Understanding that, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the \nfood consumption of infants and into their early teens. What they found \nout is that there is 21 times the amount of apple juice consumed by \nsmall children than adults, 11 times the grape juice, and right down \nthe list--bananas, 7 times as much consumption by small children than \nadults, all the way down, with milk, and continuing along.\n  Then over here it gives the percent of diet. Apple juice is 10 \npercent of the diet for children; milk, 12 percent; orange juice, some \n10 percent for the diets of small children. What the National Academy \nof Sciences said is, since children are the most vulnerable and since \nthey consume these kinds of products, should we not look, for example, \nat the number of carcinogens that they intake, particularly in the \nareas of pesticides, so we might be able to prevent the incidence of \ncancer increasing in the children? They did a thorough study on that, \nsensitive to the developmental problems of small children and also the \ntypes of pesticides that are being used on these products.\n  Some of their examples: Apples have 123 different pesticides on them. \nWe have to look at this from a scientific point of view. The bottom \nline on this is the Academy of Sciences says if we are serious about \ntrying to develop a process concerning the use of various pesticides, \nwe ought to determine what are the foods which small children eat \nprimarily and look at the tolerance level for those children and \ndevelop a policy that is going to be sensitive to the incidence of \ncarcinogens, cancer forming agents, and the risks that they have. It \nmakes common sense. It can make a difference,\n particularly when we are seeing the number of child cancers which have \nbeen escalating. Do you think that has been included in this regulatory \nreform? Absolutely not.\n\n  Do you think there was any willingness to consider that kind of \nrecommendation of the Academy of Sciences? Absolutely not.\n  Has there been any willingness on the other side to review or accept \nor incorporate this kind of concept? Absolutely not, because they have \nthe votes. They have the votes to put at greater risk our food supply \nand to basically say we are not going to pay any attention to the best \nscience that we have in this country at the Academy of Sciences as it \nrelates to children.\n  I heard out here during those earlier debates that what we want to do \nis eliminate bureaucracy and bring in the best science. This is the \nbest science. But the supporters of that program are quite unwilling to \naddress it or to be responsive to it.\n  Finally, as we know, the Delaney clause currently applies to four \ndifferent categories of products--food additives, certain pesticides, \nanimal drugs, and food colorings. Different considerations apply to \nreform in each of these areas.\n  In the case of pesticides, it may be appropriate to weigh the risks \nof the chemicals against the importance of a stable food supply. But \nthere is no justification for allowing cancer-causing food colorings. \nThere is no benefit to the public from an M colored with red dye-No. \n3 versus Red dye-No. 40. If food colorings cause cancer in laboratory \nrats, they should simply be banned from our food supply.\n  That would make pretty good common sense--but not the regulatory \nreform legislation; no willingness to try to give that any kind of \nconsideration.\n  Thirty-five years ago, in 1960, Congress held hearings to consider \nlegislation to expand the Delaney clause. An industry witness testified \nthat any such expansion would be foolish hysteria. He gave the \ncommittee an example of a chemical that caused cancer in animals but \nthat he said posed no risk to human health. That chemical was DES. The \ntragedy that ensued for thousands of women who took DES should be \nenough alone to stop the Senate in 1995 from capitulating to the food \nindustry's efforts to weaken public health. We can reform the Delaney \nclause without destroying it.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment to strike the ill-\nconsidered provision in S. 343, and replace it with a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which, if adopted, will put the Senate firmly on \nrecord in favor of prompt and responsible Delaney reform.\n  The amendment states unequivocally that ``the Delaney clause in the \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act governing carcinogens in foods must be \nreformed,'' and that the current Delaney clause should be replaced by a \nscientific standard that takes account of the right of the American \npeople to safe food; the conclusions of the National Academy of \nSciences concerning the diets of infants and children; the importance \nof a stable food supply and a sound farm economy; and the interests of \nconsumers, farmers, food manufacturers, and other interested parties.\n  In addition, the amendment establishes a timetable for responsible \nlegislative action. It states that the Senate should enact Delaney \nreform, based on this work, by the end of the first session of this \nCongress--in other words, by the end of this year. It seeks careful, \nbut expedited, consideration of the matter by the committee of \njurisdiction, where the scientific experts as well as the food industry \nwill have an opportunity to be heard.\n  In fact, the Labor and Human Resources Committee is currently \nconsidering a comprehensive FDA reform bill. That bill would be an \nappropriate vehicle for Delaney reform. The views of the Agriculture \nCommittee are also essential to consider legislation of concern to \nfarmers.\n  Food safety is a complex, technical subject. A substantial body of \nscientific research exists on this subject that should inform our work \nin this area through hearings and consultation with the experts. That's \nwhat committees are for. Let us do this right.\n  This bill does not represent a rational, responsible reform of the \nDelaney clause. Instead, it represents a surrender to business greed \nfor higher profits and to the most irresponsible elements of the food \nprocessing industry. Its philosophy on food safety is simple and \nsinister--let the buyer beware, the public be damned.\n  And that is only half the problem with this provision. In its zeal to \nuproot the Delaney clause and assist the food industry, the Dole-\nJohnston alternative drastically weakens the general food standard in \ncurrent law.\n  There is legitimate serious debate about Delaney reform. But there is \nno serious debate, legitimate or illegitimate, about a wholesale \nweakening of the general standard that protects food from other harmful \nadditives.\n  I repeat that, Madam President. As we pointed out, there may be \nreason--and I believe that there is reason--for debate about the \nDelaney clause here. But I do not see, and I wait to hear, what the \njustification is for changing the safe food standard that we have at \nthe present time that has been in place for 40 years. Who is asking us \nto do this? Who is requesting it? Where is the mail that is coming in \nto our colleagues? Who are going to be the beneficiaries of it? Who are \ngoing to be put in greater risk because of it?\n  I think the answers to those questions are quite clear. It is an \naspect of the food production industry that is favoring their position, \nbut it certainly is not the families in this country that deserve it.\n  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act now requires that for a non-\ncancer-causing food additive to be approved, its sponsor must \ndemonstrate that it will be safe. Under that standard, FDA approves \nadditives today if \n\n[[Page S 10269]]\nthey present a reasonable certainty of no harm. But under the Dole-\nJohnston proposal, the language of the Delaney reform is carried over \nto the general standard for food safety. FDA would be required to \napprove additives that caused only a negligible or insignificant risk \nof harm--in other words, instead of the current law standard of no \nharm, the proposal would establish a weaker standard of not too much \nharm.\n  Perhaps this change is inadvertent. It certainly is unjustified and \nunneeded. Perhaps, in aiming at the Delaney clause on cancer-causing \nsubstances, the sponsors mistakenly hit the general food safety \nstandard too. Or perhaps the food industry lobbyists saw their chance \nand took it--to get out from under the Delaney clause, and get out from \nunder the general food safety standards too.\n  It is a long way from no harm to not-too-much harm, and before we \ntravel down that road we had better be very sure we know the \nconsequences.\n  The amendment I will offer when we return to the bill, in addition to \ndealing with the Delaney clause, will also delete the provision \nweakening the general food safety standard. The provision seems to be a \ngratuitous weakening of a standard that is working well in current law \nand does not need reform. If a change in this important law is not \nnecessary, it is necessary not to change it.\n  The bedrock food safety standard in current law should not be \ndiscarded lightly. Any legislation in this area must reflect the care \nan deliberation due a subject as important as whether the citizens of \nthis country, especially infants and children, are now to be exposed to \na higher risk of cancer and other diseases in the food they consume.\n  Madam President, toward the conclusion of my remarks I remind the \nSenate once again what has been happening to cancer incidence in the \nAmerican population. It has increased by 48 percent since 1950. This is \nexcluding cancers of the lung and the stomach.\n  Here we see what has been happening. We have seen the treatment of a \nnumber of these, particularly childhood cancers, have gotten much \nbetter. So the burden among the children in this country in many \ninstances has been increasingly hopefully beneficial in terms of the \ntreatment.\n  But when we see the continued increase in the incidence of cancer, \nand the danger that brings, why should we be out here flying in the \nface of a National Academy of Sciences' study which has recommended how \nwe can protect children, and throwing that recommendation, which \nrepresents the best in terms of scientific information, over our \nshoulder and throwing it to the winds? I fail to understand the logic \nof that position.\n  Everyone knows what is going on here. Food industry lobbyists are \ntrying to stampede Congress into hasty action on the Delaney clause \nthat will have drastic long-term consequences for the safety of the \nfood supply of 250 million Americans. I have never heard any consumer \nsay that they think food is too safe.\n  Those who vote for this amendment go on the record in support of \nprompt but responsible Delaney reform and against any tampering with \nthe general food safety standard.\n  The Delaney clause may have outlived its usefulness, but it deserves \na decent burial. It deserves to be replaced by a modern safety standard \nthat strikes the right balance between the needs of industry and the \nhealth of our children. And the general food safety standard deserves \nto remain intact.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10266-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10269-S10270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              REGULATORY REFORM AND FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, contrary to what opponents of S. 343 \nallege, enactment of our bill would neither undermine the existing \nstandard for food safety nor needlessly expose our citizens--man, \nwoman, or child--to carcinogenic substances.\n  Although we are today considering the Bosnian arms embargo issue, \nsince the issue of the Delaney clause has arisen, I wanted to take this \nbrief opportunity to respond to some inaccuracies that were propounded \nin this Chamber today.\n  I will limit my remarks now to two criticisms raised today: that S. \n343 lessens the safety standard for all foods; and that the bill is \ndefective in that it lacks a definition of negligible or insignificant \nrisk.\n  I plan to defer the rest of my remarks on Delaney clause issues for \nour continued consideration of S. 343.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the three Delaney clauses contained \nwithin the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to ban a limited group \nof substances--food additives, color additives, and animal drugs--if \nthey are found in whatever quantity to produce cancer in laboratory \nanimals.\n  This inflexible zero risk standard in the law is outdated \nscientifically, as my colleague, Senator Kennedy, noted earlier.\n  Some have alleged that the Delaney clause modification language of S. \n343 somehow fundamentally undermines our Nation's food safety laws. \nThat simply is not the case. It is unfortunate that some of my \ncolleagues are relying on the interpretation of lawyers at the Food and \nDrug Administration who apparently cannot read the law--and this is not \nthe first time those in this Chamber have had that experience.\n  So that this is perfectly clear to my colleagues, I want to walk \nthrough this issue so that you can see how the language contained in S. \n343 continues to protect the public health.\n  The Delaney clause modification language in S. 343 states:\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall \n     not prohibit or refuse to approve a substance or product on \n     the basis of safety, where the substance or product presents \n     a negligible or insignificant foreseeable risk to human \n     health resulting from its intended use.\n\n  This provision of S. 343 harmonizes the safety standard of the three \nDelaney clause provisions with the safety standard long applied by FDA \nunder the other safety provisions contained within the Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act.\n  In other words, there are substances which could be present in food, \nor added to food, or indeed, used on or in the human body, which are \nnot subject to the Delaney clause language. To single out these three \nDelaney clause substances for treatment other than that accorded a \nbroader group of substances used for virtually identical purposes is \nsenseless, especially in view of the fact that FDA has a well-\nestablished safety standard for those substances which does incorporate \nthe negligible risk standard.\n  For the edification of my colleagues, I will list these substances: \npesticide residues that do not concentrate in processed food; food \nsubstances that are not classified as additives because they are \ngenerally recognized as safe or were approved by FDA or USDA during the \nperiod 1938 to 1958; dietary supplement ingredients; constituents of \nfood additives; constituents of color additives; environmental \ncontaminants in the food supply; cosmetic ingredients; undetectable \nanimal drug residues; and ingredients in nonprescription and \nprescription drugs, biologics, and medical devices.\n  To make a distinction in the safety standard for these substances \nversus food additives, color additives, or animal drugs, is, at best, \nirrational.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts has expressed the concern that in \namending section 409(c)(3) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the \nlanguage of S. 343 eliminates the safety standard for all foods from \nthe law.\n  Specifically, 409(c)(3) says:\n\n       No regulation [food additive approval] shall issue if a \n     fair evaluation of the data before the Secretary--\n       (A) fails to establish that the proposed use of the food \n     additive, under the conditions of use to be specified in the \n     regulation, will be safe: Provided, that no additive shall be \n     deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when \n     ingested by man or animal. . .[Delaney language].\n\n  It is my understanding that my colleague is concerned that the way in \nwhich S. 343 was drafted, that is, modifying all of 409(c)(3) instead \nof just the proviso containing the Delaney language, eliminates \nentirely the existing safety standard.\n  I believe the implication is that the modification should be made to \nthe proviso only.\n  I simply do not believe that is an accurate reading of the law, when \nthe totality of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provisions with respect \nto food safety are read together.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that that was not our intent. In fact, \nI do \n\n[[Page S 10270]]\nnot recall ever hearing any one suggest that that should be the case, \nin any discussions I have had on the Delaney clause.\n  There exist a number of safety standards which apply to food under \nthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Some of these standards \noverlap--that is, more than one standard may apply to a food or food \ningredient or constituent, depending on the particular circumstances.\n  First, there is the general adulteration standard under section \n402(a)(1) of the FD Act. This section, which applies to food \ngenerally, says that a food is deemed to be adulterated (that is, \nunsafe) if:\n\n       It bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance \n     which may render it [the food] injurious to health; but in \n     case the substance is not an added substance such food shall \n     not be considered adulterated under this clause if the \n     quantity of such substance does not ordinarily render it \n     injurious to health.\n\n  This safety standard has two parts. For poisonous or deleterious \nsubstances added to food, the food is adulterated if the substances may \nrender the food injurious to health. For substances which are not \nadded, that is, they are inherent or not the result of human activity, \nthe adulteration standard is ordinarily injurious to health.\n  These two principal adulteration standards have been bulwarks in the \nlegislative and regulatory scheme to ensure the safety of food for \ndecades. Indeed, numerous courts have had occasion to interpret these \nprovisions, for example, in U.S. v. Boston Farm Center, Inc. (590 F.2d \n149 (4th Cir. 1979) and United States vs. Anderson Seafoods, Inc., 622 \nF.2d 157, (5th Cir. 1980).\n  These standards remain unamended in S. 343 and would continue to \nguarantee the safety of our food supply.\n  Second, it is important to note that the adulteration standards found \nin section 402(a)(1) are independent of the requirement that such food \ningredients as food or color additives be shown to be safe. Or put more \nsimply, any legislative change to section 409 dealing with food \nadditives, for example, would not affect the adulteration standards in \nsection 402(a)(1).\n  In fact, FDA has used the 402(a)(1) standard to permit quantities of \nsubstances, including recognized carcinogens such as aflatoxin--a \nnaturally occurring toxicant from mold which particularly affects \npeanuts--to be in food. In such a case, FDA has typically employed risk \nassessment to determine the level of the carcinogenic poisonous or \ndeleterious substance that presents only an insignificant risk.\n  Third, numerous other safety standards are set forth in section 402 \nof the FD act. One of the principal additional standards provides \nthat a food is adulterated if it contains a poisonous or deleterious \nsubstance which is unsafe within the meaning of section 346.\n  Section 346 provides that a food containing a poisonous or \ndeleterious substance is unsafe for purposes of section 402, and thus \nis adulterated unless the substance is required in the production of \nthe food or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.\n  It is under the principals of section 346 that FDA has regulated \nenvironmental contaminants, including such substances as PCBs, a \nparticularly toxic group of chemicals once widely used in industrial \nproduction, and PBBs, a flame retardant that was mistakenly applied to \nfood in Michigan.\n  FDA has implemented this section through the use of action levels and \ntolerances, which are announced levels of the toxic substance that will \nbe permitted in food.\n  As Professor Richard Merrill observed in ``Regulating Carcinogens in \nFood: A Legislator's Guide to the Food Safety Provisions of the Federal \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act,'' (77 Mich L.Rev. 171 (1978), ``Most \nnotably section 406 . . . does not unequivocally preclude the marketing \nof food that contains an added carcinogenic substance.'' Professor \nMerrill adds that ``FDA has taken the position that it may establish a \ntolerance for a contaminant shown to be carcinogenic--and thus \n'approve' its presence in food in quantities below the tolerance.''\n  As is the case with respect to section 402(a)(1), the legislative \nlanguage contained in S. 343 has no effect on the important safety \nstandard found in the interplay between sections 402(a)(2)(A) and \nsection 406.\n  Fourth, section 402 contains numerous other standards related to the \nsafety of food, including those that pertain to food that contains \nfilthy, putrid or decomposed substance, that has been prepared under \nunsanitary conditions, that contains unlawful pesticide residues, or if \nthe package of the food contains a poisonous or deleterious substance \nthat may render the food injurious to health, (the same standard as set \nfor in section 402(a).\n  The second point on which I would like to comment is the contention \nthat not defining insignificant or negligible risk in legislation \nlanguage is a bad idea.\n  I take vigorous exception to the idea that the Congress should define \nthese terms in law. Imposition of the zero risk standard by legislative \nfiat is what led to the Delaney dilemma in the first place.\n  When Congress first enacted a Delaney amendment in 1958, scientists \nwere not able to detect potentially carcinogenic substances at the \nparts per million, or parts per billion, levels as they are today. Does \nthis mean that we should lock into the law a one in a million lifetime \nrisk of cancer standard? I think not. What our bill does is allow the \nagencies to make these definitions. This will allow the law to grow \nwith the science.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate my continued commitment \nto Delaney reform which both protects the public health and is \nconsistent with sound scientific and regulatory principles. This is \nlong overdue.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10269-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 21) to terminate the United States arms embargo \n     applicable to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nproposal which I am privileged to cosponsor with the distinguished \nmajority leader and many others of both parties, which would finally \nlift the arms embargo and do some justice in the former Yugoslavia, by \nreplacing a policy of inaction or half actions that has failed to stem \nthe conflict, has failed to stop aggression, and has failed to protect \nthe victims of that aggression, whose pain we see each night on our \ntelevision sets.\n  Madam President, this is a genuinely bipartisan or nonpartisan \neffort, as it should be, as American foreign policy has traditionally \nbeen at its best--above party consideration.\n  Senator Dole and I began this effort in 1992 when the incumbent in \nthe White House happened to be a Republican, President Bush. We have \ncontinued in 1993, 1994, and 1995, with President Clinton in the White \nHouse.\n  Sadly, each time that we have raised this question of lifting the \narms embargo and using allied air power selectively, we have been met \nwith different excuses. A defense, not even really so much a defense of \nthe existing policy, but criticisms, complications, unintended results, \nthat might occur if the arms embargo was lifted.\n  In that, I think, and I will get to that in a moment or two, we have \nfailed not only to see what was happening on the ground, but to listen \nto the victims of the aggression. The Bosnians have said repeatedly, \nover and over again, ``We don't want American soldiers on Bosnian soil. \nWe don't need American soldiers on Bosnian soil. We have troops on \nBosnian soil, they are Bosnians--in excess of 100,000. They are \nmotivated, understandably, to fight to defend their country, their \ncommunities, their families, themselves. Just give us the weapons with \nwhich to defend ourselves.''\n  Madam President, we rise again, a bipartisan group. Several tries at \nlifting the arms embargo having failed, this time we act with some \nsense of hope that we will be able to achieve, perhaps \n\n[[Page S 10271]]\nlater today, a strong bipartisan statement that it is time to change \nour policy. Give the Bosnians the weapons they deserve. Stop denying \nthem their inherent right to defend themselves, a right we have as \nindividuals, the right Bosnians have as a nation, under international \nlaw, under the charter of the United Nations.\n  This is a bipartisan call. Let me read the names of some of the \nothers who are cosponsoring S. 21: Senator Helms, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Biden, Senator D'Amato, Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Warner, Senator Hatch, Senator Kyl, Senator Moynihan, Senator \nStevens, Senator Cochran, the distinguished occupant of the chair, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Mack, Senator Coverdell, Senator Packwood, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Specter. And I am pleased now, Madam \nPresident, to ask unanimous consent that Senator Craig of Idaho be \nadded as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1801, a substitute to S. 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yesterday, Secretary Perry, the Secretary of Defense, \nand Secretary of State Christopher, visited with both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators, to report on events that are going on in former \nYugoslavia, to discuss some new options, for it sounds like a more \nvigorous policy, particularly the employment, more aggressively, of \nNATO air power, and to ask the Senate to delay taking this measure up \nand lifting the arms embargo, saying it is the wrong time to do it, \nwith the discussions going on now.\n  Madam President, I have the greatest respect for Secretary Perry and \nSecretary Christopher. They are distinguished public servants. They \nhave served with extraordinary skill, I think, in their respective \npositions, but I respectfully disagree with them. I hope that my \ncolleagues will reject this call, this latest call, to delay action on \nlifting the arms embargo.\n  I particularly appeal to my democratic colleagues who may have some \nunderstandable reluctance to oppose the President. I strongly support \nthe President in general. I just respectfully and sincerely and deeply \ndisagree with the policy the administration has followed in regard to \nBosnia.\n  Madam President, President Clinton, in the campaign in 1992, \nadvocated the policy that I thought then held the best hope of a \nreasonable solution in Bosnia, and I still think does, which is to lift \nthe arms embargo and strike from the air at Serbian targets, on the \nbasic premise that there is an aggressor here and a victim. The \naggressor is Serbia, led by President Milosevic.\n  As I recounted last night, history will show and the record shows \nthat beginning in 1988, President Milosevic of Serbia took a series of \nsteps--clear, concerted, intentional--to create a greater Serbia by \ntaking advantage of the instability that existed in Europe as a result \nof the end of the cold war, the coming collapse that could be seen as \nthe years went on. The entity of Yugoslavia began this concerted effort \nthrough aggression and other means, to move into Srebrenica, Croatia, \nto be more aggressive, and control the Albanian majority in Kosovo--\naggressive is a tame word; abusive is a correct word--and to move into \nBosnia,\n using Serbian agents, as it were, that is to say Serbs who lived in \nBosnia and Croatia, as a fighting force, augmented, supplied, and in \nsome cases actually supported right there by members of the Serbian \narmed forces--a clear stream of aggression.\n\n  President Clinton saw that, I think, in 1992, and brought the policy \nof lift and strike into office with him, understanding, making the \npoint that if aggression is allowed to go unresponded to, there will be \nmore aggression. History shows us that. Common sense shows us that. If \nyou let common criminals on the streets of any city or town in America \ncontinue to hold people up, abuse them, commit acts of assault and \nbattery, larceny, and murder against them without the law taking any \nstand against that, without threatening them, without forcing them to \nhave any fear, they will continue to do it. And that is exactly what \nhas happened in the last 3\\1/2\\ to 4 years in Bosnia.\n  In the spring of 1993, Secretary Christopher went over to Europe to \nspeak to our allies in Britain and France, advocating the policy of \nlift and strike. They refused to go along. And that was the end of that \npolicy for this administration.\n  So I say to my colleagues, as we listen to the appeals that will be \nmade today by our friends and our leaders in this administration, that, \nreally, what we are asking in putting forward S. 21 today is that the \nadministration be given a chance to implement the policy that it \nbrought into office with it and that was essentially blocked in \nimplementation by some of our good friends and allies in Western Europe \nwho had a different point of view.\n  At every step, when we have raised the idea of lifting the arms \nembargo, there has been another reason why it was the wrong time. \nEarlier it was the wrong time because the United Nations had to be \ngiven an opportunity to work its will, or the Owens-Vance peace mission \nhad to be given an opportunity to work its will, or the Serbs had to be \ngiven a chance with the Bosnians to accept the peace proposal. It was \nvery detailed, very fair--not so good for the Bosnians, because it left \nthem with about 20 percent of the land that they had before the Serbian \naggression began--but give them a chance to accept it. The Bosnians \naccepted it. The Serbs did not. It was the wrong time to lift the arms \nembargo because if it was lifted, people said to us, U.N. personnel who \nare there will be seized as hostages.\n  The arms embargo was not lifted. The Bosnians continue to be victims \nof aggression, torture, ethnic cleansing, rape, murder--and yet, as we \nhave seen, tragically, the U.N. personnel were seized as hostages.\n  Then it was said last year, when we brought up this proposal to lift \nthe arms embargo, you cannot lift the arms embargo, this will anger the \nSerbs. They will have no reason not to go into the safe areas that the \nUnited Nations has created for a humanitarian purpose, to protect the \nBosnian victims. We did not lift the arms embargo and what has happened \nin the last couple of weeks? The Serbs moved into these undefended safe \nareas like Srebrenica, forcing out thousands--older people. I hate to \nsee those pictures of those old women and men, forced marches, dropped \noff in the middle of the night in a no-man's land between the Serb and \nBosnian forces, forced to walk their way across difficult terrain to \nfind their way to Bosnian territory to get some food and shelter. The \nharrowing stories of young women taken away by Serbian soldiers from \ntheir families for God knows what reason. Young men of military age \nremoved on trumped up charges that they were going to be investigated \nas criminals or terrorists.\n  We have seen it before in this conflict. We saw--most notably in 1992 \nwhen British television crews found their way to what I would call \nconcentration camps--what happens to these Bosnian men when they were \ntaken away by Serbian forces: the emaciated bodies, the horrible echoes \nof the Second World War.\n  They said, if we lifted the arms embargo, we would see this again, \nwhat we saw in 1992. We have not lifted the arms embargo, and the Serbs \ncarried all of this out, all these atrocities again.\n  Did you read the story of the 20-year-old woman, a Bosnian woman, \nfound hanging from a tree at her own hand, blouse and skirt blowing in \nthe wind? People could not really explain what had happened, except \nthere were allegations that she had been taken away by the Serbs, \nperhaps raped, perhaps abused, perhaps separated. There was no family. \nNo one knew who she belonged to. There were only rumors. Had her \nparents been separated from her? Did a husband get taken away as a \nperson of military age? These are the consequences of Serbian \naggression and the consequences of leaving a people undefended.\n  Wrong time? Now the argument is that it is the wrong time to lift the \narms embargo because of the horrific events in Bosnia in the last \ncouple of weeks--the fall, the conquest of an undefended city. It was \nno act of bravery by the Serbian forces. There were 40,000 people there \nwith an army whose weapons had been put into the U.N. compound, and \nU.N. soldiers, Dutch soldiers, brave Dutch soldiers, put into an \nimpossible position with light arms \n\n[[Page S 10272]]\nto defend themselves against a Serbian invasion with heavy weapons--\ntanks, armored personnel carriers, sophisticated weapons. This was no \nbrave military conquest.\n  As a result of the horrors we are seeing, we are now seeing a pickup \nin the pace of Western concern, responding to the Western public, who \nare obviously, all of us, outraged by these atrocities being committed \nagainst the Bosnian people. President Chirac proposes that the United \nNations should become more aggressive in defending the safe areas, or \nget out. He is right. The United Nations has become a cover for Serb \naggression. Every time the Serbs strike, in fear of reprisal they grab \nsome U.N. soldiers as hostages and frustrate, emasculate, nullify any \nWestern will to take action against them.\n  And what is the response from Britain and the United States to \nChirac's proposal? Uncertain, although now there seems to be a genuine \ninterest in the more aggressive use of NATO air power, at least to \nprotect the safe havens, but also to put the Serbs on notice that other \nSerbian targets in Bosnia and beyond may be vulnerable.\n  So we are now asked not to take action on lifting the arms embargo \nbecause it somehow may affect the pace of these negotiations about the \nuse of air power. I do not get it. I do not understand that argument. \nFirst, I think it is wrong. I think it is wrong to give us yet another \nargument why we should not be lifting the arms embargo, particularly as \nevery passing day brings more powerful, painful evidence of the failure \nof the current policy. But it does not make sense. If the United States \nnow, our Government, wants to be part of a more aggressive use of NATO \nair power to protect and give some meaning to the safe havens, it seems \nto me if this Senate, in a strong bipartisan majority, rises up and \nadopts S. 21, we are saying not just to lift the arms embargo, we are \ncrying out. We are saying, united as Americans, as leaders, \nrepresentatives of the people of the greatest power in the world, a \npower that has built its strength not just on military might but on the \nmight of its morality, that this policy that the West has been \nfollowing in Bosnia is a failure.\n  I think for that message to be in the air, if we can pass this \noverwhelmingly today on a bipartisan basis, that message in the air as \nthe allies gather again in London on Friday to discuss what course to \nfollow can only help. It can only strengthen the hand of our \nrepresentatives there, Secretary Perry, Secretary Christopher, to say, \nlook what the Senate of the United States has said now by an \noverwhelming majority, perhaps even a veto-proof majority: We must \nstrengthen the U.N. posture or we must get out and lift the arms \nembargo.\n  So, Mr. President, the time has come. It is long past due. The hour \nis late in Bosnia. The suffering has gone on there. There is no \nperfect, no guaranteed solution. But what we clearly know is that the \ncurrent policy has failed. It has failed for the Bosnian people, it has \nfailed for NATO, for the United Nations, and for the United States. It \nis time to try the alternative, and this is the alternative.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Connecticut for his \nleadership in this area and for being the cosponsor with our majority \nleader on this very important resolution in a bipartisan effort. The \nSenator from Connecticut has been consistent. He has been there from \nthe beginning, when we started talking about this issue over a year \nago. I thank him once again, after what has happened in the last week, \nfor coming forward and saying ``enough is enough.''\n  Mr. President, it is time for the United States to end this failed \npolicy of leaving the Bosnian Moslems defenseless. Time after time, Mr. \nPresident, we have returned to this debate, and we have watched more \npeople ravaged in Bosnia as we ponder the issue. We cannot continue to \nwring our hands and withhold from the Bosnian people the means to fight \nfor their own freedom. The time has come for us to end this debate and \nlift the arms embargo. If we have to do it unilaterally, we must, or in \nconcert with our allies, if we can.\n  An old adage says it is preferable to die fighting on your feet than \nto live begging on your knees. I doubt there is a Senator in this body \nwho disagrees with that statement. But it is clear that the Bosnians \nhave made their choice, and it is to fight on their feet.\n  The Bosnians are not asking us to arm them. They are not asking for \nAmerican troops to defend them. They are simply asking to be allowed to \nfight their own fight. It is unconscionable for us to continue to deny \nthem that basic right for survival and liberty. What we have now is a \nbloodstained policy which denies them the means of defending \nthemselves. And it is one that we should no longer countenance.\n  Two months ago, Mr. President, I returned from visiting our forces in \nMacedonia and Croatia more concerned than ever that we are perilously \nclose to direct involvement in this Eastern European conflict. Today, \nthe administration is considering a request from our allies which will \nonly draw the United States deeper and deeper into an implacable \nsituation. The French Defense Minister recently called for the United \nNations to expand its mission in Bosnia and to assume a more aggressive \nstance against the Bosnian Serbs, including more airstrikes and a \nlarger U.N. ground force.\n  I believe for us to participate in such a plan would be a grave \nmistake. I have been totally opposed to sending United States ground \ntroops into Bosnia, and in the light of recent developments, my resolve \nis even stronger. Any decision to involve U.S. forces in additional air \nsupport roles would move us two steps closer to a United States ground \npresence in Bosnia.\n  The shootdown of Capt. Scott O'Grady served to remind us that \nproviding air support is not without cost. It has the real potential of \nmission creep--involving us deeper and deeper in this conflict. And \nmake no mistake, we are on the brink.\n  I have heard the discussions evolve about what is help for extraction \nof our troops. Is it reconfiguration of our troops anywhere within \nBosnia? Is it an emergency? Now we are talking about using American \nhelicopters. American helicopters are the beginning of ground \ninvolvement, and we cannot let this happen.\n  It is clear that the United Nations is conducting a peacekeeping \nmission in a region where there is no peace. There is no peace in \nsight. The United Nations is paralyzed and unable to respond and \nunwilling to retreat.\n  Last week the Bosnian Serbs attacked a U.N.-designated safe area of \nSrebrenica. They routed Dutch U.N. forces. They took U.N. forces \nhostage and drove the inhabitants of the so-called safe area out of \ntheir homes--the same inhabitants we have denied the ability to fight \nfor their homes. Even as we debate this matter right this minute, the \nSerbs are overrunning U.N. outposts and assaulting another supposed \nsafe area, Zepa, with artillery and armored vehicles.\n  According to the administration, its reluctance to lift the arms \nembargo stems from the fear that if the embargo should be lifted, the \nBosnian Serbs would only be encouraged to go on the offensive and press \ntheir attack on the Bosnian Moslems. Encouraged? What is happening now \nthis very minute? I do not think you could say by any stretch of the \nimagination that anything we would do would change the encouragement \nthat they are now receiving to do the atrocities that they are doing.\n  This seems to me to be an empty excuse when they are already clearly \non the attack. The refugees fleeing Srebrenica and Zepa provide ample \nevidence of the failure of this embargo where only one side of the \nconflict is disarmed.\n  Secretary Christopher said yesterday that lifting the arms embargo \nunilaterally would force the withdrawal of U.N. troops. I am sorry to \nsay, Mr. President, that would be a positive development. It is the \nstatus quo that represents failure. This resolution that we are \ndebating is an acknowledgment that the U.N. can no longer function in \nBosnia until both sides are ready to sit down at a table and negotiate \npeace.\n  The United Nations is an effective peacekeeper when both sides are \nseeking peace. This is not the case in \n\n[[Page S 10273]]\nBosnia today. As Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacribey said so \neloquently just this week, ``The U.N. troops have become a hindrance * \n* * a clumsy reminder of the U.N.'s failure.''\n  The Bosnians need more than bread flown in on a U.N. airlift. The \nBosnians need to be able to defend themselves, to get their country \nback in order. The United Nations has shown that it cannot and will not \nperform that vital role. So it is time for the U.N. to step aside. \nFleeing Bosnian Moslems reportedly have seized weapons from the \nUkrainian U.N. forces. Ironically, those seized weapons may represent \nthe most concrete peacekeeping effort yet provided by the U.N. forces \nto the Bosnians.\n  I urge the President to turn away from this most recent in a long \nseries of shifts in our American policy. Instead, he should be \nencouraging the United Nations and our allies to withdraw as swiftly as \npossible and then lift the arms embargo so the Bosnian Moslems can \ndefend themselves.\n  Last year when I met with Bosnian Vice President Ganic in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, where the distinguished Presiding Officer \nalso was present, he made a poignant appeal.\n And then he said apologetically, ``I realize I am emotional about this \nissue.''\n\n  I thought to myself, this man is apologizing for being emotional when \nhis people are unarmed and under assault, his families are being \nbrutalized and murdered, and we in the West are the ones who should be \napologizing for denying those people a basic right that we all \nacknowledge, the right to defend their country.\n  We have a moral obligation to uphold a U.S. doctrine articulated by \nPresidents from John F. Kennedy to George Bush: We will lend our \nsupport to oppressed people who are willing to fight for their freedom.\n  It is not always our responsibility to fight for those people, but we \ncertainly ought to be willing to support them in the other ways that we \ncan, and we certainly should not deny them the right to fight for \nthemselves. This is an American principle that we must uphold.\n  During his compelling testimony before the Armed Services Committee, \nVice President Ganic talked of our sacrifices on D-day, but he warned \nus that 50 years after the defeat of fascism in Europe, it is once \nagain there on the rise in the form of genocide and oppression against \nthe non-Serbian populations of Bosnia.\n  When a few of us visited with the Prime Minister of Bosnia just 3 \nweeks ago, he said, ``I am puzzled by the U.N. which keeps saying there \nare two sides to this issue.'' He said, ``There are two sides. One side \nis shooting and the other side is dying.'' Not exactly, Mr. President, \na level playing field.\n  Bosnia's Foreign Minister told reporters yesterday, ``We are not \nwaiting for anyone anymore. We are not asking for troops to be sent to \nBosnia. We are only prepared to count on ourselves and no one else.''\n  Mr. President, we can no longer continue to leave Bosnia defenseless \nagainst a well-armed Serbian aggression. The United States has acted \nunilaterally before, and we will again. We are the leader of the free \nworld. We must lift the arms embargo. Vice President Ganic said, ``We \nare dying anyway. Let us die fighting, fighting for our country.''\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Senate to heed their pleas \nand set a date certain for lifting this arms embargo.\n  I thank the leaders of this effort, Senator Dole, Senator Lieberman, \nand the other cosponsors of this very important resolution.\n  We have talked about this enough. The time has come for us to act \ndecisively as the leader of the free world.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Connecticut \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague and friend from Texas not only for her support of this call \nfor lifting of the arms embargo but for a powerful and eloquent \nstatement of moral principle as well as strategic interest and just \ngood common sense.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased at this time to ask unanimous \nconsent that the distinguished occupant of the chair, the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Kempthorne], be added as an original cosponsor of this \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues or any staff who \nare following the proceedings in the Chamber, that I am going to \ncontinue for a while to deal with some of the issues which I think are \ninvolved in this debate, but I am more than happy to yield the floor to \nany colleagues who wish to speak on this proposal as they come to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, let me focus for a few more moments on the appeal that \nwill be made today again that this is the wrong time to lift the \nembargo, the wrong time for the Senate to speak out because of the \nincreased pace of discussions between the United States and our allies \nin Europe about a more robust policy to follow against Serbian \naggression or for implementation of the U.N. policy.\n  I have said a short while ago here that on every occasion when we \nhave proposed lifting the arms embargo, there has always been another \nreason why people have said to us this is the wrong time. I truly hope \nand pray that my colleagues will not listen to these entreaties and \nwill join in the strong, bipartisan, nonpartisan outcry against the \ncurrent policy and plea for implementation of the right of self-defense \nof the Bosnian people, to which Senator Hutchison has so eloquently \nspoken.\n  The other fact, in addition to the one I cited earlier, about why I \nbelieve passing this proposal will in fact strengthen the \nadministration's hand in discussions with our allies for a robust \npolicy is that it shows not just the impatience but the growing \nopposition, the strong opposition, the nonpartisan opposition to the \ncurrent policy. It cannot be sustained anymore. It is not being \nsustained on the ground in Bosnia, and it cannot be sustained in the \npolitical representative community that we are for the American people.\n  It is in that sense simply unfair of the Europeans to continue to \npress this administration to follow a policy that is not the one of \nlift and strike that it brought into office.\n  The other thing to say about the timing may be a sad fact, but it is \ntrue that there is a temporal discontinuity between what may happen in \nthis Chamber today, hopefully, perhaps tomorrow, in adopting this \nproposal and what is happening on the ground and the suffering of the \nBosnian people and continued aggression of the Bosnian Serbs, as Zepa, \neffectively undefended, is about to fall; which is to say that even if \nwe adopt this proposal, hopefully by a strong, overwhelming majority, \nthat does not mean it becomes law. Something has to be done by the \nHouse. Either this will go to the House or the House will take up a \nseparate proposal. I gather the latter is the more likely course. Then, \nas this Government of ours works, it will go to a conference committee. \nThat will take some time. And then it will go to the President, and he \nhas some period of time to decide in the normal course whether to sign \nor veto the proposal.\n  So do not worry. If I were a Bosnian on the ground suffering, \nwatching my country being taken away from me, watching tens of \nthousands of my country men and women being forced out of their homes, \nwatching people being raped and murdered, I would worry about the \ntiming, but for those who counsel against action today because of what \nmay happen in London on Friday, do not worry about it. Do not worry \nabout it. Unfortunately, there will be plenty of time, even if we adopt \nthis proposal today or tomorrow, before the arms embargo is actually \nlifted.\n  Mr. President, let me now go on to talk about some of what happens on \nthe ground today in Bosnia and what I think is the attitude we have \nallowed to develop among the leadership of the Serbs and the Bosnian \nSerbs, which is a wanton disrespect of international order and morality \nand law.\n  A story on the radio today that I heard coming in is that as these \ndiscussions of a more aggressive Western NATO policy in Bosnia--not to \ntry to turn back Serbian aggression, which has already taken well over \n70 percent of the country--but discussions are \n\n[[Page S 10274]]\ngoing on about a more aggressive NATO policy to protect the safe areas, \nto give some meaning to the word ``safe\" to make it other than \nludicrous, which is truly what it was, ludicrous and horrific for the \n30,000 or 40,000 in Srebrenica who did not find that town to be a safe \narea. In other words, we are talking now about using Western air power \nand stronger defense forces to give some meaning to a resolution of the \nUnited Nations to create six safe areas in Bosnia, one of which has \nfallen, another of which is about to go, a resolution that I must say \nhas the same source as the arms embargo,\n which we have painfully respected for so long and at such cost for \neveryone.\n\n  And what is the response of the Serbs to even the discussion of more \nforcefully enforcing an act of international law, of the international \ncommunity, of the United Nations? Mr. Karadzic, the President of the \nBosnian Serb nation, operating out of Pale, says he warns the Western \nPowers that Bosnian Serb forces will shoot down any Western planes or \nhelicopters that come in to defend the safe areas. Can you imagine the \noutrage here, the outrage that we have created? If you again let an \naggressor go on and do not make them pay for their aggression, if they \nare rewarded for their aggression, if they essentially laugh at the \nUnited Nations, NATO, the Western World, what is the hope for order, \nfor morality in an international society, in the post-cold war? What is \nthe next step?\n  Basically the Chirac proposal to protect the safe zones is really \nlike a local police force saying it is going to carry out the law in a \nlocal area, and the criminals saying, ``If you bring police cars into \nthis area to carry out the law, we are going to throw hand grenades at \nthe police cars.'' What would our reaction to that be? But that is what \nwe have invited here by our inaction.\n  We have allowed not a great army, we have allowed a second-rate army, \nto put it mildly, to hold at bay, to take aggressive action, to punish, \nnot just the Bosnian people, but the greatest military alliance in the \nhistory of the world; namely, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \nWe have sent in these courageous soldiers wearing the blue helmets of \nthe United Nations saying they are not combatants, giving them light \narms, refusing repeatedly under this bizarre, ridiculous dual-key \napproval approach where NATO troops under fire wearing the U.N. uniform \nhave to get the approval of the U.N. political authorities; namely, Mr. \nAkashi, to fight back, to call in air power. Efforts to call for \nstrikes have been repeatedly frustrated and turned down. So we send in \nthe United Nations and basically give these heroic soldiers wearing the \nblue helmets a mission impossible. And what we have done is diminish \nthe credibility of this great allied force, this NATO force which held \nthe Soviet armies at bay for the duration of the cold war and now is \nbeing made a fool of by a second-rate military in Serbia, such that the \npolitical leader of those Serbs says this morning, has the nerve to \nwarn the West, that his forces will shoot down Western helicopters if \nthey dare to enforce the law, which is to say to protect civilians in \nsafe areas. That is what we have come to.\n  Uncertainty, irresoluteness, weakness in the face of aggression will \nalways draw more aggression. There is no reason to stop.\n  Others say that if we lift the arms embargo we will Americanize the \nwar. My first answer to that is the answer that Prime Minister \nSilajdzic respectfully gave when he was here a while ago. The Prime \nMinister of Bosnia said in one sense the war has already been \nAmericanized. It is a tragic sense. It is a painful sense, which is to \nsay that the continued American support of the arms embargo, the \ncontinued refusal to allow not just that we supply the Bosnians with \nweapons to defend themselves but that we make it difficult for others \nto do so, we continue to support this policy in the world community \nthat effectively is America taking a position in this war. Certainly it \nis so on a moral basis that we have by our continued support of the \narms embargo had an effect. We have Americanized the conflict by \ndenying weapons to one side. And of all the bizarre and crazy results, \nwe are denying weapons to the victims of aggression.\n  Mr. President, as I said last night and I repeat here briefly, there \nis a tragic history and story to be told here about the origins of this \nembargo. It began in 1991 when Yugoslavia had not quite broken apart. \nAnd it was requested by the Government in Belgrade, the same government \nof Milosevic that has carried out this policy of aggression for the \npurpose of creating a greater Serbia.\n  Why was it requested? Well, with some naivete let me say why I think \na lot of people voted for it. The theory that was being presented was \nthat if we closed the flow of arms into the Balkans, we would stop the \noutbreak of war there. And in 1991 it was possible for people of good \nfaith to accept this argument, which looking back today is \npreposterous.\n  But what is even more infuriating is that this arms embargo was \nrequested by the Government in Serbia. And why did they request it? \nBecause they had all the arms they needed. History and fate made it \nsuch that the warmaking capacity, the munitions, the military equipment \nof the former Yugoslavia were almost totally in what became Serbia, \noperating out of Belgrade.\n  So I have viewed the arms embargo and certainly the request to \nsupport for it by the Government in Belgrade in 1991 as a cynical act \nwhich was done with full knowledge of their own intentions, the \nintention of the Government in Belgrade to begin aggression to extend \ntheir domain as a way to prevent their soon-to-be victims from \nobtaining weapons.\n  That is the sad and twisted history of this embargo, which some have \nnow raised to the level of great international law. It was an act of \npolitics, an act of policy for some, a well-intended attempt to stop \nwar from breaking out once again in the Balkans.\n  But how can we have sustained that policy when on the ground it was \nclear that war had broken out, and the impact of the embargo was to \ndeny one side, the Bosnians, the means with which to defend themselves \nwhile the other had plenty? So in response to this argument that \nlifting the arms embargo Americanizes the war, I offer the statement of \nthe premise that unfortunately America's enforcement of the arms \nembargo Americanizes the war. There is an extent to which we have blood \non our hands here by our inaction, if you will, although it is action. \nAnd insofar as we have continued to support the arms embargo, second, \nin a more direct sense, the war has already been Americanized.\n  As I have said here before, weakness in the face of aggression \nencourages more outrageous aggression. And the most powerful testimony \nto that could be offered by Captain O'Grady in his F-16, taking off on \na flight as part of Operation Deny Flight which was the United Nation's \neffort to enforce the no-fly zone which also was an act of the U.N. \nSecurity Council.\n  What is the no-fly zone? The no-fly zone was the attempt after the \ninitial mistakes of the United Nations to try to tone down the conflict \nacknowledging that most of the planes in the region were from Serbia. \nTo keep them on the ground or at least not give them that brutal \nadvantage from the air. So Captain O'Grady leaves on this mission \nflying this American plane, this F-16. As I indicated last night--I \nwill say this again briefly--I pursued this with some intensity and \ndetail because I wanted to understand from a military point of view \nwhat did the Serbs on the ground who fired that missile at Captain \nO'Grady know about that plane he was flying? What was their knowledge \nand intention as they did that?\n  And the answers I have received from sources that I trust and have \nhigh regard for are, one, that the Serbs in Bosnia on the ground were \noperating as part of a very sophisticated integrated air defense radar \nsystem which actually had been used before the conflict as an air \ntraffic control system for commercial air traffic by the former \nYugoslavia. It extends back to Belgrade, although its parts can stand \non their own, now being used primarily for military purposes.\n  The Bosnian Serbs on the ground saw that plane in the air, one of \nseveral sorties flown. A large number of sorties are flown everyday as \npart of Operation Deny Flight. They had the capacity. They knew that \nthat was an American plane. They could identify it. That is how \nsophisticated their air defense system is and, by the nature of its \nflight \n\n[[Page S 10275]]\npattern, they also knew, because I asked, that it was part of Operation \nDeny Flight and not part of an airstrike mission. There have been \nairstrikes carried out by NATO. They have been very limited. They have \nbeen described as pin-prick airstrikes. They have had some partial \nsuccess. But we never have, in any way, pulled the throttle on the air \npower capacity we have in that region.\n  I asked those who know, ``Was it possible for the Serbs on the \nground, seeing what they had identified as an American plane, an F-16, \nabove to know whether that plane was on an aggressive mission to strike \nfrom the air or whether it was part of what I would call a \nnonaggressive patrol mission to see that Serbian planes had not left \nthe airspace?''\n  The clear response I received was that because of the patterns the F-\n16 was flying, it was absolutely clear that this American plane was \nflying as part of Operation Deny Flight, not on an aggressive mission, \non a patrol mission. Again, if I may use a domestic metaphor here, it \nis as if the police car was going through an area of a town enforcing \nthe curfew and was not on an aggressive mission.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to see the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Roth], here. I will finish this line of argument and yield to him.\n  So the Serbs on the ground, with their fingers on the missiles, \nmissiles that they received from the Russians, that the Serbs from \nBelgrade brought into Bosnia to be at the disposal of the Bosnian \nSerbs, they knew that that F-16 was not on a mission to do them any \nharm. It was patroling, and they intentionally shot that American plane \ndown. It is only by the grace of God and, of course, his own \nextraordinary courage that Captain O'Grady is alive today, through his \nheroism and bravery and the extraordinary capacity of American \nequipment that we have supported in this Chamber--global positioning \nsystems to locate a distress signal at critical moments--picked up by \nAmerican planes, we send in the CH-53 Super Stallion helicopters to \npick him up. They are noticed by Bosnian Serbs and they too are fired \non. Again, an intentional attack on American planes, in this case \nhelicopters.\n  What did we do about it? We did not do anything. We did not do \nanything, I suppose, because the Serbian forces were holding U.N. \npersonnel. I think we should have done something in spite of those \nhostages that were being held, because it seems to me when you allow \npeople to take hostages and hold them and they render you impotent, \nthen they will simply act more outrageously. But an American plane on a \nnonaggressive patrol mission was intentionally shot down by the Serbs.\n  So I offer that as evidence that the war, indeed, has been \nAmericanized. Our soldiers, our pilots flying those missions, the NATO \nsoldiers in U.N. uniforms may think they are noncombatants, but the \nSerbs do not think they are noncombatants. The soldiers have paid the \nprice.\n  Lastly, let me talk about Americanizing the conflict. Let me say, it \nis up to us. We are not going to be drawn into a conflict we do not \nwant to be drawn into. Lift and strike that President Clinton brought \ninto office with him is just that. We have a strategic interest in \nstemming the conflict in Europe. We have a moral mission of protecting \nthe victims from genocide, but we do not really have enough of an \ninterest, nor does the strategic situation demand it or call for it, to \nsend American troops on the ground.\n  We do have enough of an interest in stopping this conflict by using \nallied air power to stem aggression and by giving these people, the \nBosnians, the victims, the opportunity to defend themselves.\n  We are not putting ourselves, if we adopt this, on a slippery slope. \nIt is up to us to make policy. Nothing irretrievably Americanizes this \nconflict. In my opinion, it is a lame excuse and an insult to our \ncapacity to control the course of our behavior to be in opposition to \nS. 21, as amended by amendment No. 1801.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to see three other distinguished \ncolleagues on the floor. I welcome their entrance into this debate. I \nyield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support of S. 21, the \nBosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1995. I do so because I \nregard it as a first step in a more effective strategy to enable the \nBosnian people to exercise the right of self-defense to bring this \nhorrible war and its atrocities to an end and to do so in a way that \nwill, in the long term, reinforce the cohesion of the alliance.\n  Those who argue against this legislation fear that it risks a crisis \nwithin the alliance. They fear it will escalate the conflict and its \natrocities, as well as expand the war into the surrounding regions. The \ntruth is, Mr. President, current policy has already made these fears \ntoday's realities, and with each passing hour, the situation only gets \nworse.\n  First, because of the war, the alliance is already well into its \nworst crisis of cohesion. The current course of events in the Balkan \nwar is only making this acrimony even sharper.\n  Second, the war in Bosnia is escalating. The Serbs have initiated the \nlargest offensive since the beginning of the conflict. Croatian Serbs \nand Serbian regulars have crossed over into Bosnia to support the \nBosnia Serbs. They have declared the United Nation and NATO to be \nenemies. They continue to humiliate and attack U.N. and allied forces \nthat are trying to bring peace and humanitarian assistance to that \nregion.\n  They have shot down an American F-16. We are all witnesses to the \nSerbs' attacks against the safe havens in Bosnia. We are all witnesses \nto the ethnic cleansing now underway, and we cannot dismiss new \nconcentration camps the Serbs are establishing and the new waves of \nrapes and other crimes. Our fears have become reality, and it is now \nnecessary for a new strategy to end this conflict.\n  The emphasis of a new strategy should be to establish a military \nbalance in former Yugoslavia that will induce and sustain a negotiated \nsettlement. Toward this end, I believe the United States should take \nthe following steps:\n  First, the United States Government should notify the United Nation \nand our allies that it favors the withdrawal of the UNPROFOR from \nBosnia, and if the Western alliance is to remain cohesive, we must \nhonor the President's commitment to provide United States forces to \nfacilitate the withdrawal of the UNPROFOR.\n  Second, the United States should help the Bosnia Government attain \nthe military equipment and supplies necessary to defend itself. The \nSerbian Army inherited from the former Yugoslavia a vast superiority in \nmilitary equipment and infrastructure, including large numbers of \ntanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and aircraft. These \nadvantages have been preserved by the current arms embargo against \nBosnia,\n and the Serbs are brutally exploiting these advantages. Even with a \nmore disciplined and larger army in terms of personnel, Sarajevo has \nnot been able to overcome their weakness in equipment and supplies. \nConsidering the Bosnian fighters' demonstrated courage and their will \nto fight, Sarajevo's access to modern arms will help significantly \noffset the Serb advantages in weaponry and logistical support.\n\n  Third, the United States should declare that it will exercise the \nright to utilize its air power in a sustained and strategic manner \nagainst any Serb effort to exploit the UNPROFOR withdrawal and to \nassist the Bosnian military in defending against any Serb offensives. \nThe commitment to employ air power is necessary to prevent further Serb \naggression and massacres. However, the application of American air \npower is not to win the war for the Bosnians, nor should it be \nconstrued as a step toward a commitment of United States ground forces. \nThe war must be fought and won by the Bosnians. The purpose of United \nStates air power would be only to deter further Serb offenses and deny \nthem the advantages they now exploit from their superiority in heavy \ntanks, artillery, and military equipment and infrastructure.\n  These steps will help the Bosnian people to more effectively defend \nthemselves on a strategic level. They would contribute to a more even \ndistribution of military power in the region. That would help deny \naggressors in the war \n\n[[Page S 10276]]\nopportunities and incentives to continue their offenses. Indeed, it \nwould help prompt them to recognize the imperative of achieving a \nnegotiated and peaceful solution to the war.\n  Mr. President, strong congressional support behind S. 21 is \nabsolutely essential. Strong support will communicate to the world \nAmerica's determination not to tolerate the aggression now underway in \nBosnia. It will demonstrate to our European friends and allies that \nAmerica is always ready to live up to its commitments, and that America \nis always prepared and willing to undertake what is necessary to \nestablish and ensure enduring peace and stability in post-cold-war \nEurope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dole-Lieberman \nlegislation. It is an unhappy situation, and there are no good answers. \nWhatever course we take is going to be criticized. What we can do is \nlearn from our mistakes.\n  In 1991, when the aggression first took place, President Bush and the \nadministration should have responded. When Bill Clinton took office, \nhe, after criticizing George Bush during the campaign, should have \nresponded. That is easy for us to say. But what we know is that the \nsituation is deteriorating. If some action is not taken now, it is \ngoing to be worse in a month. And if some action is not taken in a \nmonth, it is going to be worse in 3 months.\n  The great threat to the world today is not nuclear annihilation, as \nit was a decade ago; it is instability, and it is that tyrants \nsomewhere in the world will get the message out of Bosnia that they can \nmove against their neighbors and the community of nations will do \nnothing. The danger in Bosnia, if appropriate action is not taken, is \nthat it is going to spread. It will spread to Macedonia, Bulgaria, \nGreece, and Turkey, and we will have a major problem on our hands. And \nhere what the United States has to do is to show some backbone, some \nmuscle.\n  The community of nations do not question our technical competence. \nYou know, we are increasing defense appropriations as a way to send a \nmessage to the world. That is not going to send a message to the world. \nWhat the world questions right now is our will, our muscle, our \nbackbone. And when I say ``our,'' I am not talking about the members of \nthe Armed Forces; I am talking about the administration, I am talking \nabout the Senate, I am talking about the House.\n  Let me just give an illustration. Suppose in the Chicago Police \nDepartment, or the Los Angeles Police Department, or the New Haven \nPolice Department, people would enlist. But, tragically, as happens in \nevery major city police department, there is a casualty. Would the city \nof Chicago, or Los Angeles, or New Haven announce: Sorry, we have some \ndrug dealers here who killed a Chicago policeman, we are going to \nabandon that portion of Chicago, or Los Angeles, or New Haven because \nof a casualty. We would recognize that to do that invites more trouble, \ntragic as the casualty is.\n  Yet, that is what we did in Somalia. I read in editorials about the \ndisaster of Somalia. Real candidly, George Bush's finest hour was when \nhe had the courage to send our troops there, and we saved hundreds of \nthousands of lives. And then a decision was made by a retired American \nadmiral to go after General Aideed--frankly, a decision that should \nhave been made--after consultation with Ambassador Oakley and others. \nBut a mistake was made. Nineteen Americans lost their lives, including \none who we saw on television being dragged around the streets, and that \nshocked and stunned all of us. Immediately, there were calls for the \nUnited States to get out of Somalia. And we understand that. We do not \nlike casualties. But we have to recognize that if we are going to have \nstability in the world, those who enlist in armed forces, like those \nwho enlist in the Chicago Police Department, are taking additional \nrisks. And the risk we cannot take is having a world of instability.\n  After the uproar here in Congress on Somalia, there was a meeting at \nthe White House, about a 2-hour meeting, with about 20 of us, as I \nrecall. A decision was made that by the following March 31, we would \npull out all American troops. It was not an agreement I liked, but it \nwas better than pulling out American troops immediately. And that was \nthe sense of this body at that point. Shortly after that decision was \nmade and announced, President Mubarak of Egypt visited the United \nStates. He was in the Blair House. I, at that point, chaired the \nSubcommittee on Africa. I went down to visit President Mubarak, who was \nchairman of the Organization for African Unity at that point. Just \nbefore I went down, I received a call from someone in the White House--\nnot the President--saying, ``Could you ask President Mubarak to keep \nhis troops there longer than March 31?'' I made the request--without \ndisclosing a private conversation--and it would not surprise any of you \nto learn that President Mubarak was not impressed that the most \npowerful nation in the world and the richest nation in the world said \nwe were getting out of Somalia, but we would like their troops to stay. \nWe did not show determination or fortitude.\n  Senator Nunn is going to have an amendment which will make clear, if \nit is adopted, that the U.S. Senate backs, if this amendment is adopted \nand troops are withdrawn, we have pledged we will use up to 25,000 \ntroops to pull the U.N. forces out.\n  Frankly, I think if that happens and arms are supplied, there will \nhave to be air cover for the Bosnian Government. This is not going to \nbe a risk-free operation. There will be calls on this floor, once there \nare casualties, to pull out, to stop.\n  I think here we have to show the determination and the muscle and the \nwill that recognizes the great threat to the world through today's \ninstability. Bosnia can be a spreading disease. We have to get a hold \nof this thing.\n  I think the Dole-Lieberman proposal is a sensible proposal. It is not \nrisk-free. There are no good answers. There are only two answers right \nhere: One is to go in with substantial military muscle; or follow the \nDole-Lieberman proposal and let the people of Bosnia defend themselves.\n  I do not believe there is the will--not just on the part of the \nUnited States, but on the part of other governments--to take the first \nalternative. I do not know whether that would be a realistic \nalternative also.\n  No one can guarantee that this is going to work, that this will \npreserve the Bosnian Government. We have to send a message to tyrants \nin Asia, Latin America, Europe, everywhere in the world, you cannot \nmove against your neighbors and bring about world instability. The \ncommunity of nations will respond. We have to respond.\n  I think this is a well-crafted proposal. I intend to support it. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator \nfrom Illinois for some very thoughtful, and I believe, sound comments. \nI find myself in agreement, Senator, with virtually everything that the \nSenator said.\n  I also thank the Senator from Connecticut for what has not been easy \nfor someone on our side of the aisle, to take this level of leadership \non the issue. I heard the Senator last night so eloquently put forward \nthese facts.\n  Perhaps, in 1878, Benjamin Disraeli said it best when he offered \nthese words in the British House of Lords:\n\n       No language can describe adequately the condition of that \n     large portion of the Balkan peninsula--Serbia, Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina and other provinces--[the] political intrigues, \n     constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit . . \n     . hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions and \n     absence of any controlling power . . . nothing short of an \n     army of 50,000 of the best troops would produce anything like \n     order in these parts.\n\n  And that was said 117 years ago.\n  We know that when Marshal Tito governed what was known as Yugoslavia, \nthe strong central control kept down these 100-year-old animosities. \nToday, they have boiled to the point of no return.\n  Many have characterized UNPROFOR as a complete failure. I believe \nthat exaggerates the case. After all, there has been a dramatic \ndecrease in civilian casualties in Bosnia--from 130,000 in 1992 down to \n3,000 in 1994. UNPROFOR deserves much of the credit for this decrease. \nHowever, it is undeniable that UNPROFOR has major shortcomings that \nhave been exposed with increasing regularity. \n\n[[Page S 10277]]\n\n  We saw it on May 25, in Tuzla, a so-called U.N. safe-area, when 71 \nyoung people, all under age 28, were killed by a single Serb shell--one \nof many instances when Serb forces have eroded safe areas with \nattacks--without any retaliation, despite a U.N. Security Council \nresolution authorizing such responses.\n  We saw it when 377 U.N. troops were taken hostage in June after a \nNATO airstrike on a Serb ammunition dump.\n  We saw it when Capt. Scott O'Grady's F-16 was shot down without a \nresponse, as scores of U.N. hostages were still held captive.\n  We see it every day, as U.N. peacekeepers attempt to protect innocent \ncivilians, sometimes successfully, but often not.\n  And we saw it on June 10, when the U.N. mission in Sarajevo announced \nit would not respond to protect Moslem enclaves from attack without the \nconsent of the Bosnian Serbs--the attackers.\n  I believe it is fair to say that U.N. forces have neither the \nmandate, the training, the equipment, nor the rules of engagement, to \nallow them to respond sufficiently to attacks against them or against \ncivilian populations. They are meant to be observers to keep corridors \nfor humanitarian aid open--not fighters.\n  These problems have taken their toll on public and congressional \nsupport for the present course. And they have taken their toll, I think \nunfairly, on support for UNPROFOR troops.\n  In Congress, there has been continuing debate over whether a \nunilateral or a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo against \nBosnia, or the withdrawal of UNPROFOR troops altogether is the humane \nor the inhumane action to take. And because the United States has no \ntroops on the ground in Bosnia, we have less leverage in influencing \nnations that do have troops on the ground.\n  But during the past week, events have reached a terrible watershed, \nand we have seen a startling and devastating turn: The three Eastern \nenclaves, Srebrenica, Zepa, and Gorazde, are falling to Serb \naggression. Ethnic cleansing has taken a giant step forward.\n  Mr. President, 42,000 civilians from this area of Srebrenica have \nbeen separated from their families, and many of them are at this moment \nstill being held hostage in a stadium in nearby Bratunac up here. \nLiterally, thousands of refugees from Srebrenica remain unaccounted \nfor, perhaps up to 20,000. We have heard ominous stories of women being \ntaken hostage and raped, of summary executions, and of bodies lining \nthe nearby roads.\n  A second safe area, Zepa, with some 16,000 Bosnian residents, is in \nthe process of being overrun. Today, it is reported in the Los Angeles \nTimes that Bosnian Government soldiers have said, they would use the 65 \nUkrainian peacekeepers in Zepa as human shields against Serb attacks \nunless the United Nations called in NATO air power. What we see is that \nnow the Bosnian forces are beginning to use the Serb tactics of taking \nhostages.\n  It has been shocking to see the ease with which these areas have and \nare falling. Dozens of U.N. observation posts have been abandoned, \nleaving unarmed Bosnian Moslems to try to defend themselves.\n  The third area, Gorazde, will be next, unless there is a will to use \nmajor airstrikes. Airstrikes were successfully employed in April 1994, \nto prevent a Serb invasion of Gorazde. However, such airstrikes are now \nmade unlikely by the fear that Bosnian Serb forces will retaliate by \ntaking more U.N. troops hostage. UNPROFOR weapons and equipment in the \nsafe areas are being taken by Bosnians and used to fight the Serbs \nsince the world has decided that the Bosnians cannot arm themselves.\n  This past weekend, I opened the New York Times, and saw photographs \nof elderly refugees in wheelbarrows, being wheeled over rough roads. I \nsaw sobbing mothers and children. I also saw this picture. To me, it \nwas a call for change.\n  I do not know this 20-year-old woman's name. She was a refugee from \nSrebrenica, and as she neared Tuzla, where the first camp was set up, \nthis young woman decided she could not go on. She climbed a tree, tied \na rope around her neck, and jumped. A photographer captured the image \nof her lifeless body hanging from the tree.\n  It is an image that haunts us. We do not know what humiliations and \ndeprivations this woman suffered. Perhaps she saw a loved one killed. \nPerhaps she had been raped. Perhaps she simply could not bear the pain \nof being forced out of her home.\n  We only know that she could take no more. We only know that finally, \nthe pain was too great. We only know that she could not endure any more \nsuffering, any more indignity, any more barbarism. This was the act of \na defenseless, vulnerable, beaten person. It was not the act of someone \nwho had the ability to fight in self-defense.\n  Just as the anonymous white-shirted young man facing down a column of \ntanks in Tiananmen Square a few years ago conveyed the unspeakable \nmessage of oppression to the world, so did this photograph point \neloquently to the world's failure in Bosnia.\n  The conscience of Europe and America must examine and reverse this \nterrible downhill slide now.\n  As the distinguished majority leader said yesterday at the beginning \nof this debate:\n\n       This debate is not just about Bosnia. This is not just \n     about a small European country under attack. This debate is \n     about American leadership and American principles, about NATO \n     strength and credibility, and about our place in history.\n\n  I have been a supporter of this administration's policy to this \npoint, but recently certain things have been made clear:\n  First, the involved allied powers have stood against ethnic \ncleansing, and yet ethnic cleansing is taking place unabated on a \ncontinuing basis, as an unrelenting Serb military is allowed to rape, \nmaim, and kill innocent people who cannot defend themselves, and whose \nmilitary the world's powers are preventing from gaining access to \nsufficient arms.\n  Although the Bosnian Government forces have a significant manpower \nadvantage over the Serbs, they face more than a 3-to-1 disadvantage in \ntanks, more than a 2-to-1 disadvantage in artillery, and a nearly 3-to-\n1 disadvantage in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\n  Second, UNPROFOR's well-intentioned--and in some parts of the country \nsuccessful--efforts have been shattered by a mandate that does not let \nthem fight back, but has allowed them to be taken hostage, and allows \ntheir weaponry and equipment to be taken from them.\n  Third, beginning this past weekend, we have seen the fall of one of \nso-called safe areas; this week--the likely fall of a second; and \nshortly--the probable loss of third. With 70 percent of Bosnia in Serb \nhands, we must conclude that the present course needs to be changed.\n  I agree with those who have argued that the Dole-Lieberman resolution \nis not perfect. It probably will offend allies we do not want to, and \nshould not, offend. It may contribute to an escalation of the war, and \nit may increase the likelihood that U.S. troops will be deployed to \nhelp UNPROFOR withdraw.\n  But I believe this resolution, in the absence of any other viable \ncourse of action, has one overriding redeeming value: It will establish \nunequivocally that the U.S. Senate believes that an afflicted and \ndecimated people should be able to defend themselves.\n  Let me just give an example of the effects of the arms embargo. \nEarlier this week, I met with the Bosnian Foreign Minister in my \noffice. He explained to me that despite their lack of heavy weapons, \nthe Bosnian Government forces, who outnumber Bosnian Serb forces, have \nimproved their battlefield performance in recent months. But, according \nto the Foreign Minister, the Bosnian troops still suffer a lot of \ncasualties, the vast majority of which are fatal shrapnel wounds to the \nhead.\n  Why is this significant? Because the arms embargo prevents the \nBosnian Government from buying helmets for its forces. Helmets--one of \nthe most essential pieces of equipment a soldier can have. And without \nthem, many Bosnian soldiers are dying from shrapnel wounds to the head.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have tried to learn \nas much as possible, to listen to and be advised by the experts. But I \nhave not yet seen any viable plan to deal with and prevent the imminent \ntaking of Gorazde.\n  This weekend, the United States will confer with its NATO allies in \nEurope \n\n[[Page S 10278]]\non this situation. This meeting, in my view, is key and critical, and I \nhope that a course of action and a change of mandate will be presented. \nIt is my hope that those attending these meetings will think about a \nscenario which could create an incentive for the parties to agree to a \nlast cease-fire and cooling off period for a specific period of time, \nperhaps 3 to 6 months. The cease-fire would be enforced by three \npowers, using NATO troops under NATO command, employing aggressive air \nstrikes to deter violations. The three powers would obviously be \nFrance, Britain, and the United States.\n  During the cease-fire, UNPROFOR troops and Moslem civilians would be \nallowed to safely evacuate the remaining indefensible--termed by the \nexperts, everyone I have talked to, as indefensible--eastern enclave \nwithout interference, and be relocated to safe areas of Bosnian \nGovernment territory in central Bosnia or elsewhere.\n  At the same time, UNPROFOR troops could be reconfigured to only those \nareas where they can protect themselves and others, and carry out their \nmission of keeping open humanitarian aid corridors and facilitating the \ndistribution of aid.\n  But one thing is clear. If UNPROFOR is to remain in Bosnia at all, \ntheir mandate and their mission must be changed. They must be able to \ndefend themselves and fight back under a clear, decisive and expedited \nfield command.\n  In return, during the cessation of hostilities, the Bosnian \nGovernment, the Bosnian Serbs, and the Croats must agree to one last \neffort to negotiate a fair apportionment of disputed lands.\n  If an agreement on land apportionment is not reached by the end of \nthe cease-fire period, Britain, France, and the United States would \nagree to lift the arms embargo multilaterally.\n  Throughout this period, economic sanctions would be maintained and \nstrengthened where possible against Serbia, with the understanding that \nthey will not be lifted until a settlement in Bosnia is reached.\n  Perhaps--I say ``perhaps''--a scenario like this could have merit. I \npresented it last Thursday night to the Secretary of State, I presented \nit to the minority leader, and I have discussed it with the majority \nleader. I do not know whether it has merit. But I do know that in the \nabsence of any other course of action, people must be able to defend \nthemselves. And in the absence of any other constructive, precise, and \nwell-defined effort, it will be my intention to vote for the Lieberman-\nDole resolution.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to the very eloquent, very moving, \nand very strong remarks of my colleague and friend from California, \nSenator Feinstein. I appreciate very much the history that she told, \nthe obvious concern and frustration that she expressed for the failure \nof the current policy, the haunting picture of a 20-year-old woman \nhanging from a tree, a victim of suicide for reasons that we do not \nknow. But speaking for all of us of what happens when you leave a \npeople defenseless, women defenseless, perhaps she was raped, perhaps \nshe was separated from her family, or perhaps her husband or loved one \nwas carted off with other young Bosnian males, young men; whatever. It \nis that picture, and so many others, that will haunt us as the \nindication and evidence and proof of the failure of the current policy \nand the effect of the current policy.\n  I heard somebody speaking on one of the television programs today \nagainst lifting the arms embargo, a spokesperson for the \nadministration, saying something that has been said over and over \nagain, which is that, if we lift the arms embargo, it will lead to more \nbloodshed. How much more bloodshed could there be? Over 200,000 killed, \n2 million-plus refugees, and the conflict goes on; one side with arms \nwilling to take whatever action is necessary, violating all rules of \ninternational morality, with its leaders today the subject of an \ninternational inquiry at The Hague as to whether they are war \ncriminals--Milosevic, Karadzic, Mladic, the whole crew.\n  So will lifting the arms embargo lead to more bloodshed? None of us \ncan say it will not. It may lead to more bloodshed. It may lead to the \nshedding for the first time in any significant degree of Serbian blood. \nAnd until that happens, the Serbs, in by opinion, will not accept the \npeace at the peace table that the Bosnians could possibly accept. They \nwill only seek unconditional surrender and the continuing death and \ntorture of the Bosnian Moslems.\n  I appreciate the sincerity of my colleague from California in \nsuggesting the possibility of an alternate course here, a last chance, \na 3- to 6-month period in which both sides, the Bosnian Serbs, Bosnia \nand Serbia, be given a chance to negotiate a peace, after which, if \nthere is failure, the arms embargo will be lifted multilaterally.\n  I appreciate the sincerity. I wish that such a policy had any chance \nof working. But I will offer this response to it. In the first place, \ninsofar as part of it involves the movement of the remaining Bosnians \nwho are in the east of Bosnia into the central area of Bosnia around \nSarajevo, which is the relatively secure area, although Sarajevo \ncontinues to be shelled, unfortunately, it yields ground to the \nSerbians, which is exactly what they want. They want the greater \nSerbia, and eastern Bosnia.\n  But more to the point, every peace offer that has been made by any \ncredible authority, including most significantly the contact group, the \ninternational five-nation group that made the peace offer of 51 percent \nto the Serbs, the remainder to the Bosnians, 20 percent less than the \nBosnians had at the beginning of the war before they were defenseless \nvictims of aggression, the Bosnians accepted it; the Serbs did not. \nThat has been the course of every peace offer made.\n  The Serbs are not accepting terms of peace because they are running \nwillfully, wantonly, brutally throughout the country and nobody is \nmaking them suffer. When outlaws are allowed to commit illegal acts, \nthe worst illegal acts--theft of land, eviction of people, rape, \nmurder, slaughter, separation of families--they will continue to do it \nbecause nobody stops them. We know that here in our own country. That \nis why we are all supportive of stronger law enforcement.\n  So they continue to do that. They are not going to accept the peace. \nThey have not accepted any peace. If I had one shred of hope that they \nwould, I would say it was worth trying to pursue some opportunity to \ngive them that.\n  Let me add this, that any terms they would accept are unacceptable to \nthe Bosnians, and none of us in the exercise of fairness would ask the \nBosnians to accept. They have taken enough abuse. They have suffered \nenough. It is not for the international community at the point of a \nSerbian gun to force the Bosnians to accept the decimation of their \ncountry. They have already accepted every reasonable or not so \nreasonable peace plan they have been given.\n  So I wish I could have some hope for the prospects of yet another \ncease-fire and a chance for negotiation. But at every turn the Serbs \nhave not only rejected the suggestions; they have deceived us. They \nhave tricked us. They have talked while preparing to attack. And the \nBosnians and the United Nations and NATO and the United States have \nbeen the victims.\n  And finally, so far as the suggestion made--and again I respect it \nand I know it is made in good faith and with a sense of hope--that at \nthe end of the 6-month period Britain and France and the United States \nwould multilaterally lift the arms embargo, I see no indication that \nour allies and friends in Europe are prepared to commit to that.\n  So, Mr. President, again I note the presence in the Chamber of \ncolleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if he would be \ninterested in entering into a little bit of a colloquy maybe simply \nbecause we all come to the floor and the debate seems to pass by itself \nin a way. I think it would be helpful if we could talk through it a \nlittle bit. \n\n[[Page S 10279]]\n\n  I ask my colleague if it is his judgment that withdrawing UNPROFOR \nand lifting the embargo, which is essentially the heart of what is in \nthe Senator's amendment, constitutes the policy of choice? Is that what \nwe as a country and we as Senators want to put forward as our first \nchoice policy here, to simply say that if the President of Bosnia says \nUNPROFOR get out, we lift the embargo, or if UNPROFOR is out, we lift \nthe embargo?\n  My question is, is there not really a precursor to that, which is in \neffect a policy that wants to prevent the safe areas from being \novertaken, a policy that wants to prevent women from being raped as a \nmatter of war strategy, a policy that wants to guarantee the delivery \nof humanitarian assistance? Is that not rather the policy of choice for \na great nation and a Western civilization, a free people?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in responding to my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts, this is not the first choice, but it is \nthe choice that is offered in the context of the failure of the other \nchoices that have been made, the other choices that have done damage \nand been inconsistent with the policy of a free people and a great \nnation and have done extraordinary damage not only to the Bosnian \npeople but to the rule of law.\n  The policy that this proposal advocates, lifting the embargo and \nstriking from the air, is the policy that President Clinton brought \ninto office with him in 1993, that our allies in Europe opposed, and \nthen the policy was changed.\n  So, of course, if the United Nations had played any role other than \npassing resolutions--and I say to my friend, it is my personal judgment \nthat the United Nations has suffered terribly in this conflict because \nit has been misused and its soldiers, brave soldiers, have been \nmisused.\n  When did the United Nations go in? It went in after the aggression of \nthe Serbs became clear and the first wave of terrible atrocities became \nvisible to the world, when the concentration camps were seen by British \ntelevision and sent around the world. Camps that were operated by the \nSerbs with the Moslems: the haunting pictures, the echoes of the Second \nWorld War, emaciated bodies, stories of mass slaughter, rape, all the \nrest.\n  The Western Powers could not sit by when that happened, but instead \nof being forceful, lifting the arms embargo, striking from the air at \nminimal risk to Western personnel, they threw in the United Nations, on \na presumably humanitarian mission, and gave them no weapons with which \nto defend themselves, and were not willing to stand by the resolutions \nthat were adopted subsequently by the United Nations to deny flight, to \nprotect safe areas.\n  And what have we had? Sadly, we have had the United Nations serving \nnot as a guarantor of peace and security for the Bosnian people but \nnow, not for a day, not for a month, but for 3 years being a cover for \nSerbian aggression. And every time we have begun to get up some \nbackbone here to strike back at the Serbs for killing people, for \nshooting down American planes, for taking U.N. personnel hostage, they \nhave just taken more hostages and said if you strike back at us, we \nwill kill your personnel, and we have walked away. We have moved to the \nback.\n  So I say to my friend from Massachusetts, policy of choice? We are \nlate in the game. We are late in the day in Bosnia. If in 1991 and \n1992, when the Serbs moved into Slovenia and then Croatia and Bosnia, \nthe world had drawn a line and said: end of the cold war instability or \nnot, do not think you can march now and not pay a price for it. We did \nnot and as a result we have paid a price.\n  I say to my friend, policy of choice? Let us listen to the victims. \nLet us listen to the people of Bosnia who have said through us, through \ntheir elected representatives over and over again, the United Nations \nis not helping us; it is hurting us. Get them out of here. Give us the \nweapons with which to defend ourselves. Please, help us from the air to \nstrike at Serbian targets until we can make this a fair fight.\n  Mr. KERRY. There is nothing in this amendment about strike.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No, there is not.\n  Mr. KERRY. There is nothing in here about strike. This amendment is \nexclusively what you do if you withdraw. I respectfully suggest to my \nfriend from Connecticut, I agree with everything he just said. \nEverything he just said is a wonderful statement of what is wrong with \nour current policy. The question is, is this a replacement for that \npolicy? And I respectfully suggest to my friend this is not a policy. \nThis is the last step. This is the last step. If the President of \nBosnia says UNPROFOR out, under the law UNPROFOR has to get out. So \nabsolutely, unequivocally, I suppose you have no choice morally but to \nlift the embargo then because you cannot keep an embargo against some \npeople while the others have weapons to kill them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is just what we have done for 3 years.\n  Mr. KERRY. But that does not mean we ought to continue to do that \ntoday. If the policy of choice as the Senator has acknowledged is to \nstand up, then I ask the question, why do we not stand up today?\n Sarajevo has not yet fallen. Gorazde has not yet fallen. Zepa may \nfall. It is in the process. Are we so weak, are we so without guts and \npolicy that we are going to come in here and ratify an amendment that \neffectively says if the Bosnian President says, ``Get out,'' or \nUNPROFOR is out, is that all we have to offer in the United States \nSenate, an epitaph rather than a policy?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I answer my friend from Massachusetts, he asks, are we \nso weak? Do we so lack guts? Do we have no policy that this is the \nalternative? And I say to my friend, look at the history of the last 3 \nyears. And all you will see is weakness, lack of policy, and no guts. \nAnd who has paid for it?\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend, I am not the prisoner of the history \nof the last 3 years. I hope he is not. I do not think the U.S. Senate--\n--\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I must take into account the history of the last 3 \nyears. At every moment we have brought this proposal up again--Is this \nthe first step? It was the first step that President Clinton brought \ninto office with him and our allies with Europe frustrated with its \nimplementation.\n  So I say to my friend, obviously we have to look at the history. I \nsay this with respect to my friend from Massachusetts. I know he speaks \nwith sincerity. At every point that the option was given to the Senate, \nto the House, to the administration, to the Western allies to lift the \nembargo, stop this immoral refusal to let these people defend \nthemselves, use air power to help them resist aggression, there has \nalways been another excuse for delay.\n  And so, respectfully, when my friend comes in today and says, is this \nthe replacement for policy--this is what we have been crying out for \nfor more than 3 years. And it is time to stop finding excuses for not \nat least giving these people the opportunity to defend themselves. If I \nhad any confidence that there would be a stronger Western policy, I \nwould listen--although I would still push forward--but, respectfully, \nthe voices that I hear are not the voices telling me to delay. The \nvoices I hear are the voices of the Bosnian people who have suffered as \na result of just what you have used, the words you have used: weakness, \nlack of guts, and lack of policy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Right now, all right in the newspapers, the British, \nthe French, and our administration are not agreeing on an alternative \npolicy.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree. But therein lies the question of leadership and \nof resolution, not, it seems to me, in a sort of final statement of \nwhat you do if nothing else can happen. It seems to me my friend--I \nthink we are talking the same language but coming at it from a \ndifferent point. My sense is that the problem has not been the defined \ngoal of UNPROFOR. The problem has been the implementation of that goal, \nthe dual-key requirements for airstrikes, the absolute ineffectiveness \nof the troops on the ground who are armed not to fight back or to \nenforce most anything but are really so lightly armed as to be \ninvitations to be taken hostage.\n  The question I think the U.S. Senate ought to be asking itself more \nappropriately is not what do we do to wash our hands of this situation, \nwhich, incidentally, is more complicated than that. And I think the \nSenator from Connecticut knows that. He is one of \n\n[[Page S 10280]]\nthe clearest thinkers in the U.S. Senate. If the Bosnian President can \neffectively say, OK, I want UNPROFOR out, and the Senate now passes a \nresolution saying one of the circumstances under which we will lift the \nembargo will be if the President of Bosnia says, UNPROFOR, get out, \nwell, the President is pledged to put 25,000 American troops on the \nground in order to help UNPROFOR get out. If I were the President of \nBosnia, and I were kind of backed up against the wall, I might just \nthink of saying to myself, ``Boy, how do I get the United States over \nhere?''\n  So, he says, ``UNPROFOR get out.'' All of a sudden there are 25,000 \ntroops in Bosnia. And then you might just want to--I can remember, you \nknow, from the days of being in Vietnam, when the North Vietnamese \nwould dress up like South Vietnamese and attack other people. I can \nwell imagine Moslems putting on the uniforms of the Serbs and attacking \nAmericans and drawing the United States into retaliation against the \nSerbs, or making it extremely difficult for America to get out in a way \nthat then entangles us. I mean, why give the President of Bosnia the \nchoice of putting 25,000 American troops on the ground in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask----\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me finish. It seems to me the Senator from Connecticut \nand all of us ought to be defining for the country and the world what \nis at stake here. Pope John Paul said it the other day, that the world \nis watching, you know, that civilization is standing by and \nexperiencing a great defeat. To the best of my historical recollection, \nmost of what World War II and World War I were about are principles \nthat are fundamentally involved here.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that they rise to the level of threat that \nwe ought to put American troops on the ground. I have never said that. \nI believe this is fundamentally the backyard of Europe, with respect to \na localized kind of action, and they have got to bear the brunt on the \nground. And the French have indicated a willingness to do that. The \nBritish seem to be dragging. But one of the reasons they are dragging \nis that we are not indicating our willingness to be sufficiently \nsupportive with respect to air power and other things.\n  Now, I will tell you something. I think we ought to say that the \nUnited States of America is prepared to run the risk of putting \nAmerican air people at risk, in harm's way, in the effort to back up \nour allies on the ground sufficiently to be guaranteeing only one \nthing--a minimalist capacity to deliver humanitarian assistance and \nguarantee safe areas.\n  Now, if the Western World and civilization cannot come together \naround the notion that a safe area is a safe area and we ought to stand \nup for it, and if we cannot come up around the notion that the basic \nlaws of warfare ought to be adhered to, and if we are going to walk \naway in the face of thugism, we will ignore the lessons of history and \ninvite future confrontation and future questions about our leadership \nand so forth.\n  I think the Senator agrees with that. So the issue here is, why not \nchange the rules of engagement? Why not pull this away from the dual-\nkey of the United Nations? Why not create a structure where the United \nStates can control its destiny with its allies and not be subject to \nthe politics of Mr. Akashi and Mr. Boutros-Ghali? Why not do what we \neffectively did in Desert Storm, where we ran the show or undertook \nthat responsibility, and stand up for something before we turn around \nand say that all we can do is wash our hands and allow people to get \nweapons several months from now, when in the intervening months the \nSerbs will very clearly use the time? And if you think you have seen \nbloodshed and refugees on CNN in the last few days, wait until you see \nwhat happens on that course of policy.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if there had been any indication over \nthe last 3 years that there was the kind of resolve and willingness to \nstand up against aggression that the Senator from Massachusetts \ndescribes, my response would be more open than it is. The fact is that \nwe have gone through more than 3 years in which the United Nations has \nacted with weakness and has been a cover for Serbian aggression against \nthe Moslem people. We have acted for 3 years pursuant to a policy that \nhas lacked purpose and force in such a way that we have demeaned the \ngreatest military alliance in the history of the world, NATO, and \nraised questions about its continued viability. And we have diminished \nourselves, the United States, the greatest power in the world.\n  Mr. President, if I had any hope--and I would like to still have \nhope--that the United Nations' mission in the specific areas that the \nSenator from Massachusetts refers to, protecting the safe areas, \ngetting the humanitarian assistance in, would be fortified, I would be \nglad to see that happen. I would be glad to see that happen. But it \nwould not be for me an excuse not to end this immoral embargo.\n  How can we justify that for more than 3 years now we have imposed an \nembargo that, incidentally, is Milosevic's embargo? He called for it in \n1991. Why? Because he knew he had plenty of tanks and personnel \ncarriers and planes and weapons. And we went along in naive good faith \nthat was somehow to stop the conflict from breaking out, and with every \npassing week and month as the conflict went on and the Serbs took more \nland and kicked more people out of their homes and killed and raped and \ntortured more people and put them in concentration camps, we continued \nto enforce that embargo.\n  May I say, after those 3 years of history, it ill behooves us to \nraise any questions about the motivation of the leaders of Bosnia, to \nsuggest that we not lift the arms embargo or not give them the right to \nhave some say in determining when they think the U.N. mission has ended \nall purpose for them and impute that somehow this is their intent to \ntrap us into this----\n  Mr. KERRY. Why----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excuse me. They have been asking for 3\\1/2\\ years that \nwe give them weapons to defend themselves, long before there was ever \nany talk of American troops. As a matter of fact, at every point, the \nBosnians have said, ``We don't want American soldiers on the ground. We \nhave plenty of soldiers. We just don't have weapons.''\n  So I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, respectfully, this is not \nthe hour to speak against this proposal on the basis of either what the \nUnited Nations might do, after its sorry record of the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, or to speak against it, because it finally gives one ear to the \nvictims of this aggression, the direct victims, the Bosnians, or to \nimpute cynical motives to them in this.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, if this is not the moment to talk \nabout why this is an incomplete policy, then what is? I mean, the fact \nis that the President has not to this day asked UNPROFOR to leave. The \nPresident of Bosnia has not said, ``Get out of here.''\n  So, of course, they are asking to lift the embargo. The best of all \nworlds is to keep UNPROFOR and have no embargo. I understand that, and \nso does the Senator. But the Senator also understands why he has not \nasked UNPROFOR to get out, because UNPROFOR has reduced the number of \ndeaths, because UNPROFOR has provided some safety and succor. And the \nquestion is not whether we ought to now trigger the absolute certainty \nof UNPROFOR being withdrawn, the question is whether or not we ought to \nmake it work.\n  I totally agree with the Senator's complaints about the weakness and \nthe unfairness and the total inconsistency of this equation of the last \nyears. It has been horrendous.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Then why does the Senator not support the lifting of \nthe arms embargo? How can the Senator justify that?\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend, because it is a half solution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It has always been a half solution, but we have given \nthem no hope, no solution.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am prepared to suggest there is hope, and we should \noffer it. I am prepared to suggest there is a precursor policy to what \nthe Senator is offering. The Senator is offering something I would vote \nfor if it was the final step. I do not believe we have reached the \nfinal step, because I have not given up on the notion that Sarajevo and \nGorazde and safe areas could \n\n[[Page S 10281]]\nbe preserved. I think that is a two-bit tinhorn bunch of thugs that \nmake up an army, and the reason they have been able to kick people \naround that country is because the blue helmets have been lightly armed \nand have, basically, been targets for hostage taking and because we--\nwe--have been consistently trying to have a no-risk policy.\n  There is no such thing as a no-risk policy in Bosnia or anywhere. \nWhen you put on the uniform of the United States military, you assume \nthe possibility of going to fight. Ever since Vietnam, we have been a \ncountry that has been unwilling to understand that risk and scared to \ntake it in certain situations. President Bush went through \nextraordinary hoops with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a remarkable \nseries of steps, and with great leadership, I will add, to put together \na capacity for this country to recognize its interests and send people \ninto harm's way.\n  President Reagan did it in Grenada. President Bush did it again in \nSomalia. President Clinton did it in Haiti. You put on the uniform, \nthere is a risk. I hate to say it, it is a tragedy, but we lose young \npeople for merely the putting on of the uniform. Every month, every \nweek in a training accident, in a catapult that does not work correctly \non an aircraft. That is a risk.\n  I believe that the defense of NATO, I believe that the principles \nthat are at stake here have been, for the whole 3 years that the \nSenator has said, rightfully on the table and it has been too long in \nproperly coming to this Chamber to be articulated.\n  But my sense is that I think the Senator has a correct statement. If \nthe President did say get out, of course you would lift the embargo. If \nUNPROFOR is out, of course you would lift the embargo, but that is not \na policy. That is truly a final statement of where you are when all \nelse is exhausted, and this Senator does not believe all else is \nexhausted, because UNPROFOR is still there, because we are still here, \nbecause the French are prepared to fight and because we should all \nstand up and offer the leadership that suggests that Pope John Paul is \nnot going to be proven correct, that civilization is just going to \nstand aside and accept a defeat.\n  I do not think we need to do that, I say to the Senator from \nConnecticut, and I think we ought to stand up and assert the rights--\nlook, if we cannot assert the notion that humanitarian aid is going to \nbe delivered, and if we cannot assert the notion that women and \nchildren are not going to be blown up when they go to a water fountain \nto drink, and that men and women are not going to be blown away like \nclay pipes in a shooting gallery, if we cannot assert those notions, \nwhat are we doing? What are the millions of dollars of NATO for? Who \nare we? If we cannot remember the lessons of World War II only 45 years \nlater, then something is wrong.\n  I suggest, respectfully, that we have the ability to say to the \nSerbs, ``We're not here to mix in your war. If you want to go out there \nin the fields and fight, you go do it, and we're not going to get in \nyour way. But you're not going to rape women and you're not going to \nbreak the laws of warfare and you're not going to kill innocent women \nand children and pick off people in areas that the United Nations and \nthe world has called a safe area.''\n  I agree with the Senator. There is ignominy in the last years. But \nthe admission of that should not bring you to simply say we are going \nto go away and let you guys duke it out in the worst of circumstances.\n  I believe there is a first policy, and the first policy is to try one \nlast time to make this mission work. If it means take it away from the \nUnited Nations, take it away from the United Nations. If it means those \ncountries willing to stand up do it together, then do it that way. But \nwe cannot any longer--I agree with the Senator--we cannot any longer \nremain the prisoners of this extraordinary political, weak, haphazard, \ndamaging policy that is destroying our capacity to control our own \ndestiny and, most important, the destiny of innocent people.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this has been an important colloquy. I \nnote that the Senator from Maine has been on the floor for some period \nof time. I want to yield to him in a moment--both Senators from Maine, \nas a matter of fact.\n  I just want to say finally, in response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, is this a policy, the lift and strike? You bet your life \nit is.\n  Mr. KERRY. There is no strike. There is no strike.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excuse me. We do not need in this resolution to order \na strike. It is unfortunate enough we have to go to a point in a \ncongressional action to try to urge the administration to lift this \nembargo which has put blood on our hands. We can determine--and these \ndiscussions are apparently finally going on with our allies to strike--\nthis is a policy. This is the best policy. In fact, if we had followed \nthis policy of lifting the arms embargo and striking from the air, I am \nconfident that the war would be over today. I am confident that the war \nwould be over today, because the Serbs would have felt some pain, had \nsome fear about what would happen if they continued their aggression, \nand that would have brought them to the peace table and we would have \nhad an agreement.\n  So I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, good luck in your attempt \nto fortify the United Nations and NATO. Good luck in your attempt--\nfinally, after 3 years of temporizing and irresoluteness and mixed \nmessages and consequent suffering by people in Bosnia and for the rest \nof the world, good luck in trying to do that.\n  But that is no excuse for voting against this policy of finally \nlifting the arms embargo, because regardless of what the effect or \nintention of the United Nations is, or NATO, this arms embargo is \nimmoral. It strikes at the most fundamental right that we, as \nindividuals, have, to defend ourselves and our families, as countries \nhave under international law in the charter of the United Nations. It \nis an outrage. So, good luck in strengthening the U.N. mission, if \nthere is any hope in doing that. But it is no excuse for not supporting \nthis proposal, and, unfortunately, because I believe that, I must say \nthis. I do not impugn the motives or the sincerity of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. It is just the latest in a line of arguments and excuses \nfor not lifting the arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friends from Maine for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, earlier this year, I had a chance to \naddress a conference in Munich, Germany, and it dealt principally with \nthe issue that we are still struggling with here today. I will repeat \nsome of the comments that I made during that conference because they \nbear repeating here.\n  I said:\n\n       We have entered a new world of disorder and our inability \n     to formulate coherent policies and strategies to deal with \n     ethnic conflicts and the expansion of NATO membership has led \n     to cross-Atlantic fear, confusion, incoherence and \n     recrimination--a state of affairs not unprecedented for the \n     NATO alliance.\n\n  With respect to Bosnia itself, I observed:\n\n       NATO cannot act unless America leads.\n       America will not lead unless it can persuade the American \n     people that it is imperative for us to do so.\n       The conflict in Bosnia is not perceived to involve American \n     interests that are vital. Rather, it is a quagmire where its \n     inhabitants would rather dig fresh graves than bury old \n     hatreds.\n       The European members of NATO were not willing to wade into \n     the quicksand of ancient rivalries and engage in peacemaking \n     operations so the responsibility was passed to the United \n     Nations, which has fewer divisions than the Pope and none of \n     his moral authority.\n       As a result, we are all bearing witness to the decimation \n     of a nation that was guaranteed protection under the U.N. \n     Charter while the best we can offer is to seek to minimize \n     the bloodshed by denying arms to the victims of aggression.\n\n  So we have a situation where our collective acquiescence to \naggression may be the lesser of two evils. But it is nonetheless the \nparticipation in the evil of ethnic cleansing that we hoped would never \nagain touch the European continent.\n  Well, we are still hesitant to take more aggressive action even \ntoday. I spoke these words in February because the consequences of our \nactions cannot \n\n[[Page S 10282]]\nbe predicted. None of us can predict the full implications of what we \nare to do and not to do here today. But it was the absence of this \npredictability that prevented the development of a consensus.\n  I suggested at that conference that a number of things had to be \ndone--that new leadership is required at the United Nations, and that \nMr. Akashi should be asked to resign immediately. I issued that \nstatement in February. I believe it to be the case, even more so, \ntoday. I also suggested that when a no-fly zone or weapons-exclusion \nzone had been declared, it should be enforced and not allowed to be \nviolated with impunity; no tribute or tolls should be paid by UNPROFOR \nforces to gain passage to help the victims of war; no tolerance should \nbe granted for taking hostages or using them as human shields.\n  If any harm were to come to UNPROFOR forces, we should take out every \nmajor target that allows the Serbs to continue to wage war. That power \nshould be disproportionate to the transgression, and no area in Serbia \nruled out of our bombsight.\n  UNPROFOR should be given the heavy armor necessary to protect its \nforces and achieve its humanitarian mission.\n  That is what I suggested at the time in early February. If we were \nunable to give UNPROFOR--whose troops were trapped in the layers of a \ndisastrous dual-command structure--the authority and firepower to \nachieve these ends, then we should remove the forces before the United \nNations political impotence is allowed to corrode any further the \nintegrity and credibility of NATO.\n  I think the time has long since passed for us to try to strengthen \nUNPROFOR. I might take issue with the statement that UNPROFOR has been \nresponsible for significantly reducing the numbers of casualties. I \nthink the UNPROFOR forces should be celebrated and heralded as the \nheroes that they are for wading into this quicksand, this quagmire of \nconflict--not a peacekeeping mission. There is no peace there. So they \nare truly courageous men and women who have sacrificed their lives in \norder to bring humanitarian relief to those suffering from war.\n  But, Mr. President, it is too late at this point to say that UNPROFOR \nshould be beefed up, should be given a military role that it has yet to \nbe provided with. I think that time has long since passed.\n  I was at the briefing yesterday, when Secretary Warren Christopher \ncame before the Republican conference policy lunch, along with General \nShalikashvili. I listened with care, because I have also had doubts in \nterms of the consequences of any action we might take. I listened to \nwhat they criticized would be the result of the Dole-Lieberman \nresolution. They said, First, it would cause the immediate withdrawal \nof UNPROFOR, with a huge flood of refugees; second, it would \nAmericanize the war; third, the United States obviously has a lot at \nstake in U.N. resolutions; fourth, it would increase the expansion of \nthe war. General Shalikashvili indicated that the passage of the Dole \nresolution would make life more difficult for UNPROFOR, and the \nwithdrawal operation would also be made more difficult. I think those \nare fair observations.\n  I asked the questions: What would the administration's policy now do? \nWho would be in control of this beefed-up UNPROFOR mission? Would it be \nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali? Would it be Mr. Akashi, whose \nleadership, I think, has been in doubt? Who would order the airstrikes? \nWho would pick the targets? Who would decide whether the sites were too \ndangerous to hit, and that it might provoke Serbian response? Who would \ntransport the French troops to the regions they now seek to reinforce?\n  What is the Russian role in all of this? We know that the Russians \nhistorically have been supportive of the Serbs. What has been their \nrole to date? What would be their role in the future? What is the state \nof negotiations that have taken place behind closed doors at diplomatic \nlevels between Russian negotiators or representatives and our own State \nDepartment?\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I did not hear a satisfactory response. I \nheard statements of ambiguity, of doubt--no real clear direction of \nwhether or not we would be in charge. I heard statements made like: \nWell, no longer will we have the disastrous dual-structure arrangement; \nthat is something that would be under the control of the United States. \nI have not seen evidence of that before. When the forces on the ground \nhave requested military assistance, they have been overruled. Each time \nwe have promised to provide airstrikes, we have done so in the most \nminimalist of ways--creating a large 20-foot crater at an airstrip \nwhich could then be filled in within a matter of 20 or 30 minutes. The \noption of destroying aircraft on the ground was precluded because that \nmight be too provocative.\n  So I have yet to hear a clearly enunciated strategy coming from the \nadministration on exactly what the proposal is. The administration has \nwarned that Senator Dole's proposal would Americanize the war in \nBosnia.\n This is the greatest fear of the administration, and the greatest hope \non the part of some in Europe who are looking to shift the blame to the \nUnited States for failed policies.\n\n  At the same time, I might point out that the administration is \nconsidering using U.S. forces to reinforce Gorazde--using helicopters \nto ferry French troops and provide air cover with attack helicopters \nand AC-130 gunships. This is a proposal that would immediately \nAmericanize the war.\n  The administration has also made it clear that it will move French \ntroops to Gorazde only if the United States has a free hand to attack \nBosnian Serb--and possibly the Serbian Serb--air defenses that could \nthreaten United States aircraft. The United States would also, I am \ntold--I have not seen it spelled out--insist on a free hand to bomb any \nother Serb forces that could possibly pose a threat to United States \nforces or that threaten the success of the mission.\n  Now, the administration, I think, is absolutely right to insist on \neliminating the dual-key arrangement with the United Nations if we are \ninvolved with reinforcing Gorazde. But it would make us responsible for \nthe outcome. It would, in fact, Americanize the war.\n  I believe we have to think very carefully before we decide to try to \nreinforce Gorazde, as the French have proposed. This would require \nsignificant American involvement, and I think the charge would be we \nare thereby contributing to the Americanization of the war itself.\n  I think there is a very serious reason to question whether Gorazde \ncan be saved from a determined Serb assault. Gen. John Galvin, who \nserved as both the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and as a military \nadviser to the Bosnian Government, came before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and testified that the eastern enclaves in Bosnia \nare militarily indefensible. I think the events of the past 2 weeks \nonly reinforce that assessment.\n  I know that many American military officers have questioned the \nFrench proposal to reinforce Gorazde because of the great difficulty, \nnot only in transporting the troops and equipment there, but also of \nresupplying them once they are deployed. Agreeing to the French \nproposal would mean that we are committing our forces to an ongoing \nmission in which the United States Army aviation troops would be \noperating in the midst of the Bosnian war.\n  Even assuming the French proposal is completely successful in \ndeterring a Serb attack on Gorazde, this very success would free up \nSerb forces who are now focused on the eastern enclaves to move to new \ntargets: Tuzla, Sarajevo or the narrow swath of Moslem-held territory \nconnecting these cities.\n  If we are seriously going to consider the French proposal, we should \nnot be naive about the implications. It would Americanize the conflict. \nIt would result in ongoing United States Army combat missions in \nBosnia. There should be no doubt about that.\n  I also want to point out, Mr. President, that I believe the \nadministration is refusing to engage in debate on this proposal in a \nserious way. The administration officials seem to be deliberately \nmischaracterizing--I was going to say ``misrepresenting''; perhaps that \nis too harsh a word--mischaracterizing \n\n[[Page S 10283]]\n\n     what the Dole-Lieberman proposal says, because the \n     administration really does not have a credible argument \n     against it.\n  During the daily press briefings yesterday, both the White House and \nthe Defense Department spokesmen framed their case against this \nproposal by saying that by lifting the arms embargo, it would force \nUNPROFOR to leave Bosnia.\n  I am going to quote here statements coming out of the administration:\n\n       . . . lifting that arms embargo unilaterally as proposed . \n     . . would lead to an Americanization of the war . . . and \n     drive out UNPROFOR . . .\n\n  Kenneth Bacon, a DOD spokesman.\n\n       . . . that decision by the U.S. Congress (to lift the arms \n     embargo) would trigger a decision by UNPROFOR to withdraw \n     from Bosnia and then we would be in the position of having to \n     commit ground troops to extract U.N. personnel from Bosnia . \n     . .\n\n  Michael McCurry, White House spokesman.\n\n       [The Dole-Lieberman proposal] as we've said over and over \n     again . . . would draw the United Nations out of Bosnia.\n\n  Again, Michael McCurry.\n  These arguments really have very little to do with the legislation \nbefore the Senate. The Dole-Lieberman proposal would lift the arms \nembargo only if--let me repeat, only if--UNPROFOR withdraws and only \nafter UNPROFOR withdraws.\n  So it seems to me that the administration's core objection that it \nwould force UNPROFOR to leave Bosnia is not, really, quite relevant.\n  The administration's argument may be applicable to the original bill \nthat Senators Dole and Lieberman introduced in January calling for the \narms embargo to be lifted in May, even if UNPROFOR were still in place. \nI think that the sponsors of this resolution have recognized the \nlegitimacy of the administration's argument, and they modified the \nproposal so it would not take effect unless and until UNPROFOR departs.\n  I must say, the administration is still refusing to acknowledge the \nchanges that we have in front of us, a different proposal, even though \nit has been circulating throughout Washington and, indeed, the world, \nfor the past several weeks.\n  I also think the administration is trying to confuse the issue of \nunilateral versus multilateral lifting of the arms embargo.\n  There is a common misperception, spread by those who do not support \nthe resolution, that the United States alone desires to lift the arms \nembargo in the Government of Bosnia.\n  That is not the case, Mr. President. In fact, the U.N. General \nAssembly has called for the lifting of the embargo on Bosnia a number \nof times, most recently November 1994, in Resolution 49/10. This \nresolution was passed by the General Assembly without dissent. Close to \n100 nations voted in favor of the resolution. Not one voted in \nopposition.\n  A similar resolution, No. 48/88, passed the assembly a year before, \nwith 110 nations voting in favor and none voting against.\n  I think it is simply inaccurate to assert that a lifting of the arms \nembargo by the United States would be unilateral. There are many other \nnations who would be eager to join the United States should that prove \nto be necessary.\n  I would ask to have printed in the Record relevant portions of the \ntwo U.N. resolutions I mentioned, as well as a list of the many nations \nthat have voted for them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Resolution 49/10 Adopted by the General Assembly, November 8, 1994\n\n\n                the situation in bosnia and herzegovina\n\n       The General Assembly,\n       22.

Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks by saying that \nno Member here can stand on the Senate floor with complete assurance \nthat we know what the outcome of our deliberations and ultimately our \nvote will be.\n  That is something we cannot predict. There is no foreknowledge of the \nfinality of things in this body or elsewhere. There are great risks \ninvolved in whatever decision we choose.\n  I might point out that the Dole resolution of several months ago has \nalready been taken over by events. Perhaps we could have beefed up the \nforces several months ago and prevented the Serbs from overrunning the \nso-called safe haven areas. That is no longer the case. They have been \nand are being overrun. One or two more remain.\n  The difficulty, of course, now, is that assuming the Dole resolution \nwere to pass, I think the administration makes a valid point that there \nis going to be more bloodshed. The Serbs are on the offensive. They are \nin high gear now. They are moving, there is no doubt about it. If they \nthink that the U.N. forces are coming out with the aid and assistance \nof the United States, they will move as expeditiously as possible to \nexact even a greater blood toll. That is something I think that we can \nanticipate, reasonably, will take place.\n  I must say that as we have delayed and delayed and delayed and \nexercised this sort of Hamlet-like irresoluteness, we have witnessed \nsafe area after safe area falling, more atrocities being committed, \nmore rapes, more plunder, more pillage, more arrogance. The notion that \nthe Serbs can flaunt their military power in the face of the United \nStates, or indeed the entire Western \n\n[[Page S 10284]]\n\nworld, strikes everyone as simply unacceptable.\n  We should make no mistake about it. We do not have any real \nconclusive answers as to what will flow from our action. That is why we \nhave hesitated today.\n  Perhaps if we had followed Lady Margaret Thatcher's leadership \nseveral years ago, we would not find ourselves in the place we are \ntoday. Perhaps if we had taken collective action 3 years ago--we can go \nback and retrace our mistakes. We can go back and say perhaps if we had \nnever recognized Bosnia as a separate state--all the ``perhapses'' that \nwe can engage in right now--but we are where we are, and what we are \nwitnessing is an ethnic cleansing on a horrific scale.\n  So we cannot turn away from what is taking place. We are trying not \nto become engaged in that effort. But I think we have to be very \ncareful on the proposals coming out of our European allies. I give them \ngreat credit for their willingness to commit ground forces in an effort \nto preserve lives. And they have preserved lives. I want to make this \npoint again. They have helped to sustain life in that war-torn country. \nBut I take issue with the notion that UNPROFOR is responsible for \ncutting down on the numbers, the vast number of casualties. Secretary \nPerry testified to that in open session of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I pointed out, at that time, the reason the casualties have fallen is \nbecause the Serbs have largely accomplished their objectives. They have \ncleansed those areas. They have murdered those people, so they achieved \nmost of their objectives, so the casualties have come down. It is not \nin any way to diminish or denigrate the heroic effort on the part of \nUNPROFOR, but UNPROFOR really has not been there in order to defend \nagainst Serb aggression. They have been trying to deliver food and \nmedicines and carry out a humanitarian mission--against all odds, I \nmight add.\n  So I think there is danger in whichever direction we go. If we are to \nfollow the French proposal, if we are to be asked to provide the \nhelicopters and gunships necessary to transport French troops to \ncertain regions, I can imagine what the Serb reaction will be. Let us \nnot go at Gorazde, let us go over here to Tuzla. Let us pick a \ndifferent location. Then we are into ferrying troops here and there \nwith the risk, obviously, of losing our gunships, our transport \nhelicopters, our men and women. That obviously will involve us in a \nvery significant way.\n  So there is no easy solution. There is no happy ending to this tragic \nstory. And whatever route we take is going to involve risk for the \nUnited States.\n  I listened with great interest to my colleague from Massachusetts \nsaying there are no risk-free options. There are not. Every option we \nconsider has great risks. But we have been standing by, year after \nyear, and we have watched the decimation of a people take place. And we \nhave foundered because we have not had a consensus, we have not had a \nsense of obligation, we have not had a moral commitment to do much \nabout it, other than to talk.\n  So I think the time for talking has reached an end. I believe we have \nto take action. Whether ultimately the Senate will go on record as \nsupporting the Dole resolution remains to be seen. For the first time, \nI have heard my colleague from Massachusetts suggest an option, \nsomething akin to what President Bush put together for the Persian Gulf \nwar. It will be interesting to find out what our allies think about \nsuch a proposal. I have not heard such a proposal offered on this floor \nbefore, or indeed in any of the international circles. Perhaps there is \nsupport for having a Persian Gulf-like armada go off into the hills of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. I am not satisfied that is the case.\n  Nonetheless, I believe the time has come for us to take action, \nknowing full well there are risks involved. There are risks to the men \nand women who are in our armed services. There are risks involved that \nthis will be seen as an effort to Americanize the war. There is also \nthe risk that, indeed, the U.S. Senate, by its action, could be blamed \nfor the failure which has preceded any action we might take. Those are \nrisks we have to assume with full knowledge before we finally cast a \nvote, either today or sometime during the course of the week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished Senator from Maine yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COHEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I know my colleague from Maine has been patiently \nwaiting to address the Senate. I just want to first thank the senior \nSenator from Maine for what he has said; the very tone, the clarity, \nand the openness to the complexity that we face.\n  In November 1992 I made my way into Sarajevo and met, at UNPROFOR \nheadquarters, with General Morillon, who was then the commander. Even \nas the evening mortars were beginning to descend on the neighborhood \nand he was heading off for a roadblock, I asked him what would be the \npossibility of lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. And he made no \ncomment as such, but said, ``By all means, if that is what you want to \ndo, but give me 48 hours to get my people out of here.''\n  It was already clear that, had we enforced the sanctions on Serbia \nthat were voted on May 30, 1992, had we cut off the oil--three-quarters \nof the oil used in Serbia is imported--if we just stopped it on the \nDanube, and had we just bombed every bridge in Belgrade, and more, we \nmight have made our point.\n  We did not. And the UNPROFOR forces were hostages then; they are \nhostages now. But the Senator is aware that the same General Morillon \nis now part of the chiefs of staff in the French Government, in Paris. \nHe said just a week ago, ``We have to declare war on General Mladic''--\nthat is the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces--``or get out.''\n  It is possible the French now are of that view. It may be that this \nis a real option. But it seems to me--I will ask the Senator if he does \nnot agree--that it in no way precludes our responsibility under the \nU.N. Charter, under article 51. It reads so very clearly. It is \nunambiguous. It is emphatic:\n\n       Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent \n     right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed \n     attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.\n\n  That is the Charter. If we cannot abide by that and allow the Bosnian \nGovernment to defend itself, then what has the last half-century been \nfor? Would he not agree?\n  Mr. COHEN. I agree with my friend from New York. One of the great \ntragedies in all of this is that the United Nations has been deeply--\nnot fatally perhaps--but deeply humiliated. Day after day after day, we \nhave seen the Serbs flaunt their arrogance to the United Nations. To \nsend blue-helmeted peacekeepers into that region, declare no-fly zones \nthat go unenforced--in fact we see a reversal, an inversion, where the \nSerbs threaten the United Nations that they will shoot down any \naircraft that they see in the no-fly zone. That is a complete \ninversion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Or on first sight of a NATO plane, they will cut the \nthroats of eight Dutch hostages.\n  Mr. COHEN. Exactly. We have seen them use U.N. forces as hostages, \nmake them pay tribute, demand that they give up 50 percent of their \nfuel or food or medicines in order to gain passage to the areas for \nwhich they were headed. It has been one humiliation after another.\n  Again, this is not to diminish in any way, to undercut the tremendous \nheroism being demonstrated by those who are there. But when the ground \nforces call in and say, ``Please send us air cover,'' and someone \nsitting in Zagreb, or perhaps back in New York, says, ``No, that might \nbe too provocative,'' there has to be a level of exasperation among \nthose who are now held hostage with the threat of their throats being \nsevered in response to any action taken by the United States.\n  It seems to me that we have really very few choices here. We can say \nthere is going to be an all-out war declared against the Bosnian Serbs, \nand mean it; saying we are going to wage holy hell, in terms of your \ncountry, for what you have done and continue to do, unless you are \nwilling to sit down and negotiate a peace and not only to say it but to \nmean it. I am not sure--that means coming, sort of, I call it a \nShaquille O'Neal: You come big or you do not come at all. That type of \nstrategy. You come with power, overwhelming power, and you have a \nunited front. It is not the United States, it is not Britain, it is not \nFrance; it is the United Nations represented by its members' \n\n[[Page S 10285]]\n\nmilitary forces, meaning you are going to wage war in order to help \nmake a peace.\n  I have not seen such resolve offered or indeed generated by our \nEuropean allies to date. It has been, more or less, these half-step, \nhalf measures. ``Let's see if we cannot contain. Let's see if we cannot \nwork out something.'' With no real threat that can be made, a \nlegitimate threat, backed up by power. Each time we made a threat the \nthreat has been empty. It has been idle. So each time there has been an \nidle threat made we have invited the arrogant display on the part of \nthe Serbs.\n  So I say to my friend, we have some choices here. They are very \nclear, in terms of either go in, in a very big way, in a united way, in \norder to help make a peaceful solution--say it and mean it and do it, \nmeaning that nothing is off base. It could be carried all the way to \nBelgrade if necessary.\n That runs a risk of running into a controversy with our Russian \nfriends. That is why I raised the question yesterday. What is the role \nof the Russians in all of this? What have been the state of \nnegotiations between the Russian diplomats and our own? Are they \nprepared to act, as a member of the United Nations, to really see that \na peace is arrived at? Or has it been one of covert support, be it \nmilitary or moral assistance, to those who continue to snub and to \nviolate the U.N. sanctions? We do not know the answer to this. I do not \nknow the answer to this. They obviously will be a major player. They \ncan have a major impact on what is to take place. Obviously, if the \narms embargo were to be lifted, we could foresee more arms going in to \nthe Serbs as well as to the Bosnian Moslems.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Surely the Senator would agree that it is time the U.S. \nSenate made its views known.\n  Mr. COHEN. We have come to that point. We have delayed and been \nirresolute too long.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my colleague.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I certainly want to commend the distinguished majority \nleader and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] \nfor their bipartisan leadership on this matter. The moral question of \nwhether to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia is a bipartisan issue.\n  The original cosponsors of this bill represent a distinguished cross-\nsection of the Senate. And the legislation to lift the arms embargo \npassed the House by an overwhelming vote of 318 to 99. It received \nbroad support from both sides of the aisle. It was sponsored by the \nDemocrats. I believe that the U.S. Senate deserves to take a similar \naction on the Dole-Lieberman bill.\n  The Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act is not a panacea. It will \nnot bring back to life the Bosnian women who have been raped, \nmutilated, and torn from their homes by advancing Serbian forces.\n  It will not return the thousands of Bosnian men who have disappeared \ninto Serbian concentration camps never to be heard from again.\n  It will not erase 3 years of Serb genocidal atrocities in this war, \nwhich the Serbs call ethnic cleansing.\n  What this bill would do, however, is to return to a country and a \npeople under siege their God-given right to defend themselves against \nnaked aggression. This principle is enshrined in article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter, which states:\n\n       Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent \n     right of individual or collective self-defense.\n\n  Today, Bosnia faces perhaps its gravest threat from Serb forces that \nhave already conquered 70 percent of the country's territory. These are \nthe same forces that on July 11 overran the U.N.-designated safe area \nof Srebrenica, in blatant violation of the U.N. Security Council and \ntheir own earlier agreements.\n  These are the same forces that promised not to take any future U.N. \npersonnel as hostages, yet captured Dutch peacekeepers as they advanced \non the town and used them as human shields against NATO airstrikes.\n  And these are the same forces that murdered, raped, and disappeared \nthe people of Srebrenica and today they are poised to overrun Zepa, \nanother U.N. safe area, with inevitable similar results.\n  Mr. President, the Bosnian Government is not asking for United States \ntroops to come to their aid. They are not asking Americans to fight and \nto die to turn back the aggression of the Bosnian Serbs. They are, \nhowever, asking for us to stop impeding their own ability to fight--\nand, if necessary, to die--to defend their own homes and families from \nSerbian aggression.\n  I would like to take a moment to respond to the two main arguments \nthe administration has made against this legislation. No. 1 is that the \nUnited States should take this action, but should do so only \nmultilaterally, not unilaterally. I have two responses to this. First, \nthis is an argument that says no matter how bad things may get in \nBosnia, we must allow any single permanent member of the Security \nCouncil to prevent us from doing what we know to be moral and right.\n  But there is an equally strong legal argument. I challenge any of my \ncolleagues to find a Security Council resolution that places an arms \nembargo on the sovereign nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1991, the \nSecurity Council placed an arms embargo on the country of Yugoslavia in \na failed effort to prevent the outbreak of violence in the Balkans.\n  A year later, in 1992, Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia gained their \nindependence from Yugoslavia. These countries quickly received\n diplomatic recognition from the United States and Western Europe, and \nthey were admitted to the United Nations as sovereign states.\n\n  At that time, the United States should have simultaneously recognized \nthe legal status of these countries as not being the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia--which today encompasses only Serbia and Montenegro. At \nthat time, we should have had the political courage to do what was \nright. We did not--and I recognize that this error was made in the \nwaning months of the Bush administration.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the Hyde amendment to lift the arms \nembargo 2 years ago in the House. I believe that the Bush \nadministration got this issue wrong, and the Clinton administration \ncontinued that error, despite Clinton's campaigning against President \nBush's policy in Bosnia. But it is never too late to do what is morally \nright and legally correct. That is what this bill is intended to do.\n  The administration's second argument against this bill is curious, \nbecause it is logically incompatible with the first, which argues that \nwe should lift the embargo but should do so multilaterally.\n  The second argument is if we were to lift the embargo at all, it \nwould only encourage more bloodshed, or that the Bosnian Serbs would \nimmediately launch an offensive against remaining Bosnian Government \nterritory to take advantage of their military superiority while they \nstill have it.\n  I have a simple response to this. Just look at what is happening \ntoday--even as we talk--in Bosnia. Do we have any right to determine \nfor the Bosnian people whether they should choose to fight for their \nlives and their independence against aggression? Must we tell them that \ntheir duty to the international community is to die quietly and \nsubmissively, to avoid provoking the Serbs even further?\n  Mr. President, the Dole-Lieberman substitute adds an important \nelement to the original version of S. 21. It delays its effective date \nto 12 weeks after enactment to permit time for the withdrawal of the \nU.N. protection force in Bosnia. The President may extend this another \n30 days, if necessary, for the safe withdrawal of UNPROFOR.\n  I think it is also important to mention, especially in response to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, who earlier said that the Bosnians want \nboth--they want to lift the embargo as well as keep UNPROFOR in place--\nbut that is not what this resolution says. It requires that, prior to \nthe termination of the arms embargo, the United States Government has \nto receive a request from the Bosnian Government for a termination of \nthe arms embargo. In addition, they have to request the U.N. Security \nCouncil for departure of UNPROFOR, and there has to be a decision by \nthe U.N. Security Council, or decisions by countries contributing \nforces to UNPROFOR, to withdraw \n\n[[Page S 10286]]\nUNPROFOR. So the point is that has to occur before we lift the embargo.\n  I think this resolution, in the final analysis, is perhaps an overdue \nrecognition, unfortunately, that UNPROFOR, as constituted, has no \nviable mission.\n  UNPROFOR is incapable of protecting the victims of this war. It is \nincapable of keeping open humanitarian supply routes. And it has become \nthe pawn of the Serb forces who now routinely using U.N. forces as \nhostages to protect their own military advances.\n  In Bosnia, the United States and other Western nations have supported \npolicies that have put NATO and U.N. forces into the midst of a raging \ncivil war with a complicated line of command that weaves and snakes its \nway through the United Nations through NATO, and through the labyrinth \nof bureaucracies in various national governments.\n  This U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia is not a humanitarian mission, \nbecause it is not perceived of as neutral. It is not a traditional \npeacekeeping force, because there is no peace to keep.\n  And it cannot be merely a fighting force, because it does not have a \nmilitary mission and does not have adequate rules of engagement \nrequired for combat.\n  Call it the ``no-name'' defense. No one knows exactly what it is--or \nwhat it should become.\n  But this confusion and timidity has had consequences. It has had \nconsequences for those Bosnians who apparently believed that the United \nNations designation of so-called safe areas actually meant anything. \nAnd it has had consequences for NATO personnel who struggled to defend \nthemselves under the United Nations mandated rules of engagement.\n  Last month, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clerk, Director of Plans and Policy of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed in an open session before the \nForeign Relations Committee that the NATO flights over Bosnian Serb \nareas under Operation Deny Flight have been hampered by the U.N. \nrefusal to grant our forces the right to defend themselves. The United \nNations has expressly denied past NATO requests for authority to take \nout Bosnian Serb surface-to-air missile batteries that have fired at \nour planes enforcing the no-flight zone over Bosnia, the very same \nmissiles that shot down Scott O'Grady during a mission over Bosnia not \nlong ago.\n  As we all know, NATO made a request to take out the surface-to-air \nmissiles last year when a British plane was shot down, and they were \ndenied. They were denied then and they are denied now because such an \naction could provoke the Bosnian Serbs--could provoke the Bosnian \nSerbs. Exactly what are the Serbs doing today?\n  The key question is whether the status quo is something that makes \nsense for the long term and whether it is leading to any acceptable \nsolution in Bosnia. I believe that the current situation makes no sense \nprecisely because UNPROFOR has no coherent goal, and it certainly \ncannot function for the purposes for which it was originally designed \nand intended. As the loss of innocent human life increases, our options \nto stem the tide of the bloodbath decrease conversely.\n  I have long supported the lifting of the United States arms embargo \nin Bosnia, and that is why I think this resolution is so critically \nimportant. Unfortunately, it comes late, is long overdue, knowing the \nthousands and thousands of casualties in Bosnia, but the fact remains \nthat we have to do what is right now.\n  I support this measure because I think it clearly gives the Bosnians \nthe understanding that lifting the arms embargo is out of respect for \ntheir inherent right of self-defense, and I think we can do no less \nunder these very circumstances. And considering the fact that we look \nat the safe haven issue and what has already happened--we have lost \none, perhaps we will lose another--the fact remains these people, these \nrefugees going to these safe havens think they are protected, and they \nare not. So the time has come to do something different, to introduce a \ndifferent dynamic.\n  I do not support the authorization of ground troops, and again this \nresolution stipulates very clearly that there will be no authorization \nof ground troops but for the purposes of training and support of \nmilitary equipment. I do think we should give the Bosnian Serbs a right \nto defend themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article that appeared in the Washington Post today that was written \nby Richard Perle, the headline of which says, ``Will We Finally \nRecognize the Right to Self-Defense?''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 19, 1995]\n\n          Will We Finally Recognize the Right to Self-Defense?\n\n       Today the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Robert Dole, \n     and Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman will once again propose \n     legislation that would require President Clinton to end U.S. \n     participation in the U.N. embargo barring the supply of arms \n     to the government of Bosnia.\n       This time, unlike the previous occasions on which similar \n     legislation was defeated, Dole and Lieberman have more than \n     enough votes to win. Administration arguments on Bosnia, \n     steadily undermined by events, are no longer convincing. \n     Indeed, among the growing majority of senators and \n     congressmen who believe the embargo is wrong and should be \n     lifted are many who have, until now, accepted Clinton \n     administration arguments that lifting the embargo would \n     damage NATO, widen and ``Americanize'' the war and lead to \n     increased casualties among the Bosnians.\n       The deterioration of the administration's case was \n     inevitable. After all, it was the president himself who \n     argued the invalidity of the embargo during the 1992 campaign \n     and who promised to end it immediately upon taking office. It \n     was the president who dispatched Warren Christopher to Europe \n     in May 1993 with a reasoned, prudent proposal to lift the \n     embargo on Bosnia and provide air strikes to support the \n     Bosnian government.\n       Sadly, dangerously, Clinton lacks the courage of his \n     convictions. And every member of Congress knows that a weak \n     and indecisive president, acquiescing to allied demands, has \n     been singing Europe's tune since his policy--now Dole's--ran \n     into opposition from weak governments in Britain and France.\n       Many members--but fewer with each diplomatic failure, each \n     humiliation of NATO at Serb hands, each ghastly shelling of \n     women and children--opposed unilateral lifting of the \n     embargo, until now. They believed that diplomacy would soon \n     achieve results, that our European allies, who had sent their \n     sons to create safe havens in Bosnia and keep peace between \n     warring parties, would eventually succeed, that lifting the \n     embargo would weaken or even destroy the North Atlantic \n     Alliance.\n       Hardly anyone in Washington now believes that diplomacy \n     will succeed or that America's NATO allies have either a \n     serious policy or the will to implement one. Few now agree \n     that the way to save NATO is for the United States to abandon \n     its leadership of the alliance and cave in to weak European \n     policies. And most members of Congress have grown weary of \n     hearing from London and Paris that the U.S. Congress has no \n     right to insist on a new policy because we did not follow \n     British and French folly in sending ground troops to Bosnia. \n     For an increasing number of Americans, those troops were \n     unwisely sent in harm's way with no clear mission under \n     paralytic U.N. guidelines that render them hostages and \n     prevent them from defending themselves, much less the \n     Bosnians they are there to help.\n       With television images of unbearable brutality and \n     suffering, most members of Congress have found it \n     increasingly difficult to put aside the central truth about \n     the war in Bosnia: that it is a war of territorial \n     aggrandizement carried out by well-armed Serbs, largely \n     against unarmed civilians, a war in which the shelling of \n     towns and villages, rape, pillage and massacre are the \n     instruments of ``ethnic cleansing.''\n       They deplore the failure of the United Nations to \n     distinguish between the perpetrators and the victims of \n     aggression. They are angry that NATO forces, including U.S. \n     air forces, have been subordinated to the United Nations. In \n     increasing numbers they believe, as Clinton once did, that \n     the government of Bosnia has an inalienable, inherent right \n     to self-defense of such primacy that it can no longer be \n     abridged in the interests of ``NATO unity'' or theories about \n     how to contain the war and keep it from spreading. They \n     accept that participation in an embargo that keeps the \n     Bosnian Muslims hopelessly outgunned creates a moral \n     obligation to defend them. Yet they know it is an obligation \n     the West, has cynically failed to honor.\n       For a while, many members accepted the administration's \n     argument that lifting the embargo would merely prolong the \n     war and increase the suffering. Now they are appalled to hear \n     this argument, from British officials especially. They \n     remember that the same argument could have been made in 1940 \n     when Lend Lease ``prolonged'' a war that might have been \n     ended quickly by British surrender or Nazi victory.\n       As they look for an end to the fighting, they now see that \n     with their monopoly of heavy weapons protected by the \n     embargo, the Serbs have no intention of bringing the war to \n     an end. They are placing new credence in Sen. Dole's argument \n     that the surest way to end the fighting in Bosnia is to \n     enable the Bosnians to defend themselves.\n       Dole's legislation recognizes that the U.N. mission in \n     Bosnia is bankrupt and that the \n\n[[Page S 10287]]\n     U.N. forces there must be withdrawn as the Bosnians are armed. It \n     contemplates their withdrawal by allowing time for the \n     British, French and other governments that have troops on the \n     ground to bring them home.\n       Time to get home safely. That is a great deal more than the \n     Western powers have so far given the people of Bosnia.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I congratulate the Senator from Maine on a \ncarefully balanced, reasoned, and documented statement. I particularly \nappreciate the reference to Richard Perle's article this morning. The \nright of self-defense is an innate right under international law. It \nwas what the U.N. Charter was all about. Fifty years ago this June the \ncharter was adopted, with a very specific decision by President \nRoosevelt and the United Kingdom, after much debate, that article 51 \nwould be included.\n  She is so right, I believe. Had we only understood that when the \noriginal embargo was placed on Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavian Government \nin Belgrade--the Serbian Government, in effect--in Belgrade asked for \nit, knowing it controlled the armaments of Yugoslavia itself and not \nwishing to have any weapons go to successor states. But when Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, as with Croatia, as with Slovania, became independent \nMembers of the United Nations, they had a right to arms, a right to \ndefend themselves.\n  You can make the clearest case, in my view--the Senator may not \nagree--that the present embargo is illegal and contrary to the charter.\n  So I thank her, and I hope she is widely attended.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate the words of the Senator from New York and \nhis leadership on this issue as well. He is absolutely correct with \nrespect to the arms embargo. Regrettably, it did not happen before. \nThey do have the inherent right of self-defense, and that is what we \nshould give them now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for the \nexcellent debate. I have been listening to the debate all morning on \nthe pending matter. I appreciate the fact that we have underscored \nagain this is not partisan at all. It is nonpartisan, bipartisan. It is \nnot an attack on this administration. As I have said, many of us were \njust as critical of the previous administration, the Bush \nadministration. But I think the debate is good. I know that the \nDemocratic leader indicates we may not be able to vote today, but \nhopefully we can tomorrow, or there may be amendments.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate continues consideration today \nof the Bosnian arms embargo with the Dole-Lieberman substitute, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor and which I rise to support. I rise, sir, in the \ncontext of the ceremonies that took place in San Francisco on June 26 \nwhere our revered senior Senator from Rhode Island was present, having \nbeen present at the creation of the San Francisco Conference, in 1945. \nHe was there 50 years later. And he was then carrying, as he invariably \ndoes, his U.N. Charter. And to say, sir, that the issue that confronts \nus in the Balkans and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and in \nsurrounding areas is the elemental issue which the charter of the \nUnited Nations was designed to address. The charter is above all a \ntreaty about the use of force in international affairs. It arose out of \nthe Second World War, which in so many ways was a continuation of the \nFirst World War, which began in the setting of territorial aggression, \nthe armed forces of one nation crossing the borders of another for \npurposes of annexation.\n  It is a great irony that the First World War began on a street corner \nin Sarajevo, with the assassination of the Archduke by a young Serb \nnationalist named Princip. I stood on that street corner Thanksgiving \n1992 with bullets from an AK-47 coming across the Princip Bridge. I \nthought, ``My God, this is where the 20th century began and now it is \ngoing to end, here.'' After all we have been through.\n  The idea of collective security was put in place in San Francisco. We \nhad hoped to do so in the League of Nations, which had failed partly \nbecause the United States had not joined but partly because the lessons \nhad not yet been learned and had not yet been absorbed. Here we are 50 \nyears later and it turns out they still have not been absorbed.\n  The charter provides first of all under article 24 that the Security \nCouncil will be responsible for the maintenance of international peace \nand security.\n\n       In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the \n     United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council \n     primary responsibility for the maintenance of international \n     peace and security, and agree in carrying out its duties \n     under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their \n     behalf.\n\n  Mr. President, I served as our representative at the United Nations \nunder President Ford. I have been President of the Security Council. \nAnd I cannot express how painful it is to see this first test of the \ncharter following the end of the cold war, which paralyzed the United \nNations for reasons we understood for so long, but now, in this first \ntest, this clear bright line test, to see us failing. Failing in a \nmanner that history will judge contemptible. We have not yet failed. \nBut we are failing.\n  Security Council Resolution 836 of June 4, 1993, declared that acting \nunder chapter 7 of the charter, the Security Council decides ``To deter \nattacks against the safe areas.'' It goes on to authorize UNPROFOR ``to \ntake the necessary measures, including the use of force, in reply to \nbombardments against the safe areas by any of the parties or to an \narmed incursion into them or in the event of any deliberate obstruction \nin or around those areas to the freedom of movement of UNPROFOR or of \nprotected humanitarian convoys.''\n  That has been the Security Council proposition for the last 2 years. \nAnd we are seeing it being shredded, being treated with contempt, and \nbeing made a nullity.\n  We do so, sir, at the risk not just of the independence and the \nintegrity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but of the whole \nworld order we had hoped to put in place in San Francisco, with the \nSecond World War still under way in Asia--Japan was to surrender almost \n2 months later.\n  As I remarked earlier to the Senator from Maine, in November 1992 I \ntraveled to Sarajevo and I reported back a long memorandum to the \nPresident-elect saying that this would be the central foreign policy \nissue that would be awaiting him on his inauguration. The trip into \nSarajevo was not what it should have been. I was then a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee. I was traveling on official business.\n We informed the NATO command and the United States Air Force that we \nwould be coming, myself and now-Ambassador Galbraith, the Ambassador in \nZagreb; that we would be in Frankfurt and hoped to go to Sarajevo. This \nwas sent by cable. It was fully understood we were coming and meant to \ngo down in that part of the world.\n\n  We arrived and the base commander knew nothing of our trip. I said I \nwould like to go to Sarajevo, and he piled us into a station wagon and \nroared across the tarmac and there was a C-130 manned by the West \nVirginia Air National Guard, propellers just beginning to turn, with a \ncargo of meals ready to eat for Sarajevo. We got on board, and off we \nwent.\n  Halfway across Austrian airspace, because countries were opening up \ntheir airspace for this purpose, we received a message that said \n``Members of Congress are not allowed into Sarajevo.'' I simply said, \n``Signal back that if the West Virginia Air National Guard could take \nthe risk, so could I and that I had no intention of being diverted.'' \nSilence. Then a half hour later a signal came that the airport at \nSarajevo had closed, which certainly could have been the case. Sarajevo \nis in a bowl. The lid of fog goes up and down, up and down.\n  We landed, diverted to Zagreb, and got off. The American Charge \nd'Affaires was there at the airport, which was not far from downtown. I \napologized for parachuting in thus, explaining that the airport was \nclosed. He said, ``What do you mean it is closed? Two C-130's just took \noff.'' The airport was indeed open. Which it is not always, and when it \nis one knows.\n  I was lied to, which is not a good practice. It took me a year to get \nthe Air Force to sort out what happened. The word came from Washington. \nThey did not want us to know what was \n\n[[Page S 10288]]\ngoing on in Sarajevo. As the junior Senator from Maine has said, this \nis a matter that has crossed two administrations. We are not here on a \npartisan issue. We are here in response to an international emergency \nwhich we have helped create.\n  The Canadians got me in to Sarajevo the next day. The British got me \nout the day after that. We arrived in Sarajevo and went through hellish \nsmall arms fire in a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier. If you have \never been in a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier, you would have a \nbetter understanding how they prevailed over the Wehrmacht. If you can \nlive in those, you can live in anything. We went directly to the \nUNPROFOR headquarters and met with General Morillon. He was very open. \nWhen asked should we not lift the embargo on Bosnia--clearly an illegal \nembargo as Article 51 gives the absolute right to self-defense--\nMorillon said, ``Do so if you want, but give me 2 days to get my people \nout.'' They were already hostages. We allowed that to happen by \ninjecting them into a situation where there was no peace to keep. There \nwas just the aggressor and the member state aggressed against.\n  That is the fundamental fact that Senator Dole and Senator Lieberman \nbring before us today. You cannot have seen those UNPROFOR forces \nwithout admiring them. I will cite Anthony Lewis in this matter when he \nreferred to General Morillon's recent statement that we have to declare \nwar on General Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, or get \nout. Anthony Lewis went on to say:\n\n       General Morillon's words pithily summed up one lesson of \n     Bosnia for the Western alliance: To intervene in a conflict \n     and pretend there is no difference between the aggressors and \n     the victims is not only dishonorable but ineffective.\n\n  He say further that the UNPROFOR forces deserve the greatest \nadmiration, but they have been given an impossible task.\n  A year ago on this floor, I put the same proposition. I said the \nforces ``deserve our utmost support. But if we are to refrain from \nhelping the Bosnians out of concern for their welfare, let us at least \nbe candid and call the members of UNPROFOR what they have become: \nhostages.''\n  This was a year ago on this floor. I said, if we are going to refrain \nfrom helping the Bosnians out of concern for the welfare of those \ntroops, ``let us at least be candid and call the members of UNPROFOR \nwhat they have become: hostages.''\n  Now this has taken on a miserable, contemptible mode. We are told \nthat--as I read this morning--if Bosnian Serbs see one NATO plane in \nthe sky, they will cut the throats of the Dutch soldiers they have \ntaken hostage. That is what we are dealing with.\n  At the very minimum, we can understand that the grotesque fact of \nthis whole horror has been our denial to the Bosnian Government of its \ninnate right of self-defense. We have put an embargo on the capacity of \nthe member country aggressed against to defend themselves. Remember \nthat one of the central purposes of the original embargo against \nYugoslavia itself was the fact that Belgrade had control of all of the \narmed forces and the material of the Yugoslav Government. It did not \nwant any successor states to get it, and the Bosnians had none. That \nthey are still there 2\\1/2\\ years later is hard to contemplate. But \nthey are still there. They have begun to arm themselves. They have \nbegun to train, and they have not been overrun.\n  Now all we are asking is to grant them what is their right at law, \nwhich is the right of self-defense.\n  The issue has been raised, if we act in what we are doing and the \nUnited States proceeds unilaterally, will this put in jeopardy the \nauthority of U.N. sanctions in other areas of the world? When we \ndebated this last year, I addressed the question as follows:\n\n       First, we are asked, if we lift this embargo how will we \n     resist other nations lifting embargoes on Iraq, Serbia and \n     Libya? How, that is, shall we distinguish between lambs and \n     lions, between victims and aggressors? By looking at the \n     facts. Iraq was an aggressor, not the victim of ``an armed \n     attack'' giving rise to Article 51 rights. Serbia is not \n     subject to an armed attack. Nor is Libya. Each of these \n     states is as clearly an aggressor or violator of \n     international law as Bosnia is clearly a victim.\n       To be clear: lifting the embargo on Bosnia creates no legal \n     or factual precedent for ignoring valid enforcement action \n     taken against an aggressor state. Article 51 applies solely \n     to the victim of an act of aggression.\n\n  This right to self defense was so obvious and fundamental that the \nUnited States delegation to the San Francisco Conference at first \nopposed including language on the right of self defense in the charter \nfor fear that such a provision might be used to limit the right of self \ndefense. In a dispatch to the New York Times from the San Francisco \nConference, James Reston described the breakthrough which produced \narticle 51:\n\n       San Francisco, May 15 [1945].--President Truman broke the \n     deadlock today between the Big Five and the Latin American \n     nations over the relations between the American and world \n     security systems.\n       After over a week of negotiating, during which American \n     foreign policy was being made and remade by a bi-partisan \n     conference delegation, the President gave to the Latin \n     American nations the reassurance which they wanted before \n     accepting the supremacy of the World Security Council in \n     dealing with disputes in the Western Hemisphere. . . .\n       This assurance was announced late tonight by Secretary \n     Stettinius, who said that an amendment to the Dumbarton Oaks \n     proposals would be proposed reading substantially as follows:\n       ``Nothing in this charter impairs the inherent right of \n     self defense, either individual, or collective, in the event \n     that the Security Council does not maintain international \n     peace and security and an armed attack against a member state \n     occurs. . . .''\n\n  Mr. President, we have been here before. That charter was in so many \nways written in response to the failure of the collective security \narrangements of the League of Nations, of which the most conspicuous \nwas the civil war, so-called, in Spain. A group was put together, \ncalled the Lyon Conference, where representatives of Britain, France, \nGermany, and Italy agreed in 1936 to stem the flow of supplies to both \nsides. France and Britain complied with the agreement. Germany and \nItaly ignored it, and in a very little while, the world was at war at \nlarge.\n  I would like to end these remarks by quoting two citations from the \nNew Republic.\n Both are addressed to the President of the United States:\n\n       [We] urge you to act at once in raising the unneutral \n     embargo which is helping to turn Spain over to the friend of \n     Hitler and Mussolini . . . Is the course of this country \n     determined by the wishes of . . . Great Britain? . . . \n     Perhaps you believe that it is too late to do anything. But \n     you probably believed that last spring . . . Mr. President, \n     we urge you not to hesitate or delay. We can imagine no valid \n     reason for you to do so. You have spoken bravely--in some \n     cases, we believe, so bravely as to be foolhardy. But here is \n     something that you can safely do--and do now. Why not make \n     your acts correspond with your words?\n\n  This Telegram to the President was dated February 1, 1939. We did \nnothing. In no time at all, we were attacked and the war became a world \nwar.\n  And now, more recently, Mr. President, from the New Republic of May \n9, 1994:\n\n       The administration does not grasp that moral principles are \n     also analytically useful. Consider its most frequently stated \n     explanation for its timidity in the Balkans. It is reluctant, \n     it says to ``take sides'' in the conflict. It aspires to \n     neutrality, in other words, between the Serbs and the \n     Bosnians, between the conqueror and the conquered, between \n     the raper and the raped. This is a kind of blindness, alas, \n     that no major diplomatic initiative will cure.\n\n  I think we have all been impressed with the candor of the Assistant \nSecretary of State for European Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, who called \nthe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina ``the greatest collective \nfailure of the west since the 1930's.'' That a U.N. declared safe area \ncould be allowed to be taken is shameful. That one week later no \nmeasurable response from the United Nations has been recorded is \npotentially fatal. The analogies to the confusion of the 1930's--the \nundoing of the League of Nations--are not idle. Our actions, or lack of \naction, in Bosnia will be defining. It will indicate whether or not we \nare committed to abiding by the legal structures put in place at San \nFrancisco a half century ago in the wake of two world wars, and now, at \nlong last, tested in a clearest possible setting--a setting in which \nthose wars began, Sarajevo, 1914.\n  If what we constructed in the wake of two world wars in an effort to \nprevent the third is not adhered to, the alternative is chaos. It will \nspread much more rapidly than we think. We will \n\n[[Page S 10289]]\nhave lost the central legal, moral principle of world order we \nundertook to set in place--which we defended at enormous costs through \n50 years of cold war. Now to see it trivialized and lost in the Balkans \nis an act for which we will no more be forgiven than were the leaders \nof Europe that let the war in Spain lead on to their own--the Second \nWorld War, from which they have never yet recovered.\n  Mr. President, it is not too late, although it is very late indeed. \nThe Republican leader and Senator Lieberman are very much to be \ncongratulated. I very much hope the Senate will support them and that \nthe administration will get the message, as well as the rest of the \nworld. They have been listening to us with great care and attention, as \nwell they ought, after the contributions we have made to the rest of \nthe world these past 75 years.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday the President's spokesman \nlabeled the proposal to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia a nutty \nidea. Given the quality of invective in what passes for political \ndebate today, Mr. McCurry's remark seems to me a rather light censure.\n  However, it is fair to observe that to make such a charge, Mr. \nMcCurry had to exceed the already Olympic standards of hypocrisy that \nthe administration has established throughout the many twists and turns \nof the catastrophe that is its Bosnia policy. Let us consider two truly \nnutty ideas, offered by the Governments of France and the United States \nwhich will be considered at the ministerial level by NATO governments \nthis Friday.\n  Let us consider what the administration is reportedly proposing to do \nabout the rapidly deteriorating situation in Bosnia.\n  As I understand it, the administration has rejected French President \nChirac's proposal to reinforce peacekeepers in Gorazde. Instead, \nadministration officials have proposed more aggressive NATO air strikes \nagainst Bosnian Serb forces currently besieging Gorazde.\n  Before commenting on the two proposals, Mr. President, I must caution \nthat they are only the proposals of the moment. As France's and the \nUnited States positions on Bosnia have experienced for many months now \ndizzying and frequent metamorphoses, no one can be certain that today's \nproposals will resemble tomorrow's.\n  Neither idea has been conceived in anything approaching a historical \nreview of the failure of the United Nations and the West's efforts to \nresolve the Bosnian conflict or even, apparently, a rational analysis \nof the present circumstances in Bosnia. Both ideas are certainly \nunsound as deterrents to Bosnian Serb aggression and as remedies to the \ndecline of the Atlantic Alliance.\n  Let us first consider President Chirac's call for reinforcing U.N. \npeacekeepers in Gorazde with an additional force of up to 1,000 French \nand British troops who would arrive in Gorazde aboard American \nhelicopters, accompanied by American gunships, and after Serbian air \ndefenses had been suppressed by NATO warplanes.\n  President Chirac has threatened to remove existing French \npeacekeepers if his plan is not adopted by NATO. I have no idea if his \nthreat is serious or imminent. Nor do I particularly care.\n  We can be certain, however, that France will withdraw it peacekeepers \nfrom Bosnia, as will all other countries who have contributed troops to \nUNPROFOR, and that the United States will conduct the withdrawal. All \nthat remains uncertain is whether the withdrawal will occur in a few \ndays or a few weeks or a few months. All that will be accomplished by \ndeploying more French or British or Dutch troops to Gorazde is to \ncomplicate our contingency planning and to make more dangerous our \neventual evacuation of UNPROFOR.\n  At one point last week, both Presidents Clinton and Chirac indicated \ntheir preference that UNPROFOR retake Srebrenica from the Serbs. They \nwisely re-thought that suggestion moments after making it. However, the \ndifference in degree of foolishness between their previous suggestion \nand the idea that we can somehow prevent Serbian advances and retain a \npeacekeeping function by reenforcing UNPROFOR's failure in the eastern \nsafe areas is, quite obviously, only marginal.\n  Again, the deployment of a few hundred or a thousand or 10 thousand \nadditional forces to UNPROFOR will only increase the number of hostages \nto fortune currently at risk in Bosnia, exacerbate the confusion in \nBosnia about the West's commitment to peace in Bosnia, worsen the \nburden on the United States when we extract UNPROFOR, and get a lot of \nAmericans and our European comrades-in-arms killed in the bargain.\n  Only marginally less ridiculous is the administration's proposal to \nuse NATO air power more aggressively to defend Gorazde. What \nconstitutes more aggressive air strikes is, of course, unknown. Since \nthe use of NATO air power in this conflict to date has been so \ninconsequential, so utterly futile, its more aggressive use could mean \nlittle more than an intention to actually harm a single Serbian \nsoldier.\n  Interestingly, the administration proposes this option to counter \nPresident Chirac's proposal because they fear the latter would make \nNATO a belligerent in this war. What, pray tell, does bombing the Serbs \nmake us--a disinterested third party?\n  Mr. President, I do not believe in the occasional, or the \nincremental, or the half-hearted, or the uncertain, or the timid use of \nAmerican force. History has shown its contempt for doubt and \nvacillation in the decision making process which sends Americans into \nharm's way. If we commit force it must be with confidence that we can \naffect a substantial improvement in the situation on the ground in \nBosnia. Can anyone--anyone--be even fairly certain that bombing a \nlittle more artillery, or a few more tanks will really deter Serb \naggression?\n  I have never believed airstrikes alone could make difference in the \ncourse of the conflict in Bosnia. Winning wars, as I have often \nobserved in our many debates on Bosnia, is about seizing and holding \nground. You cannot do that from the air.\n  I have been strongly opposed to the almost comical pinprick \nairstrikes authorized by the United Nations. against Serb military \ntargets following Serb attacks on civilians and UNPROFOR forces. I have \nlittle faith that the more aggressive use of NATO air power--whatever \nthat entails--will accomplish anything more than to momentarily make \nthe West feel a little better about its manifest failure in Bosnia. My \nopposition to air strikes today rests in the same argument I made a \nyear ago.\n  When the United States commits its prestige and the lives of our \nyoung to resolving a conflict militarily then we must be prepared to \nsee the thing through to the end. If you start from the premise--and I \nhave heard no voice in Congress oppose this premise--that American \nground forces will not be deployed to Bosnia for any purpose other than \nto help evacuate UNPROFOR, then you identify to the enemy the \ncircumstances under which you can be defeated. You have indicated the \nconditionality, the half-heartedness of our commitment. And you have \ntold the Serbs: We may bomb you, but if you can withstand that, Bosnia \nis yours.\n  NATO's ineffectual use of air power to date has clearly indicated to \nthe Serbs that they can withstand the limit of the West's commitment to \nBosnia. No one, no one in Congress, no one in the administration, no \none in the Pentagon can tell me with any degree of confidence that even \nmore aggressive air strikes will determine or change in any way the \noutcome of this war.\n  The American people and their representatives in Congress have \nalready made the most important decision governing United States \ninvolvement in Bosnia. As a nation, we have decided that the tragedy in \nBosnia--as terrible as it is, as unjust as it is, as brutal as it is--\nthe tragedy in Bosnia does not directly affect the vital national \nsecurity interests of the United States. We made that decision when we \ndecided not to send American infantry to fight in Bosnia.\n  Some in Congress and elsewhere have argued the opposite, that the war \nin Bosnia does threaten our most vital security interests to the extent \nthat it has the potential to spread throughout the Balkans, and even to \nprovoke open \n\n[[Page S 10290]]\nhostilities between two NATO allies. I believe that we can contain the \nconflict. But for the sake of argument, let us consider the conflict as \na direct threat to our security.\n  If the U.S. Government feels our national interests so threatened \nthen they should--they must--take all action necessary to defend those \ninterests. If our vital interests are at risk then we must say to the \nSerbs and to Serbia: You have threatened the security of the United \nStates, the most powerful nation on Earth. We intend to defend our \ninterests by all means necessary, and you can expect the invasion of \nBosnia by American ground forces supported by all available air and sea \npower.\n  But the fact is, Mr. President, that neither Congress nor the \nPresident would support such a grave undertaking. Why? Because we \ncannot make a plausible argument to the American people that our \nsecurity is so gravely threatened in Bosnia that it requires the \nsacrifice, in great numbers, of our sons and daughters to defend.\n  So let us dissemble no longer about how the war in Bosnia threatens \nthe security of the United States. It does not, and we all know it. \nWhat the President will apparently decide is to try by the incremental \nescalation of air power to bluff the Serbs into ceasing their \naggression.\n  As I already argued, the previous use of NATO air power has done \nlittle more than aggravate the bleeding of American and NATO \ncredibility. Additional air power, especially the levels contemplated \nby the President and our allies, will be no more decisive in Bosnia \nthan our previous attempts to bluff the Serbs from the air.\n  A committed foe--and I have no doubt that the Serbs are committed--\ncan and will resist enormous levels of carnage wrought by air power. In \nVietnam, we bombed the Than Hoa bridge over a hundred times, We \nunleashed the awesome destructive power of the B-52's on Hanoi, a \ndevastation I witnessed personally, and still we did not destroy their \nwill to fight.\n  I fear the Serbs will endure whatever air strikes NATO next \nundertakes, and will continue their conquest of Bosnia. I fear this, \nMr. President, because the Serbs know in advance the limit of our \ncommitment to Bosnia. They know we will not send troops to fight on the \nground. They know there are limits to the escalation of any bombing \ncampaign we are prepared to undertake, because of the extreme tactical \ndifficulties posed by the climate and terrain, and because of the \ncertainty that such strikes will do terrible collateral damage.\n  Mr. President, I fear that both the Governments of France and the \nUnited States, are asking us to increase our involvement in an \nundefined military adventure in Bosnia where the limits of our force \nare known to our enemy in advance of its use; where out of concern for \nour prestige we will be drawn deeper into war or compelled to sacrifice \nfurther that prestige and many lives to a cause we were not prepared to \nwin; and where the aggrieved party has been prevented by us from \nfighting in their own defense even as we decline to fight for them.\n  There is but one honorable option remaining to us, Mr. President, \nthat is to terminate the failed UNPROFOR mission, remove all U.N. \nofficials from any further responsibility to preside over the \ndestruction of Bosnia; assist in the evacuation of UNPROFOR, and lift \nthe unjust arms embargo against Bosnia. That is what the majority \nleader and Senator Lieberman's resolution proposes to do, and all the \narguments arrayed against it are, in the words of Mr. McCurry, \n``nutty.''\n  Lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia is the only action which the \nUnited States and the U.N. can take that might help the Bosnians \nachieve a more equitable settlement of this conflict without deploying \nmassive levels of NATO troops to roll back Serb territorial gains.\n  Better armed and better able to defend themselves, the Bosnians might \nbe able to present a more credible, long term threat to Serb conquests, \nand by so doing, convince the Serbs to re-think their refusal to \nrelinquish any substantial part of their territorial gains.\n  But even if lifting the embargo only exacerbates the violence and \nhastens Serbian advances, it has an advantage that our current Bosnia \npolicies lack--it is just. It is just.\n  We have all heard the arguments that if the West wants to economize \nthe violence in Bosnia and contain its spread then we will not lift the \nembargo, but sustain UNPROFOR.\n  Shall we sustain the policy which allowed the Serbs to block delivery \nof humanitarian relief; that allowed Srebrenica to fall and that has \nalready stipulated its assent to the imminent fall of Zepa; which \ntolerates ethnic cleansing and reported war crimes that if even half \ntrue should shame us for a generation? Shall we sustain this policy? \nFor what another few days, weeks? Until Gorazde falls? Sarajevo?\n  Mr. President, if we will not fight for Bosnia, than we are morally--\nmorally--in the wrong to prevent Bosnians from fighting for themselves.\n  We cannot continue to falsely raise the hopes of the Bosnian people \nthat the West will somehow stop Serb aggression by maintaining unarmed \nU.N. forces in Bosnia where they serve as likely hostages rather than a \ndeterrent to Serb aggression. We cannot tell Bosnians any longer that \nit is better to attenuate their destruction rather than to resist it. \nWe cannot any longer refuse the defense of Bosnia while denying \nBosnians their right to self-defense. We have come to the end of that \ninjustice, Mr. President.\n  I cannot predict that Bosnians will prevail over the Serb aggressors \nif we lift--at this late date--the arms embargo. I cannot predict that \nBosnians will even recover enough territory to make an eventual \nsettlement of the conflict more equitable. I cannot predict that \nBosnians will mount anything more than a brief impediment to Serbian \nconquest of all of Bosnia. But they have the right to try, Mr. \nPresident. They have the right to try. And we are obliged by all the \nprinciples of justice and liberty which we hold so dear to get out of \ntheir way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and, Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am not going to really make a speech on \nthe issue of the arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, but rather attempt to raise some issues and some \nquestions.\n  There have been a number of questions about what would happen in the \nevent that the United States unilaterally lifts the arms embargo. Some \nof the questions that have come to my mind--and for which I do not have \nthe answers--I think are important, and I think we ought to ask a \nnumber of questions and attempt to at least analyze those questions, \nand, of course, hopefully to come up with answers.\n  Some of my questions are, first, how close to winning the war are the \nSerbs? Second, if we arm the Bosnians, what are their chances of \nwinning the war? Third, if we arm the Bosnians, and they cannot win the \nwar, then there seems to be a number of questions that ought to be \nconsidered, such as the following:\n  What are the consequences in terms of death and other casualties?\n  What will be the likelihood of the enlargement of the conflict to \nother areas and countries?\n  What period of time will it take to train the Bosnians and assemble \narms sufficiently to make the Bosnians into a credible fighting force?\n  During the period of time that it would take to train the Bosnians \nand assemble the arms, can the Serbs intensify their fighting \nsufficiently to make victory for the Serbs inevitable?\n  What type of victories must the Bosnians win, and how many such \nvictories will be necessary in order to bring about a negotiated peace?\n  Then, I think one of the ultimate questions we have to ask is what \nare the prospects of a lasting peace without a complete, unconditional \nsurrender by one side or the other?\n  I do not know the answer to these questions. But I think these \nquestions ought to enter the thought processes of each Senator in \nmaking his decision on this issue. \n\n[[Page S 10291]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dole-Lieberman \nsubstitute amendment to S. 21, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Self Defense \nAct of 1995.\n  The events of the last week in Bosnia are appalling. Not only does \nthe tragedy continue, but the latest attack on so-called safe areas has \nresulted in a new level of violence aimed at civilians, a new wave of \nethnic cleansing and the creation of a whole new refugee population.\n  The position of the United Nations in Bosnia is increasingly \nuntenable: its role in delivering humanitarian aid is marginal, its \nrole in protecting ``safe areas'' is dominated by spectacular and \ndeadly failures. The fact that the United Nations chief role in Bosnia \nincreasingly is offering hostage targets to the Bosnian Serbs would be \nlaughable if it were not so sad. Not only are our allies' brave and \ndedicated soldiers being put at risk, but their role as hostage targets \nhas virtually guaranteed inaction by NATO air power no matter how \nbrutal and blatant Bosnian Serb aggression becomes--whether it is aimed \nat Bosnian Government forces, at civilians, or even at the U.N. \npeacekeepers themselves.\n  The United Nations must strengthen its position in Bosnia or get out. \nAt a minimum, it must reconfigure its troops into stronger and more \neasily defended units. I am inclined to support efforts by the \nadministration and our European allies to do this, if it can contribute \nto offering real protection to the currently misnamed ``safe areas.'' \nIn the end, however, if the resulting UN forces have no viable mission \nto carry out they should be withdrawn. U.S. and NATO assistance in this \neffort would be appropriate.\n  I do not support the use of U.S. ground troops to take sides in this \nwar, or simply to assist a feckless U.N. force. But NATO air power can \ncontribute to protection of Bosnian ``safe areas'' or at least deter \nfurther Bosnian Serb aggression. It should be used. We have a moral \nresponsibility to allow the Bosnians to defend themselves and to try to \nend the one-sided slaughter. And our broader security interests will be \nseriously damaged if we allow this aggression to go unchallenged, and \nto spread to Kosovo, Croatia, and eventually Albania, Macedonia, and \nbeyond. Failure to act carries grave risks.\n  I am under no illusion that solutions to the problems in Bosnia are \nsimple. Some problems defy attempts from the outside to solve them, and \nthis may be a tragedy the United States cannot end, as much as we would \nlike to. But, there are things we can do, and the people of Bosnia have \nsuffered too long. At a minimum, and as an immediate step, we can and \nshould end the unjust arms embargo against Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved and interested in this situation \nfor several years now. I would like to try to put it in some sort of \nperspective that perhaps all of us can understand where the morality is \nand where we ought to be.\n  I was, in August 1992, at a conference in Austria with several \nEuropean members of Parliament. At that time, I had also just come from \nvisiting Croatia, and had been to the front and visited with refugees \nthat had streamed out, with those that had been victims, and with those \nthat had witnessed the terrible situation with respect to the raping of \nwomen, and the deaths of many males which had occurred as a result of \nthe Serb intrusion into the villages and homes of the Bosnian Moslems \nand Croats.\n  When I was at that conference, the Chancellor of Austria was present. \nAnd I asked the Chancellor--I said, ``Why is it not imperative, and \ncertainly rational, for the European Community to step in and stop the \nfighting in some way?'' He looked at me and he said, ``Well, we cannot \nget involved because they are both our friends.''\n  I started to think about that at that conference. It seemed to me \nthat the time you really want to get involved between two of your \nfriends who are fighting is when one of your friends is there \nhandcuffed to a post and the other friend is there beating him with a \nlead pipe. It seems even more imperative that you ought to get involved \nand stop the fighting, especially when you consider that the size of \nthose that are standing around watching the fight are more than capable \nof walking in and resoling the situation. That seems to me the \nsituation we have right now.\n  Also, at that conference I asked a question of the group there. Well, \nwould it not be right under this situation, if you are not ready to go \nin and separate your friends from fighting, that perhaps at least you \nought to take the handcuffs off the individual that is at the post and \nperhaps give that individual a weapon or the weapons necessary to be on \nequal terms with his opponent? No, they said. The answer to that is, \nwell, more people might get hurt that way--with the conclusion, \ntherefore, that it would be better to allow your friend to be beaten to \ndeath than to come in and try to separate them because somebody might \nget hurt.\n  Take a look at the U.N. situation. There is a way you can look at it \nand, I think, using that same scenario, understand what has happened \nthere. First of all, in the two opponents, the Serbs and the Bosnian \nSerbs on the one hand against the Moslems, Bosnian Moslems and Croats \non the other, we have a situation where one side is heavily armed and \nthe other is not. The Bosnian Serbs inherited the arms which came from \nYugoslavia--howitzers, the tanks, and the airplanes--whereas those \nweapons are not available to the other side. That is the situation we \nhave now.\n  It seems to me that again those forces that are standing outside, \nthat have the ability to come in and settle it, are faced with a couple \nof options, again very similar to the scenario I laid out, and that is \nwe can walk in with force, and we can do it. But then that may put some \nof our people and others in harm's way.\n  The other thing we could do is to say, all right, we are going to \nlevel the fighting field. In fact, we will not only do that, but if we \narm the Bosnians, their forces outnumber the Serb forces. Well, if I am \nstanding there as a Serb force and recognize that, whereas I now have \nthe upper hand because of the weapons I possess, if the United States \nsuddenly enters and changes its policy and says, OK, that is enough, we \nare now going to arm the other side so they have the same kind of arms \nyou do, all of a sudden I am not in a position of superiority but \ninstead in a position of inferiority.\n  So that is why I support this amendment, because what we will be \ndoing is aiming a huge weapon at the Serbs instead of their pointing \nweapons in the other direction, and that leverage alone, in my mind, \nwill bring the Serbs to the conclusion that they have to come to heel \nand to reach some political accomodation.\n  The other way, which is represented by our current policy, is to come \nin and say we will hold a shield up and prevent one side from beating \nthe other. And then, of course, when that got troublesome and we began \nto get hurt, we let the shield down, and the beating began again with \nimpunity. If we just go in there now and try to strengthen those forces \nbut we still do not raise the shield to protect, we are not going to \nmake any headway at all.\n  I am a strong believer that if you get involved in these things and \nyou have overwhelming force, the best way to resolve the situation is \nto make sure that force is available and ready, whether it is the \nUnited Nations or ours. Alternatively, as this amendment would provide, \nwe can say, if you do not come in and work out a peace here, we will \narm the other side so they have the superiority.\n  Continuation of this policy which relies on an ineffectual peace \nforce and hamstrings real efforts to assist the war's victim is a very \ndestructive policy with respect to the United Nations. This event could \nwell make the difference as to whether the United Nations is going to \nbe an effective body to prevent war in the future or not. We are at \nthat point where we have to do what is necessary to ensure that we can \npreserve the ability of the United Nations to make a difference, and, \n\n[[Page S 10292]]\nhopefully, we will have the courage to do that.\n  So I again reflect back upon a year and a half ago or so or 3 years \nago now when we were starting to take a look at this, and I have come \nto the same conclusion again that I came to then, that if we do not as \na United Nations intervene in a responsible way, we will cause the \nUnited Nations to become an ineffective and unusable organization with \nrespect to this kind of conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Last night when this debate opened, I said I find this a \nvery difficult vote to cast. Hearing the debate this morning, I find \nsome of my colleagues' arguments to be very compelling. Senator \nLieberman and others have given us an excellent, eloquent account, for \nexample, of the horror the Bosnian civilians are suffering--of the \ndreadful behavior of the Serbian forces who are outgunning the \nBosnians.\n  The invasion of two safe areas, areas that the international \ncommunity said it would protect, outrages us, as it should. We all want \nto do something to respond to the atrocious Serb behavior in Bosnia. \nIndeed, the United States and our allies are working hard on a united \nresponse.\n  Lifting the arms embargo certainly seems, at first glance, to offer a \ncost-free solution to the fall of the safe areas. I, too, am torn. I am \nstill not convinced, though, that we will make things better by passing \nthis legislation. Indeed, we could make things worse, at great risk not \nonly to the besieged in Bosnia but to the United States and to our \nEuropean allies.\n  It is time for our President, along with our U.N. and NATO allies, to \nconsider how we will respond to the dreadful, egregious Serbian \nbehavior and, indeed, to consider the very future of the United Nations \nin Bosnia. The United States and our allies know that if the United \nNations were to pull out altogether, many areas of Bosnia, now stable \nand well supplied due to the U.N. presence, would face humanitarian \ndisaster. This is particularly true in central Bosnia.\n  The President and our NATO allies must balance that potential \ncatastrophe against the current tragedy which has led many to call for \na complete U.N. withdrawal.\n  We should be honest about what we are debating. This bill, if passed, \nwill actually trigger the U.N. withdrawal from Bosnia. I remind my \ncolleagues that the United States has committed to helping our allies \nto withdraw from Bosnia as part of the NATO effort, so in essence by \npassing this bill we are precipitating the commitment of up to 25,000 \nU.S. troops to Bosnia to help with the withdrawal.\n  I do believe that if and when a decision is made to withdraw \nUNPROFOR, the arms embargo will de facto be lifted. And that is just as \nit should be. We are not at that point yet, though. The troop-\ncontributing countries have not made a decision to withdraw. The U.N. \nSecurity Council has not made a decision to withdraw UNPROFOR. The \nBosnian Government has not asked UNPROFOR to withdraw. Yet, by passing \nthis bill, the United States Senate would very likely trigger a U.N. \nwithdrawal from Bosnia.\n  If we pass this bill today, it will inevitably be perceived as the \nbeginning of a U.S. decision to go it alone in Bosnia. It is naive to \nthink we can unilaterally lift the arms embargo and walk away. Instead, \nwe would have to assume responsibilities for Bosnia not only in terms \nof our moral obligation but in practical terms as well.\n  Lifting the embargo without international support would increase the \nAmerican responsibility for the outcome of the conflict.\n Delivering weapons to Bosnia would likely require sending in United \nStates personnel. Granted, this legislation states that nothing should \nbe construed as authorizing the deployment of U.S. forces to Bosnia and \nHerzegovina for any purpose. But I want to emphasize that this would be \nthe U.S. decision to dismantle the embargo. I do not see how we can \nlift the embargo on our own without sending in the personnel and \nwithout providing the wherewithal to carry out the new policy.\n\n  Another serious concern on this legislation is that it says that the \nlifting of the embargo shall occur after UNPROFOR personnel have \nwithdrawn or 12 weeks after the Bosnian government asks U.N. troops to \nleave, whichever comes first. Basically, what this does is it gives the \nBosnian Government, not the United States Government, the power to end \nthe United States participation in a U.N.-imposed embargo.\n  As I have said, if and when UNPROFOR does leave, it is very likely \nthat the arms embargo would be lifted. While the Bosnian Government \ndoes indeed have the right to ask UNPROFOR to leave, we should not give \nthe Bosnian Government the power to trigger the unilateral lifting of \nthe embargo. To give them that right is an abdication of U.S. power. \nLifting the embargo unilaterally would increase U.S. responsibility in \nBosnia, yet this legislation would allow the Bosnian Government to make \nthe decision to increase our involvement.\n  Finally, I do not want to see happen to the United Nations at this \ntime what happened many years ago when Abyssinia was about to be \noverrun by Italy. It appealed to the League of Nations, but the League \nwrung its hands and did nothing. That was the downfall of the League. \nWe do not want to see the same set of circumstances arise here where \nBosnia comes and asks for help, and we wring our hands but do not \nreply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the subject that \nSenator Pell just addressed. My colleagues are probably tired of my \nrising and speaking to this subject over the last 3 years. I have been \narguing for some time and continue to contend that we need to lift what \nis, in fact, an illegal as well as immoral arms embargo against the \nGovernment of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  Mr. President, observers in the Senate know full well that I am no \nstranger to this issue. Nearly 3 years ago, on September 30, 1992, I \nspoke out against the arms embargo on Bosnia after returning from \nSarajevo, Tuzla, Belgrade, and various places in Croatia--in short, \nfrom having traveled Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia fairly extensively and \nobserving what was going on. I came back and wrote a report, which I \ndelivered to the President and to the Secretary of State, and spoke on \nthe floor of the Senate and to the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nrecommended a policy that came to be referred to as lift and strike and \nsaid that the arms embargo was illegal as well as immoral. After \nspeaking out against the embargo, I introduced the so-called Biden \namendment, which was subsequently adopted by the U.S. Senate during the \nwaning months of the Bush Presidency.\n  The Biden amendment, I would like to remind everyone, is law now. The \nBiden amendment authorized assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina through \na drawdown of up to $50 million in Defense Department stocks of \nmilitary weapons and equipment. As I said, it passed. It became law. It \ngave the President the discretion when to draw down this weaponry.\n  But we heard then from many people who are now suggesting we should \nlift the embargo as well as all those who are against it that this \nweaponry would be of little value to the Bosnian Government and their \narmy, which then as now was made up of Serbs, Croats, and Moslems. \nNearly everyone forgets, incidentally, that when hostilities started \nonly perhaps 60 percent of the Serbs in Bosnia, who made up only a \nportion of the population of Bosnia, were engaged in or supported this \nvile ethnic cleansing.\n  To return to the issue of arms, I was told then--incorrectly--that \nthese Bosnian Moslems, Serbs, and Croats who supported the multiethnic \nBosnian Government would not be able to use these weapons. Supposedly \nthey had to be trained by Americans and other Westerners. I reminded \npeople then and I remind people now who will raise the same argument \nthat every young Bosnian Moslem, every young Bosnian Croat, every young \nBosnian Serb male was conscripted into the Yugoslav Army, trained in \nthe Yugoslav army, and became fully capable of using the weaponry we \nwould send their way.\n  Mr. President, less than a week after we passed the Biden amendment, \non \n\n[[Page S 10293]]\nOctober 5, 1992, I made the following statement.\n\n       Surely the greatest single step the U.N. could take to \n     increase the impact on sanctions on Serbia is to leave the \n     embargo against Serbia in place while lifting the embargo \n     against Bosnia and Herzegovina--an embargo that, however well \n     intentioned--\n\n  I might note parenthetically here, I may have been too generous in \nthat remark--\n\n     has had the undeniable effect of freezing the people of that \n     country in a state of utter defenselessness.\n\n  That was true on October 5, 1992, and now it is clear to the whole \nworld. Since that time I have spoken regularly here on the floor of the \nSenate and elsewhere against the arms embargo on Bosnia, which flies in \nthe face of article 51 of the U.N. Charter, an article that gives every \nmember state the right to self-defense.\n  While we have prevented heavy weapons from reaching the victims of \naggression, we have not prevented the shells from heavy weapons in the \nhands of the Bosnian Serb aggressors from reaching the victims of \naggression. The Bosnian Serb aggressors have been lavishly supplied \nwith tanks, artillery, planes, and even troops by Serbian strongman \nMilosevic.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned my long record of public opposition to \nthis illegal and totally immoral embargo only to remind my colleagues, \nfirst, that the embargo has been strangling an innocent victim for \nyears. This is not new. It is just increasingly more dire.\n  Second, that the issue has been before this House for just as long, \nand each time we have opted not to act decisively, preferring to give \ndiplomacy one more chance. If one more of my colleagues, as much as I \nrespect them, comes up to me on the floor, as several of my Democratic \nand one of my Republican friends recently have, and says privately, \n``Joe, why don't we give diplomacy one more chance?'' my answer will \nbe, because I do not want to be a party to a delay that I know is going \nto result, while we are acting diplomatically, in the corralling of \nyoung Bosnian women into rape camps, in the siphoning off of young boys \nand men into death camps, and in the expulsion of old men and old women \nfrom their home areas by the repulsive practice whose grotesque \neuphemism is ethnic cleansing. Not one single time, not once since \nSeptember 30, 1992, has any delay resulted in anything other than the \ndeath, destruction, humiliation, and genocide of the people of Bosnia.\n  I bring up this history not in the vein of, ``I told you so,'' but to \nremind everybody how long this has been going on and to caution my \ncolleagues not to listen to the siren song of inaction one more time. \nYou can convince me once, maybe, not to act; twice; maybe three times, \nbut 7, 8, 9, 10 times? I challenge anyone in this body to give me one \nshred of evidence that any delay in lifting the embargo has in any \nway--in any way--enhanced the prospect that fewer women in Bosnia will \nbe raped, that fewer young girls will be raped, that fewer men will be \nexterminated, and that fewer older people will be expelled from the \nareas in which their families have lived for centuries. One shred of \nevidence. I challenge any of my colleagues to come to the floor now or \nat any time at their convenience and debate that issue with me.\n  So wait, wait for what?\n  The third reason I bring up the history on this, is that the \nPresident of the United States of America has been and is still \nauthorized to provide $50 million worth of military assistance to \nBosnia. This is authorized without any further congressional action \nrequired, to be delivered as soon as we take the step of lifting the \nembargo.\n  This step has never been more acutely necessary than it is now, Mr. \nPresident. Since the Bosnian Serb aggressors brazenly defied the United \nNations, in a sense the entire civilized world, by overrunning the U.N. \nsafe area in Srebrenica last week, we have now had the whole world see \nwhat I saw and other folks saw firsthand the last time an enclave was \noverrun, as people were driven into Tuzla as I stood there.\n  I was meeting with the aid relief workers, and there was a great \ncommotion. Everyone got up out of the makeshift meeting room we were in \nbecause great big, old, white dump trucks were coming into Tuzla filled \nwith men and women, holding their young children over their heads and \noutside the dump truck. There was an air of relief and celebration, and \nthose of us watching thought this holding up their children was part of \nthe celebration. We were, however, to find out as they unloaded this \ndump truck filled with human beings that the reason they were holding \nup their children was because other children had been trampled \nunderfoot and smothered to death on the last trip from ethnically \ncleansed territory into the safe area of Tuzla.\n  Then the United Nations and the contact group--Russians, French, \nBritish, Germans, Americans--said, ``Tell you what we're going to do. \nThrough the United Nations, we're going to lay out certain safe \nareas,'' which they listed.\n  I remind everybody what the deal was in the safe areas. The deal was \nthat if the Bosnian Government--primarily Moslems, but also some Croats \nand Serbs who supported the Government--if they would give up what few \nweapons they had left in Gorazde and Zepa and Tuzla and Srebrenica, \nthen we, the United Nations, speaking for the world, would guarantee \nthat we would keep the Huns away from the door. We would guarantee that \nthe ethnic cleansing would stop, and we would negotiate.\n  So then they gave up their weapons and, as John McCain and I \nmentioned last week on the floor, all one had to do was hold up any \nnewspaper in America and see--and I am not being critical of the troops \nthat are there personally--blue-helmeted and blue-bereted soldiers \nsitting on armored personnel carriers, sitting on tanks and sitting in \ntrucks, watching as the Bosnian Serbs went in and, before their very \neyes, cleansed, in the same way that the Nazis cleansed when they \ndropped off folks at the Auschwitz train station in cattle cars.\n They found an interesting thing as they observed this vile ethnic \ncleansing. All the young women and all the young girls were sent off in \none direction. The men who were fighting were not seen anywhere. The \nold folks were loaded into trucks with the very young children. And \narmed military personnel sat there, representing the world--they sat \nthere while the Bosnian Serbs, before the very eyes of all the world, \nculled out these folks as if they were cattle. Then, we were told that \nif we lifted the arms embargo, do you know what was going to happen? \nThe Bosnian Serbs might really get mad and overrun the safe areas.\n\n  Mr. President, being as calm as I can about this, let me remind \neveryone that safe areas have already been overrun. I plead with some \nof my colleagues not to come to the floor and tell me what you have \nbeen telling me for 2 years--that if we lift the embargo, the Bosnian \nSerbs will overrun the safe areas. They have already done it in \nSrebrenica, and they are going to do it very soon in Zepa; they are in \nthe process of overrunning it right now. I spoke with the Bosnian \nForeign Minister, and indirectly through him to the Prime Minister, \nonly 2 hours ago. The world has a perverse notion of how to deal with \nthis. The Bosnian Government forces have taken into their protective \ncustody the U.N. protectors of Zepa because of what is going to happen \nif they do not. If they do not, the Serbs will take the U.N. troops and \nthreaten to kill them. Unless the people in Zepa throw down what few \narms they have been able to find, unless they get into trucks, go to \nrape camps and go to death camps, the Bosnian Serbs are going to kill \nsome of those U.N. blue helmet peacekeepers.\n  But how is this being portrayed by the Mr. Akashi of the United \nNations? He says that the Bosnian Government is no different from the \nBosnian Serbs; they are both holding hostage blue-helmeted U.N. \npeacekeepers. What the Bosnian Government forces know, however, is that \nif they do not prevent those blue-helmeted peacekeepers from coming \nunder the control of the Bosnian Serbs, they are dead. Mr. Akashi's \nfallacious moral equivalency is just another example of the twisted \nlogic, the overwhelming rationalization the United Nations and others \nwill undertake to avoid facing the truth of international inaction.\n  Genocide. Genocide. Genocide. That is what this is about. Many of \nthese brutalized Moslems, as we have been reading in the paper, as a \nconsequence of having been raped or otherwise tortured, have committed \nsuicide. When is the last time we read about that in this \n\n[[Page S 10294]]\ncentury? It is not Joe Biden's judgment. World news organizations are \nreporting this now.\n  These war crimes and crimes against humanity are no longer deeds \nknown only by the specialists. They are there for all the world to see. \nThese unspeakable deeds would be horrific enough if the government of \nthose unfortunate people, the Bosnian Government, had been unwilling to \ndefend them.\n  But, Mr. President, the story is far worse than that.\n  The Government of Bosnia has shown for more than 3 years that its \nyoung Moslems, young Croats, and young Serbs, are willing to fight \nagainst a foe with vastly superior weaponry, and to die defending their \nhomes, their wives, their mothers, and their sisters. And what have we \ndone? We have forbidden them to get the arms necessary to defend \nthemselves. Instead, we have opted for the cruel deception of alleging \nthat the U.N. Protection Force would defend them.\n  Well, that has been laid to rest, Mr. President, as an outright \nfabrication.\n  Mr. President, after the last few days, even the most naive American \ncannot hear those words--and I repeat--the U.N. Protection Force--\nwithout being sickened by its Orwellian name.\n  Mr. President, we have to put an end to this madness. We have \ntemporized for far too long. The so-called U.N. Protection Force has \nabdicated its responsibility to the people it had pledged to defend, \nand the contact group's diplomacy is at a dead end.\n  I might add that former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, is right \nthat this U.N. Protection Force is not to blame; it has been the \nexcuse. Many of those folks in the protection force are brave and \ndecent and, from my personally meeting with them on two occasions in \nBosnia--last year in June, and in September 1992--I know that they are \nrepulsed by this, as well. But, Mr. President, their mandate is not to \nget involved. For that, I blame the West--not the United Nations, but \nthe West.\n  Mr. President, the least the United States can do is to allow the \nvictims of oppression to defend themselves. We must lift this illegal, \nimmoral arms embargo now. As an original cosponsor of the Dole-\nLieberman legislation, and of previous legislation, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 21.\n  Mr. President, I might add that in order to get more votes --and I do \nnot say that critically--Senators Dole and Lieberman have apparently \nalready decided to amend the legislation to allow the President the \nright to postpone lifting the embargo for 30 days at a crack if he \nbelieves that the safe and secure completion of the U.N. personnel \nwould otherwise be endangered. I understand the intention of this \nwaiver. But I respectfully suggest, Mr. President, that this waiver \nwill only invite the rabid minority of Bosnian Serbs led by Karadzic \nand General Mladic and his genocidal troops to go after the U.N. forces \nas they withdraw, or American forces if they are moved in to help them \nwithdraw.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I say that we have made a botch of our \npolicy in the former Yugoslavia in two successive administrations. \nPresident Bush started this awful policy off. He handed it off to \nPresident Clinton, and, unfortunately, in my view, this administration \nhas not reacted because of the need to find NATO unity. But there is no \nunity on this, Mr. President. We should get on the right side of \nhistory. We should get on the side that makes the most sense. We should \nget on the side of morality.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that there is no need for any American \nforces in order to lift the embargo. The Moslems have a right to be \nable to defend themselves. I will end with a quote from the Prime \nMinister of Bosnia, who, 2 years ago, was Foreign Minister. I have said \nthis to my colleagues before, but I want to remind them, and maybe even \nawaken their consciences a little bit.\n  I held a meeting in my conference room and invited about a dozen \nSenators of both parties. The then Foreign Minister, now Prime Minister \nHaris Silajdzic--all of you have met him by now, I suspect--was there. \nWhen I made the case for lifting the arms embargo and using air power \nto protect peacekeepers and others while they moved, one of my \ncolleagues said, ``I do not want to do that because more death will \nresult.\n If the U.N. force leaves, more of your people will die.''\n\n  This Senator was very sincere, because that was the wisdom of the \nmoment. Silajdzic looked at this Senator, for whom I have a great deal \nof respect, and said, ``Senator, please, do me a favor. Allow me the \ndignity to choose how I will die. Senator, all the UNPROFOR does for us \nnow is to fatten up my wife, my children, my countrymen, and me to be \nkilled incrementally over the winter and the next spring and the \nsummer. I would rather not have the food and have a weapon. Let me \nchoose how I am going to die. For certain, I will die.''\n  Mr. President, that was not a comment of a man engaging in hyperbole. \nIt is a man who puts his life on the line every day. His predecessor \nsaid the same thing.\n  Please, when this legislation comes up, please, we should get on the \nright side of history and morality and lift the arms embargo that is \nputting the Bosnian Government in a position where they cannot defend \nthemselves. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the pending matter before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Dole amendment to \nS. 21.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the United States is caught in a dilemma. For the past \n3 years we have been working with our allies to bring the warring \nfactions in what was formerly Yugoslavia to a peace settlement and end \nthe pervasive brutality against innocent men, women, and children.\n  As we have pursued this diplomatic track, the United States has \nrefused to become involved militarily on the ground to halt the \naggression against civilian populations or punish the root sources of \nthe aggression, the Bosnian Serbs against the Bosnian Moslems.\n  The fact is that there is no political will in America for a level of \ninvolvement that may result in Americans dying in Bosnia. It is, as \nmany proponents of the legislation are fond of saying, a European \nproblem.\n  American national security interests are not at stake, it is said. \nLet the Europeans get their own house in order.\n  On its face, Mr. President, that sounds reasonable enough. It is \nalso, as it has most unfortunately turned out, a convenient exercise in \nface saving for us. It has not worked, obviously. Clearly, the efforts \nthus far have not stopped the fighting and the killing. There is no \npeace settlement. The U.N. peacekeepers have been ineffective shields \nagainst Serb forces who regard human flesh as fodder and ravenous eyes \ncast on innocent people, penned in like sheep waiting to be \nslaughtered.\n  As a nation, we are outraged at the dark turn of events. The chorus \ncries louder and more demanding. Something must be done. The United \nStates must lead. The United States recognizes the problem, but the \nefforts of the Europeans have failed.\n  There has emerged a political scapegoat theory by some Republicans \nand some Democrats alike. It is called ``Clinton bashing.'' Blame the \nPresident and his leadership, even though I suggest that George \nWashington could not have led such a collection of wet noodles.\n  Here lies our dilemma. Our moral outrage has led to an overwhelming \ndesire to do something--anything--to halt Serb aggression. But there is \nan important restriction on any action that we take: no American can be \nput at risk. In what is the messiest, most intractable crisis the world \nhas known in this decade, we want a neat, antiseptic solution.\n  I think it is time for a little realism. I do not think it is going \nto happen, but we should try. The die is cast. Many of my closest \ncolleagues in the Senate do not see this as I do. They may be correct. \nI think not.\n  The bill before the Senate now is not a solution, and it does not \nfill the leadership vacuum with respect to Bosnia that so many lament. \nIt says let us lift the embargo and let the chips fall where they may. \nAt least we will feel better about ourselves knowing that we have \nremoved an impediment against the Bosnian forces trying to defend \nthemselves, and it keeps our hands clean.\n  I have heard a lot about ``heavy lifting'' in the Senate over the \nyears. \n\n[[Page S 10295]]\n While we have been talking about S. 21, it is often referred to as \nlifting. It should not be confused with the substance or the wisdom of \nS. 21. S. 21 is foreign policy light. It represents an approach that \nstarts a course of events in motion without being honest enough to \nadmit the resulting likely consequences. S. 21 is like a mischievous \nboy who lights the end of a firecracker and then runs a safe distance \nout of harm's way.\n  Mr. President, I say those nations that have displayed the courage \nand put their soldiers in Bosnia should not be undercut. Our allies, \nthe British, the French, the Dutch, and others are on the ground in \nBosnia. We are by our own wishes not. They have lost dozens of their \ntroops to snipers, to mortars, to mines, in an attempt to keep the \nforces of slaughter at bay. We have not.\n  The question each of us should consider before we vote for S. 21 is \nwhether it is right to force a decision on our own allies when we enjoy \nthe luxury of not being involved, when our forces are not at risk.\n  I am not a supporter of the embargo against Bosnia, and I do not \nbelieve that the U.N. peacekeepers are effectively protecting the \nsupposedly civilian safe areas. However, let the Bosnians go to the \nUnited Nations and ask that the peacekeepers leave. To date, they have \nnot. Or if the situation on the ground in Bosnia becomes untenable, let \nthe nations with troops in Bosnia make the decision that it is best for \nthem to leave. After all, they are risking their lives to protect \ninnocent Bosnians. That should count for something when it comes to the \nquestion of who decides that the forces should be withdrawn.\n  The decision should be made without having the Senate lighting a \nfirecracker under the seat and then running away.\n  Perhaps the most important part of S. 21 is what it does not say. It \ndoes not say what damage will result to NATO if the United States \ndecides to break with our allies on the question of the embargo.\n  It does not say that a United States decision to unilaterally lift \nthe embargo will endanger compliance with existing embargoes against \nSerbia, Iraq, Libya, or with economic sanctions against rogue nations \nin the future.\n  It does not say that passage of the bill will precipitate the removal \nof peacekeeping forces which in turn will involve American forces for \nthe possible purpose of extraction.\n  It does not face up to this consequence and authorize the President \nto use military forces to safely remove our allies from Bosnia. They \nare silent on that, evidently by design.\n  It does not recognize the safe areas may be protected in western \nBosnia despite Serb actions in the east and the withdrawal of \npeacekeepers there.\n  It does not mention how many more civilians will die when the Serbs \nstep up their attacks before the arms reach the Bosnian Moslem forces \nunder the theory of lifting the embargo.\n  It does not explain that an infusion of arms from Serbian and Slavic \nallies will flow freely to counter the arms embargo against Bosnia, \nlikely resulting in heavier fighting and more killing.\n  It does not talk about who will arm and train the Bosnians and how \nmuch it will cost. Do we bear a significant portion of that?\n How much? It is not surprising that S. 21 is silent on these \nquestions. It not only has the United States light the firecracker \nunderneath our allies and then run off, it has us look the other way \nconveniently as well. We do not want to know the consequences of our \nactions or deal with the details. We want a shot of cortisone to allay \nour guilt complex in the pretense of leadership. Cortisone is not a \ncure for cancer.\n\n  The well-meaning S. 21, in my opinion, will make a bad situation \nworse. If the authors of the bill feel its passage is necessary due to \nthe lack of coherent, effective policy in Bosnia, they have failed to \nstep up with an approach that will end the fighting. S. 21, in my \nopinion, is very likely to inflame the fighting to new heights \nresulting in the deaths and the horrible situation for refugees and the \natrocities that are so rampant in that area.\n  Mr. President, it is a scapegoat approach. It is cleaner and neater \nand more antiseptic for the United States to unilaterally lift the arms \nembargo and thumb our noses at our allies. Such an action is \ncounterproductive and obviously endangers an alliance that has \nfurthered the cause of peace on the continent for 50 years. When it \ncomes to the crisis in Bosnia, we are not participants in the solution. \nWe are removed observers who cannot accept that the situation has \nturned sour. I am reminded of a quotation that, ``For every complex \nproblem there is a solution that is both simple and wrong.'' S. 21 in \nits present form, in the opinion of this Senator, is such a solution.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 21, the \nBosnian Self-Defense Act. I want to commend the majority leader for his \nstrong and principled leadership in responding to the escalating crisis \nin Bosnia. His decisive move to bring this legislation to a vote may \nprove to be a turning point for U.S. policy in the Balkans. I, like \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have had grave \nreservations about our Bosnian policy for several years, and even the \nhearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have done little, if \nanything, to alleviate my concerns. Frankly, I am amazed at this \nadministration's refusal to recognize numerous foreboding signs for the \nU.N. mission in Bosnia.\n  On May 8, the General Accounting Office released a report on the so-\ncalled peace operations in Bosnia. In that report GAO states that \n``UNPROFOR has been ineffective in carrying out mandates leading to \nlasting peace in the former Yugoslavia.'' Moreover, it continues, \n``UNPROFOR's limited effectiveness to deter attacks and provide \nprotection stems from an approach to peacekeeping that is dependent on \nthe constant cooperation of the warring parties.'' And finally, GAO \nconcludes, ``UNPROFOR [has] lost credibility as a peacekeeping force * \n* *''\n  I point out this report was released before the Bosnian Serbs took \nhundreds of U.N. peacekeepers hostage, before the Serbs shot down an \nAmerican pilot on a NATO operation and before the Serbs began storming \nso-called U.N. safe areas.\n  Mr. President, the GAO's report foreshadowed what many in Congress \nhave now concluded, that is, the U.N. operation in Bosnia has failed \nand is moving toward a state of complete collapse. UNPROFOR cannot even \nmeet the most minimal of its mandates. The U.N. force can no longer \nprotect itself, let alone civilians in safe areas. Moreover, the \nongoing offensive by Bosnian Serb forces against U.N.-declared safe \nareas has underscored the folly of the arms embargo. Imposed before \nBosnia even officially existed, the embargo has consistently denied the \nBosnians the right to defend themselves. There is not one Member of \nCongress, not one member of the State Department, and not one member of \nthe Clinton administration who would deny that the arms embargo has \nallowed the Bosnian Serbs to preserve a powerful military advantage.\n  With the help of the arms embargo, the 80,000-man Bosnian Serb \nmilitia has dominated 70 percent of Bosnia through its near monopoly of \nheavy weapons. Even with 200,000 soldiers, the Bosnian Government \nsimply cannot compete. The occupation of U.N. safe areas by Bosnian \nSerbs is the beginning of the end for the U.N. mission. It is another \ngruesome admission of how the arms embargo continues to condemn the \nBosnian people to a slow death. In Srebrenica, Bosnian troops actually \noutnumbered the attacking Serbs, but the Serb forces had far more \nfirepower. Bosnian forces had no tanks or artillery with which to \ndefend themselves, and once again the United Nations waited too long to \ncall in NATO, too late for airstrikes to make a difference.\n  Now, the opponents of lifting the arms embargo have repeatedly said \nthey fear the Serbs would make a grab for the ``safe areas'' in eastern \nBosnia. But the Serbs have not waited, even with the embargo in place \nand UNPROFOR on the ground. The United Nations, with American \nassistance, is perpetuating a cruel hoax on the Bosnian people. We \nforce them to fight without adequate defenses, promise to protect them \nfrom hostile Serb troops, \n\n[[Page S 10296]]\nand then let them fend for themselves when they are attacked.\n  So far the American taxpayers have provided $2.5 billion to support \nthe U.N. operations in Bosnia and they continue to support UNPROFOR to \nthe tune of $500 million a year. Added to this sum is the \nadministration's new pledge to provide another $95 million in cash and \nmilitary equipment to the European rapid reaction force. Now, this \nlatest action was taken in spite of strong congressional opposition, \nand it only threatens to deepen United States involvement in the \nBosnian quagmire. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration seems \ndetermined to sink or swim with the status quo policy in Bosnia. If the \nPresident continues to stay the course, he will be in danger of \ndragging down the Bosnian people, along with American and NATO \ncredibility.\n  Supporters of lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia are often accused of \nbeing naive and unrealistic. I am neither. Ending the embargo is far \nfrom a perfect solution. There are many logistical questions that \nremain to be worked out. But given the events of the last few months, \nlet alone the last few weeks in Bosnia, I see no other option in a \ncivil war with no end in sight and with no peace agreement within \nreach.\n  It is those who support the current Bosnian policy who have lost \ntouch with reality. The U.N. peacekeeping mission cannot sustain itself \nin a country where there is no peace to keep. The United Nations has \nnever been equipped to enforce peace on factions that are still \nspoiling for war. It is time for the administration to stop acting as \nif some miracle will occur to save the day.\n  Just last month the House of Representatives approached an end to the \narms embargo with a bipartisan and veto-proof vote of 318 to 99. I urge \nmy colleagues to follow that example and also send a strong message of \nour own to the President by voting for S. 21. I believe it is the least \nwe can do for the Bosnians and the very least that the American people \ncan expect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appear once again, briefly, to support \nthe majority leader and my distinguished friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, in the proposal which they have before the Senate to \nterminate the arms embargo against Bosnia.\n  Other than to add my voice to that cause, I can add nothing to the \neloquence of what they have already said. What began as a policy of \nconvenience and a seeking for time and a diplomatic solution on the \noccasion of the breakup of Yugoslavia, has not only proven to be a \npolicy failure, a significant contributor to the loss of thousands of \nlives, and war crimes unmatched in Europe since the era of the Nazis, \nit has degenerated into a moral swamp, in which the actions of the \nUnited States and the United Nations contribute only to the success of \nthe aggressors, to the success of those who have proposed this barbaric \nsystem, based on the religious background of the people of Bosnia.\n  We are fond of saying, as a number of newspapers have, that the time \nhas come to end that arms embargo.\n  In truth, Mr. President, the time came long since. The distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden] in his remarks an hour or so ago, \nreferred to statements that he made in the fall of 1992 which were \nvalid then and are valid today.\n  The particular occasion for the debate over this resolution today, of \ncourse, is the latest set of atrocities on the part of the Bosnian \nSerbs, the destruction of what we had long trumpeted as a safe haven, \nthe rape of some, the murder of others, the driving out of most of the \ncitizens that were supposedly protected in that safe haven.\n  Mr. President, I think the failure of our policies and our \nproclamations cannot better be summarized than it was indirectly in two \nparagraphs in a story from last Friday's Washington Post about those \ncitizens driven out of Srebrenica to a temporarily safe haven \nelsewhere. I want to quote those two paragraphs from that news story.\n\n       ``This is Major's work,'' yelled a man on crutches, \n     referring to British Prime Minister John Major. ``It is \n     Clinton's work, too. Clinton--always talking so nice and \n     doing nothing.''\n       ``They had better take a gun and kill us all,'' one woman \n     said. And waving her arms towards the masses of dazed people \n     who made up the weeping, nearly hysterical crowd, she added: \n     ``Look at what you did for us, all you governments.''\n\n  That is a tiny portion of the human price we have paid for this arms \nembargo, for all of the threats not backed up, for all of the promises \nthat got broken, for all of the lives lost. And have we done this in \norder to protect the lives of Americans? No, Mr. President. Just \nrecently we had one of our Air Force pilots shot down over Bosnia--\nrescued by a magnificent feat of arms, and celebrated here in this \ncountry for his escape, but those who shot him down remain totally \nunpunished.\n  Can it not be said that perhaps that last, most recent demonstration \nof our lack of dedication led to the overrunning of the safe haven, the \nloss of hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives, and the driving out of \ntens of thousands of others? We have made ourselves contemptible. We \nhave made ourselves a laughingstock. And it is time to end that policy \nnow.\n  Will we save more American lives? No. The President has promised that \nwhen the war is irretrievably lost, and when the U.N. forces want to \ncome out, we will send troops in to save them--undoubtedly at the \nexpense of casualties. Mr. President, that is a wrong policy as well. \nThe correct policy is to end the arms embargo, to allow, to encourage, \nto assist in the arming of people desperately anxious to fight for \ntheir own freedom and probably capable successfully of fighting for \nthat freedom if they are armed with weapons anywhere near equal to \nthose of their aggressors. That was the correct strategy during the \nPresidency of George Bush. It has been the correct policy for the 2\\1/\n2\\ years, at least, of the Presidency of Bill Clinton.\n  Mr. President, the policies in which we have engaged have undercut, \nif they have not destroyed completely, our own credibility--not just in \nthe Balkans, but all over the world. They have not only failed to \nsucceed in ending or limiting the war, they have encouraged it. They \nhave not discouraged aggression, they have encouraged it. They have not \nlimited ethnic cleansing, they have increased it. And it is time to end \nthose failed policies. It is time, at the very least, to allow the \nvictims to fight for their own liberties.\n  It is also time--not at all incidentally, Mr. President, in my view--\nto end the arms embargo against Croatia and Slovenia as well. Slovenia \nis not in the news yet. It had succeeded in winning its independence \nand has been at peace ever since. It threatens no one. There is no \nreason in the world not to lift the embargo against it. Croatia is 25 \npercent occupied by a dissident government which is engaged in some, \nthough not all, of the same practices of their compatriots, the Bosnian \nSerbs.\n  The only way there is any possibility in this case of proving that \naggression and ethnic cleansing and rape and murder do not pay is to \nallow the victims of those crimes to be able to liberate themselves \nfrom those crimes.\n  So I believe the two principal sponsors of this resolution, the \nmajority leader and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who are \nnow on the floor, are proposing exactly what the United States ought to \ndo and I wish to express the hope that the Senate will promptly and \noverwhelmingly vote in favor of their resolution.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nBosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support S. 21, the bill to terminate the \nillegal and immoral arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. It is \n\n[[Page S 10297]]\ntime we abandoned this morally and politically bankrupt policy. It is \nlong past time that we permitted the victims of ethnic genocide to \ndefend themselves; it is time we stand for a policy that may not \nguarantee an easy outcome, but that will put the United States on the \nside of principle.\n  That principle is the right to self-defense against conquest by \naggression, the right to self-defense against ethnic genocide.\n  The time has come to declare our intentions to aid the victims in the \nbloodiest war to wreak mayhem in Europe since World War II. For too \nlong the international community has been hamstrung by diplomatic \ninertia; for too long have sympathetic nations of the world been \nfrustrated by U.N. and European reluctance to act; for too long have we \nwatched United States policy flit about while Bosnia has suffered \nattacks against civilians, mass deportations, rape, and ethnic \ngenocide. Washington dithers while Sarajevo burns.\n  We cannot allow the Serbs to continue with their aggression by \ncontinuing to tie the hands of those who wish to defend themselves. The \narms embargo has played into the hands of these aggressors; it has \nfailed to make the moral distinction between the victims and the \narchitects of genocide.\n  The fall of Srebrenica demonstrates the collapse of the multinational \nmission and the hollowness of U.S. support for it. I believe it is past \ntime for the Clinton administration to abandon this failed policy, \nrather than continue to make pathetic attempts to rationalize or \nperpetuate it.\n  Some have noted that the arms embargo is a carryover of the Bush \nadministration policy on Bosnia. This is true, Mr. President, and I \nurged President Bush to lift it then. The situation has grossly \nworsened in the 2\\1/2\\ years since he left office, and it is now \nPresident Clinton's responsibility to deal with this international \nhorror.\n  Last month, Bosnia's Prime Minister made another visit to Washington. \nTo meet with him was to meet with a man fighting for the very existence \nof his country. I saw him after he went to the White House to meet with \nVice President Gore. The Vice President used to be a supporter of \nlifting the embargo when he was a member of this body. At the White \nHouse, he told Prime Minister Silajdzic that the administration would \ncontinue to oppose a lift, because a lift would incite the Serbs to \nattack the safe havens.\n  The administration had it exactly wrong. The fall of Srebrenica last \nweek demonstrates the collapse of the multinational mission and, with \nits failure, the failure of U.S. policy supporting it. Now, if anything \ngood can come out of these horrors, it must be that this body will vote \nto lift the embargo now.\n  Over the past week we have all been horrified by the pictures and \nstories coming from Srebrenica, Zepa, and Sarajevo. There is no reason \nto repeat the horror here, nor is there any excuse to act as if these \nlatest outrages against humanity have been of any surprise. I can only \nlament that it did not have to come to this.\n  Many of us who have followed this war have concluded long ago that \nSerbia and its proxies would not cease in its pursuit of a Greater \nSerbia. After we saw that the Serbs would use the horror of ethnic \ngenocide as an instrument of war, we could not be surprised about the \ndevelopments we saw over the past 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  We could not be surprised when the Serbs continued to attack the \ncivilian population of the so-called safe havens.\n  We could not be surprised when the Serbs starved Bihac.\n  We could not be surprised that pinprick airstrikes emboldened the \nSerbs.\n  We could not be surprised when the Serbs took U.N. hostages last \nmonth.\n  And, finally, we could not be surprised when it was revealed that \nU.N. Special Envoy Akashi had recently sent a secret letter to the \nBosnian Serbs assuring them that the United Nations would not seek \nconfrontation with them.\n  And no one, Mr. President, should have been surprised to learn that \nBelgrade continues to supply and assist its Serbian proxies in Bosnia \nand Croatia.\n  We were dismayed, yes. Outraged, yes. But no one who has been \nwatching this war could be surprised.\n  No one, perhaps, except the policymakers at the White House and State \nDepartment. From the constantly shifting statements of the \nadministration, however, it appears that every development has caught \nthem off guard. Their only constancy has been their insistence on \nrefusing the Bosnians the right to defend themselves. This has become \nincomprehensible.\n  Today's U.S. policy lies in tatters. It is the product of a misplaced \nbelief in multilateralism. An exaggerated estimate of a ruthless but \nthird-rate foe. A solipsistic faith in the selfless intent of \ndictators. And an immature and myopic view of geopolitics.\n  This administration supported the U.N. missions in Bosnia and \nCroatia. Many of these peacekeepers bravely put their lives on the line \nfeeding the captives in the safe havens. But they never had a peace to \nkeep; they disarmed the victims and aggressors alike, but when the \naggressors challenged them by violating Security Council resolution \nafter resolution, the United Nations feared calling in NATO air \nsupport.\n  When the planes came, as rarely they did, they delivered pinprick \nstrikes, destroying a tent here, a truck there. The Serbs laughed and \nbecame emboldened. The United Nations became more reluctant to engage. \nThe Security Council resolutions enacted in New York City became \nworthless documents in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, and the other towns of \nBosnia.\n  The United Nations, without a peace to keep, kept the borders set by \nthe aggressors; and if the peacekeepers dared challenge the Serbs, they \nwere taken as hostages.\n  Multilateralism failed because multilateralism was incapable of \nacting on the distinction between victim and aggressor. As a result, \nmultilateralism engendered a policy of deference to the aggressor and \nindifference to victims.\n  The longer this dynamic went unchallenged, the larger the myth of \nSerb power grew. Despite the stories of a supine Serbian economy, \ndespite the reports of thousands of military-age men fleeing Serbia, \ndespite the reprehensible and cowardly behavior of any army that could \nonly terrorize unarmed civilian populations, policymakers around the\n world, including many in our State Department, began to accept the \nnotion of the formidable foe.\n\n  They confused the ability to commit unspeakable acts with the ability \nto sustain a popularly supported war. Even today, so many analysts do \nnot include military assessments of the capabilities of the combatants. \nBut when they do take a hard look at Serbian and Bosnian capabilities, \nthey seem to reach the same conclusion: The Bosnians have the advantage \nin men and morale; the Serbs, heirs of the Yugoslav Army, have the \nadvantage in heavy weapons. And from these assessments we must conclude \nagain: If we seek to achieve a shift in this war, we must lift the \nembargo; we must provide the Bosnians with the weapons they need.\n  Further emboldening the Serbs was the administration's attempts at \ndiplomacy. Taking its diplomatic cue last spring from Russian Foreign \nMinister Kosyrev--an ally of the Serbs--the administration believed \nthat it could persuade Serbia's Milosevic to pressure Radovan Karadzic \nto a negotiated peace.\n  This is one of the most self-deluding diplomatic strategies in modern \ntimes, and the administration feigned belief--or maybe, incredibly, \nactually believed--that Milosevic could be a broker for peace. \nRepresentatives of the administration actually stated that Milosevic \nand Karadzic were competing, and had differing interests. Instead of \nlifting the arms embargo on the embattled Bosnians, the administration \noffered to lift the economic embargo on Serbia, which, most analysts \nagreed, was actually having an affect on Serbia's ability to wage war.\n  This notion that Milosevic would curb Karadzic was, of course, \nridiculous, but the administration persisted. They offered lifting the \nsanctions if Milosevic recognized Bosnia and Croatia. When he refused, \nthe administration lowered its demands and asked Milosevic to recognize \njust Bosnia--a move that could have threatened, at that time, to \nshatter the federation between Bosnia and Croatia, which the \nadministration had claimed was its single greatest accomplishment in \nthis \n\n[[Page S 10298]]\ncrisis. Milosevic, no fool, knew that he could gain more and refused.\n  Meanwhile, the evidence kept coming that Milosevic continued to \nprovide armaments to his proxies in Bosnia and Croatia. No one could \nreally be surprised, but many of our allies, and this Administration, \nlooked the other way.\n  And then Scott O'Grady was shot down by a SAM missile--a NATO jet on \na mission to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions was downed by \nthe Bosnian Serbs. And NATO did not retaliate. History's most \nsuccessful military alliance--the world's most impressive military \nforce--did not retaliate when a third-rate army that specializes in \ntorturing civilian populations shot down one of its planes. And we did \nnot retaliate when the evidence was revealed that Belgrade had a hand \nin this, and that Milosevic's army provided parts maintenance, computer \nand radar support for the SAM system that shot down our F-16.\n  Mr. President, how much evidence do we need that Milosevic and \nKaradzic work hand-in-hand? How much more humiliation should we take \nbefore we recognize that our diplomacy is based on fatuous delusions?\n  One of my greatest concerns throughout this conflict has been the \nadministration's inability to see this crisis in the greater context of \nEurope. Specifically, it has refused to recognize the role that Russia \nhas played in supporting the Serbs, in frustrating any resolution that \nwould be fair to the Bosnians, and in undermining the Western alliance. \nI am disturbed that very few appear to be focusing on Russia's role in \nthis crisis.\n  One of Russia's primary foreign policy goals has been to obstruct the \nexpansion of NATO. Last month, when the Russians finally decided to \nsign on to the President's Partnership for Peace Program, Foreign \nMinister Kozyrev stated that NATO must ``cease to be a military bloc'' \nand must abandon policies of enlargement. Last week, Yuri Baturin, \nnational security adviser to Boris Yeltsin, said that the war in Bosnia \nis a test of strength between Russia and the West. President Clinton \nhas repeatedly declared that Russia will not exercise a veto over NATO \nexpansion. But I must wonder, Mr. President, when the SAM missile of a \nRussian ally shoots down a NATO jet over Europe, could not this be \nconstrued as a veto over NATO?\n  I believe that if Russia wants to try its strength against the West \nby backing the forces of ethnic genocide and by using diplomacy to \nprevent a just settlement in Bosnia and obstruct NATO enlargement, then \nwe should, again, engage in the challenge. We must lift the embargo and \narm the Bosnians. We will be, again and finally, on the side of the \nmorally defensible.\n  The conflagration in the Balkans, the West's confusion, and America's \nlack of leadership are casting a pall over the prospect of a NATO \nenlargement.\n  NATO is not credible when it inflicts pinprick strikes instead of \neffective bombing sorties. NATO is not credible when the Serbs can \ncheck it by taking hostages.\n  NATO cannot be credible if its stands idly by when its planes are \ndowned by a third-rate power.\n  Mr. President, it is time to abandon this failed policy.\n  While the Clinton administration has wrung its hands, vacillated, and \ndeferred to inconsistent allies, many Members in this body, led by the \ndistinguished majority leader, have declared for some time that the \nonly sensible policy after years of inept and immoral policies is to \nlift the arms embargo. To demonstrate how important this issue was, \nSenators Dole and Lieberman introduced S. 21 on the first day of this \nhistoric Congress.\n  The Bosnians are willing to fight for the right to exist as a \npeaceful and democratic nation that respects ethnic rights. They have \nnot asked us to defend them, they only ask that we allow them to defend \nthemselves. ``We don't need you to die for us,'' Prime Minister \nSilajdzic said here on his last visit, barely two weeks after his \nForeign Minister was blown out of the sky over Bihac by Serb rockets. \n``We know very well how to do this ourselves.''\n  But it seems that some outside observers are in a state of weariness \nbrought on by years of inaction against a war of brutal slaughter. We \nwant it to stop; we want the suffering to cease. But we must not \nconfuse our righteous repugnance for human suffering with the Bosnian \ngovernment's heroic commitment to defend itself.\n  The Bosnians have a right to defend themselves. Article 51 of the \nU.N. Charter clearly articulates a nation's right to defend itself from \nhostile aggression. The majority of the nations of the United Nations \nhave agreed.\n  Lifting the embargo will lead to the removal of U.N. peacekeepers. \nThese troops have not kept the peace. They have been hostage bait. And, \nwhile they have sometimes fought bravely in recent months, their \npresence over the years has, in too many cases, legitimized Serbian \ngains. For the United Nations to stay would mean the symbolic defeat of \npeacekeeping. For the United Nations to leave would indicate that we \nare ready to return to reality.\n  I believe that the U.S. should assist in the withdrawal of the \nUNPROFOR troops. I say so reluctantly, because I do not believe this \nwar requires a role for U.S. ground troops. But I will support the \nPresident if he chooses to assist our allies in the withdrawal, \nprovided that the conditions the majority leader has laid out are \nstrictly observed:\n  First, a withdrawal must occur under NATO or U.S. command. There must \nbe no U.N. role in the command structure.\n  Second, the rules of engagement must be clear to any potential \nantagonists: Any attack on U.S. troops will be met with massive and \ndisproportionate retaliatory attacks. If the Serbs take one shot at a \nUnited States soldier or a blue helmet that we are escorting out, the \nUnited States will retaliate anywhere in Bosnia or Serbia proper.\n  And finally, U.S. troops are not there to extract equipment. Any \nmilitary materiel that could fall into Serb hands must be destroyed, if \npossible, but we will not engage troops for anything but the rescue of \npersonnel.\n  S. 21 will put into motion a policy that will not bring us peace, but \nit will allow for the possibility of a real peace. By lifting the arms \nembargo on beleaguered Bosnia, this bill will allow for the only kind \nof peace that has worked through history: a peace gained by a balance \nof power on the ground.\n  But this will not be a peace guaranteed or easily achieved. We cannot \nrealistically or responsibly let the issue stop here. We know that the \nchances of increasing the hostilities are great, although a strong \nsignal from the United States in defense of Bosnia will certainly \nconvey a level of seriousness to the Serbs that they have not yet seen, \nand we should not rule out the possibility that they may respond to \nthis signal with the realization that the terms of the conflict are \nabout to get much worse for them. However, since the Serbs have \ndemonstrated a reckless intent to conquer by genocide, we should not \ndelude ourselves with hopes of an easy settlement.\n  For this reason, I believe we must concomitantly begin the debate \nabout military assistance to Bosnia. We should declare our support for \nBosnia through a program of immediate provisions of military aid and \ncontinued humanitarian assistance. In addition, I believe we must also \nlift the embargo against Croatia, which has also been a victim of \nSerbian aggression, and without which we cannot effect a successful \nprogram to assist the Bosnians.\n  Mr. President, I also believe that we must consider the use of air \nstrikes--during the extraction of UNPROFOR and while we arm the \nBosnians. In addition to providing the necessary support for the \nBosnian government, these air strikes can demonstrate--for the future \nreference of those who have witnessed NATO's hapless performance to \ndate--that the West is capable of using its military might effectively.\n  I have always stated that our policy in Bosnia should not require the \ncommitment of United States ground troops. U.S. troops should not be \ninvolved in any mission but the support for an UNPROFOR extraction. It \nhas been but one of the many straw men put out by this Administration \nthat lifting the arms embargo would require the commitment of U.S. \ntroops. The administration is either cynically manipulating a \nlegitimate concern of the American people in order to rationalize a \nfailed foreign policy, or it is truly naive in assessing the military \nand geopolitical realities of the Balkan conflict.\n  Mr. President, I wish to state very clearly that my objection to our \ncurrent foreign policy is not partisan. As \n\n[[Page S 10299]]\nyou have seen, some of the most articulate in this body in favor of \nlifting the embargo are Democrats. As I stated earlier, I strongly \ncriticized President Bush's support for the arms embargo. As a matter \nof fact, I was encouraged when Governor Clinton, during his \npresidential campaign, advocated lifting the embargo. I am, of course, \ndisappointed that now President Clinton has appeared so irresolute.\n  I believe the Bosnian crisis may permanently shatter the moral \nstature of our country. The crisis has already severely harmed the \ncredibility of the United Nations. Much more importantly, it threatens \nthe future of NATO, which had been the most successful military \nalliance in modern history. And it has put the United States--the \nworld's remaining superpower--on the sidelines, while Bosnia burns.\n  Foreign policy should not be an exercise in naivete or cynicism. It \nshould be a discipline requiring the highest order of judgment, soberly \nsteeped in the awareness that the affairs of mankind are imperfect and \nrecognizing that real options cannot offer panaceas to the bloody \nintents of the brutal. But U.S. foreign policy has often stood for more \nthan the pragmatic: Our foreign policy, at its best, has been vitalized \nby principle.\n  We should be able to make clear distinctions about Bosnia. We should \nbe able to declaim against genocide and put our actions where our \ndenunciations are. We must abandon a policy that has been resolute in \nits lack of determination. We can make no argument for supporting an \narms embargo that perpetuates genocide. And we must declare that we \nbelieve in the right of self-defense.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. Dole. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in just a minute or two I will ask that we \nstand in recess until 5:15 p.m, because the Republicans have a \nconference, and I think a number of my colleagues on the other side are \nat the White House discussing with the President the Bosnian \nresolution. There may be a chance we might bring up the rescission \npackage tonight, too. I need to talk to Senator Daschle about that. So \nwe will be under a strict time agreement, a limited number of \namendments, and an agreement that the leadership on each side will vote \nagainst the amendments, as well as most of our colleagues, because this \nis something that has taken a long time because of a couple of \nSenators, who certainly are within their rights. But if we cannot reach \nthat agreement, we will not bring it up.\n  I want to say just one additional word on this resolution.\n  Yesterday I addressed some of the criticism made by opponents of our \nlegislation, and there are just a couple others I want to review at \nthis point. The first criticism is that the legislation is unilateral \nin nature. Yes, this bill is unilateral. It provides that the United \nStates will lift the arms embargo only after UNPROFOR withdraws--I \nwould like to repeat, after withdrawal of the United Nations protection \nforces. This fact is being ignored by the administration and by some of \nour allies.\n  In my view, unilateral action as provided by this legislation is \nhardly a negative, but a positive. What the last 3 years of \nmultilateral hand-wringing have demonstrated is that if the United \nStates does not lead, action is not taken. It is time for leadership. \nWe have been waiting, waiting and waiting for leadership. And so far \nnothing has happened. We are witnessing this right now. Thousands of \ncivilians have begun to flee Zepa, as the Serbs close in. The United \nNations has written Zepa off. And the hand-wringing is beginning with \nrespect to Gorazde--the third eastern enclave. If Gorazde goes, that \nwill be three out of six safe havens have been overrun. The French \nreportedly have a proposal for Gorazde that they are advocating. The \nBritish oppose stronger action and want the status quo. The White House \nspokesman says the administration is ``leaning'' toward action--but is \nnot clear if the main objective is to forestall the fall of Gorazde or \nthwart this legislation.\n  In fact, the White House press secretary said this is a nutty idea. \nWell, I hope he tells that to Senator Moynihan and Senator Biden and \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Feinstein and other Democrats who are \nsupporting us. If it is a nutty idea, I am certain they would not want \nto have anything to do with it.\n  It is not a nutty idea. It is an idea we have been working on for \nyears, Democrats and Republicans, to de-Americanize the conflict, lift \nthe arms embargo, let Bosnia defend themselves without committing \nAmerican troops. That is what it is all about. But I see an effort now \nby the White House at the last moment to stall and not have a vote on \nthis legislation--always something better going to happen; just wait 1 \nmore week, 1 more month. We waited 11 months. It has been 11 months \nsince we had a vote.\n  In any event, leaning toward more aggressive action is not a \nsubstitute for aggressive action. And this is not for airstrikes, which \nthe White House appears to be considering. The obstacle to airstrikes \nhas been and continues to be opposition from some of our allies; \nnamely, the British. Unless that hurdle is overcome, all the reports \nthat the President is ``leaning toward'' airstrikes is meaningless. \nMoreover, while many of us in the United States Congress have urged \nthat NATO conduct something more than pinpricks, we must realize that \nthe robust use of NATO air power now is an appropriate, if overdue, \nreaction to Bosnian Serb action, but does not constitute a policy in \nand of itself.\n  Mr. President, what this bill does is commit the United States to \nleading the way and lifting the arms embargo, but going first does not \nmean going it alone.\n  Last fall, nearly 100 countries--nearly 100 countries--in the United \nNations General Assembly voted in support of lifting the arms embargo--\nover 100 countries. It is not just the United States alone.\n  I believe if the United States was in the lead, others would follow. \nI believe a number of countries, in addition to the United States, \nwould also provide military equipment or the funds to purchase such \nequipment.\n  I also would like to turn for a moment to the argument that UNPROFOR \nis neutral and lifting the arms embargo would eliminate that \nneutrality.\n  First I point out that the U.N. resolutions are clearly not neutral. \nIn imposing sanctions on Serbia, they recognize who the aggressor is. \nIn committing to protecting the safe havens, on paper, they are \nacknowledging that the Bosnians need protection from this aggression. \nFinally, in perpetuating neutrality on the ground operationally, the \nU.N. peacekeepers are helping the very aggressors that have threatened \nto attack not only the Bosnians but the United Nations as well. This is \nnot only absurd but a moral outrage.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on the idea raised by some that \nthere should be another cease-fire and more negotiations. It seems to \nme that for negotiations to be successful in Bosnia, there needs to be \nsome leverage on the side of the Bosnians. Why should the Serbs agree \nto anything when they are given free rein to overrun U.N.-designated \nsafe havens?\n  At this point, the only negotiations that the Serbs might be \ninterested in are the talks to arrange the surrender of the Bosnians. \nWell, the Bosnians are not ready to surrender. They are ready to fight \nand die for their country, if we only let them. That is what this \ndebate is about. It is not Democrat; it is not Republican; it is not \nabout liberal or conservative; it is about the U.S. Senate speaking on \na very important issue. I hope we can have the vote before we adjourn \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10270-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 5:15 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, thank you for the recognition.\n  We are back on the Bosnia debate. In one sense, this debate should \nnot be necessary. In the normal course of events, the President is the \none who holds the duty to provide direction in these matters. I have \nlong believed that our foreign policy ought to be directed by the chief \nexecutive officer and ratified by the Congress--the Senate--but not \nformulated.\n But the situation is far from normal in this instance.\n\n  Our action today on this Bosnia resolution is required by a somewhat \nunusual, maybe unprecedented failure of leadership on a very important \nissue. The credibility of our Nation and the existence of NATO are at \nrisk. But it seems that the administration moves from crisis to crisis \nin Bosnia without a clear definition of what our policy is or ought to \nbe. We have alternated between indifference and almost panic, operating \nwithout purpose and often seemingly without principle.\n  Over 2 years ago, as the policy of ``safe havens'' was being defined, \nI came to this floor expressing a concern and a question. ``A police \naction,'' I said, ``protecting safe havens, will probably stop some \nshort-term suffering, but it will answer few long-term questions. After \nwe purchase a temporary peace for fleeing refugees, what is our \neventual goal?'' I asked. ``On this question,'' I then said, ``this \nadministration is silent.''\n  Now it is 2 years later and that eventual goal is still unclear, and \nthat silence has become a source of considerable embarrassment. For, 2 \nyears later, little has changed. The situation is worse.\n  We have maintained, during that period of time, a one-sided arms \nembargo against Bosnia which has only served to reinforce the \nadvantages enjoyed by the Serb aggressors.\n  We have placed critical command decisions in the hands of \ninternational bureaucrats who have not brought any military experience, \npolitical insight, or even moral courage to their position.\n  We have made a series of threats against Serbian forces that proved \nhollow, empty, undermining our credibility with both friends and foes \nalike around the world.\n  And we have repeatedly misled Bosnian leaders, first opposing and \nthen supporting various initiatives, leaving the Bosnian Vice President \nto conclude ``We are going to die of these initiatives.''\n  Mistake has followed failure in an unending downward spiral as each \nsafe area became progressively unsafe.\n  ``I don't remember a time,'' says one expert, ``when there was so \nmuch scorn for American foreign policy.'' Former British Secretary \nDavid Owen comments, ``To the day I go to my grave, I will not \nunderstand the policy.''\n  The result has been an American retreat into a purely reactive mode. \nOur only role, it seems, is to respond to European proposals and \ninitiatives. The only clear objectives of this administration seem to \nbe to appease our allies and avoid political blame.\n  Now the administration is reduced to floating another French \nproposal, which repeats every error of the past. It calls on us to \nplace more troops into indefensible positions. It demands that we risk \nAmerican lives to prove our loyalty to a failed NATO policy. And once \nagain, it has no diplomatic or military end game. It continues an \naimless and endless commitment.\n  The President of France says the use of American helicopters and \nairmen is necessary ``to place the Americans squarely in front of their \nresponsibilities.'' The effect would be to place our troops squarely in \nfront of bullets as a symbolic commitment to a strategy which no one \nexpects to succeed. It is hard to imagine a policy more destructive to \nAmerican interests or more likely to lead to pointless loss of life.\n  The central problem here is pretty clear. The ``safe haven'' approach \nhas not worked. But even more than that, it could not have worked, even \nwith less United Nations interference, even with more military \ncommitment, because the safe havens were chosen for a humanitarian, not \na military mission. Thus, the deployment of forces on the ground and \nthe equipment they were given was matched for this humanitarian \npurpose, not for a military purpose. The troops were lightly armed and \nthey were heavily restricted.\n  But now we are being asked to expand that mission to a combat role \nfrom militarily indefensible and irrational positions. Each of these \nareas is a Moslem outpost in a sea of Serbian hostility. We are being \nasked to man and defend six exposed and vulnerable enclaves, apparently \nfor an indefinite future.\n  If all this sounds somewhat familiar, it should, because it is a \npolicy that acts as though our experience in Somalia never happened; as \nthough the deaths of those Rangers never took place. We attempted to \nexpand that humanitarian effort into a military operation without \nholding military positions, without adopting military strategies, and \nwithout setting military goals. And under these circumstances, \npeacekeeping became bloodletting and nothing lasting was accomplished.\n  Mr. President, we are accustomed to saying all options in Bosnia are \nbad, which has been used as an excuse for choosing those options which \nare worse. It is increasingly clear to me that only one approach is \njustified.\n  Our goal should be the creation of a viable Bosnian state with \ndefensible borders and the military equipment to uphold them. This goal \nwill never be reached while the embargo remains in force.\n  I believe we are led to this goal by two very direct American \ninterests.\n  First is our strategic interest in the containment of this crisis. \nThe worst possible result here would be for the fighting to extend \nbeyond Bosnia, to spread to Macedonia, Kosovo, and beyond. That would \nbring in other NATO allies and could result in a situation that would \nbe far more difficult in the future than even what we face today. It \nseems to me the best way to make that result difficult and hopefully \nimpossible is to have a viable Bosnian state in the region to provide a \ncheck against Serb aggression.\n  Second, I suggest we have a moral interest and that moral interest is \nan eventual peace agreement between the parties in Bosnia. History \noffers no example of fruitful diplomacy or lasting peace between \nwarring nations where the stronger power has a continued interest in \nconflict. Therefore, trying to \n\n[[Page S 10301]]\nbring both sides into some parity of power will bring them to the \ntable.\n  All along, my problem with removing U.N. forces and lifting the \nembargo has been the safety of the safe havens. Establishing \nindefensible regions and calling them ``safe havens'' was a mistake in \nthe first place, but that is the course we took and now those safe \nhavens exist.\n  The President himself, at the beginning, predicted that these areas \nwould become ``shooting galleries.'' But they were adopted anyway, at \nEuropean insistence, because America offered no alternative.\n  When one top Clinton official was asked why the President accepted \nthis proposal he responded: ``They''--meaning the Europeans--``showed \nup in town with a plan and he had no choice.''\n  But the status of the safe havens has been the most difficult \nobstacle to changing the Bosnian policy. What would happen to these \npeople, to whom we offered the temporary illusion of safety, when the \nUnited Nations left? But that dilemma, tragically, is quickly coming to \nan end. Precisely because these isolated areas only existed at the whim \nof Bosnian Serbs, they are now endangered. An indefinite commitment to \nsafe havens is not, I suggest, a real option.\n  Mr. President, I suggest a new Bosnian policy embody four principles.\n  The first principle, there must be a timetable for withdrawal of \nUNPROFOR, the U.N. Protective Force. British and French troops in \nBosnia are now the primary obstacle to any sensible policy in the \nregion. Whenever anyone suggests some responsible action, like lifting \nthe embargo, we are told that this is impossible because UNPROFOR \nforces, which are primarily British and French and some other nations--\nthose forces would be endangered. In fact every single member of \nUNPROFOR is now a virtual hostage, preventing a reasonable reassessment \nof our goals.\n  One commentator has said, ``The U.N. might as well have deployed \nwomen and children.'' UNPROFOR has proven its inability to achieve its \nstated purpose and now stands as an impediment to a viable alternative \npolicy.\n  The second principle I suggest is that U.S. troops should not be used \nto symbolize our commitment to a failed NATO strategy. We are told that \nthe deployment of American troops is necessary rather than risk further \ndivisions in the Atlantic alliance. But this does nothing to rebuild \nthe reputation of NATO, to join it in a policy that is doomed to fail. \nIn fact, to advance down this path will further undermine NATO's \nfragile credibility. The United States should not accept either the \ndeployment of American forces to defend the safe havens, or the use of \n10,000 American ground troops to help extract French and British \nforces.\n  The Europeans have proposed this commitment to cement American \ninvolvement, not because they are militarily incapable of performing \nthis mission themselves. If we do, however, reach an emergency in which \nthe only means of rescuing the French and British involves a United \nStates role, then I suppose that is part of our duty as an ally, and we \nought to have the capability of responding.\n  In addition, I am not opposed to using American communications, \nlogistic support, and transport to help evacuate UNPROFOR. But this is \nentirely different than sending American infantry and Marines into the \nBosnian quagmire as a show of political solidarity for a failed policy.\n  The third principle that I would advocate is that after UNPROFOR have \nbeen evacuated we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. It is \ncertainly preferable that this be done with the cooperation of our \nallies. But if it cannot be done with their cooperation, I believe that \nwe should take this action unilaterally, as the Dole-Lieberman \nresolution directs.\n  The effect of our current policy has been to deny the legitimate and \ninherent right of Bosnian Moslems to defend themselves. It has also \nprevented the creation of meaningful borders that could contain Serb \naggression in the region. Maintaining the embargo is a violation of \nboth our moral commitments and our direct national interests.\n  In the short term, lifting the embargo may cause the fight to \nintensify. But this is a risk the Bosnians themselves seem eager to \naccept. Even under a crippling embargo, the Bosnians have fought with \ncourage and tenacity. They show increasing organization and capability, \nand the Bosnian Serbs themselves are overextended and plagued by \ndesertions. All the Bosnian Moslems lack are the heavy arms to match \nthe Serbs. Once some balance or parity is achieved, and both sides have \na reason to negotiate, the United States should be aggressive in \nmediating some solution.\n  I am not suggesting that this is a policy without risks. It does \ncarry risks. But there is good reason to believe that Bosnian Moslem \nresistance will not collapse if UNPROFOR leaves. It is the Bosnian \nMoslems themselves that assert they are prepared to assume their \nresponsibilities.\n  I cannot forget the personal plea of the Vice President of Bosnia \nwhen he testified before the Armed Services Committee: ``We repeat over \nand over again: we are not asking you for your troops to fight for us \non the ground. That is our job and our task. But please do not combine \nany more big words with small deeds. God will not forgive you if you do \nnothing. Doing nothing creates a tragedy in Bosnia everyday.''\n  I suggest that the fourth principle underlying our policy is that \nAmerica must provide a serious strategy to contain the carnage in the \nBalkans. The flashpoints of future conflict are Macedonia and Kosovo. \nHere is where NATO has a compelling interest in building and fortifying \na barrier against aggression.\n  Currently, in these regions, we do not have a deterrent, only a \ntripwire under ineffective U.N. control. NATO should assume full \ncontrol of this operation, not as a confused humanitarian effort, but \nas a serious military commitment.\n  This, in general, is the approach adopted by the Dole-Lieberman bill. \nI believe the time has come for the Senate to support a strong measure \nand fill a vacuum of leadership that exists.\n  Some will argue that this proposal will weaken NATO. Let me be clear: \nthe health of NATO is essential to American interests. This historic \ncomment is a continuing necessity. But this alliance was successful \nbecause its leadership has in the past been unquestioned. And that \nleadership was effectively provided, throughout the cold war, by \nAmerica.\n  There is nothing more likely to destroy NATO than for America to \nretreat from that leadership and abdicate its role. But that is exactly \nwhat this administration has allowed to happen. European leaders have \nattempted to fill that vacuum, but have not succeeded.\n  In David Rieff's new book on Bosnia, he concludes: ``The story of \nBosnian defeat is the story of Western European and North American \ndisgrace. What has taken place in Bosnia has revealed the bankruptcy of \nevery European security institution, from the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nand exposed the fact that nowhere in these great structures was there \neither intellectual preparedness or moral fortitude for dealing with \nthe crises of the post-cold-war world.''\n  President Chirac commented yesterday, ``There is no leader of the \nAtlantic Alliance.'' That is unfortunately, tragically true. It is a \ndisaster for Bosnia, for Europe and for the world.\n  We will not reassert American authority by following European and \nU.N. officials further into this policy that has not worked. The best \nway to restore national integrity, I suggest, is by providing it with a \nstrategy that will work. And the best way to preserve NATO is by \nleading it once again.\n  Mr. President, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that lifting \nof the embargo is a policy option that we should adopt. It is clear \nthat we will not--or should not, hopefully will not--place U.S. troops \nin an indefensible military situation to achieve an objective that has \nyet to be defined, in a military manner that has yet to be defined, \nwith an end purpose that has yet to be defined.\n  Therefore, I believe we should heed their request, and since we will \nnot do that, and since the UNPROFOR forces are ineffective in terms of \nproviding the protection that they promised the Bosnian Moslems, I \nbelieve it is time that we assert those principles that I \n\n[[Page S 10302]]\noutlined--that we lift the embargo, and that we heed their request to \nallow them to defend their sovereign state.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senate discussing the pending \nresolution to lift the embargo?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending business.\n  Mr. BYRD. And there is no time under control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time under control.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n                   united states policy toward bosnia\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a difficult debate, and a debate \nthat could significantly affect the situation in Bosnia. The \nlegislation we are considering, to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, is, \non the surface, appealing. It appeals to our instincts to do something \nto redress the plight of the Bosnian civilian population without \ngetting too personally involved. It appeals to our instincts to ``level \nthe playing field,'' and support the underdog.\n  Representatives of the Bosnian Government have reinforced the \nappealing character of this legislation. They have visited with me and \nwith other Senators, and they have assured us that if they only had \narms to match the aggressor Serbs, they could secure a safe, ethnically \ndiverse, and democratic Bosnian state without the further help of the \nUnited Nations or other Western help, although help would be welcome.\n  But there is a less appealing side to this legislation, a side that \ntroubles me. This is, as some have noted, an incomplete piece of \nlegislation. There are many unanswered questions raised by this \nresolution. It is these missing answers that so trouble me.\n  First, and perhaps most troubling, is that this legislation pushes \nthe United States out in front of allies, out in front, and gets the \nCongress out in front of the President. There is a meeting of NATO \nallies scheduled to take place in London this Friday, 2 days from \ntoday, to finalize a unified NATO plan for Bosnia. While earlier \nmeetings have failed to reach a consensus view, it is clear that the \npressure is on to agree on a unified plan of action. Passage of this \nbill in advance of that meeting narrows the options for the United \nStates and for our allies. It pushes us out on an untraveled path of \nunilateral action and leaves our allies to deal with the consequences. \nWe have resisted taking this path for 2 years, and have honored our \nNATO allies' concerns for the safety of their personnel on the ground \nin Bosnia.\n  I cannot understand why this debate cannot wait until after the \nmeeting Why the hurry? The meeting will take place Friday. Why can we \nnot wait until next week to consider this bill?\n  It was at the urging of his officer corps and Senators who were in \nthat officer corps that thrust Pompey into the fatal decision not to \nwait and delay attacking Caesar at Pharsala. Pompey controlled the \nAdriatic with his 500 large warships and his many more small ships. He \ncontrolled the lines of transport. It was just a matter of waiting, to \nlet Caesar's army starve to death. But the officer corps wanted action. \nAnd so Pompey made the fatal decision to act quickly, and he was \ndefeated at the battle of Pharsalus in 48 B.C.\n  It was that same impetuosity, that same desire to rush matters that \nbrought about the defeat of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi in 42 B.C. \nBrutus and Cassius had squared off against Octavian and Antony. Brutus \nfaced Octavian's wing and defeated it. Cassius, who was in control of \nthe left wing, faced Antony and lost. That was the first battle of \nPhilippi. Then came the second battle, in which, again, the Roman \ngeneral, Marcus Junius Brutus, had the advantages had he waited. But \nhis soldiers taunted him and urged him to fight sooner rather than \nlater. Brutus did so and lost.\n  So why the hurry? What is the rush? The situation in Bosnia is \ndesperate, but rash action on our part may make it all the more \ndesperate, and may only serve to add withdrawal forces to the numbers \nof Bosnian civilians facing crisis situations.\n  This bill also puts U.S. policy partially in the hands of a foreign \ngovernment. A request by the Bosnian Government would trigger the \nlifting of the American role in the arms embargo. This disturbs me. \nU.S. foreign policy should be directed by the President working with \nthe Congress. U.S. foreign policy should be developed within concert \nwith our allies. Its direction and timing should never be deposited in \nthe hands of any foreign government. Never should we allow the actions \nof a foreign government automatically to trigger a military action on \nour part.\n  Yesterday morning, the distinguished ranking member on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Nunn, identified another of the missing \nelements in this bill. That is, that unilateral U.S. action to lift the \narms embargo in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions brings \nwith it the high probability, if not the virtual certainty, that the \nU.N. forces would withdraw from Bosnia. Indeed, the Bosnian Government \nmay request the withdrawal of the U.N. forces. That is their right. But \neither of these actions would most certainly trigger a commitment by \nPresident Clinton to deploy some 25,000 U.S. troops to participate in \nthe extraction of the U.N. forces. Well, I believe that Congress should \nwait for a Presidential decision and a NATO decision to actually commit \ntroops before actively authorizing such an operation. But I agree that \nwe should not ignore this logical consequence of the action that may be \ntaken today or tomorrow, whenever we vote on this measure. But we must \nalso consider the consequences of such actions.\n  There are those who have assured us that the risks to U.S. and NATO \nforces of a U.N. withdrawal may be overstated; that most U.N. forces \nare deployed on Bosnian Government-held territory; and that Bosnian \nGovernment forces would not hinder the withdrawal. Therefore, the full \n80,000-plus NATO extraction force may not be necessary and the risks of \ncasualties may be reduced. This may all be true--I am not an expert in \nmilitary planning. I have no personal knowledge of the conditions on \nthe ground in Bosnia. I deplore what I see and what I read and what I \nhear. But I am hesitant to accept such reassurances when the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense continues to support a robust operations plan \ndesigned to deter attacks and reduce casualties. And I am concerned by \nthe lack of discussion regarding the situation facing the Bosnian \ncivilian refugees affected by a U.N. withdrawal. What efforts will such \nrefugees make to retain or to retaliate against U.N. peacekeepers in \nthe event of a withdrawal? Will the refugees be left in the former safe \nareas or will they withdraw along with the peacekeepers to Bosnian \nGovernment-controlled territory? This resolution ignores the reality of \nwithdrawal by ignoring such questions.\n  Another missing element in this debate concerns the funds required to \npay for the U.S. share of a NATO withdrawal of U.N. forces. At a time \nwhen we are making many very difficult choices required to meet the \nbudget resolution goals and reduce the deficit, we must address the \napproximately $1 billion bill for U.S. participation in a withdrawal. \nLet us not forget that. There will be a bill to pay. I am not arguing \nthat we should not lift the embargo because it would prove too \nexpensive. I simply note that the passage of this bill would lead to \ncosts eventually to the United States, and that we must address these \ncosts up front.\n  This bill is not a simple and appealing low-cost solution to the ugly \nsituation in Bosnia. It carries with it consequences, and those \nconsequences carry a price in both lives and treasure, and the future \nof our alliances with other nations. If the United States pursues a \nsolo course in Bosnia, and chooses to unilaterally abrogate an \ninternational arms embargo against Bosnia, what authority can we muster \nto argue for the maintenance of other sanctions or embargos against \nother countries? One compelling example is the case of the sanctions \nagainst Iraq. For 4 years, our allies have stayed the course with us to \nmaintain sanctions against Iraq. These sanctions have proven to be the \ncritical tool in pushing a very recalcitrant Iraqi Government to \ndisclose and dismantle their industrial infrastructure for the research \nand production of weapons of mass destruction. Without the sanctions, \nthe Iraqi biological weapons production complex would not have been \nrevealed, and \n\n[[Page S 10303]]\nSouthwest Asia and the rest of the world would remain at the mercy of \nIraqi-produced anthrax and botulinum bombs. Many of our allies, \nincluding prominent members of the coalition in Bosnia, would like to \nlift the sanctions against Iraq. They want to restore lucrative--\nlucrative--trade ties with Baghdad, but they have bowed to our \ncompelling interest in maintaining the sanctions, just as we have \nsupported their desires to maintain the arms embargo against Bosnia in \norder to protect allied personnel on the ground. Our unilateral action \non Bosnia would provide our allies with the excuse to deny United \nStates requests concerning Iraq, at a time when the U.N. inspectors \nthere are very close to resolving the few, but critical, remaining \nissues concerning Iraqi chemical and biological weapons programs.\n  Finally, I would note that the appealing message trumpeted by this \nbill and by the Bosnian Government representatives is somewhat \ndisingenuous. It is designed to appeal to our sympathies and to our \ndesire to help, but a lifting of the arms embargo also appeals to our \ndesire not to put Americans in harm's way. Members have argued that \nU.S. support of the arms embargo has already ``Americanized'' the \nconflict. This is not true. The United States, has with other nations, \nsupported a U.N. Security Council resolution to limit arms. Our allies \nwith troops on the ground have reinforced the consensus on maintaining \nthe embargo. If that causes the conflict to be ``Americanized,'' then \nit also makes it\n ``Britishized'' and ``Frenchified,'' and ``Spanishized.'' The act of \nunilaterally lifting the embargo, pushing our allies out of Bosnia, and \nleaving the Bosnian Government to look to the United States for \nsupport--that unilateral act is what risks ``Americanizing'' the \nconflict.\n\n  The Bosnian Government representatives have identified three \npriorities, which also trouble me. First, they seek a lifting of the \narms embargo. Although this bill does not promise any U.S. arms or \nassistance, it is clearly desired and perhaps even expected. The \nlegislative history of United States policy on Bosnia has linked--\nlinked--the lifting of the arms embargo with the provision of up to \n$200 million in training and assistance, and with the provision of \nexcess United States military equipment at no cost. Do not be surprised \nto see actions to extend this assistance in the authorization and \nappropriations bills later this year, even though no promises are made \nin this bill before us. Additionally, remember that this imperfect arms \nembargo also affects the Serbs. If we lift the embargo and supply arms \nto the Bosnian Government, it will not occur in a vacuum. The Serbs \nwill also receive arms from their friends and sympathizers. As the \nconflict heats up and more nations get involved, are we going to be \nable to easily walk away?\n  Second, the Bosnian Government desires a continuation of the NATO \n``no-fly'' zone over Bosnia. Because the Bosnian Government has no air \nforces while the Serbs do, it seems reasonable to prevent the Bosnian \nSerb forces from exploiting their advantage in the air, and allow both \nsides to fight on a level playing field on the ground. The Bosnian \nGovernment suggests that this role can be continued by NATO at low \nrisk, despite the shoot-down of American pilot Scott O'Grady, and the \nlosses of other NATO aircraft in the past.\n  Finally, the Bosnian Government's third priority is NATO airstrikes \nagainst Serb forces and ammunition dumps. This is not a level playing \nfield. This is a desire for a playing field tilted in favor of the \nBosnian Government. The Bosnian Government wants NATO to intervene to \nkeep the Serbs out of the air, and then use NATO air superiority to \nattack Serb forces and installations. While the victimization of the \nBosnian Moslem civilian population may merit this kind of support, it \nis exactly the kind of action that leads to greater NATO or United \nStates participation in the conflict. That is where the rub comes. \nThese unheralded priorities disguise the slippery slope of escalating \nU.S. involvement down which we might slide, and with this resolution we \nmay be pouring more oil on that slick hillside.\n  These priorities, and the language in the bill, make it clear that \nUnited States policy, which up until now has been one of neutrality and \nconflict containment, will tend to tilt to partisan support of the \nBosnian Government and the Bosnian Moslem side in the conflict. I do \nnot think we want to tilt either way. With the adoption of this \nresolution, we will move toward picking a side--picking a side--in this \nconflict, and thereby irrevocably tie United States to Bosnia and to \nthe fate and abilities of the Bosnian Government.\n  And so I urge my colleagues will consider carefully the downside of \nthis legislation before they cast their votes. This bill is not a \nsimple solution to a complex and guilt-laden problem. We must \nunderstand the consequences of our actions. I for one do not relish the \npossibility of emotional speeches of support for the Bosnian victims of \nthis tragic conflict being replaced by emotional speeches decrying the \nlives of American pilots and soldiers lost in a civil war that everyone \nacknowledges is not in the vital national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I shall vote against the pending bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of regulatory \nreform, which this Senate has debated at length.\n  I think many Americans, as they listen to the debate, must wonder \nwhat the argument is all about. There have been charges that sponsors \nof S. 343 will eliminate regulations protecting food, clean air, clean \nwater, and that we will eliminate regulation of meat inspection, and so \non. All those charges are completely inaccurate. No statutes in those \nareas are repealed. No regulations are repealed. What this bill \nbasically does is simply require that the Government examine the merits \nand the cost of new or current regulations.\n  I think many Americans may wonder, why the filibuster? What is really \ninvolved is the question of costs and benefits of regulations. Why does \nthat deserve a filibuster? This regulatory reform bill has been \nfilibustered in a way I have never before seen in a legislative body. \nCertainly we have had filibusters on the floor before, but seldom have \nwe had filibusters in the committee, which is what occurred in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  What I think is at stake--and why I think you see such vigorous \ndebate of this issue--is the question of unbridled, uncontrolled \nregulation of an economy goes to the core of people's philosophy about \nAmerica and American Government.\n  Last year this country added more than 60,000 pages of new \nregulations to the Federal Register. I think most Americans, when they \nhear that, would be shocked. It is true--the Government promulgated \nmore than 64,000 pages of new regulations. If you wanted to read those \nregulations--and, of course, all Americans are subject to them, and if \nthey violate them, they could be fined, or even on occasion thrown into \nprison--if you wanted to read the regulations that you are subject to, \nand if you read it 300 words a minute, which is a very good reading \nspeed for a legal document, it would take you more than a year. In \nfact, you would be roughly halfway through it. If you read 8 hours a \nday with no coffee breaks, 5 days a week with no holidays or days off, \nif you read 52 weeks a year with no vacations, you still would not have \neven read the new regulations. Add to that the tens of thousands of \npages of regulations that already exist.\n  What is at stake in this debate is not whether you should have a \ncost-benefit analysis or not. What is at stake is the question of \nwhether or not the Federal Government has any restrictions on its \nability to micromanage the economy. What Americans have found is that \nthe \n\n[[Page S 10304]]\ndetails of how you drive the truck, how you dig a ditch, how you \noperate daily activities in many, many areas, are now controlled by \nregulations.\n  What is at stake is, who will make the decisions in this country? \nWill Government make those decisions about how we run our daily lives \nin minute detail, or will individuals preserve a right to make \ndecisions about how they function and how their activities are lived? \nThat is an important decision.\n  I think those who look at the votes in the Senate on this issue will \nnote one thing. In most cases, those Members that have worked for a \nliving in the private sector, who have used their hands and their minds \nto produce products, goods, or services, are the ones who voted to \nreform the regulatory process--not all, but most of them. And largely \nthose people who did not have an opportunity, or have not for many \ndecades had an opportunity, to work in the private sector, who have \nspent their productive lives in government, tended to vote to oppose \nregulatory reform. It is not surprising that people would reflect their \nbackground.\n  What is sad, though, is that there are not more Members who have \nwalked in those moccasins, so to speak, who have had a chance to be \nsubject to regulation, who understand what it is like to have OSHA \ninspect their business, understand what it is like to have the EPA come \nalong, or who have run a municipal operation.\n  We heard in the Constitution Subcommittee the other day from the \nGovernor of Nebraska, who is a Democrat, that they are required by \nFederal regulations to test for pineapple sprays in Nebraska. It is \nludicrous. And, yet, the people of Nebraska are subject to this \nregulation and are forced to spend their money and their treasury on \nit, when it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of water in the \nState of Nebraska.\n  There are thousands of examples like that. But this is not just about \nwhat Nebraskans have to test for in their water, whether there are \nsprays for pineapples or not; it is about a concept. It is about the \nconcept of who will make the decisions in America. Will working men and \nwomen have a chance to decide how they live their daily lives, or is \nthis all to be relegated to minute regulations that come down from the \nFederal Government?\n  That is an important principle. I believe if we in America stand for \nanything, it is for individual opportunity and individual freedom; yes, \neven at times an opportunity to make a mistake. But Americans believe \nwe have an opportunity and a right to help run our own lives, not \nsimply take dictates from those who govern, no matter how wise or how \nwell meaning.\n  Do we need regulations? Of course. But 60,000 pages of new ones every \nyear? No society can sustain it. What is at stake is an effort to make \nregulations responsible and reasonable. What is at stake is individual \nopportunity to decide how to live their own lives.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 21, \nSenator Dole's bill to lift the United States arms embargo against the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the so-called U.N. safe zones \nfall one by one to Serbian rebel assaults, and their civilian \ninhabitants face the horrors of ethnic cleansing, we must stand up for \nthe sovereign right of Bosnia to defend itself against this armed \naggression.\n  The U.N. protected areas were initially created to actually protect \ntheir inhabitants from ethnic cleansing. The plan was that the U.N. \nProtection Force, backed by NATO air power, would actually use force to \nstop the population of these areas from coming to harm. The implicit \ndeal was that the United Nations, through UNPROFOR and NATO, would \nassume Bosnia's sovereign responsibility to defend its people and its \nterritory, in return for Bosnian cooperation in pursuit of a diplomatic \nsolution to the conflict.\n  Mr. President, Bosnia has cooperated. Bosnia accepted the contact \ngroup's plan that would have left the Bosnian Serb rebels in control of \nhalf of their country. Bosnia, in return, had every right to expect the \nUnited Nations and NATO to uphold their end of the bargain, and use \narmed force to defend the Bosnian people in the protected areas from \nSerbian assault.\n  We have now seen that neither the United Nations nor NATO is willing \nto meet its obligations under this arrangement. After the disastrously \nmisguided air attacks on unmanned Serb ammunition bunkers near Pale, \nthe Serbs did again what they have done before--they seized UNPROFOR \nmembers as hostages and, in a new violation of the laws of war, chained \nthem to potential targets. Some charge that our allies in UNPROFOR \ndeliberately deployed their forces in militarily untenable positions so \nthat they would serve as de facto hostages, effectively barring the use \nof force in response to Serb outrages. Whether or not this unsound \ndeployment was deliberate and the actual taking of hostages was \nforeseen, neither the United Nations nor NATO is now free to use force \nagainst the Serbs even if they had the political will to do so.\n  In fact, the West lacks the political will to use force to protect \nthe safe zones and the people living in them. Srebrenica has fallen and \nZepa is about to fall. In my opinion, any of the publicly discussed \nplans to protect Gorazde are doomed to failure.\n  The United States Senate should vote today to return to the Bosnian \nGovernment the capability to exercise its sovereign right of self \ndefense. The recent attacks to lift the siege of Sarajevo show that the \nBosnian Government is not afraid to use force in its own self defense, \nand that its people are ready to make tremendous sacrifices for their \ncountry. We need to allow them to obtain the tools they need to convert \ntheir political resolve and courage into military success.\n  While I believe that the French plan to insert additional troops in \nthe besieged Gorazde zone is the height of folly--someone wrote that \nthe French have forgotten Dien Bien Phu--I agree with President \nChirac's assessment of the performance of the West in this crisis as \nbeing the worst since the late 1930's, when we faltered and compromised \nin the face of Nazi aggression. It is time and past time for us to get \nout of the Bosnians' way and allow them to obtain the means to defend \nthemselves.\n  Accordingly, I will vote for this measure and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to give it their wholehearted support.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10303-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10304-S10305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. First of all, Mr. President, let me indicate there will be \nno more votes this evening. We are still hoping to have the debate \ntonight on the rescissions bill. We have an agreement that we hope we \ncan reach here in the next moments. It depends on, as I understand, \nsome assurance from the White House to the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone. But it is the majority leader's intention to have \nthe debate tonight, 40 minutes of debate, 20 minutes of debate \ntomorrow, there be two back-to-back votes, then a vote on final \npassage, if necessary, tomorrow morning. If we cannot reach that \nagreement, then I really will give up on it. We tried to accommodate \nthe Senator from Minnesota. It is very important that we pass this \nbill, but we need to have some movement on the other side.\n  Second, I have had a lengthy phone conversation with the President \nabout Bosnia. He has asked that we not have a vote on the Bosnian \nresolution, S. 21, until next week. And I have told the President I \nwould--he asked me to think about it overnight and contact him \ntomorrow. So I will certainly do that. Without in any way trying to \ncharacterize the conversation, I think the President indicated that he \nknew that the present policy was not working. He knew that the changes \nwould have to be made. He was prepared to provide the leadership \nnecessary to bring about those changes. I think that is about all I can \nsay about it. But, obviously, I wish to cooperate with the President \nwherever and whenever possible. So it would be my inclination that we \nnot vote on the Bosnia resolution this week. But I will discuss this \n\n[[Page S 10305]]\nwith some of my colleagues in the morning and get back to the \nPresident.\n  Third, we are still negotiating S. 343, the regulatory reform bill. \nUnder the agreement, I can call for the regular order at any time, but \nan hour later we could have a cloture vote on S. 343. Obviously, I will \ngive the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, adequate notice before \nthat is done. But there are still some negotiations underway. It is \nstill our hope that we can find some common ground, though I must say \nsome of the demands cannot be met. Perhaps some others can. And we \nshould, hopefully, reach some final decision on that bill sometime \ntomorrow.\n  Also, I hope, after we work out the rescissions agreement, that \ntomorrow morning following the vote on the rescissions package, we will \ntake up legislative branch appropriations. We have notified Senator \nMack, the subcommittee chair, so that we will start on our first \nappropriations bill somewhere between 9:30 and probably about 10 \ntomorrow morning.\n  So that is sort of a summary of where we are. And while I dislike not \nbeing able the accommodate the staff, we need to wait until we hear \nfrom the White House before we know that we can proceed on the \nrescissions package. Perhaps we will just have a recess until 8:15. At \nleast the staff can get up and walk around.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10304-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 8:15 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, we have been unsuccessful in working out an \nagreement with the Senator from Minnesota. It is unfortunate. We would \nhave hoped he would come to the floor and use some of the time this \nevening. He has refused to do that. So it seems to me, if you cannot \nget anybody to cooperate, there is no reason to worry about the \nrescission package and I am not going to worry about it. Somebody else \ncan worry about it from now on. I have talked to the President about it \ntoday. I have talked to the chief of staff at the White House. We \nthought we had an agreement. We cannot get the agreement.\n  I am going to ask consent and let somebody object to the agreement as \nsoon as we can find an objector. I wish it were the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, since he is the one who we are trying to \naccommodate. It is hard to do.\n  So, tomorrow we will have morning business from 9 to 10, then we will \ngo on to the legislative branch appropriations. And hopefully, \nfollowing that, military construction appropriations. And perhaps, \nmaybe by then we will be able to go back to the reg reform bill, S. \n343.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10305-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1944\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of H.R. 1944 and that it be considered under \nthe following agreement: One amendment in order to be offered by \nSenator Wellstone, regarding education funding/job training and LIHEAP, \non which there be a division, and each of the two divisions be limited \nto 1 hour to be equally divided in the usual form, with all time to be \nused this evening with the exception of 40 minutes; then, when the \nSenate reconvenes on Thursday at 9 a.m., the Senate resume H.R. 1944 \nand the remaining 40 minutes on the amendment and the 10 minutes for \nthe managers on the bill, to be followed immediately by a motion to \ntable the first Wellstone division, and that following that vote, the \nmajority leader be recognized to place the bill on the calendar. If \nthat action is not exercised, the Senate then proceed immediately to \nvote on a motion to table the second Wellstone division to be followed \nimmediately by a vote on passage of H.R. 1944.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished majority \nleader's effort to try to accommodate Senators on our side. The offer \nthat the Senators on our side, Senators Wellstone and Moseley-Braun, \nhave made is that we have three amendments and three votes. This \nrequest accommodates two amendments. I know that there are still some \noutstanding negotiations underway with regard to the third matter.\n  This is a very important bill. It deals with assistance to be \nprovided in cases in California and Oklahoma, as we all know. I hope, \nas close as we are, we could continue to try to resolve these \ndifferences. But unfortunately, as a result of our inability to resolve \nthat third outstanding matter, on behalf of Senators Wellstone and \nMoseley-Braun I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kansas retains the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would just add, my understanding is the White House is \nworking in good faith. I have talked to the chief of staff, Leon \nPanetta. And as far as I know, everyone is in good faith. But nobody \naccepts anybody's good faith, at least the Senator from Minnesota does \nnot. He has every right to have someone object to the agreement, but it \nis important to the people of Oklahoma City. This bill is important to \npeople in about 39 States. It is not just important to the Senator from \nMinnesota. The amendment he is talking about is less than $5 million, \nthe third amendment.\n  I have tried to help him on that amendment. I have asked the White \nHouse, myself, to try to accommodate the Senator from Minnesota. I \nwould think, in the spirit of comity, he would let us proceed and have \nthe debate tonight. I assume when the President or chief of staff \nindicate they think they can work something out, that would be--at \nleast good enough for this Senator. But maybe not the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10305-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, earlier today, President Clinton \ndelivered an eloquent and excellent address on one of the most \nimportant issues the Nation faces--the future of affirmative action.\n  In my view, and I believe in the view of the vast majority of the \nAmerican people, President Clinton is doing the right and courageous \nthing. He is preserving and improving the best of affirmative action, \nand eliminating its abuses.\n  For a generation, beginning with the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 \ndecision outlawing school segregation, America has made significant \nbipartisan progress in attempting to end the most blatant forms of \ndiscrimination and racism in our society.\n  Much of this progress has been achieved through affirmative action, \ninvolving the leadership of government at every level--Federal, State, \nand local--and the action of dedicated private citizens.\n  Unfortunately, discrimination persists, often in subtle forms. We \nhave made real progress, but much more remains to be done. Good jobs \nstill too often remain closed or less available to qualified minorities \nand women because of bigotry. By helping to assure that every \nindividual has an equal opportunity, affirmative action is one of our \nmost effective means and best hopes for rooting out that bias. \n\n[[Page S 10306]]\n\n  The President is right to broaden set-asides, to oppose quotas, to \nreject preferences for unqualified individuals and reverse \ndiscrimination, and to end programs that have achieved their goals. \nEvery Federal affirmative action program deserves review to see whether \nabuses have occurred and whether it accords with the Supreme Court's \ncurrent guidelines.\n  I commend President Clinton for his leadership and his vision of a \nmore just America. Today was one of his finest hours. At a time when \nsome in the Party of Lincoln are seeking to divide America because of \nrace, we must not retreat from our commitment to fulfill the \nConstitution's fundamental promise of equal justice for all.\n  Mr. President, I believe the President's address will be of interest \nto all of us in Congress and to all Americans, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Address by President Clinton on Affirmative Action, July 19, 1995\n\n       Thank you very much. To the members of Congress who are \n     here, members of the Cabinet and the administration, my \n     fellow Americans: In recent weeks I have begun a conversation \n     with the American people about our fate and our duty to \n     prepare our nation not only to meet the new century, but to \n     live and lead in a world transformed to a degree seldom seen \n     in all of our history. Much of this change is good, but it is \n     not all good, and all of us are affected by it. Therefore, we \n     must reach beyond our fears and our divisions to a new time \n     of great and common purpose.\n       Our challenge is twofold: first, to restore the American \n     dream of opportunity and the American value of \n     responsibility; and second, to bring our country together \n     amid all our diversity into a stronger community, so that we \n     can find common ground and move forward as one.\n       More than ever, these two endeavors are inseparable. I am \n     absolutely convinced we cannot restore economic opportunity \n     or solve our social problems unless we find a way to bring \n     the American people together. To bring our people together we \n     must openly and honestly deal with the issues that divide us. \n     Today I want to discuss one of those issues: affirmative \n     action.\n       It is, in a way, ironic that this issue should be divisive \n     today, because affirmative action began 25 years ago by a \n     Republican president with bipartisan support. It began simply \n     as a means to an end of enduring national purpose--equal \n     opportunity for all Americans.\n       So let us today trace the roots of affirmative action in \n     our never-ending search for equal opportunity. Let us \n     determine what it is and what it isn't. Let us see where it's \n     worked and where it hasn't and ask ourselves what we need to \n     do now. Along the way, let us remember always that finding \n     common ground as we move toward the 21st century depends \n     fundamentally on our shared commitment to equal opportunity \n     for all Americans. It is a moral imperative, a constitutional \n     mandate, and a legal necessity.\n       There could be no better place for this discussion than the \n     National Archives, for within these walls are America's \n     bedrocks of our common ground--the Declaration of \n     Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. No paper \n     is as lasting as the words these documents contain. So we put \n     them in these special cases to protect the parchment from the \n     elements. No building is as solid as the principles these \n     documents embody, but we sure tried to build one with these \n     metal doors 11 inches thick to keep them safe, for these \n     documents are America's only crown jewels. But the best place \n     of all to hold these words and these principles is the one \n     place in which they can never fade and never grow old--in the \n     stronger chambers of our hearts.\n       Beyond all else, our country is a set of convictions: ``We \n     hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n       Our whole history can be seen first as an effort to \n     preserve these rights, and then as an effort to make them \n     real in the lives of all our citizens. We know that from the \n     beginning, there was a great gap between the plain meaning of \n     our creed and the meaner reality of our daily lives. Back \n     then, only white male property owners could vote. Black \n     slaves were not even counted as whole people, and Native \n     Americans were\n      regarded as little more than an obstacle to our great \n     national progress. No wonder Thomas Jefferson, reflecting \n     on slavery, said he trembled to think God is just.\n       On the 200th anniversary of our great Constitution, Justice \n     Thurgood Marshall, the grandson of a slave, said, ``The \n     government our founders devised was defective from the start, \n     requiring several amendments, a civil war, and momentous \n     social transformation to attain the system of constitutional \n     government and its respect for the individual freedoms and \n     human rights we hold as fundamental today.''\n       Emancipation, women's suffrage, civil rights, voting \n     rights, equal rights, the struggle for the rights of the \n     disabled--all these and other struggles are milestones on \n     America's often rocky, but fundamentally righteous journey to \n     close up the gap between the ideals enshrined in these \n     treasures here in the National Archives and the reality of \n     our daily lives.\n       I first came to this very spot where I'm standing today 32 \n     years ago this month. I was a 16-year-old delegate to the \n     American Legion Boys Nation. Now, that summer was a high-\n     water mark for our national journey. That was the summer that \n     President Kennedy ordered Alabama National Guardsmen to \n     enforce a court order to allow two young blacks to enter the \n     University of Alabama. As he told our nation, ``Every \n     American ought to have the right to be treated as he would \n     wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be \n     treated.''\n       Later that same summer, on the steps of the Lincoln \n     Memorial, Martin Luther King told Americans of his dream that \n     one day the sons of former slaves and the sons of former \n     slaveowners would sit down together at the table of \n     brotherhood; that one day his four children would be judged \n     not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their \n     character. His words captured the hearts and steeled the \n     wills of millions of Americans. Some of them sang with him in \n     the hot sun that day. Millions more like me listened and wept \n     in the privacy of their homes.\n       It's hard to believe where we were, just three decades ago. \n     When I came up here to Boys Nation and we had this mock \n     congressional session, I was one of only three or four \n     southerners who would even vote for the civil rights plank. \n     That's largely because of my family. My grandfather had a \n     grade school education and ran a grocery store across the \n     street from the cemetery in Hope, Arkansas, where my parents \n     and my grandparents are buried. Most of his customers were \n     black, were poor, and were working people. As a child in that \n     store I saw that people of different races could treat each \n     other with respect and dignity.\n       But I also saw that the black neighborhood across the \n     street was the only one in town where the streets weren't \n     paved. And when I returned to that neighborhood in the late \n     '60s to see a woman who had cared for me as a toddler, the \n     streets still weren't paved. A lot of you know that I am an \n     ardent movie-goer. As a child I never went to a movie where I \n     could sit next to a black American. They were always sitting \n     upstairs.\n       In the 1960s, believe it or not, there were still a few \n     courthouse squares in my state where the rest rooms were \n     marked ``white'' and ``colored.'' I graduated from a \n     segregated high school seven years after President Eisenhower \n     integrated Little Rock Central High School. And when \n     President Kennedy barely carried my home state in 1960, the \n     poll tax system was still alive and well there.\n       Even though my grandparents were in a minority, being poor \n     Southern whites who were pro-civil rights, I think most other \n     people knew better than to think the way they did. And those \n     who were smart enough to act differently discovered a lesson \n     that we ought to remember today. Discrimination is not just \n     morally wrong, it hurts everybody.\n       In 1960, Atlanta, Georgia, in reaction to all the things \n     that were going on all across the South, adopted the motto, \n     ``The city too busy to hate.'' And however imperfectly over \n     the years, they tried to live by it. I am convinced that \n     Atlanta's success--it now is home to more foreign \n     corporations than any other American city, and one year from \n     today it will begin to host the Olympics--that that success \n     all began when people got too busy to hate.\n       The lesson we learned was a hard one. When we allow people \n     to pit us against one another or spend energy denying \n     opportunity based on our differences, everyone is held back. \n     But when we give all Americans a chance to develop and use \n     their talents, to be full partners in our common enterprise, \n     then everybody is pushed forward.\n       My experiences with discrimination are rooted in the South \n     and in the legacy slavery left. I also lived with a working \n     mother and a working grandmother when women's work was far \n     rarer and far more circumscribed than it today. But we all \n     know there are millions of other stories--those of Hipsanics, \n     Asian Americans, Native Americans, people with disabilities, \n     others against whom fingers have been pointed. Many of you \n     have your own stories, and that's why you're here today--\n     people who were denied the right to develop and use their \n     full human potential. And their progress, too, is a part of \n     our journey to make the reality of America consistent with \n     the principles just behind me here.\n       Thirty years ago in this city, you didn't see many people \n     of color or women making their way to work in the morning in \n     business clothes, or serving in substantial numbers in \n     powerful positions in Congress or at the White House, or \n     making executive decisions every day in business. In fact, \n     even the employment want ads were divided, men on one side \n     and women on the other.\n       It was extraordinary then to see women or people of color \n     as television news anchors, or, believe it or not, even in \n     college sports. There were far fewer women and minorities as \n     job supervisors, or firefighters, or police officers, or \n     doctors, or lawyers, or college professors, or in many other \n     jobs that offer stability and honor and integrity to family \n     life.\n       A lot has changed, and it did not happen as some sort of \n     random evolutionary drift. It \n\n[[Page S 10307]]\n     took hard work and sacrifices and countless acts of courage and \n     conscience by millions of Americans. It took the political \n     courage and statesmanship of Democrats and Republicans alike, \n     the vigilance and compassion of courts and advocates in and \n     out of government committed to the Constitution and to equal \n     protection and to equal opportunity. It took the leadership \n     of people in business who knew that in the end we would all \n     be better. It took the leadership of people in labor unions \n     who knew that working people had to be reconciled.\n       Some people, like Congressman Lewis there, put their lives \n     on the line. Other people lost their lives. And millions of \n     Americans changed their own lives and put hate behind them. \n     As a result, today all our lives are better. Women have \n     become a major force in business and political life, and far \n     more able to contribute to their families' incomes. A true \n     and growing black middle class has emerged. Higher education \n     has literally been revolutionized, with women and racial and \n     ethnic minorities attending once overwhelmingly white and \n     sometimes all male schools.\n       In communities across our nation, police departments now \n     better reflect the make-up of those whom they protect. A \n     generation of professionals now serve as role models for \n     young women and minority youth. Hispanics and newer immigrant \n     populations are succeeding in making America stronger.\n       For an example of where the best of our future lies, just \n     think about our space program and the stunning hook-up with \n     the Russian space station this month. Let's remember that \n     that program, the world's finest, began with heroes like Alan \n     Shepard and Senator John Glenn, but today it's had American \n     heroes like Sally Ride, Ellen Ochoa, Leroy Child, Guy Bluford \n     and other outstanding, completely qualified women and \n     minorities.\n       How did this happen? Fundamentally, because we opened our \n     hearts and minds and changed our ways. But not without \n     pressure--the pressure of court decisions, legislation, \n     executive action, and the power of examples in the public and \n     private sector. Along the way we learned that laws alone do \n     not change society; that old habits and thinking patterns are \n     deeply ingrained and die hard; that more is required to \n     really open the doors of opportunity. Our search to find ways \n     to move more quickly to equal opportunity led to the \n     development of what we now call affirmative action.\n       The purpose of affirmative action is to give our nation a \n     way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individuals \n     of talent on the basis of their gender or race from \n     opportunities to develop, perform, achieve and contribute. \n     Affirmative action is an effort to develop a systematic \n     approach to open the doors of education, employment and \n     business development opportunities to qualified individuals \n     who happen to be members of groups that have experienced \n     longstanding and persistent discrimination.\n       It is a policy that grew out of many years of trying to \n     navigate between two unacceptable pasts. One was to say \n     simply that we declared discrimination illegal and that's \n     enough. We saw that that way still relegated blacks with \n     college degrees to jobs as railroad porters, and kept women \n     with degrees under a glass ceiling with a lower paycheck.\n       The other path was simply to try to impose change by \n     leveling draconian penalties on employers who didn't meet \n     certain imposed, ultimately arbitrary, and sometimes \n     unachievable quotas. That, too, was rejected out of a sense \n     of fairness.\n       So a middle ground was developed that would change an \n     inequitable status quo gradually, but firmly, by building the \n     pool of qualified applicants for college, for contracts, for \n     jobs, and giving more people the chance to learn, work and \n     earn. When affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, \n     it is fair, and it works.\n       I know some people are honestly concerned about the times \n     affirmative action doesn't work, when it's done in the wrong \n     way. And I know there are times when some employers don't use \n     it in the right way. They may cut corners and treat a \n     flexible goal as a quota. They may give opportunities to \n     people who are unqualified instead of those who deserve it. \n     They may, in so doing, allow a different kind of \n     discrimination. When this happens, it is also wrong. But it \n     isn't affirmative action, and it is not legal.\n       So when our administration finds cases of that sort, we \n     will enforce the law aggressively. The Justice Department \n     files hundreds of cases every year, attacking discrimination \n     in employment, including suits on behalf of white males. Most \n     of these suits, however, affect women and minorities for a \n     simple reason--because the vast majority of discrimination in \n     America is still discrimination against them. But the law \n     does require fairness for everyone and we are determined to \n     see that that is exactly what the law delivers. (Applause.)\n       Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean \n     and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean--and I \n     don't favor--the unjustified preference of the unqualified \n     over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean--\n     and I don't favor--numerical quotas. It doesn't mean--and I \n     don't favor--rejection or selection of any employee or \n     student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard \n     to merit.\n       Like many business executives and public servants, I owe it \n     to you to say that my views on this subject are, more than \n     anything else, the product of my personal experience. I have \n     had experience with affirmative action, nearly 20 years of it \n     now, and I know it works.\n       When I was Attorney General of my home state, I hired a \n     record number of women and African American lawyers--every \n     one clearly qualified and exceptionally hardworking. As \n     Governor, I appointed more women to my Cabinet and state \n     boards than any other governor in the state's history, and \n     more African Americans than all the governors in the state's \n     history combined. And no one ever questioned their \n     qualifications or performance. And our state was better and \n     stronger because of their service.\n       As President, I am proud to have the most diverse \n     administration in history in my Cabinet, my agencies and my \n     staff. And I must say, I have been surprised at the criticism \n     I have received from some quarters in my determination to \n     achieve this.\n       In the last two and a half years, the most outstanding \n     example of affirmative action in the United States, the \n     Pentagon, has opened 260,000 positions for women who serve in \n     our Armed Forces. I have appointed more women and minorities \n     to the federal bench than any other president, more than the \n     last two combined. And yet, far more of our judicial \n     appointments have received the highest rating from the \n     American Bar Association than any other administration since \n     those ratings have been given.\n       In our administration, many government agencies are doing \n     more business with qualified firms run by minorities and \n     women. The Small Business Administration has reduced its \n     budget by 40 percent,\n      doubled its loan outputs, and dramatically increased the \n     number of loans to women and minority small business \n     people, without reducing the number of loans to white \n     businessowners who happen to be male, and without changing \n     the loan standards for a single, solitary application. \n     Quality and diversity can go hand in hand, and they must. \n     (Applause.)\n       Le me say that affirmative action has also done more than \n     just open the doors of opportunity to individual Americans. \n     Most economists who study it agree that affirmative action \n     has also been an important part of closing gaps in economic \n     opportunity in our society, thereby strengthening the entire \n     economy.\n       A group of distinguished business leaders told me just a \n     couple of days ago that their companies are stronger and \n     their profits are larger because of the diversity and the \n     excellence of their work forces achieved through intelligent \n     and fair affirmative action programs. And they said we have \n     gone far beyond anything the government might require us to \n     do, because managing diversity and individual opportunity and \n     being fair to everybody is the key to our future economic \n     success in the global marketplace.\n       Now, there are those who say, my fellow Americans, that \n     even good affirmative action programs are no longer needed; \n     that it should be enough to resort to the courts or the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission in cases of actual, \n     provable, individual discrimination because there is no \n     longer any systematic discrimination in our society. In \n     deciding how to answer that, let us consider the facts.\n       The unemployment rate for African Americans remains about \n     twice that of whites. The Hispanic rate is still much higher. \n     Women have narrowed the earnings gap, but still make only 72 \n     percent as much as men do for comparable jobs. The average \n     income for an Hispanic woman with a college degree is still \n     less than the average income of a white man with a high \n     school diploma.\n       According to the recently completed Glass Ceiling Report, \n     sponsored by Republican members of Congress, in the nation's \n     largest companies only six-tenths of one percent of senior \n     management positions are held by African Americans, four-\n     tenths of a percent by Hispanic Americans, three-tenths of a \n     percent by Asian Americans; women hold between three and five \n     percent of these positions. White males make up 43 percent of \n     our work force, but hold 95 percent of these jobs.\n       Just last week, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank reported \n     that black home loan applicants are more than twice as likely \n     to be denied credit as whites with the same qualifications; \n     and that Hispanic applicants are more than one and a half \n     times as likely to be denied loans as whites with the same \n     qualifications.\n       Last year alone, the federal government received more than \n     90,000 complaints of employment discrimination based on race, \n     ethnicity or gender. Less than three percent were for reverse \n     discrimination.\n       Evidence abounds in other ways of the persistence of the \n     kind of bigotry that can affect the way we think, even if \n     we're not conscious of it, in hiring and promotion and \n     business and educational decisions.\n       Crimes and violence based on hate against Asians, \n     Hispanics, African Americans and other minorities are still \n     with us. And, I'm sorry to say that the worst and most recent \n     evidence of this involves a recent report of federal law \n     enforcement officials in Tennessee attending an event \n     literally overflowing with racism--a sickening reminder of \n     just how pervasive these kinds of attitudes still are.\n       By the way, I want to tell you that I am committed to \n     finding the truth about what happened\n      there and to taking appropriate action. And I want to say \n     that if anybody who works in federal law enforcement \n     thinks that that kind of behavior is acceptable, they \n     ought to think about working someplace else. (Applause.)\n       Now, let's get to the other side of the argument. If \n     affirmative action has worked and if \n\n[[Page S 10308]]\n     there is evidence that discrimination still exist on a wide scale in \n     ways that are conscious and unconscious, then why should we \n     get rid of it, as many people are urging? Some question the \n     effectiveness or the fairness of particular affirmative \n     action programs. I say to all of you, those are fair \n     questions, and they prompted the review of our affirmative \n     action programs, about which I will talk in a few moments.\n       Some question the fundamental purpose of the effort. There \n     are people who honestly believe that affirmative action \n     always amounts to group preferences over individual merit; \n     that affirmative action always leads to reverse \n     discrimination; that ultimately, therefore, it demeans those \n     who benefit from it and discriminates against those who are \n     not helped by it.\n       I just have to tell you that all you have to decide how you \n     feel about that, and all of our fellow countrymen and women \n     have to decide as well. But I believe if there are no quotas, \n     if we give no opportunities to unqualified people, if we have \n     no reverse discrimination, and if, when the problem ends--the \n     program ends, that criticism is wrong. That's what I believe. \n     But we should have this debate and everyone should ask the \n     question. (Applause.)\n       Now let's deal with what I really think is behind so much \n     of this debate today. There are a lot of people who oppose \n     affirmative action today who supported if for a very long \n     time. I believe they are responding to the sea change in the \n     experiences that most Americans have in the world in which we \n     live.\n       If you say now you're against affirmative action because \n     the government is using its power or the private sector is \n     using its power to help minorities at the expense of the \n     majority, that gives you a way of explaining away the \n     economic distress that a majority of Americans honestly feel. \n     It gives you a way of turning their resentment against the \n     minorities or against a particular government program, \n     instead of having an honest debate about how we all got into \n     the fix we're in and what we're all going to do together to \n     get out of it.\n       That explanation, the affirmative action explanation for \n     the fix we're in, is just wrong. It is just wrong. \n     Affirmative action did not cause the great economic problems \n     of the American middle class. (Applause.)\n       And because most minorities or women are either members of \n     that middle class or people who are poor who are struggling \n     to get into it, we must also admit that affirmative action \n     alone won't solve the problems of minorities and women who \n     seek to be part of the American Dream. To do that, we have to \n     have an economic strategy that reverses the decline in wages \n     and the growth of poverty among working people. Without that, \n     women, minorities, and white males will all be in trouble in \n     the future.\n       But it is wrong to use the anxieties of the middle class to \n     divert the American people from the real causes of their \n     economic distress--the sweeping historic changes taking all \n     the globe in its path, and the specific policies or lack of \n     them in our own country which have aggravated those \n     challenges. It is simply wrong to play politics with the \n     issue of affirmative action and divide our country at a time \n     when, if we're really going to change things, we have to be \n     united. (Applause.)\n       I must say, I think it is ironic that some of those--not \n     all, but some of those--who call for an end to affirmative \n     action also advocate policies which will make the real \n     economic problems of the anxious middle class even worse. \n     They talk about opportunity\n      and being for equal opportunity for everyone, and then they \n     reduce investment in equal opportunity on an evenhanded \n     basis. For example, if the real goal is economic \n     opportunity for all Americans, why in the world would we \n     reduce our investment in education from Head Start to \n     affordable college loans? Why don't we make college loans \n     available to every American instead? (Applause.)\n       If the real goal is empowering all middle class Americans \n     and empowering poor people to work their way into the middle \n     class without regard to race or gender, why in the world \n     would the people who advocate that turn around and raise \n     taxes on our poorest working families, or reduce the money \n     available for education and training when they lose their \n     jobs or they're living on poverty wages, or increase the cost \n     of housing for lower-income, working people with children?\n       Why would we do that? If we're going to empower America, we \n     have to do more than talk about it, we have to do it. And we \n     surely have learned that we cannot empower all Americans by a \n     simple strategy of taking opportunity away from some \n     Americans. (Applause.)\n       So to those who use this as a political strategy to divide \n     us, we must say, no. We must say, no. (Applause.)\n       But to those who raise legitimate questions about the way \n     affirmative action works, or who raise the larger question \n     about the genuine problems and anxieties of all the American \n     people and their sense of being left behind and treated \n     unfairly, we must say, yes, you are entitled to answers to \n     your questions. We must say yes to that.\n       Now, that's why I ordered this review of all of our \n     affirmative action programs--a review to look at the facts, \n     not the politics of affirmative action. This review concluded \n     that affirmative action remains a useful tool for widening \n     economic and educational opportunity. The model used by the \n     military, the Army in particular--and I'm delighted to have \n     the Commanding General of the Army here today because he set \n     such a fine example--has been especially successful because \n     it emphasizes education and training, ensuring that it has a \n     wide pool of qualified candidates for every level of \n     promotion. That approach has given us the most racially \n     diverse and best-qualified military in our history. There are \n     more opportunities for women and minorities there than ever \n     before. And now there are over 50 generals and admirals who \n     are Hispanic, Asian or African Americans.\n       We found that the Education Department had programs \n     targeted on under-represented minorities that do a great deal \n     of good with the tiniest of investments. We found that these \n     programs comprised 40 cents of every $1,000 in the Education \n     Department's budget.\n       Now, college presidents will tell you that the education \n     their schools offer actually benefits from diversity--\n     colleges where young people get the education and make the \n     personal and professional contacts that will shape their \n     lives. If their colleges look like the world they're going to \n     live and work in, and they learn from all different kinds of \n     people things that they can't learn in books, our systems of \n     higher education are stronger.\n       Still, I believe every child needs the chance to go to \n     college. Every child. That means every child has to have a \n     chance to get affordable and repayable college loans, Pell \n     Grants for poor kids and a chance to do things like join \n     AmeriCorps and work their way through school. Every child is \n     entitled to that. That is not an argument against affirmative \n     action. It's an argument for more opportunity for more \n     Americans until everyone is reached. (Applause.)\n       As I said a moment ago, the review found that the Small \n     Business Administration last year increased loans to \n     minorities by over two-thirds, loans to women by over 80 \n     percent, did not decrease loans to\n      white men, and not a single loan went to an unqualified \n     person. People who never had a chance before to be part of \n     the American system of free enterprise now have it. No one \n     was hurt in the process. That made America stronger.\n       This review also found that the executive order on \n     employment practices of large federal contractors also has \n     helped to bring more fairness and inclusion into the work \n     force.\n       Since President Nixon was here in my job, America has used \n     goals and timetables to preserve opportunity and to prevent \n     discrimination, to urge businesses to set higher expectations \n     for themselves and to realize those expectations. But we did \n     not and we will not use rigid quotas to mandate outcomes.\n       We also looked at the way we award procurement contracts \n     under the programs known as set-asides. There's no question \n     that these programs have helped to build up firms owned by \n     minorities and women, who historically had been excluded from \n     the old-boy networks in these areas. It has helped a new \n     generation of entrepreneurs to flourish, opening new paths to \n     self-reliance and an economic growth in which all of us \n     ultimately share. Because of the set-asides, businesses ready \n     to compete have had a chance to compete, a chance they would \n     not have otherwise had.\n       But as with any government program, set-asides can be \n     misapplied, misused, even intentionally abused. There are \n     critics who exploit that fact as an excuse to abolish all \n     these programs, regardless of their effects. I believe they \n     are wrong, but I also believe, based on our factual review, \n     we clearly need some reform. So first, we should crack down \n     on those who take advantage of everyone else through fraud \n     and abuse. We must crack down on fronts and pass-throughs, \n     people who pretend to be eligible for these programs and \n     aren't. That is wrong. (Applause.)\n       We also, in offering new businesses a leg up, must make \n     sure that the set-asides go to businesses that need them \n     most. We must really look and make sure that our standard for \n     eligibility is fair and defensible. We have to tighten the \n     requirement to move businesses out of programs once they've \n     had a fair opportunity to compete. The graduation requirement \n     must mean something--it must mean graduation. There should be \n     no permanent set-aside for any company.\n       Second, we must, and we will, comply with the Supreme \n     Court's Adarand decision of last month. Now, in particular, \n     that means focusing set-aside programs on particular regions \n     and business sectors where the problems of discrimination or \n     exclusion are provable and are clearly requiring affirmative \n     action. I have directed the Attorney General and the agencies \n     to move forward with compliance with Adarand expeditiously.\n       But I also want to emphasize that the Adarand decision did \n     not dismantle affirmative action and did not dismantle set-\n     asides. In fact, while setting stricter standards to mandate \n     reform of affirmative action, it actually reaffirmed the need \n     for affirmative action and reaffirmed the continuing \n     existence of systematic discrimination in the United States. \n     (Applause.)\n       What the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to do \n     was to meet the same more rigorous standard for affirmative \n     action programs that state and local governments were ordered \n     to meet several years ago. And the best set-aside programs \n     under that standard have been challenged and have survived.\n       Third, beyond discrimination, we need to do more to help \n     disadvantaged people and distressed communities, no matter \n     what their race or gender. There are places in our \n\n[[Page S 10309]]\n     country where the free enterprise system simply doesn't reach. It \n     simply isn't working to provide jobs and opportunity. \n     Disproportionately, these areas in urban and rural\n      America are highly populated by racial minorities, but not \n     entirely. To make this initiative work, I believe the \n     government must become a better partner for people in \n     places in urban and rural America that are caught in a \n     cycle of poverty. And I believe we have to find ways to \n     get the private sector to assume their rightful role as a \n     driver of economic growth.\n       It has always amazed me that we have given incentives to \n     our business people to help to develop poor economies in \n     other parts of the world, our neighbors in the Caribbean, our \n     neighbors in other parts of the world--I have supported this \n     when not subject to their own abuses--but we ignore the \n     biggest source of economic growth available to the American \n     economy, the poor economies isolated within the United States \n     of America. (Applause.)\n       There are those who say, well, even if we made the jobs \n     available, people wouldn't work. They haven't tried. Most of \n     the people in disadvantaged communities work today, and most \n     of them who don't work have a very strong desire to do so. In \n     central Harlem, 14 people apply for every single minimum-wage \n     job opening. Think how many more would apply if there were \n     good jobs with a good future. Our job has to connect \n     disadvantaged people and disadvantaged communities to \n     economic opportunity, so that everybody who wants to work can \n     do so.\n       We've been working at this through our empowerment zones \n     and community development banks, through the initiatives of \n     Secretary Cisneros of the Housing and Urban Development \n     Department and many other things that we have tried to do to \n     put capital where it is needed. And now I have asked Vice \n     President Gore to develop a proposal to use our contracting \n     to support businesses that locate themselves in these \n     distressed areas or hire a large percentage of their workers \n     from these areas--not to substitute for what we're doing in \n     affirmative action, but to supplement it, to go beyond it, to \n     do something that will help to deal with the economic crisis \n     of America. We want to make our procurement system more \n     responsive to people in these areas who need help.\n       My fellow Americans, affirmative action has to be made \n     consistent with our highest ideals of personal responsibility \n     and merit, and our urgent need to find common ground, and to \n     prepare all Americans to compete in the global economy of the \n     next century.\n       Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the \n     Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four \n     standards of fairness to all our affirmative action programs \n     that I have already articulated: No quotas in theory or \n     practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including \n     reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not \n     qualified for any job or other opportunity; and as soon as a \n     program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that \n     doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or \n     reformed to meet them.\n       But let me be clear: Affirmative action has been good for \n     America. (Applause.)\n       Affirmative action has not always been perfect, and \n     affirmative action should not go on forever. It should be \n     changed now to take care of those things that are wrong, and \n     it should be retired when its job is done. I am resolved that \n     that day will come. But the evidence suggests, indeed, \n     screams that that day has not come.\n       The job of ending discrimination in this country is not \n     over. That should not be surprising. We had slavery for \n     centuries before the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15 \n     Amendments. We waited another hundred years for the civil \n     rights legislation. Women have had the vote less than a \n     hundred years. We have always had difficulty with these \n     things, as most societies do. But we are making more progress \n     than many people.\n       Based on the evidence, the job is not done.\n        So here is what I think we should do. We should reaffirm \n     the principle of affirmative action and fix the practices. \n     We should have a simple slogan: Mend it, but don't end it. \n     (Applause.)\n       Let me ask all Americans, whether they agree or disagree \n     with what I have said today, to see this issue in the larger \n     context of our times. President Lincoln said, we cannot \n     escape our history. We cannot escape our future, either. And \n     that future must be one in which every American has the \n     chance to live up to his or her God-given capacities.\n       The new technology, the instant communications, the \n     explosion of global commerce have created enormous \n     opportunities and enormous anxieties for Americans. In the \n     last two and a half years, we have seen seven million new \n     jobs, more millionaires and new businesses than ever before, \n     high corporate profits, and a booming stock market. Yet, most \n     Americans are working harder for the same or lower pay. And \n     they feel more insecurity about their jobs, their retirement, \n     their health care, and their children's education. Too many \n     of our children are clearly exposed to poverty and welfare, \n     violence and drugs.\n       These are the great challenges for our whole country on the \n     homefront at the dawn of the 21st century. We've got to find \n     the wisdom and the will to create family-wage jobs for all \n     the people who want to work; to open the door of college to \n     all Americans; to strengthen families and reduce the awful \n     problems to which our children are exposed; to move poor \n     Americans from welfare to work.\n       This is the work of our administration--to give the people \n     the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, to \n     give families and communities the tools they need to solve \n     their own problems. But let us not forget affirmative action \n     didn't cause these problems. It won't solve them. And getting \n     rid of affirmative action certainly won't solve them.\n       If properly done, affirmative action can help us come \n     together, go forward and grow together. It is in our moral, \n     legal and practical interest to see that every person can \n     make the most of his life. In the fight for the future, we \n     need all hands on deck and some of those hands still need a \n     helping hand.\n       In our national community, we're all different, we're all \n     the same. We want liberty and freedom. We want the embrace of \n     family and community. We want to make the most of our own \n     lives and we're determined to give our children a better one. \n     Today there are voices of division who would say forget all \n     that. Don't you dare. Remember we're still closing the gap \n     between our founders' ideals and our reality. But every step \n     along the way has made us richer, stronger and better. And \n     the best is yet to come.\n       Thank you very much. And God bless you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10305-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10309-S10315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  FIFTY YEARS OF THE ENDLESS FRONTIER\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 50 years ago today the Truman White \nHouse released ``Science--The Endless Frontier,'' the document that set \nthe course for this country's postwar science and technology policy and \nthat has continuing relevance today, five decades later.\n  This seminal report was written by Vannevar Bush, Director of the \nOffice of Scientific Research and Development, who had headed up the \nwartime mobilization of our Nation's scientific and technological \nresources to defeat our Axis foes. It was written in response to a \nseries of four questions which had been posed to Dr. Bush by President \nRoosevelt in a letter dated November 17, 1944.\n  As the Bush report was being released, President Truman was at the \nPotsdam conference with Churchill and Stalin. Three days earlier in the \nNew Mexico desert, the United States had detonated the first atomic \nbomb--the Trinity test, although that would remain secret to all but a \nfew leaders and the Potsdam principals until the Hiroshima bombing on \nAugust 6.\n  The research effort which Dr. Bush, a Republican I might add, had \nheaded during the war was the greatest scientific and technological \nmobilization the world had ever seen. It had included not just the \nManhattan Project, but major efforts and great successes in weapons \ntechnologies, such as radars, fighter aircraft, bomber aircraft, and \ncode breaking, and in what we call today dual-use technologies, such as \nthe first electronic computer, aircraft engines, medical technologies, \nand communications technologies.\n  President Roosevelt had asked Bush four questions:\n\n       First: What can be done, consistent with military security, \n     and with the prior approval of military authorities, to make \n     known to the world as soon as possible the contributions \n     which have been made during our war effort to scientific \n     knowledge?\n       The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate \n     new enterprises, provide jobs for returning servicemen and \n     other workers, and make possible great strides for the \n     improvement of the national well-being.\n       Second: With particular reference to the war of science \n     against disease, what can be done now to organize a program \n     for continuing in the future, the work which has been done in \n     medicine and related sciences?\n       The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or \n     two diseases alone are far in excess of the total number of \n     lives lost by us in battle during this war should make us \n     conscious of the duty we owe future generations.\n       Third: What can the Government do now and in the future to \n     aid research activities by public and private organizations? \n     The proper roles of public and of private research, and their \n     interrelation, should be carefully considered.\n       Fourth: Can an effective program be proposed for \n     discovering and developing scientific talent in American \n     youth so that the continuing future of scientific research in \n     this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has \n     been done during the war?\n\n  President Roosevelt added:\n\n       New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are \n     pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with \n     which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more \n     fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life.\n\n  Vannevar Bush worked with four advisory committees over the next 7 \nmonths to respond to the President's \n\n[[Page S 10310]]\ntasking. Unfortunately, Roosevelt had passed away before he could \nreceive this far-seeing report, which fully endorsed his vision of a \nnew and endless frontier of science in the national interest. Instead \nit was Truman who met with Bush on June 14, 1945, and approved the \nrelease of the report. And it was Truman who would oversee the \nestablishment of the National Science Foundation 5 years later after a \nlong congressional debate and the implementation of the report's other \nrecommendations.\n  What did the report say and why is it still relevant? Mr. President, \nuntil the Bush report, we had no national policy for science. Bush \nargued that this must end. ``In this war,'' he wrote, ``it has become \nclear beyond all doubt that scientific research is absolutely essential \nto national security.'' But he went beyond the national security \njustification for governmental support of research:\n\n       More and better scientific research is essential to the \n     achievement of our goal of full employment . . . Progress in \n     combating disease depends upon an expanding body of \n     scientific knowledge.\n\n  Bush saw the Government's role in supporting science and technology \nas filling needs where the public interest was great, but the private \nsector would not meet these needs adequately. He wrote:\n\n       There are areas of science in which the public interest is \n     acute but which are likely to be cultivated inadequately if \n     left without more support than will come from private \n     sources. These areas--such as research on military problems, \n     agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical \n     research, and research involving expensive capital facilities \n     beyond the capacity of private institutions--should be \n     advanced by active Government support. To date, with the \n     exception of the intensive war research conducted by the \n     Office of Scientific Research and Development, such support \n     has been meager and intermittent. For reasons presented in \n     this report we are entering a period when science needs and \n     deserves increased support from public funds.\n\n  It is striking to me in rereading ``Science--The Endless Frontier,'' \nhow soundly Bush and his colleagues addressed almost every aspect of \nscience and technology policy--from the Tax Code to patent policy to \nscience education to the structure of the postwar science and \ntechnology infrastructure in Government. Bush's report put the United \nStates on a course of sustaining preeminence in science and technology \nfor the past 50 years, a course that enjoyed bipartisan support for \nmost of those five decades.\n  What have our scientists and engineers accomplished with the \nresources the taxpayers gave them over the past five decades? They won \nthe cold war, put men on the moon, revolutionized medicine, invented \ncomputers, pioneered electronics and semiconductor devices, and \ninvented a myriad of new materials that have fundamentally changed our \nlives.\n  This is just as Bush predicted half a century ago. Bush had the \nwisdom to know that new scientific and technological fields would \nemerge that he could not yet imagine: semiconductor electronics, \nmolecular biology, and materials science to name just three. Bush had \nthe vision to see that Federal investments in science and technology \ncould transform our lives and contribute to our health, standard of \nliving and security.\n  For the past half century, the Federal Government has acted on Bush's \nvision to foster a science and technology enterprise in this country \nsecond to none. It is not an accident that American industries from \naerospace to agriculture to pharmaceuticals, in which the Federal \nGovernment has made substantial research investments, enjoy world \nleadership. It is a direct result of the vision of Vannevar Bush, who \nwe remember today as one of the giants of the post-war generation. I \nask unanimous consent that the first 12 pages of Bush's report, \nincluding Roosevelt's letter and Bush's response to Truman, be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Any Member who would \nlike a copy of the complete report, which runs 196 pages with \nappendices, should contact my office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the bipartisan consensus \non our science and technology policy is now fracturing as we seek to \nbalance the Federal budget. The Republican budget resolution passed at \nthe end of June proposes to slash the Federal research investment \nacross government. By the year 2002, the Federal Government will be \nspending about $28.5 billion for civilian research and development, \ndown a third from today's investment in real terms.\n  These figures come from estimates made by the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science. I ask unanimous consent that an article \nfrom the July 3 issue of New Technology Week entitled ``GOP Balanced \nBudget Plan Seen Crippling R'' together with an accompanying table be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Federal investments in civilian research as a \npercentage of our economy and as a percentage of overall Federal \nspending will be lower in 2002 than at any time in 40 years or more. \nOur national R investment, public and private, will be dipping below \n2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) while almost every other \nindustrialized nation seeks to match the Japanese and German R \ninvestment levels of almost 3 percent of GDP.\n  Will this matter? In the short term, perhaps not, other than to the \nthousands of scientists and engineers who will be displaced. According \nto a recent White House report, our previous investments have given us \na substantial lead in many critical technologies. In the longer term, \nundoubtedly it will matter. That same report concluded that both the \nJapanese and Europeans are catching up in many areas and new nations \nwill challenge in the future.\n  In 1899 Charles Duell, Director of the U.S. Patent Office, proposed \nto close up shop because ``everything that can be invented, has been \ninvented.'' Luckily, we did not follow such Luddite advice as we \nprepared for the 20th century. Nor should we today as we prepare for \nthe challenges of the 21st century and seek to maintain this Nation's \nplace as the pioneer leading the family of nations in the exploration \nof the endless scientific frontier.\n  The scientific and technological frontier really is still endless. \nBush, not Duell, had it right. Scientific revolutions are still only \nbeginning in molecular biology, materials science, and electronics and \nhave not yet begun in areas yet to be discovered. For the past half \ncentury the Federal Government has been an excellent steward of the \ntaxpayers' money in this area. Not every project has been a success, \nnor should they have been. But the payoff to our economy and our \nsecurity and our well-being--the areas Roosevelt queried Bush about--\nhas been worth many times the investment.\n  Some in Congress argue for more than decimating our Federal research \nenterprise on the grounds that civilian applied research spending \nconstitutes ``corporate welfare'' or ``industrial policy.'' This is \nfundamentally wrong, for reasons that President Bush first outlined in \nhis speech to the American Electronics Association in February 1990 and \nwhich he reiterated throughout the rest of his Presidency. I will not \ngo into a long discussion of that today. But I will note that a \nRepublican pollster has concluded that the American people do not agree \nwith the priority assigned Federal research spending in the Republican \nbudget.\n  I refer to a report in the same July 3 issue of New Technology Week \nentitled ``Public Surprises Pollsters, Backs Federal R'' I ask \nunanimous consent that it also be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. According to this article, Steve Wagner of Luntz \nResearch & Strategic Service, said: ``We went looking for things that \ndidn't pan out. We went looking for the degree to which government \ninvestment in R was seen as corporate welfare, and we didn't find it. \nWe went looking for the degree to which concerns about the deficit cast \nsuch a pall over everything that R should take a disproportionate or \neven proportionate cut, and they told us ``no.'' It's fair to say that \nI was surprised by the extent of support.''\n  Wagner went on to say: ``People are very pragmatic.'' He encapsulated \nthe \n\n[[Page S 10311]]\npublic's message as: ``Jobs are a priority, finding a cure for AIDS is \na priority, and if it takes the Government to do it, the Government \nshould do it.'' And he adds: ``If they think government involvement \nwill make the situation better, people will not hesitate to say that's \na legitimate function of Government.''\n  Wagner and his fellow pollster Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion \nStrategies conclude that there is a preference in the public mind for \npublic-private R partnerships. Their advice for their House \nRepublican clients reads: ``Neither the Government nor private industry \nis completely trusted to make these (research) investment decisions. \nThe Government remains the agency of the common interest. Private \nbusiness is seen as more efficient, more disciplined, but also self-\ninterested. These perceptions cannot be changed in the short run, but \nthey can be used: Let the private sector say what is feasible, which \ntechnologies offer the promise of payoff, and let the Government say \nwhat is in the national interest to develop. A partnership of both \nentities looking over each other's shoulder will likely be most \nsatisfying to the voters.''\n  When I read this, I thought the pollsters were giving a pretty good \ndescription of SEMATECH, the Technology Reinvestment Project, the \nAdvanced Technology Program, the Environmental Technology Initiative, \nand the many other partnerships which Presidents Reagan, Bush, and \nClinton have fostered over the past decade.\n  Vannevar Bush did not use focus groups and pollsters to figure out \nthe direction of post-war science and technology policy. But without \ntheir benefit, he captured the public sentiment both then and today. He \nsaw the need for partnership, for industry to do what it did well in \nthe pursuit of profit and for Government to fill needs that industry \nwould not in the public interest, needs in areas ranging from military \nresearch to medical research to applied research in housing, \nagriculture and other areas designed to generate jobs.\n  I hope that my Republican colleagues will take the advice of their \npollsters. Speaker Gingrich told the American people on David \nBrinkley's Sunday morning news broadcast on June 11 that he was worried \nabout the degree to which research budgets were scheduled to be cut. He \nsaid: ``Yes, I am sufficiently worried that I met with Congressman \nWalker, the chairman of the House Science Committee, and with various \nsubcommittee chairmen of the House Appropriations Committee who have \nscience, and asked them to maximize the money that goes into research \nand development, because I am very concerned that we're going to cut \ntoo deeply into science.''\n  Mr. President, recognition of a problem is perhaps the first step to \na solution. I have yet to see research and development spared in the \nbudget process in the House appropriations subcommittees, far from it. \nBut perhaps with the help of rereading Science--The Endless Frontier, \nthis generation of politicians will find the resources for Federal R \ninvestments which our grandchildren will need for their security, their \nprosperity, and their well-being.\n  President Clinton and Vice President Gore stand in the long line of \nAmerican leaders dating from Roosevelt, Truman, and Vannevar Bush who \nhave supported an American science and technology enterprise second to \nnone in the public interest. The Republican budget resolution stands \noutside that tradition. The sooner Speaker Gingrich and his Republican \ncolleagues can return to bipartisanship on these vital investments in \nour Nation's future, the less the damage will be.\n  Mr. President, I hope that will be soon. I yield the floor.\n                     Science--The Endless Frontier\n\n\n                         letter of transmittal\n\n                                              Office of Scientific\n\n\n                                     Research and Development,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 1945.\n       Dear Mr. President: In a letter dated November 17, 1944, \n     President Roosevelt requested my recommendation on the \n     following points:\n       (1) What can be done, consistent with military security, \n     and with the prior approval of the military authorities, to \n     make known to the world as soon as possible the contributions \n     which have been made during our war effort to scientific \n     knowledge?\n       (2) With particular reference to the war of science against \n     disease, what can be done now to organize a program for \n     continuing in the future the work which has been done in \n     medicine and related sciences?\n       (3) What can the Government do now and in the future to aid \n     research activities by public and private organizations?\n       (4) Can an effective program be proposed for discovering \n     and developing scientific talent in American youth so that \n     the continuing future of scientific research in this country \n     may be assured on a level comparable to what has been done \n     during the war?\n       It is clear from President Roosevelt's letter that in \n     speaking of science he had in mind the natural sciences, \n     including biology and medicine, and I have so interpreted his \n     questions. Progress in other fields, such as the social \n     sciences and the humanities, is likewise important; but the \n     program for science presented in my report warrants immediate \n     attention.\n       In seeking answers to President Roosevelt's questions I \n     have had the assistance of distinguished committees specially \n     qualified to advise in respect to these subjects. The \n     committees have given these matters the serious attention \n     they deserve; indeed, they have regarded this as an \n     opportunity to participate in shaping the policy of the \n     country with reference to scientific research. They have had \n     many meetings and have submitted formal reports. I have been \n     in close touch with the work of the committees and with their \n     members throughout. I have examined all of the data they \n     assembled and the suggestions they submitted on the points \n     raised in President Roosevelt's letter.\n       Although the report which I submit herewith is my own, the \n     facts, conclusions, and recommendations are based on the \n     findings of the committees which have studied these \n     questions. Since my report is necessarily brief, I am \n     including as appendices the full reports of the committees.\n       A single mechanism for implementing the recommendations of \n     the several committees is essential. In proposing such a \n     mechanism I have departed somewhat from the specific \n     recommendations of the committees, but I have since been \n     assured that the plan I am proposing is fully acceptable to \n     the committee members.\n       The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this Nation. \n     Science offers a largely unexplored hinterland for the \n     pioneer who has the tools for his task. The rewards of such \n     exploration both for the Nation and the individual are great. \n     Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a \n     nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher \n     standard of living, and to our cultural progress.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                          V. Bush,\n                                                         Director.\n     The President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, D.C.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                      president roosevelt's letter\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1944.\n       Dear Dr. Bush: The Office of Scientific Research and \n     Development, of which you are the Director, represents a \n     unique experiment of team-work and cooperation in \n     coordinating scientific research and in applying existing \n     scientific knowledge to the solution of the technical \n     problems paramount in war. Its work has been conducted in the \n     utmost secrecy and carried on without public recognition of \n     any kind; but its tangible results can be found in the \n     communiques coming in from the battlefronts all over the \n     world. Some day the full story of its achievements can be \n     told.\n       There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in \n     this experiment cannot be profitably employed in times of \n     peace. The information, the techniques, and the research \n     experience developed by the Office of Scientific Research and \n     Development and by the thousands of scientists in the \n     universities and in private industry, should be used in the \n     days of peace ahead for the improvement of the national \n     health, the creation of new enterprises bringing new jobs, \n     and the betterment of the national standard of living.\n       It is with that objective in mind that I would like to have \n     your recommendations on the following four major points:\n       First: What can be done, consistent with military security, \n     and with the prior approval of the military authorities, to \n     make known to the world as soon as possible the contributions \n     which have been made during our war effort to scientific \n     knowledge?\n       The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate \n     new enterprises, provide jobs for our returning servicemen \n     and other workers, and make possible great strides for the \n     improvement of the national well-being.\n       Second: With particular reference to the war of science \n     against disease, what can be done now to organize a program \n     for continuing in the future the work which has been done in \n     medicine and related science?\n       The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or \n     two diseases alone are far in excess of the total number of \n     lives lost by us in battle during this war should make us \n     conscious of the duty we owe future generations.\n       Third: What can the Government do now and in the future to \n     aid research activities by public and private organizations? \n     The proper roles of public and of private research, and their \n     interrelation, should be carefully considered.\n       Fourth: Can an effective program be proposed for \n     discovering and developing scientific talent in American \n     youth so that the \n\n[[Page S 10312]]\n     continuing future of scientific research in this country may be assured \n     on a level comparable to what has been done during the war?\n       New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are \n     pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with \n     which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more \n     fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life.\n       I hope that, after such consultation as you may deem \n     advisable with your associates and others, you can let me \n     have your considered judgment on these matters as soon as \n     convenient--reporting on each when you are ready, rather than \n     waiting for completion of your studies in all.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                            Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n     Dr. Vannevar Bush,\n     Office of Scientific Research and Development, Washington, \n     D.C.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                         summary of the report\n\n                    Scientific progress is essential\n\n       Progress in the war against disease depends upon a flow of \n     new scientific knowledge. New products, new industries, and \n     more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the \n     laws of nature, and the application of that knowledge to \n     practical purpose. Similarly, our defense against aggression \n     demands new knowledge so that we can develop new and improved \n     weapons. The essential, new knowledge can be obtained only \n     through basic scientific research.\n       Science can be effective in the national welfare only as a \n     member of a team, whether the conditions be peace or war. But \n     without scientific progress no amount of achievement in other \n     directions can insure our health, prosperity, and security as \n     a nation in the modern world.\n\n                      For the war against disease\n\n       We have taken great strides in the war against disease. The \n     death rate for all diseases in the Army, including overseas \n     forces, has been reduced from 14.1 per thousand in the last \n     war to 0.6 per thousand in this war. In the last 40 years \n     life expectancy has increased from 49 to 65 years, largely as \n     a consequence of the reduction in the death rates of infants \n     and children. But we are far from the goal. The annual deaths \n     from one or two diseases far exceed the total number of \n     American lives lost in battle during this year. A large \n     fraction of these deaths in our civilian population cut short \n     the useful lives of our citizens. Approximately 7,000,000 \n     persons in the United States are mentally ill and their care \n     costs the public over $175,000,000 a year. Clearly much \n     illness remains for which adequate means of prevention and \n     cure are not yet known.\n       The responsibility for basic research in medicine and the \n     underlying sciences, so essential to progress in the war \n     against disease, falls primarily upon the medical schools and \n     universities. Yet we find that the traditional sources of \n     support for medical research in the medical schools and \n     universities, largely endowment income, foundation grants, \n     and private donations, are diminishing and there is no \n     immediate prospect of a change in this trend. Meanwhile, the \n     cost of medical research has been rising. If we are to \n     maintain\n      the progress in medicine which has marked the last 25 years, \n     the Government should extend financial support to basic \n     medical research in the medical schools and in \n     universities.\n\n                       For our national security\n\n       The bitter and dangerous battle against the U-boat was a \n     battle of scientific techniques--and our margin of success \n     was dangerously small. The new eyes which radar has supplied \n     can sometime be blinded by new scientific developments. V-2 \n     was countered only by capture of the launching sites.\n       We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy \n     while we struggle to catch up. There must be more--and more \n     adequate--military research in peacetime. It is essential \n     that the civilian scientists continue in peacetime some \n     portion of those contributions to national security which \n     they have made so effectively during the war. This can best \n     be done through a civilian-controlled organization with close \n     liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from \n     Congress, and the clear power to initiate military research \n     which will supplement and strengthen that carried on directly \n     under the control of the Army and Navy.\n\n                       And for the public welfare\n\n       One of our hopes is that after the war there will be full \n     employment. To reach that goal the full creative and \n     productive energies of the American people must be released. \n     To create more jobs we must make new and better and cheaper \n     products. We want plenty of new, vigorous enterprises. But \n     new products and processes are not born full-grown. They are \n     founded on new principles and new conceptions which in turn \n     result from basic scientific research. Basic scientific \n     research is scientific capital. Moreover, we cannot any \n     longer depend upon Europe as a major source of this \n     scientific capital. Clearly, more and better scientific \n     research is one essential to the achievement of our goal of \n     full employment.\n       How do we increase this scientific capital? First, we must \n     have plenty of men and women trained in science, for upon \n     them depends both the creation of new knowledge and its \n     application to practical purposes. Second, we must strengthen \n     the centers of basic research which are principally the \n     colleges, universities, and research institutes. These \n     institutions provide the environment which is most conducive \n     to the creation of new scientific knowledge and least under \n     pressure for immediate, tangible results. With some notable \n     exceptions, most research in industry and in Government \n     involves application of existing scientific knowledge to \n     practical problems. It is only the colleges, universities, \n     and a few research institutes that devote most of their \n     research efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.\n       Expenditures for scientific research by industry and \n     Government increased from $140,000,000 in 1930 to \n     $309,000,000 in 1940. Those for the colleges and universities \n     increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those for \n     research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to $4,500,000 \n     during the same period. If the colleges, universities, and \n     research institutes are to meet the rapidly increasing \n     demands of industry and Government for new scientific \n     knowledge, their basic research should be strengthened by use \n     of public funds.\n       For science to serve as a powerful factor in our national \n     welfare, applied research both in Government and in industry \n     must be vigorous. To improve the quality of scientific \n     research within the Government, steps should be taken to \n     modify the procedures for recruiting, classifying, and \n     compensating scientific personnel in order to reduce the \n     present handicap of governmental scientific bureaus in \n     competing with industry and the universities for top-grade \n     scientific talent. To provide coordination of the common \n     scientific activities of these governmental agencies as to \n     policies and budgets, a permanent Science Advisory Board \n     should be created to advise the executive and legislative \n     branches of Government on these matters.\n       The most important ways in which the Government can promote \n     industrial research are to increase the flow of new \n     scientific knowledge through support of basic research, and \n     to aid in the development of scientific talent. In addition, \n     the Government should provide suitable incentives to industry \n     to conduct research (a) by clarification of present \n     uncertainties in the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the \n     deductibility of research and development expenditures as \n     current charges against net income, and (b) by strengthening \n     the patent system so as to eliminate uncertainties which now \n     bear heavily on small industries and so as to prevent abuses \n     which reflect discredit upon a basically sound system. In \n     addition, ways should be found to cause the benefits of basic \n     research to reach industries which do not now utilize new \n     scientific knowledge.\n\n                  We must renew our scientific talent\n\n       The responsibility for the creation of new scientific \n     knowledge--and for most of its application--rests on that \n     small body of men and women who understand the fundamental \n     laws of nature and are skilled in the techniques of \n     scientific research. We shall have rapid or slow advance on \n     any scientific frontier depending on the number of highly \n     qualified and trained scientists exploring it.\n       The deficit of science and technology students who, but for \n     the war, would have received bachelor's degrees is about \n     150,000. It is estimated that the deficit of those obtaining \n     advanced degrees in these fields will amount in 1955 to about \n     17,000--for it takes at least 6 years from college entry to \n     achieve a doctor's degree or its equivalent in science or \n     engineering. The real ceiling on our productivity of new \n     scientific knowledge and its application in the war against \n     disease, and the development of new products and new \n     industries, is the number of trained scientists available.\n       The training of a scientist is a long and expensive \n     process. Studies clearly show that there are talented \n     individuals in every part of the population, but with few \n     exceptions, those without the means of buying higher \n     education\n      go without it. If ability, and not the circumstance of \n     family fortune, determines who shall receive higher \n     education in science, then we shall be assured of \n     constantly improving quality at every level of scientific \n     activity. The Government should provide a reasonable \n     number of undergraduate scholarships and graduate \n     fellowships in order to develop scientific talent in \n     scholarships and graduate fellowships in order to develop \n     scientific talent in American youth. The plans should be \n     designed to attract into science only that proportion of \n     youthful talent appropriate to the needs of science in \n     relation to the other needs of the Nation for high \n     abilities.\n\n                       Including those in uniform\n\n       The most immediate prospect of making up the deficit in \n     scientific personnel is to develop the scientific talent in \n     the generation now in uniform. Even if we should start now to \n     train the current crop of high-school graduates none would \n     complete graduate studies before 1951. The Armed Services \n     should comb their records for men who, prior to or during the \n     war, have given evidence of talent for science, and make \n     prompt arrangements, consistent with current discharge plans, \n     for ordering those who remain in uniform, as soon as \n     militarily possible, to duty at institutions here and \n     overseas where they can continue their scientific education. \n     Moreover, the Services should see that those who study \n     overseas have the benefit of the latest scientific \n     information resulting from research during the war.\n\n                         The lid must be lifted\n\n       While most of the war research has involved the application \n     of existing scientific \n\n[[Page S 10313]]\n     knowledge to the problems of war, rather than basic research, there has \n     been accumulated a vast amount of information relating to the \n     application of science to particular problems. Much of this \n     can be used by industry. It is also needed for teaching in \n     the colleges and universities here and in the Armed Forces \n     Institutes overseas. Some of this information must remain \n     secret, but most of it should be made public as soon as there \n     is ground for belief that the enemy will not be able to turn \n     it against us in this war. To select that portion which \n     should be made public, to coordinate its release, and \n     definitely to encourage its publication, a Board composed of \n     Army, Navy, and civilian scientific members should be \n     promptly established.\n\n                          A program for action\n\n       The Government should accept new responsibilities for \n     promoting the flow of new scientific knowledge and the \n     development of scientific talent in our youth. These \n     responsibilities are the proper concern of the Government, \n     for they vitally affect our health, our jobs, and our \n     national security. It is in keeping also with basic United \n     States policy that the Government should foster the opening \n     of new frontiers and this is the modern way to do it. For \n     many years the Government has wisely supported research in \n     the agricultural colleges and the benefits have been great. \n     The time has come when such support should be extended to \n     other fields.\n       The effective discharge of these new responsibilities will \n     require the full attention of some over-all agency devoted to \n     that purpose. There is not now in the permanent governmental \n     structure receiving its funds from Congress an agency adapted \n     to supplementing the support of basic research in the \n     colleges, universities, and research institutes, both in \n     medicine and the natural sciences, adapted to supporting \n     research on new weapons for both Services, or adapted to \n     administering a program of science scholarships and \n     fellowships.\n       Therefore I recommend that a new agency for these purposes \n     be established. Such an agency should be composed of persons \n     of broad interest and experience, having an understanding of \n     the peculiarities of scientific research and scientific \n     education. It should have stability of funds so that long-\n     range programs may be undertaken. It should recognize that \n     freedom of inquiry must be preserved and should leave \n     internal control of policy, personnel, and the method and \n     scope of research to the institutions in which it is carried \n     on. It should be fully responsible to the President and \n     through him to the Congress for its program.\n       Early action on these recommendations is imperative if this \n     Nation is to meet the challenge of science in the crucial \n     years ahead. On the wisdom with which we bring science to \n     bear in the war against disease, in the creation of new \n     industries, and in the strengthening of our Armed Forces \n     depends in large measure our future as a nation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              introduction\n\n                    Scientific progress is essential\n\n       We all know how much the new drug, penicillin, has meant to \n     our grievously wounded men on the grim battlefronts of this \n     war--the countless lives it has saved--the incalculable \n     suffering which its use has prevented. Science and the great \n     practical genius of this Nation made this achievement \n     possible.\n       Some of us know the vital role which radar has played in \n     bringing the Allied Nations to victory over Nazi Germany and \n     in driving the Japanese steadily back from their island \n     bastions. Again it was painstaking scientific research over \n     many years that made radar possible.\n       What we often forget are the millions of pay envelopes on a \n     peacetime Saturday night which are filled because new \n     products and new industries have provided jobs for countless \n     Americans. Science made that possible, too.\n       In 1939 millions of people were employed in industries \n     which did not even exist at the close of the last war--radio, \n     air conditioning, rayon and other synthetic fibers, and \n     plastics are examples of the products of these industries. \n     But these things do not mark the end of progress--they are \n     but the beginning if we make full use of our scientific \n     resources. New manufacturing industries can be started and \n     many older industries greatly strengthened and expanded if we \n     continue to study nature's laws and apply new knowledge to \n     practical purposes.\n       Great advances in agriculture are also based upon \n     scientific research. Plants which are more resistant to \n     disease and are adapted to short growing seasons, the \n     prevention and cure of livestock diseases, the control of our \n     insect enemies, better fertilizers, and improved agricultural \n     practices, all stem from painstaking scientific research.\n       Advances in science when put to practical use mean more \n     jobs, higher wages, shorter hours, more abundant crops, more \n     leisure for recreation, for study, for learning how to live \n     without the deadening drudgery which has been the burden of \n     the common man for ages past. Advances in science will also \n     bring higher standards of living, will lead to the prevention \n     or cure of diseases, will promote conservation of our limited \n     national resources, and will assure means of defense against \n     aggression. But to achieve these objectives--to secure a high \n     level of employment, to maintain a position of world \n     leadership--the flow of new scientific knowledge must be both \n     continuous and substantial.\n       Our population increased from 75 million to 130 million \n     between 1900 and 1940. In some countries comparable increases \n     have been accompanied by famine. In this country the increase \n     has been accompanied by more abundant food supply, better \n     living, more leisure, longer life, and better health. This \n     is, largely, the product of three factors--the free play of \n     initiative of a vigorous people under democracy, the heritage \n     of great natural wealth, and the advance of science and its \n     application.\n       Science, by itself, provides no panacea for individual, \n     social, and economic ills. It can be effective in the \n     national welfare only as a member of a team, whether the \n     conditions be peace or war. But without scientific progress \n     no amount of achievement in other directions can ensure our \n     health, prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern \n     world.\n\n               Science is a proper concern of government\n\n       It has been basic United States policy that Government \n     should foster the opening of new frontiers. It opened the \n     seas to clipper ships and furnished land for pioneers. \n     Although these frontiers have more or less disappeared, the \n     frontier of science remains. It is in keeping with the \n     American tradition--one which has made the United States \n     great--that new frontiers shall be made accessible for \n     development by all American citizens.\n       Moreover, since health, well-being, and security are proper \n     concerns of Government, scientific progress is, and must be, \n     of vital interest to Government. Without scientific progress \n     the national health would deteriorate; without scientific \n     progress we could not hope for improvement in our standard of \n     living or for an increased number of jobs for our citizens; \n     and without scientific progress we could not have maintained \n     our liberties against tyranny.\n\n            Government relations to science--past and future\n\n       From early days the Government has taken an active interest \n     in scientific matters. During the nineteenth century the \n     Coast And Geodetic Survey, the Naval Observatory, the \n     Department of Agriculture, and the Geological Survey were \n     established. Through the Land Grant College Acts the \n     Government has supported research in state institutions for \n     more than 80 years on a gradually increasing scale. Since \n     1900 a large number of scientific agencies have been \n     established within the Federal Government, until in 1939 they \n     numbered more than 40.\n       Much of the scientific research done by Government agencies \n     is intermediate in character between the two types of work \n     commonly referred to as basic and applied research. Almost \n     all Government scientific work has ultimate practical \n     objectives but, in many fields of broad national concern, it \n     commonly involves long-term investigation of a fundamental \n     nature. Generally speaking, the scientific agencies of \n     Government are not so concerned with immediate practical \n     objectives as are the laboratories of industry nor, on the \n     other hand, are they as free to explore any natural phenomena \n     without regard to possible economic applications as are the \n     educational and private research institutions. Government \n     scientific agencies have splendid records of achievement, but \n     they are limited in function.\n       We have no national policy for science. The Government has \n     only begun to utilize science in the Nation's welfare. There \n     is no body within the Government charged with formulating or \n     executing a national science policy. There are no standing \n     committees of the Congress devoted to this important subject. \n     Science has been in the wings. It should be brought to the \n     center of the stage--for in it lies much of our hope for the \n     future.\n       There are areas of science in which the public interest is \n     acute but which are likely to be cultivated inadequately if \n     left without more support than will come from private \n     sources. These areas--such as research on military problems, \n     agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical \n     research, and research involving expensive capital facilities \n     beyond the capacity of private institutions--should be \n     advanced by active Government support. To date, with the \n     exception of the intensive war research conducted by the \n     Office of Scientific Research and Development, such support \n     has been meager and intermittent.\n       For reasons presented in this report we are entering a \n     period when science needs and deserves increased support from \n     public funds.\n\n                  Freedom of inquiry must be preserved\n\n       The publicly and privately supported colleges, \n     universities, and research institutes are the centers of \n     basic research. They are the wellsprings of knowledge and \n     understanding. As long as they are vigorous and healthy and \n     their scientists are free to pursue the truth wherever it may \n     lead, there will be a flow of new scientific knowledge to \n     those who can apply it to practical problems in Government, \n     in industry, or elsewhere.\n       Many of the lessons learned in the war-time application of \n     science under Government can be profitably applied in peace. \n     The Government is peculiarly fitted to perform certain \n     functions, such as the coordination and support of broad \n     programs on problems of great national importance. But we \n     must proceed with caution in carrying over the methods which \n     work in wartime to the very different conditions of peace. We \n     must remove the rigid controls which we have had to impose, \n     and recover freedom of inquiry and that healthy competitive \n     scientific spirit so necessary for expansion of the frontiers \n     of scientific knowledge.\n\n[[Page S 10314]]\n\n       Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free \n     play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own \n     choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for \n     exploration of the unknown. Freedom of inquiry must be \n     preserved under any plan for Government support of science in \n     accordance with the Five Fundamentals listed on page 32.\n       The study of the momentous questions presented in President \n     Roosevelt's letter has been made by able committees working \n     diligently. This report presents conclusions and \n     recommendations based upon the studies of these committees \n     which appear in full as the appendices. Only in the creation \n     of one over-all mechanism rather than several does this \n     report depart from the specific recommendations of the \n     committees. The members of the committees have reviewed the \n     recommendations in regard to the single mechanism and have \n     found this plan thoroughly acceptable.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              GOP Balanced-Budget Plan Seen Crippling R\n\n                            (By Anne Eisele)\n\n       Federal non-defense research and development programs would \n     be cut by an average of one-third by fiscal year 2002 under a \n     Republican balanced-budget plan approved by both houses of \n     Congress late last week, according to an American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science estimate of the plan's \n     projected effects.\n       Although the individual program assumptions under House \n     Continuing Resolution 67 are not binding on congressional \n     appropriators, the plan's overall spending targets are \n     obligatory. And they paint a dire scenario for R \n     initiatives at the departments of Commerce and Energy, the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other \n     agencies.\n       A total non-defense research and development cut of 33.1 \n     percent would drop spending from the current-year level of \n     $34.3 billion to $22.9 billion by FY 2002, under a compromise \n     worked out between Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) \n     and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.).\n       Not surprising, R programs at DOC and DOE--entities that \n     many GOP lawmakers would like to see abolished altogether--\n     take a beating under the GOP plan. Total Commerce Department \n     R funding would be halved by 2002, and Energy Department \n     non-defense R monies would drop 47.4 percent during the \n     same period.\n       And while the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology's Science and Technical Research Services take \n     their biggest beating from inflation, as they lose only one \n     percent over the seven-year period, funding for NIST's $400-\n     million Advanced Technology Program is canceled in FY 1997.\n       The Economic Development Administration and certain \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration R programs \n     also are zeroed out under the Republican plan. DOE's clean \n     coal technology program would be wiped out, and fossil energy \n     R faces an 81.8 percent reduction.\n       Meanwhile, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration takes it on the chin, sustaining an agency-\n     wide cut of 35.9 percent; its key research areas, aeronautics \n     and human space flight, plummet 43.9 percent and 35.1 \n     percent, respectively. NASA's next-generation wind tunnel \n     development program would be terminated in the upcoming \n     fiscal year.\n\n            AAAS Preliminary--Final Budget Resolution--Projected Effects of Concurrent Budget Resolution (H.

We went looking for the degree to which \n     concerns about the deficit cast such a pall over everything \n     that R should take a disproportionate or even a \n     proportionate cut, and they told us `no.' It's fair to say,'' \n     Wagner admits, ``that I was surprised by the extent of \n     support'' for R that was in evidence.\n       That's not to say that the 10- to 13-voter groups, which \n     met for two hours each, had a very detailed picture of how \n     the federal government spends its R dollars. And that's \n     true even though they were chosen to take part in the \n     research--commissioned by IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, and \n     Genentech--in part of their level of education and their \n     interest in current affairs.\n       According to Public Opinion Strategies' Neil Newhouse, in \n     charge of groups in House Science Committee Chairman Bob \n     Walker's Lancaster, Pa., district and the Columbus, Ohio, \n     district of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, \n     participants showed awareness that federal R encompasses \n     the fields of space, health, and defense, but had little \n     knowledge of specific programs.\n       Nonetheless, they staunchly defended the federal R \n     function. ``We pushed people hard in terms of trying to get \n     them to move away from support from R But their support \n     was broad and had a level intensity,'' Newhouse says, that \n     ``contradicted what we saw as the current political \n     environment.''\n       Behind their attitudes may be the fact that, as Wagner puts \n     it, ``people are very pragmatic.'' Far from being greeted \n     with what he regards as ``ideological'' stances, Wagner says, \n     the researchers heard messages he encapsulates as: `` `Jobs \n     are a priority, finding a cure for AIDS is a priority, and if \n     it takes the government to do it, the government should do \n     it.' If they think government involvement will make the \n     situation better, people will not hesitate to say that that's \n     a legitimate function of government.''\n       Still, that doesn't imply an absolute faith in government, \n     or even much faith at all. This mistrust, however, is also \n     directed toward the private sector, and what emerges, \n     according to the researchers, is a preference for public-\n     private R partnerships.\n       ``Neither the government nor private industry is completely \n     trusted to make these investment decisions,'' states a \n     summary of their findings that the two polling organizations \n     issued jointly. ``The government remains the agency of the \n     common interest. Private business is seen as more efficient, \n     more disciplined, but also self-interested.\n       ``These perceptions cannot be changed in the short run, but \n     they can be used: Let the private sector say what is \n     feasible, which technologies offer the promise of payoff, and \n     [let] the government say what is in the national interest to \n     develop. A partnership of both entities looking over each \n     other's shoulder will likely be the most satisfying to the \n     voters.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10309-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I want to speak for just a few moments \nin reaction to the speech made this morning by President Clinton on the \nsubject of affirmative action. The principle that every individual \nshould have an equal opportunity to rise as high as his or her ability \nwill take them, regardless of race, gender, religion, nationality, or \nother group characteristic, is a defining ideal of our society. We must \nbe very wary of any deviation from that principle, no matter how well \nintended. That is why it is clearly time to review all Government \naffirmative action programs in which an individual's membership in a \ngroup, whether defined by race, gender, national origin, or other \nsimilar characteristics, may determine whether he or she will be \nawarded a Government benefit.\n  Mr. President, while America has clearly not yet realized the \nnational \n\n[[Page S 10316]]\nideal of equal opportunity for all, it is important to note that we \nhave made considerable progress over the three decades since President \nJohnson issued the first Executive order calling for affirmative action \nto end job discrimination. I think we should be proud of that \nprogress--long overdue as it may have been. Every President since \nPresident Johnson, and every Supreme Court since then, has acknowledged \nthat affirmative action programs were intended to be temporary. In the \ndebate that is ongoing now, and on which the President made a major \nstatement today, I believe we should pause to acknowledge not only our \ncontinuing commitment to equal opportunity and the work we still have \nto do to realize it for all Americans, but also to acknowledge our \nsuccess in overcoming what was not only a legally sanctioned system of \ndiscrimination in our country but also ingrained biases about race and \ngender which were extremely widespread in our country. We have come a \nlong way from those days. Today, poll after poll shows a very high and \nbroad national consensus about ensuring equal opportunity for all, \nwhich, of course, was what the civil rights movement was all about.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, some poorly conceived and implemented \naffirmative action programs have done more to disturb and confuse that \nbroadly accepted national consensus about equal opportunity than they \nhave done to help their intended beneficiaries. Affirmative action is \ndividing us in ways its creators could never have intended because most \nAmericans who do support equal opportunity, and are not biased, do not \nthink it is fair to discriminate against some Americans as a way to \nmake up for historic discrimination against other Americans. For, after \nall, if you discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, \nyou thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race. In \ndiscussing this subject the other day, a young man offered me this \nsimple wisdom that we all learned from our mothers and fathers: ``Two \nwrongs,'' he said, ``don't make a right.''\n  President Clinton deserves our praise for his willingness to wade \ninto this fray and examine whether affirmative action programs are \nadvancing our goal of equal opportunity in a manner that is consistent \nwith our ideals and our Constitution. In particular, I am encouraged by \nthe President's expressed commitment to implement the Supreme Court's \nrecent Adarand decision on affirmative action. The Department of \nJustice has informed all Federal agencies that every program employing \nrace-based or similar criteria must be rigorously examined to ensure \nthat it is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest \nthat cannot otherwise be achieved. If a program does not meet that \ntest, it must be significantly changed, or it must be eliminated.\n  In my own view, Mr. President, most Government programs in which \nrace, gender, or similar status are dominant factors, will not survive \nthe Supreme Court's new Adarand test. If that is in fact the case, we \nmust work together to find new and, I would hope, more broadly \nacceptable ways to achieve the goal of promoting equal opportunity for \nall--particularly our poorest neighbors. I accept the premise, as I \nbelieve most Americans do, that there is still much work to be done. We \nmust be prepared to devote more resources to enforcing our civil rights \nlaws vigorously. We need to direct our attention, energy, and money to \nhelping poor people, regardless of race or ethnic background, by making \ngreater investments in education and job training, economic \nopportunity, and empowerment. Doing so would not only be more effective \nin achieving our national ideal of equal opportunity for all, but I \nthink would restore a sense of traditional American fair play to this \nfield that, sadly, for too many has been lost.\n  Some critics of affirmative action are simultaneously urging the \ndismantling of programs that are keys to helping poor people gain the \neducation and skills that will make equal opportunity real for them. I \nwill join the President, as I have before, in fighting both to preserve \nand reform, where necessary, those programs, and in finding ways to \naddress the profound problems faced by those who are victims not only \nof discrimination, but of poverty.\n  I invite all our colleagues within this Chamber, in the House, and \nall people of good will throughout the country, who are committed to \nmaking our society as fair as possible--whatever their party \naffiliation or views on affirmative action--to join this important \neffort in the months and years ahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10315-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10316-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10316-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1977.

A bill to promote freedom, fairness; and economic \nopportunity for families by reducing the power and reach of the Federal \nestablishment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the freedom and fairness restoration act\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am proud to announce the \nintroduction of the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act in the Senate \nof the United States of America. Two years ago, the flat tax was not \neven considered as an alternative in the tax reform debate. One \n\n[[Page S 10321]]\nyear ago, thanks to the able House majority leader, the flat tax was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives and took the country by \nstorm. Today, I am here to tell the American people the flat tax has \nfound a home in the Senate and the flat tax is not only a legitimate \nproposal for tax reform, it is the leading candidate.\n  When considering any proposal for tax reform, one has to ask the \nquestion, ``Should the Federal Government coerce free individuals by \nmeans of tax policy?'' I believe the answer is a clear and resounding \n``No.'' In other words, tax policy should neither encourage nor \ndiscourage the personal decisions of free individuals in America. If \none accepts this premise, one has to conclude the best alternative for \ntax reform is the flat tax. No other tax proposal, not the sales tax, \nand especially not the Gephardt un-flat tax, has the attribute of \nneutrality.\n  The Armey-Shelby flat tax taxes every dollar in the economy once and \nonly once--all at the same rate. As a result, the Armey-Shelby flat tax \ndoes not coerce free individuals into making decisions to take \nadvantage of a special interest tax break or to avoid some tax penalty. \nThe basic premise of the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act is that \nfree individuals know best how to spend their hard-earned dollars.\n  The current Tax Code, while serving its purpose of revenue \ncollection, has many problems. It contains high marginal rates as well \nas a hodgepodge of special interest deductions. In addition, the \ncomplexity of Federal tax laws cost taxpayers approximately 5.4 billion \nhours, or $150 billion, just to comply with the current Internal \nRevenue Code.\n  As a result, the time has come to abolish the old, inefficient tax \nsystem and adopt a new, strict flat tax--20 percent for the first 2 \nyears, and 17 percent thereafter. Generous personal allowances--$31,400 \nfor a family of four--will cut taxes for families and provide a level \nof progressivity many find essential for tax reform.

Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library of Congress, I am introducing legislation \ntoday to reauthorize the Library's American Folklife Center for fiscal \nyears 1996 though 1999. I am pleased to have all the members of the \nJoint Committee on the Library and Senator Reid join me in this effort \nas cosponsors.\n  The American Folklife Preservation Act of 1976 established the \nAmerican Folklife Center at the Library of Congress with a mandate to \n``preserve and present American folklife.'' This remarkable institution \ncontains the nation's foremost collection of folklife materials, \nincluding over 1 million manuscripts, sound recordings, photographs, \nfilms, videos, periodicals, and other printed information which \nchronicle the grassroots cultural traditions of the American people. No \nother public or private establishment can compare to the Folklife \nCenter's extensive accumulation of American folklife.\n  In addition to maintaining a comprehensive record of our Nation's \ndiverse culture, the Folklife Center is also an interactive and widely \nused institution. The folklife reading room is the largest reading room \nin the nation with public access to folklife collections and \npublications. During 1994 the folklife reading room assisted nearly \n9,000 researchers. Additionally, the Folklife Center is well known for \nits popular public exhibitions and presentations, such as the summer \nfolklife music concert series in front of the Jefferson Building. This \nyear the series opened with a performance of cajun zydeco and will \nclose with the Argentine tango. The Folklife Center is also well known \nfor its programs which have traveled throughout the United States. For \ninstance, the Folklife Center's photographic exhibit ``Generation to \nGeneration: Sharing the Intangible,'' which depicts grassroots culture \nbridging the differences between older and younger individuals, had a \nbrief stay at the Hood River County Historical Museum in Hood River, \nOR.\n  Mr. President, the American Folklife Center accomplishes its broad \nmandate with minimal funding and through the efforts of creative \nindividuals. The Folklife Center has a staff of only 15 and their \nauthorization level has been frozen since 1992. However, in 1994 they \nraised $330,000--3 times the amount raised in 1990--in private funding \nand they have a multi-year plan to increase private funding. \nConsequently, the legislation I am introducing today provides a modest \nincrease in their annual authorization from the current level of \n$1,120,000 to $1,187,000 for the next 4 fiscal years.\n  The American Folklife Center is an important investment in preserving \nour Nation's cultural background that will serve future generations as \na historical reference and educational guide. I hope my colleagues will \ncontinue to support the Folklife Center by approving this \nlegislation.\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatfield \nas an original cosponsor to legislation which will reauthorize the \nAmerican Folklife Center. The Folklife Center provides our country with \nthe invaluable service of preserving the diverse cultures which makeup \nAmerican folklife.\n  Folklife is defined as the grassroots cultural traditions maintained \nat the community level and expressed through family, ethnic, \noccupational, religious, and regional associations. It includes a wide \nrange of creative forms including music, verbal traditions, crafts and \ndance. It is my strong belief that the preservation of America's \nheritage is worth funding.\n  The American Folklife Center contains by far the Nation's preeminent \nfolklife collection comprising over 1 million items in every medium: \nmanuscripts, sound recordings photographs, films, videos, periodicals, \nand other printed materials. No other institution, public or private, \ncontains such a vast and comprehensive collection of folklife. Further, \nit is the sole institution in the Federal Government authorized to \npreserve and present American folklife.\n  The American Folklife Center's authorization level has been frozen at \n$1,120,000 since 1992. On this budget, the Center has maintained the \nlargest reading room in the Nation with public access to folklife \ncollections and publications and with formal public reference services, \nassisting nearly 9,000 researchers in 1994. The Center has provided for \nprograms, presentations, field research projects, publications and \nexhibitions which strengthen public education about America's heritage \nand benefit hundreds of thousands of Americans annually. I believe it \nis time to increase the Center's funding, therefore, our amendment \nprovides for the modest increase in authorization to $1,187,000 a year \nfor the next 4 years. This money will allow the Center to continue with \ntheir important work in preserving America's heritage.\n  In 1976, the American Folklife Center was established with bipartisan \nsupport. However, the Archive of Folk Culture has been a part of the \nLibrary of Congress since 1928. This long history is evidence of our \ncountry's commitment to preserving its heritage.\n  The Center maintains a unique collection with items from all 50 \nStates. My State of Nevada has diverse folk traditions which are \npreserved by the Center. Among its unique recordings are Ute, Northern \nPaiute, Wasoe, and other native American music recordings made by Omer \nStewart in 1938 and Willard Rhodes in 1949. There are cowboy songs and \nstories by ``Powder River'' Jack H. Lee of Virginia City and oral \nhistories and stories of traditional life made by Duncan Emerich in \n1942 and 1950.\n  Between 1978 and 1982, the Center conducted the Paradise Valley \nFolklife Project to document and analyze the traditional life and work \nof a ranching community in Nevada. The project was developed in \nconjunction with the \n\n[[Page S 10322]]\nSmithsonian Institution and the National Endowment for the Arts. \nDocumentary materials from the project include field notes; sound, \nmotion picture, and video records; and 30,000 black and white negatives \nand color transparencies. The project also resulted in a book, \n``Buckaroos in Paradise: Cowboy Life in Northern Nevada,'' an exhibit \nof the same name at the Smithsonian Institution, and a videodisc, ``The \nNinety-Six: A Cattle Ranch in Northern Nevada.''\n  In 1989 and 1990, the Center conducted a field research project \ndocumenting the culture and traditions of Italian-Americans in the \nWest, which culminated in a traveling exhibition and companion book of \nessays. The documentary material created during the project includes \nrecordings, photographs, architectural drawings, and other documents \nfrom central Nevada. These are just some examples of the work that the \nCenter does in my State of Nevada. However, the Center provides this \nsort of work for each State's unique history.\n  The Center is not only a place where history is preserved, it is also \na viable working institution which provides a wealth of information \nfrom where American artists can draw upon and use these valuable \nresources. Micky Hart, drummer for the Greatful Dead, has found \nunreleased and forgotten world music in the archives. This past spring \nhe released his second CD of such sounds, ``Music of the Gods,'' a \ncollection of gamelan music acquired from the Fiji Islanders just \nbefore World War II.\n  The Center is heavily used by artists, historians, and people who \nsimply enjoy learning about our country's cultures. It has successfully \nperformed its duties on minimal funding over the years, and has made \ngreat efforts in generating private funds. The Center has demonstrated \nits dedication to the preservation of American folklife and culture, \nand greatly deserves the reauthorization our legislation \nprovides.\n\n\n

ASSESSMENTS\n\n  Mr. PELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas in 1978 the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 49, \n     calling on the United States Government to seek the agreement \n     of other governments to a proposed global treaty requiring \n     the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments for any \n     major project, action, or continuing activity that may be \n     reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on \n     the physical environment or environmental interests of \n     another nation or a global commons area;\n       Whereas subsequent to the adoption of Senate Resolution 49 \n     in 1978, the United Nations Environment Programme Governing \n     Council adopted Goals and Principles on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment calling on governments to undertake comprehensive \n     Environmental Impact Assessments in cases in which the \n     extent, nature, or location of a proposed activity is such \n     that the activity is likely to significantly affect the \n     environment;\n       Whereas Principle 17 of the Rio Declaration on Environment \n     and Development, adopted at the United Nations Conference on \n     Environment and Development in 1992, states that \n     Environmental Impact Assessments as a national instrument \n     shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely \n     to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and \n     are subject to a decision of the competent national \n     authority;\n       Whereas on October 7, 1992, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the \n     Antarctic Treaty, which obligates parties to the Antarctic \n     Treaty to require Environmental Impact Assessment procedures \n     for proposed activities in Antarctica; and\n       Whereas the United States is a signatory to the 1991 United \n     Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on \n     Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, a \n     regional treaty that calls for the use of Environmental \n     Impact Assessments as necessary tools to minimize the adverse \n     impact of certain activities on the environment, particularly \n     in a transboundary context: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should encourage the \n     governments of other nations to engage in additional regional \n     treaties, along the lines of the 1991 United Nations Economic \n     Commission for Europe's Convention on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment in a Transboundary Context, regarding specific \n     transboundary activities that have adverse impacts on the \n     environment of other nations or a global commons area; and\n       (2) such additional regional treaties should ensure that \n     specific transboundary activities are undertaken in \n     environmentally sound ways and under careful controls \n     designed to \n\n[[Page S 10323]]\n     avoid or minimize any adverse environmental effects, through \n     requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments where \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President many of my colleagues know of the interest \nthat I have long had in the protection of the global commons. As early \nas 1967 I introduced resolutions containing draft treaty language that \neventually resulted in treaties banning the emplacement of weapons of \nmass destruction on the seabed floor and the use of environmental \nmodification techniques in warfare.\n  In 1978, a resolution that I had introduced in 1977 was adopted by \nthe Senate, which called on the U.S. Government to seek the agreement \nof other governments to a proposed global treaty requiring the \npreparation of an international environmental assessment for any major \nproject, action, or continuing activity which may be reasonably \nexpected to have a significant adverse effect on the physical \nenvironment or environmental interests of another nation or a global \ncommons area--Senate Resolution 49, May 18, 1978, Report\n No. 95-990, July 17, 1978\n\n  My proposed Environmental Impact Assessment Treaty did not aim to \nprohibit a state from carrying out activities, but rather required it \nto make a detailed assessment of the impact this activity would have, \nand to communicate this information to the affected countries. As such, \nit would play a crucial part in ensuring that the United States would \nnot be negatively impacted by the activities of another state. \nAlternatively, when the activity was to have an impact on a global \ncommons area, the United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] was to be \nthe recipient of that information.\n  The United Nations Environment Programme was created in the \naftermaths of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, \nheld in Stockholm in 1972. This conference represented the first \nconcerted effort on the part of all nations to integrate human \ndevelopment and the protection of the environment and natural resources \nfor future generations. UNEP has now become the legal entity where most \ninternational environmental programs are either initiated or hosted \nand, as such, is widely recognized as a useful and efficient arm of the \nUnited Nations.\n  The United States has truly been a visionary in this respect, as the \nideas embedded in my 1978 resolution were later endorsed in a number of \ninternational environmental legal instruments. The United Nations \nEnvironment Programme itself endorsed this view when its governing \ncouncil adopted a series of goals and principles that specify how \nimportant these assessments can be, and how and when they should be \ncarried out.\n  Building on these goals and principles, the U.S. Government, along \nwith other members of the United Nations Economic Commission for \nEurope, signed the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a \nTransboundary Context, done at Espoo, Finland on February 25, 1991. \nWhile my 1978 resolution initially called for a global treaty applying \nto all activities worldwide, much of the reflection that followed led \nto a breakthrough in thinking with which I agree, namely that a \nregional approach would be more suited.\n  The Espoo Convention is a perfect example, as it embodies the \ncommitment by member states to the U.S. Economic Commission of Europe \nto act in a precautionary manner when dealing with transboundary \nactivities. The\n convention highlights how and when environmental impact assessments \nneed to be carried out, and an annex to the convention lists the \nactivities that will trigger their application. Because different \ncountries in different areas of the world carry out different \nactivities, separate regional conventions, along with specific lists of \ntriggering activities, are more appropriate than one global treaty.\n\n  Even after the Espoo Convention was signed in 1991, other \ninternational legal instruments highlighted the need for Environmental \nImpact Assessments. In 1992, at the conclusion of the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development--the Rio Earth Summit--more \nthan 180 participating nations adopted the Rio Declaration of \nPrinciples on Environment and Development. Principle 17 of the \ndeclaration states that environmental impact assessment, as a national \ninstrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely \nto have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are subject \nto a decision of a competent national authority.\n  This was but the latest indication of the endorsement by the whole \ninternational community of environmental impact assessment as a means \nto ensuring that human activities with a view to enhancing human \nbetterment are undertaken in environmentally sound ways.\n  On October 7, 1992, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the \nprotocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic Treaty, signed in \nMadrid on October 4, 1991--Treaty Doc. 102-22. This protocol builds \nupon the Antarctic Treaty to extend and improve the treaty's \neffectiveness as a mechanism for ensuring the protection of the \nAntarctic environment. Among other obligations, it requires application \nof environmental impact assessment procedures to activities undertaken \nin Antarctica for which advance notice is required under the Antarctic \nTreaty. Annex I of the protocol sets out different environmental impact \nassessment procedures that apply according to whether the proposed \nactivities are identified as having less than a minor or transitory \nimpact, a minor or transitory impact, or more than a minor or \ntransitory impact. This is a very rational approach to environmental \nimpact assessment, an approach to which the Senate gave its advice and \nconsent, and the same approach that my 1978 resolution embodied.\n  As previously noted, the United States has pursued the objectives of \nmy 1978 resolution--Senate Resolution 49--by becoming a party to the \nEspoo regional convention of the United Nations Economic Commission of \nEurope. This convention represents the consensus between the United \nStates and its industrialized allies that the best way to proceed is to \nrequire environmental impact assessments before transboundary \nactivities are carried out. As I have explained before, regional \ntreaties are the best possible approach because they allow taking into \naccount the particularities of the region at hand. What the United \nStates and its allies have achieved must now be duplicated by other \nstates, in other regions, so that the adoption of environmental impact \nassessment truly becomes a standard precautionary measure.\n  Consequently, the resolution I introduce today builds upon my 1978 \nresolution--Senate Resolution 49--by urging the administration to \nencourage other states to pursue the negotiation of appropriate \nenvironmental impact assessment requirements in other regional \ntreaties. My resolution acknowledges the history of international \nefforts carried out since 1978 and allows the Senate to endorse once \nmore these important goals.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10322-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n             subcommittee on post office and civil service\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I rise here today to pay tribute to Judge \nGeorge Edward MacKinnon. Judge MacKinnon died at his home on May 1, \n1995, at the age of 89. In life, Judge MacKinnon was a model public \nservant, and in death, his work will be remembered and his efforts \ncontinued.\n  Judge MacKinnon served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia for 25 years. He was named to the appellate bench in 1969 \nby President Nixon, where he served until shortly before his death. \nJudge MacKinnon was a dedicated jurist. He spent 6 years serving on the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission, contributing to the creation of the \nnational uniform-sentencing laws for convicted criminal offenders.\n  My own association with Judge MacKinnon stemmed from his work as \npresiding judge of the special court that oversees the independent \ncounsel law. In the 7 years he presided over the three-member court, \nJudge MacKinnon was instrumental in the successful enforcement of the \nindependent counsel law and helped establish its constitutionality.\n  Equally important, the judge made the law work on a day-to-day basis, \nfrom setting up filing systems and getting a court clerk, to working \nout conflicts-of-interest for independent counsel and suggesting \nlegislative improvements to the law. Judge MacKinnon ran the court \nefficiently and effectively. He worked with Congress in an open and \nconstructive manner. In an age of political gamesmanship, he was a \ncivil, bipartisan, and warm spirit. It was his evenhanded, commonsense \napproach which resulted in great public confidence and the ultimate \nsuccess of the independent counsel law.\n  Judge MacKinnon's career in public service did not begin with his \n1969 appointment to the bench. Prior to his term as a judge, he served \nas Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Minnesota, a Minnesota Representative in the U.S. House, \nand a Minnesota State representative.\n  Judge MacKinnon is survived by his wife, Elizabeth MacKinnon; his \ndaughter, Catharine MacKinnon, a noted professor of law at the \nUniversity of Michigan; two sons, James and Leonard MacKinnon, both of \nMinneapolis; and four grandchildren.\n  Judge MacKinnon devoted his entire career to public service. And his \nlifelong actions for the good of the American people will not be \nforgotten. It is with this in mind that I pay tribute to Judge George \nEdward MacKinnon and his family.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10324-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, my comments are about support of this \nresolution concerning the arms embargo. I know the hour is late, but \nthis is a very, very important subject that has concerned me, as it has \nconcerned so many Members of the Senate, for several years. I am hoping \nthat we come to some resolution of this matter on this occasion.\n  I understand the majority leader's desire to consider the President's \nrequest. I look forward to the results of that discussion and the \ndecisions that come from it. But I do rise tonight in support of the \nDole-Lieberman resolution. Let me begin by mentioning three \nreservations I have about taking this position.\n  First of all, I think the truest words of the day were those of \nSenator Cohen of Maine who said, ``No one can predict with complete \nconfidence whether our action in this case or inaction in this case \nwill turn out the way we want.'' This is a situation that requires the \ngreatest humility on the part of a Senator because we cannot know for \nsure and because it does involve what is obviously life or death for \nmany, many thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia. The facts are \nabout as complex as they can get in a foreign policy situation.\n  My second reservation in supporting the resolution is that basically \nI think the President should be our leader in conducting foreign \npolicy, with the assistance of Congress in certain cases; in some cases \nonly with congressional approval. I happen to believe, under the War \nPowers Act, and article I of the Constitution, that we have a \npreeminent role in making sure that we do not commit troops without \ncongressional approval. But, generally speaking, I prefer to defer to \nthe President, especially Democratic Presidents, on this kind of an \nissue.\n  Third, although I have tremendous respect for the majority leader, I \nhave generally preferred the foreign policy approach of our current \nPresident. This President has kept American youth out of wars. He has \nresisted the temptation to send us into adventures and to take every \nopportunity to police the world as, unfortunately, other Presidents \nhave failed to do. The President has shown a steady hand and does not \nbelieve that we can afford or want to shed the blood to be the \npolicemen of the world.\n  But, despite these reservations, and while I think the majority \nleader is a great Senator and I hope he continues in that capacity for \nmany, many years, I have long supported his view that we should lift \nthe arms embargo on Bosnia and we should do so unilaterally, if \nnecessary. I do think it is necessary, and I do think the time is now.\n  In fact, my hope has been and continues to be that this will truly be \na strong bipartisan vote. In fact, when I first got here, Mr. \nPresident, long before I realized the majority leader's position, \nbefore he was the majority leader, my first resolution as a United \nStates Senator made one simple request: That the arms embargo be lifted \nfor the Bosnian people. That was in March 1993.\n  Even prior to the election in 1992, before I was a Member of this \nbody, I followed the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, \nwho had already, before almost anyone else, understood that the key to \nthis situation was not talking about certain American air raids or \nsending American troops to Bosnia, but giving them the ability to \ndefend themselves.\n  One of the most stimulating comments of the day, and I listened to a \nlot of the debate, was that of the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, who spoke of lifting the arms embargo, and indicated, as I have \nheard him say on many occasions, that he supports lifting the arms \nembargo if we can. But the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that \nlifting the arms embargo is not a policy.\n  I am not so sure. In fact, after scores of conversations with people, \nexperts in foreign policy, and the military, my constituents, and \nespecially the leaders of Bosnia itself, I feel, with all due respect, \nthat all signs point to the conclusion that lifting the arms embargo \nunilaterally is not only morally right, but a very sensible policy, \nboth for the United States and for Bosnia.\n  I am sure the opposition to lifting is in good faith. But after 2\\1/\n2\\ years I almost stopped asking questions on the committee where we \nserve together, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I grew weary at \nthe committee meetings and the briefings of the constantly shifting \nseries of excuses for not doing what is right in Bosnia.\n  The opposition to lifting the arms embargo has been done in a very \nclever way. It is opposition by question, hundreds of questions, \nhundreds of scenarios, always the worst-case scenario. It is the most \namazing variety of reasons I have ever seen. There are too many reasons \nbeing given, too many shifting back and forth, and sometimes \ncontradicting each other. It does not seem credible.\n  We even heard in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing \nthe claim that lifting the arms embargo would lead to an Islamic jihad. \nSome of these arguments are just way beyond the pale. We are subjected \nto an astonishing parade of ``horribles.'' But, Mr. President, what is \nactually happening--not what is projected--is what is horrible and \nactual unending inhuman horror.\n  We are urged on the floor today to try one last time. We are told \nthat lifting the arms embargo is just like giving up. But to many \nAmericans, it just makes sense. It looks like to many Americans that we \nnever even got started helping the Bosnians if we could not do the most \nsimple thing, which is to lift the arms embargo. We have never taken \nthe first step and the most important step. We have never lifted the \narms embargo so that we have the opportunity not to work with a captive \nand defeated Bosnia, but with an increasingly viable country, an \nincreasingly viable military, working to defend itself and working \nperhaps to push back the Serbians to the lines where they were before.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the comments that I have heard most from all \nof my constituents is, ``Why in the world don't we simply let these \nfolks try and defend themselves?''\n  Mr. President, other Members of this body did a very good job today \nanswering some of these objections. But I think we ought to reiterate \nit a little bit. I want to give again the scope of all of the excuses \nbeing given for not lifting the arms embargo. Naturally, we have a \ntendency to want to defer to those who have military expertise. But in \nsome of these cases the answer is very easy and obvious.\n  For example, there is the claim that lifting the arms embargo will \nmean that the United Nations will be put in a position where none of \nits resolutions will be respected; the claim that this is, in effect, \nthumbing our nose at the United Nations and the Security Council. But \nthe Senator from New York has made the point well that no other \nsituation, no other resolution is in this status. This one involves the \nviolation of article 51 of the U.N. Charter which calls for the right \nof self-defense for all countries. That is legally superior \n\n[[Page S 10326]]\nunder the U.N. charter to any particular resolution of this kind.\n  In other cases, such as Rwanda or Angola or the Sudan, there are arms \nembargoes but those involve civil wars, internal strife. They do not \ninvolve a clear situation of one sovereign entity being involved in \nattacking another. Mr. President, that argument does not hold water.\n  Another argument that I have heard and the question that is \nconstantly asked is, ``Well, if they get the arms, how are they going \nto get trained? How are they going to know how to use the guns?''\n  I sat in a private briefing a couple of weeks ago with a number of \nSenators and with the majority leader. And the majority leader asked \nthat question of Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister of Bosnia. He \nsaid, ``We know how to use these arms. We are trained. We are not \nasking for the most sophisticated aircraft.'' They are simply asking \nfor the normal weaponry of a ground war.\n  I have here a list of what has actually been requested--certain kinds \nof defense arms, means of communication, electric power, health, \nsatellite links, various types of vehicles, generators, clothing, \nsurgical equipment. These are the kinds of things that are being \nrequested. The notion that somehow massive special training is \nnecessary is not valid.\n  Another argument that comes up: ``How are the arms going to get there \nin this difficult situation?'' Well, it is a difficult situation. But \narms are already getting there despite the embargo to some extent. How \ndo people think the Bosnian Muslims are fighting? Some have gotten \nthrough, and particularly with the alliance between Croatia and Bosnia, \nthat sealane. The necessary access to the sea through Croatia would be \navailable to provide the arms.\n  Another argument made: ``We will have to pay for all these arms. It \nis going to be expensive.'' It is true. If we want to supply the arms, \nit will cost something. Senator Biden's amendment a few years ago \nprovided for 50 million American dollars. But there is nothing in this \nresolution that says we have to supply the arms. Other countries are \nready do it. I think it is a good idea if we participate. It is not a \nchoice that it is an open checkoff. It simply says they are permitted \nto obtain arms. There is nothing in this resolution that requires that.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these examples of sort of legal or \ntactical questions, there has been very heavy emphasis today on two \nother arguments. One is, ``This is not the right time.'' And the other \nis, ``This action will `Americanize' the war.'' To me, these are \nprobably the two most troubling arguments I have heard lately. They \nremind me of double talk, or maybe worse. They remind me, in George \nOrwell's words, of ``double speak.''\n  First of all, this notion that it is not the right time--I was told \nthe first time I mentioned this issue in early 1993 that if we would \njust hang on, ``The change is right around the corner; we are going to \nwork this out; we should not lift the arms embargo; it will cause a \nterrible problem.'' But after each tragedy we get the same excuse, the \nsame flutter of activity. Things die down for a while, and we are told \nagain that we should wait.\n  It is also troubling to me that we learn the names of these little \ntowns in Bosnia and witness the tragedy, and then a few days later we \ndo not even remember where the last tragedy occurred. But we are still \ntold, ``Wait a little longer; wait until a few more towns go down the \ntubes.''\n  It has been 30 months. How can someone talking in any way that would \nbe considered straight say that we have to wait longer? How many times \nmust U.S. Senators speak until the message gets through?\n  I just had my staff tally up how many speeches have been given on \nthis subject since 1993. Just in the U.S. Senate alone, there were 210 \nspeeches by Senators. Almost, I say, the vast majority of them were in \nfavor of lifting the arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, what are we waiting for? Are we waiting for perfect \nweather conditions? This is not a moon shot. This is an ongoing, \nhorrible tragedy. And anyone can construct a reason why we should wait. \nBut you cannot wait any longer when you witness every day on the \ntelevision what can only be described as genocide.\n  What about this second argument, this mantra, ``This is going to \nAmericanize the war''? This one really bothers me. It is a slogan. \nPeople say we are committed, we are obligated to send 25,000 ground \ntroops into Bosnia if we lift the arms embargo. When do we vote on \nthat? When did Congress authorize 25,000 troops going into Bosnia? \nUnder my view of the law and the Constitution, the Chair and I should \nhave had a chance to vote on that. We did not do it. We did not make \nthat commitment.\n  And again, it is the ultimate in double speak to suggest that giving \npeople the right to defend themselves is the thing that will cause us \nto have to go and defend them. That is what we are being told, that \nsomehow giving them some guns or making sure they can buy some guns is \nthe way to guarantee that all the rest of us would have to go over \nthere and get involved. That is just nonsense. It is the opposite. \nLifting the arms embargo is the best way to ensure that American men \nand women will not have to spill their blood. This is a lesson that the \nState of Israel has understood very well since 1948.\n  The one thing that Israel always said is, ``We want help in terms of \narms, logistical help, but we do not want American men and women to \ncome here and fight on our soil.'' We always appreciated that \nsentiment, but it is not just to be nice. It is because the Israelis \nknow that if we send troops onto Israeli soil and American men and \nwomen die, the obvious result will be probably a reduction in American \nsupport for that effort. That it will turn people off. They will say, \n``Why help Israel?''\n  All you have to do is reference Somalia. It is exactly what happened \nin Somalia. People had compassion. They cared about the people in \nSomalia. They wanted to help them eat. But when it came to American men \nand women dying, they really had to question whether we could police \nthe entire world.\n  Well, the Bosnians understand this. And that is why they are sincere \nwhen they say that they did not want our troops. They want some help or \nat least not have us prevent them from getting the arms to defend \nthemselves. Why can we as a nation say in some instances, ``This we can \ndo. We can do no more. But we will do this.''?\n  We do not want to police this situation. The American people will not \nsupport this as the absolute core of our national security. We probably \nare not ready to say in the case of Bosnia that we will bear any \nburden. But we are ready to do something as a people. We do want the \nBosnians to be free. We do want them to be able to turn back Serbian \naggression.\n  So, Mr. President, this is the opposite of the Americanization of the \nwar. This is how Bosnia determines its own destiny.\n  Mr. President, maybe what has bothered me even more than these more \nconvenient arguments is my problem with the position that the \nadministration has taken when it says over and over again, ``We support \nlifting the arms embargo, but only multilaterally.'' But they are \nagainst unilateral lifting. And time and time again there have been \nstatements from the administration indicating support, not for \nunilateral but for multilateral lifting of the arms embargo.\n  A relatively recent example was March 20, 1995, where Mr. Richard \nHolbrooke stated:\n\n       Only a negotiated settlement has any chance of lasting. \n     This administration is committed to pursuing that goal. What \n     we must not do is worsen the situation by unilaterally \n     lifting the arms embargo. We have always believed the embargo \n     is unfair and worked to end it multilaterally.\n\n  This has consistently been the statement of the administration. They \noppose unilateral, but they are for the multilateral lifting of the \narms embargo. But usually when you look at the actual reasons why they \nare against the unilateral lift, they are just as true of the \nmultilateral lift. Again, it is halfhearted arguments to justify a \npolicy.\n  And I know why the administration wants to do this. It is not a bad \nreason. They do not want to break faith with their allies, the British \nand the French, in particular, and even our relationship with the \nRussians, who do not want us \n\n[[Page S 10327]]\nto lift the arms embargo. That is the real reason. What they say is \nthey are for lifting the arms embargo if only they could get the French \nand the British to go along.\n  Well, Mr. President, it does not hold up. For example, they say if \nyou lift the arms embargo unilaterally, the allied troops will be in \ndanger. Well, what is going on right now? Multilateral action there. \nAnd my figures indicate May 28, 377 peacekeepers taken hostage. Just \nlast week at Srebrenica, the attack on the Dutch peacekeepers.\n  The fact is that under either scenario, unilateral or multilateral, \nthese folks are in danger. They are in danger now, and they would be \nthen. At least if the Bosnians were properly armed, maybe those \nSerbians who like to go into the safe havens and attack peacekeepers \nand civilians would think twice if they knew there was a force to \noppose them, not just a bunch of U.N. peacekeepers who are not allowed \nto do anything about them.\n  Second, it is said that a unilateral lift would upset the Russians. \nMy feeling about that is that that is a completely disingenuous \nargument because everyone knows the Russians can veto a multilateral \nlifting request. So the administration knows that is not going to \nhappen. And certainly the Russians did not pay any attention to our \nfeelings about this type of issue when they did their actions in \nChechnya.\n  A third argument is, if you lift the arms embargo, the Serbians will \nget arms too. Well, they may. But the fact is, they are already very \nwell armed. They were the beneficiaries of the fifth largest stockpile \nof arms in all of Europe because of this foolish arms embargo.\n  How would this be different with a multilateral lift? Surely, if \nthere is a multilateral lift and the Serbians want to get more arms, \nthey will get it that way just as they will with the unilateral lifting \nof the arms embargo.\n  Finally, the incredible claim that under the unilateral lifting, the \nwar will spread, and to somehow suggest that the war will not spread if \nwe have a multi-lifting of the arms embargo. Why? Why is that the case? \nSurely it would spread either way to some extent.\n  So I do not understand how the administration can claim that there is \na difference between unilateral and multilateral. And that is deeply \ntroubling to me. I think the administration simply opposes lifting the \narms embargo and should be straightforward about it so that the Bosnian \npeople and the Members of Congress could know where they really stand.\n  So, Mr. President, why? Why have we been subjected to this avalanche \nof arguments, this manufacturing of arguments to stop lifting the arms \nembargo? It is to block the lifting of the arms embargo, obviously. But \nI think it is a symptom of what I like to call the all-or-nothing \nattitude about the military role of the United States in this world. \nEither we have to do everything, that our credibility says that if we \ndo one thing we have to send in troops later on or our credibility is \nshot. I do not buy that. In some cases that may be true. In an alliance \nwith NATO, you bet. That is the pledge. But America cannot and \ncertainly has not signed on to the notion that every time we help \nsomebody do something to defend themselves, we therefore have to commit \nthe entire force of our country. That is not the case. And I do not \nthink it is what the Bosnian people expect.\n  What is our end game? Are we going to just defend Bosnia and somehow \nbroker a peace agreement and then leave this morsel of a country with \nno defense, to do what? Are we going to have a permanent U.N. force \nthere? Are we just going to leave someday and hope the Serbians are \nnice to them?\n  There is a better scenario, and that scenario is, let these folks \ncontinue to learn to defend themselves, to actually defend themselves, \nto have the pride of having protected their nation. You know, that is \nhow we got started. That is how Israel got started in 1948, and it made \nall the difference that they won their own freedom. Yes, maybe with \nother people's arms but with their own strength and courage--and, of \ncourse, sacrifice.\n  What is our plan? To make Bosnia one big safe-haven forever? A \ncountry that is going to be free has to be able to defend itself and it \nhas to know how to defend itself. And you need arms in order to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I think lifting the arms embargo is the key to the \npermanent freedom of Bosnia.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the question for me more than anything else \nis, where did anyone get the idea that we have the right to stand in \nthe way of a self-defense of a free people that we have recognized as \nan independent country? What did we do in 1776? We were not even free. \nWe were supposedly pledged in loyalty to the King of England. We \ndecided we wanted to make our own self-determination. Somebody helped \nus get some help and some arms because we were standing for our own \nfreedom.\n  Mr. President, what is the second amendment all about, the U.S. \nConstitution? I happen to be a believer that that second amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution is important. I think we do have a right in this \ncountry or a reasonable opportunity to defend ourselves. And the reason \nfor that amendment more than anything else was that the right of a \npeople to keep and bear arms is necessary for a free people. That is \nwhat this is about, too. It is not just Americans who feel this way \nabout self-defense. It is people in every country, including Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, do we not remember appeasement in Europe? Do we not \nremember the constant embarrassment that we were taken in by the Nazis, \nthat we actually believed--speaking here more of Britain than \nourselves, of course--but we actually believed they were going to take \nthis much space, just the Sudetenland, just Czechoslovakia, just \nPoland.\n  What we are dealing with here are people who--apparently the leaders \nof Serbia--who want a greater Serbia. They will not stop if we continue \nto appease them.\n  Mr. President, do we not remember the Warsaw ghetto? We acknowledged \nthe 50th anniversary of the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto against the \nNazis. Did we say, would it not be better if they had not resisted? \nThere would be less bloodshed if they had not taken up arms against the \nNazis. That is not what we said. We commemorated the heroism and the \ncourage of people in a concentration camp who, knowing they were going \nto die, decided to die with dignity.\n  Mr. President, when I was a teenager I was given a book called \n``While Six Million Died.'' The book told a tough story for a young kid \nwho was a Democrat, and still believes that Franklin Roosevelt was the \ngreatest President in this country. It told of how that administration \nknew of some of the things that were going on to the Jews and others in \nEurope. It told how we did not really do everything we could do.\n  Mr. President, I recently toured the Holocaust Museum again, and they \ntalked about the difficulty of President Roosevelt's decision not to, \nfor example, bomb some of the concentration camps. Well, at least in \nthat case Franklin Roosevelt knew what he was trying to do. He \nbelieved, for the greater good of this world, that he could win the war \nand defeat the Nazis. He had a plan. And with Winston Churchill and \nothers the plan was effective.\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot use that excuse here. We have no plan. \nWe have no intention of actually stopping Serbian aggression. So it is \nnot understandable why we sit back and wait.\n  Finally, Mr. President, when all is said and done, should not we ask \nthe Bosnians themselves what they want? Should we impose upon them the \nnotion that we are going to just keep these U.N. forces there for their \nown good?\n  I think it is condescending, humiliating, and patronizing to the \nBosnian people to suggest that we know better, that it is for their own \ngood that we not lift the arms embargo.\n  Let me conclude by just reading three statements from the Prime \nMinister of Bosnia that I think symbolize this issue better than \nanything else and the need for lifting the arms embargo.\n  The prime minister has said first that:\n\n       If the Serbs' aggression continues, we prefer military help \n     over food for dead people. The aggression, plus the arms \n     embargo, plus the nondeliverance of aid means death to \n     Bosnia.\n\n\n[[Page S 10328]]\n\n  And he said in March 1993:\n\n       We would prefer doing it ourselves, but for that we need \n     arms. The arms embargo is what is humiliating. The \n     humiliation is to be slaughtered like an animal and not be \n     able to defend yourself like a man.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, very recently, May 28, 1995, Mr. Silajdzic \njust laid it on the line, as he has tried time and time again to do. He \nmeans it. He does not want American soldiers there. He does not want \nthe Americanization of the war. This is what he wants and this is what \nhe will do. He says:\n\n       The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \n     perfectly willing and able to defend our country and our \n     citizens. We do not now, nor have we ever, asked for any \n     ground forces from any country in the world to do our \n     fighting for us. We have the men. We have the courage. But we \n     do not have the means.\n\n  That is all they are asking, Mr. President, a chance to protect their \nown lives, their own women, their own children, and to do something \nabout this heartless Serbian aggression.\n  So, Mr. President, although I again am eager to hear the outcome of \nthe talks between President Clinton and others in the Congress, I do \nbelieve we should move forward as soon as possible to pass this \nresolution to unilaterally lift the arms embargo.\n  I thank the Chair and everyone for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/19/senate-section/article/S10325-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
