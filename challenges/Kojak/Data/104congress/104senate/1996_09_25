Mr. President, this morning, to accommodate a number of \nrequests by Senators, there will be a period for morning business until \nthe hour of 12 noon. Following morning business, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session in order to consider the International \nNatural Rubber Treaty Agreement under the parameters of a previous \nunanimous-consent agreement. I understand that a rollcall vote will not \nbe necessary on that treaty and that some of the debate time probably \nwill be yielded back.\n\n  Following the disposition of that treaty, the Senate may be asked to \nturn to consideration of any of the following matters: the pipeline \nsafety bill, with only one nongermane issue remaining unresolved; the \nwork force development conference report--we attempted to reach a time \nagreement on that one, but have been unsuccessful; we will keep working \non that--the debate on the veto message to accompany the partial-birth \nabortion bill override, the NIH reauthorization bill, or any other \nitems that can be cleared for action.\n  The Senate may also be asked to begin consideration of the continuing \nresolution, if an agreement can be reached as to how to proceed on \nthat. I continue to say that I would be glad to begin the debate and \nallow amendments to be offered as long as there is some order to it as \nto what we can expect to happen and when it would be completed. But \njust to start down the trail without any end in sight, without any \ncertainty as to how we proceed, I do not believe is in the best \ninterest of the Senate. We will continue to work on that. I hope we \nwill be able to begin that appropriations bill today.\n  We do have the end of the fiscal year next week, on Monday as a \nmatter of fact. It is imperative that we finish the work on that bill \nas quickly as possible.\n  I note that there are very important negotiations underway now to \nwrap up, not only the amounts in that continuing resolution, but also \nlanguage that would be included. We are hoping we will be able to take \nup the illegal immigration bill also in some form before we go out for \nthe year.\n  Senators should be alerted that rollcall votes are expected to occur \nthroughout the day, but we do not have any agreed-to time right now as \nto when that might happen.\n  One final cautionary note. I do not feel a sense of urgency yet. I \nthink Senators are still feeling, well, we can agree later. Time is \nrunning out. Example A is NIH reauthorization. Everybody says they want \nit, but we continue to not be able to bring it up. Today is the last \nday for NIH. If we do not get an agreement, I am going to call it up, \nsomebody is going to have to come over here and object, and a very, \nvery important piece of legislation that everybody knows we should pass \nwill be gone for the year, because beyond today--Thursday, Friday, \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday--we are going to be involved in the partial-\nbirth abortion ban debate and a vote tomorrow, and we are going to be \ninvolved in the continuing resolution, the DOD appropriations \nconference report, and the illegal immigration reform bill. There will \nnot be any time for any other chitchat, even 1 hour on these other \nissues.\n  So for those of you who are interested in parks, those of you \ninterested in NIH, those of you who think pipeline safety is something \nwe should do--by the way, that legislation needs to be done before the \nend of the month also or we are going to have a lot of expiring laws on \nour hands. I hope the Senators will get serious. I have my doubt that \nthey are serious. But I also have my limits in what I can do working \nwith the Democratic leader because we have people coming and saying, \n``Well, can we just have 6 hours? 4 hours? 1 hour?'' They are all gone. \nToday is the day. Do it today or it will be gone for the year.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11212-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, several of us want to continue our \ndiscussions of the upcoming election, discussions that have to do with \nthe issues that are involved. It is election time. Of course, as \nevidenced by what the leader said today, the time is short. It is \nelection time, and it is decision time. This is a government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people. Therefore, there is a \nresponsibility for all of us, as voters, of course, to participate in \nthe election, to participate as informed voters.\n  If we are to have self-government, then the decisions and the \ndirection that this country takes must be the result of the composite \nwisdom of voters. That time has arrived.\n  It seems almost a paradox that in a time when technically we have \nmore information available to us than we have ever had in history--\nimagine 100 years ago how much we knew in Wyoming about what was going \non in Washington. Very little. If we did, it was much after the event \nhad happened. Now we know instantly, of course. The paradox is that it \nseems to me it is more difficult for us as voters now to kind of weed \nout among all the stuff that is out there as to what the real issues \nare. Whether it is the fault of the media, whether it is the idea of \nthe media picking out the emotional things, whether it is the idea of \nprofessional campaign planners who spin and intentionally blur the \nissues, whether it is a Congress and an administration that seek to \nmake the choices less clear, I do not know. Perhaps it is a combination \nof each of those.\n  Nevertheless, you and I have a responsibility to choose. On my way \nback Sunday, I had a book I have been intending to read about the \nConstitution. I was struck by the idea that the Constitution, and more \nparticularly the Bill of Rights, was designed exclusively to limit the \npowers of Government. You do not find in the Bill of Rights, the \nGovernment will do this, the Government shall do this, the Government \nshall provide that. It says, the Government ``shall not.''\n  The great concern of our forefathers was to make sure that we limit \nthe central Government, limit the power of central Government. Still, \nit seems to me, in our own way, in our own judgment, that is the choice \nwe make. How do we see the Government? What do we think the role of the \nFederal Government is? Is it to provide all the little nice things we \nwould like to have happen personally in our lives? Every day is a new \nprogram for something that is probably pretty nice. Is that the role? \nOr is the role more one of insuring freedom, insuring opportunity, \ninsuring an environment in which the private sector can function, \nproviding for strong local government, State and county?\n  These are the decisions, and I know my prejudices are pretty well \narranged. I seek to have a Federal Government that is the protector of \nthose things, rather than a provider of those things. Obviously, there \nare things that are appropriate for the Federal Government to do--in \ninterstate commerce, in defense and those kind of things. Those are the \ndecisions that we will make. I hope each of us is prepared to do that.\n  I happen to think we have begun to do some of those things in the \nlast 2 years in this Congress, and, in fact, this has been one of the \nmost effective Congresses we have had for a very long time. \nUnfortunately, our minority leader does not agree with that. He was \nquoted as saying this has not been a productive Congress. I am sorry to \nhear him say that. I do not agree. We will talk about a number of \nthings that have been done, things I believe move us more into the \ndirection of a smaller Federal Government, a less expensive Federal \nGovernment, a less regulated society.\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\n  Lower taxes: In the 104th Congress, the Republicans passed a $245 \nbillion tax cut, including a $500 child tax credit to move toward \nallowing families to spend their own money, to allow families to \nprovide for their children. Unfortunately, it was vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  Lower spending: This Congress has cut spending $9.3 billion in 1995, \nand $23 billion in 1996 was eliminated from 270 programs. That is good. \nI think that is a real movement. The administration claims to have \nreduced the size of Government. Indeed they have--they claim, 200,000. \nThe fact is that most was from the base closures, civilian employees of \ndefense; the other was the termination of the savings and loan. \nNevertheless, it reduced employees, and that is good.\n  Balanced budget: How many times before the last 2 years did you hear \npeople talking about balancing the budget? Not very much. It has not \nbeen balanced in 40 years. Now, suddenly, everyone is for it. The \ndiscussion is not, do you balance the budget; the discussion is, how do \nyou do that? Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution was defeated here. Nevertheless, we now are on the road to \na balanced budget.\n  Ending welfare as we know it: We have done that, something that has \nnot been done for a very long time, providing the States more \nopportunity to do something about the entitlement aspect of welfare. \nEverybody wants to help people who need help. The question is, how do \nwe help them to help themselves? That is what we have sought to do. It \ntook three times to get it passed. Nevertheless, it is a success.\n  Market-based health reform: Portability, availability, limited \nmedical savings account, the end to preexisting condition exclusions, \ncombat fraud and waste in health care. A success.\n  Here is an interesting one, ensuring access to higher education. This \nCongress increased student loan volume by 50 percent, from $24 billion \nto $36 billion in 2002. Unfortunately, it was vetoed as part of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Farm programs: Many of us have been involved in farm programs for a \nvery long time. Most everyone has said we need to move toward market \norientation, toward the marketplace. Finally, we have done that over a \nperiod of 7 years. Agriculture is moving toward a market-oriented \neconomy. It needs to be done. Finally, it is done.\n  We helped to end lawsuit abuse. Securities litigation was passed. \nUnfortunately, it was vetoed. Telecommunications was passed. A \nderegulation of telecommunications which give us some of the kind of \nnew opportunities to communicate that we have never had.\n  Unfunded mandates is something that local governments have been \ntalking about for a very long time. Unfunded mandates reforms were \npassed this time.\n  Regulatory reform: Unfortunately, the real broad one was killed. I \nthink it should have been passed. A lesser one was passed.\n  Mr. President, we have done a lot of things this time. Line-item \nveto: A line-item veto in 40 years has not been done. This Congress \npassed a line-item veto.\n  Congressional accountability: People in this place, now, have to live \nunder the same rules in their offices and in their conduct, the same as \neverybody else, in the laws they pass for others.\n  Reduce congressional funding, small business regulatory reform, gift \nban.\n  Mr. President, I think this has been an extremely successful \nCongress. The choice with respect to the election is, do we want to \ncontinue in this direction, or do we want to go back to where we have \nbeen for 40 years in continuing to grow with the kind of Lyndon Johnson \nprograms we have had? That is the choice. It is really the choice.\n  I think, in addition, and perhaps as important as anything, this \nCongress has changed the culture of Washington. For the first time, I \nthink, in a very long time--certainly for the first time since I have \nbeen here in 6 years--the Congress really took a look at programs that \nexist and said, do they need to continue to exist? If so, can they be \ndone more efficiently? Could they be done more efficiently by the \nStates or local government? These are the kind of things that need to \nbe examined constantly.\n  I have a bill that I hope gets consideration next year which would \ngive us a biannual budget so we do not each year spend all of our time \non appropriations bills. As you can see by the leader's comments this \nmorning, we are still working on them, and we will not get them done at \nall this year. We do that every year. I hope, as most States do, we can \ngo to a biannual budget. It is better for agencies. Then we can spend \nthe last year with oversight, looking at programs, to see if indeed \nthis is a better way to do it.\n  There are a great many things we can do, a great many things we have \ndone. Mr. President, my whole point is, in this election, we make some \nchoices. It is not always easy. It is not always easy to determine \nwhere the choices lie, of course. We see all the advertisements, and \nsometimes you wonder where they are. But I think we have a \nresponsibility to ask, to seek, to point out where these things are. \nWhere do you stand on the balanced budget amendment? Where do you stand \non less Government rather than more? Where do you stand on less taxes \nrather than more? I think those are the basic issues that you and I \nneed to decide. I urge we all do that.\n\n  There are other issues, of course. The issue of character, I think, \nis one. I think we have to ask ourselves, what do we expect of leaders \nin terms of character? As we look back, character has been an important \nfactor, has been a key factor, and continues to be.\n  Mr. President, we have some choices. The choices, frankly, are rather \nclear. We can go back where we were or we can continue the kinds of \nthings that have been done in this Congress in the last 2 years, and it \ndoes need an opportunity to continue. You can't change 40 years of \nhistory and turn things around in 2 years. Despite the difficulties, it \nis my view that this Congress has done exceptionally well and will go \ndown in history as one who has sought to turn the direction of this \ncountry. I hope that we continue to do that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we hear so many negative things, and it is \nkind of enjoyable to talk about what has been accomplished sometimes. \nThe Senator from Wyoming has been very articulate in expressing those \npositive things. I remember in 1987 when I was first elected to the \nother body. We had as our class project at that time to repeal the \nearnings test. I have always felt there is nothing more un-American \nthan to tell the people in America that once you reach a certain age, \nyou have to become nonproductive, and if you are not nonproductive, \nthen we are going to take away some of your Social Security. Well, we \ntried for about 10 years to get that done, and it was not until we had \na Republican Congress that we were able to have a major reform. We \nhaven't totally repealed it, but we will phase into a position where we \nactually will be telling the people of America that you are not going \nto be punished if you decide to be productive past a certain age.\n  Many years ago, I was the mayor of a major city in America, Tulsa, \nOK, and every time I go and talk to mayors now, I say, ``Tell us what \nthe major problem facing your city has been.'' They don't say it's \ncrime in the streets and welfare. They say it's unfunded mandates. I \ncan remember so well as the mayor of the city of Tulsa when the Federal \nGovernment would come and tell us certain things that we had to do, and \nif we didn't do it, they are going to be taking money away from us, or \nif we did it, we would have to pay for it ourselves. Consequently, it \nwould be up to us to allow Congress in Washington, with all of the \nlofty attitudes that they seem to portray here, to say that we have \ndone these wonderful things for the people of America, and to say that \nsome political subdivision underneath them--the cities, or counties, or \nStates--had to pay for them.\n\n  We passed an unfunded mandates bill where we are not going to be \nfaced with that anymore. I would like for it to have been retroactive, \nbut it could not have been. So that has been resolved. It is a major \nreform, and it was done by this Congress. I am very, very proud of\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\nthat. I counted the reforms we have passed, and I would challenge \nanybody to find a 10-year period in history when there have been more \nreforms passed by Congress than we have passed.\n  Congressional accountability--the fact that we now have to live under \nthe same laws that we impose upon other people in the rest of the \ncountry. I spent 30 years in the private sector. I understand what it \nis like to have to live under an overregulated society, and, yet, \nMembers of Congress historically have been exempt from most of those \nimpositions. Now they are going to have to live under the same laws \nthat we pass for other people. I think that is a major accomplishment \nof this Republican Congress.\n  The line-item veto: As long as I can remember, we have talked about \nthat--about reforming the line-item veto. A lot of my friends say, \nwell, I would like to have the line-item veto, as long as we know we \nhave a conservative in the White House, or the other side of the fence \nwould say they would like to have a line-item veto as long as we have a \nliberal there. But I suggest to you, Mr. President, that they miss the \npoint when they say that, because all a line-item veto does is force \nthe President and Congress to be accountable. Republicans and Democrats \nin the White House, for decades, have been able to say, well, I didn't \nwant that law, but I had to either sign that because veterans benefits \nare in there, or something else was in there, and consequently they go \nahead and sign something that they say they are opposed to. This forces \nthem, or him, or her, Democrat or Republican, to be accountable, so \nthat if there is 1 thing out of 25 things in a bill that he doesn't \nlike, he can veto it and send it back, and that makes us accountable.\n  So the whole idea there is accountability. We have passed that. I \nfeel very good about it and think that is a major improvement. Back \nbefore I was in the U.S. Senate, I represented an all-urban area, \nprimarily one county in the State of Oklahoma. So I did not have much \nof the agricultural areas and interests in my district. But I found, as \nI traveled around the State after becoming a Member of the U.S. Senate, \nwhere I had largely an agricultural State, the people who are in the \nfarm communities in Oklahoma--and I suspect it is that way throughout \nthe Nation--really have felt that we have had a failed agricultural \npolicy in this country, that we have imposed upon our farmers things \nthat they must do. Yet, they are not free to plant what they think the \nmarket will bear and what will best take care of their needs.\n  Well, the Freedom to Farm Act was passed, and I find, as I go \naround--as I did, as a matter of fact, only Monday of this week. I had, \nI think, seven town meetings throughout agricultural areas in Oklahoma. \nThey all think it is very good.\n  Do you know what else they think, Mr. President? They want to do \nsomething about property rights. Well, that is one area where we have \nnot been successful. I would like to say that we are able to pass all \nof the reforms that we wanted to pass. Unfortunately, several of them \nwere vetoed by this President. The reform that will go down, I think, \nin history as the most significant reform that the public is aware of \nwould be welfare reform. I have to remind you that President Clinton \nvetoed this bill twice. We passed a welfare reform bill that was based \non what he campaigned on for President in 1992. He vetoed it, and then \nhe vetoed it a second time. But just as we are getting into the final \nstages of the Presidential election year, he has signed it. At the same \ntime, he has whispered to his friends on the left that if he is \nreelected, he will change some of the reforms that we have in the \nwelfare bill.\n\n  There are three things I have often said that make us globally \nnoncompetitive, Mr. President. One is that we are overtaxed. The other \nis we are overregulated. Third is our tort laws in this country. I was \nproud to be a part of the success in changing our tort laws as it \npertains to just one manufacturing item: airplanes and airplane parts. \nI have about a 39-year history and background in aviation. So I know a \nlittle bit about that. Prior to 1970, we made almost the entire world \nsupply of airplanes in the United States--a major export item. And \nthen, over the 10-year period of the 1970's, and up through to the \npresent time, we quit making single-engine airplanes in America. We \nquit making them only for one reason, which is that you can't be \nglobally competitive and offset the cost of all these lawsuits. So we \nhave lawsuit after lawsuit against manufacturers of airplane parts and \nof airplanes where maybe it has worked perfectly well for 50 years, but \nall of a sudden there is an accident and they will go back and get a \nmultimillion-dollar judgment against the manufacturer, and, \nconsequently, our manufacturers either went broke or quit making small \nairplanes.\n  I remember the case of Piper Aircraft. They said to the bankruptcy \ncourt, ``We can move our plant and all of our equipment to Canada and \nmake the same airplanes and supply the same market and do so at a \nprofit because of the fact that they don't have the tort laws we have \nin this country.'' So we passed a bill. Even though the President made \na commitment to veto any kind of meaningful tort reform, he signed it \nbecause we had so much pressure out there. People realized this is a \nmajor manufacturing area that could benefit all of America.\n  In Oklahoma alone, we can identify 4,000 jobs as a result of that one \ntort reform. Well, it would only stand to reason that if we can put \nAmerica back into making airplanes by having tort reform, insofar as \nthe manufacture of airplanes and parts is concerned, why not spread \nthat across the entire manufacturing base? So we did. We passed a bill \nthat would make America competitive again, and the President vetoed it.\n  So I think we have a lot of things that we wanted to do. There was \nthe $500-per-child tax credit, which the President vetoed. There was \nregulation reform, and some of the marriage penalties that we were \ngoing to correct, and the President vetoed it.\n  In spite of that, we have been a very productive House and Senate, \nand I am very proud of the major reforms that have passed. I only \nregret that we were unable to get them all passed because of the vetoes \nof the President, and perhaps that will change in the near future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INHOFE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11213-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11214-S11215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to pay tribute to our \ndeparting colleague, Paul Simon.\n  All of us have an image of what a U.S. Senator ought to be. It will \nnot surprise anyone that all who serve here measure up. Paul Simon is \nsomeone who clearly measures up. He is a thoughtful, hard-working, and \ncommitted American. He has a clean philosophy and the integrity to \nstand up for it. Paul's manner is open. His approach is thoughtful and \nconsiderate. He is one who cares more about solving problems than \nmaking himself look good.\n  I think of him as a part a long line of Senators from Illinois that \nare epitomized by Paul Douglas. Perhaps I should say that in my mind \nPaul Douglas is epitomized by Paul Simon because both of them brought \ngreat integrity and intellect to this body.\n  It is not unusual for Paul Simon and I to be on opposite sides of an \nissue. But, I have never found him to be unwilling to listen or \nunwilling to objectively think through problems. I have often found him \nable to find solutions that make sense for our country. In short, he is \nthe kind of person who comes here to serve, who places integrity in the \noffice, and who places the integrity of his person above the \nvicissitudes of the day and above any selfish interests.\n  It has been a great privilege for me to work with Paul Simon. He is \nsomeone I admire now and I suspect I will admire him for the rest of my \nlife because he embodies the best that is in us. He has brought this \nbody a nobleness which is in short supply. As one who hopes the \nRepublican Party will win the seat in Illinois, I will still be sad to \nsee Paul Simon go. He has enriched this body. He has enriched all of\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\nus who have had the pleasure to serve with him.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nColorado for those excellent words about a colleague--a very serious \ntribute, a very sincere one, and we are grateful to him as a friend of \nPaul's for his observations about his service. I thank him for his very \ngenerous comments. I am sure Senator Simon will, but I would certainly \nagree with all of his conclusions. I thank him for making those views \nclear on the Senate floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11214-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11215-S11217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, AND HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this past weekend, Bob Dole used his \nSaturday radio address to attack the President's record on health care. \nHe repeated his attack yesterday. He even claimed credit for passage of \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill.\n  Few issues are more important to the American people than access to \naffordable, quality health care. They want it for their children, for \ntheir parents, and for themselves. But Bob Dole was wrong on his facts, \nand he was wrong in his conclusions.\n  On health care, the choice in November is clear. President Clinton \nand Democrats in Congress stand on the side of American families. Bob \nDole and the Republican leadership in Congress have consistently put \nfamilies last and special interests first when it comes to health care \nand health reform.\n  The Republican leadership in this Dole-Gingrich Congress tried to \nslash Medicare. They tried to trash Medicaid. Bob Dole personally tried \nto kill the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. The Republican leadership blocked \nmental health parity and new protection for mothers and infants, until \nDemocratic members of Congress forced them to act. Republicans continue \nto resist enactment of a simple rule telling HMO's and insurance \ncompanies that they can't prohibit doctors from telling patients about \nmedical treatments they need.\n  Throughout this Congress, Republicans have been obstructionists on \nhealth care reform. There is no reason to believe they will deal \nconstructively with the problems facing our health care system if they \nretain control of the Congress or win the White House.\n  President Clinton and Democrats in Congress are committed to genuine \nprogress on health reform. The American people know we're on their \nside. Every American who works hard and plays by the rules should have \naccess to affordable health insurance coverage. Senior citizens deserve \nthe Medicare they have earned. They should also be able to keep their \nown doctor, and be protected against profiteering by private insurance \ncompanies.\n  Senior citizens deserve quality nursing home care, without \nbankrupting their families. President Clinton has led the effort to \nfill the gaps in Medicare by providing coverage for prescription drugs, \nand for long-term care in a nursing home or a senior citizen's own \nhome.\n  Americans deserve protection against the excesses of insurance \ncompanies that put healthy profits above healthy patients. They deserve \na strong FDA to protect people from harmful drugs, guarantee a safe \nfood supply, and crack down on shameful tobacco industry practices that \nentice children to start smoking.\n  These are basic principles that the vast majority of Americans \nsupport--but not Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and Republicans in Congress. \nNewt Gingrich has said that he wants Medicare to wither on the vine.'' \nHouse Majority Leader Dick Armey has called it a program that he would \nhave no part of in a free world.'' Bob Dole said that he is proud to \nhave voted against Medicare at the beginning. As he told the American \nConservative Union, ``I was there, fighting the fight, voting against \nMedicare, one of twelve, because we knew it wouldn't work.''\n\n  That was said not in 1965, Mr. President, but in his run for the \nPresidency.\n  The Dole-Gingrich Republican budget would have slashed Medicare by \n$270 billion. Under the Republican budget Bob Dole forced through the \nSenate, Medicare premiums would have doubled, deductibles would have \ndoubled, and the Medicare age of eligibility would have been raised.\n  Every senior couple would have paid an additional $2,400 over the \nlife of the plan in increased premiums alone. Make no mistake, Bob Dole \nand the Republican Congress are no friends of Medicare.\n  To make matters worse, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich formed an unholy \nalliance with the private insurance industry to try to privatize \nMedicare, to force senior citizens to give up their family doctor, \nleave conventional Medicare, and join a private insurance plan. The \nRepublicans claimed their plan was intended to give senior citizens a \nchoice. But as all elderly Americans know, giving up the doctor they \nhave chosen to provide billions of dollars in profits for private \ninsurance companies is no choice at all. Again and again, Congress \nvoted on these issues. Again and again, Bob Dole voted with most \nRepublicans in favor of private insurance plans and against senior \ncitizens.\n  Bob Dole claimed before the 1994 election that Republicans had no \nplan to cut Medicare. He said that President Clinton and the Democrats \nwere just using scare tactics. Bob Dole is saying the same thing this \nyear--but this time the American people know better, because they know \nMedicare was put on the chopping block by this Republican Congress.\n  Despite various promises made prior to the 1994 election that there \nwould be no cuts in Medicare, the Republicans proposed cuts of $270 \nbillion to Medicare to pay for a $245 billion tax cut. Now Bob Dole is \ntalking about an economic plan that will cost $681 billion over a 7-\nyear period. He has indicated he is not going to cut the defense \nbudget; in fact, he has said he would increase the defense budget with \nadditional funding for B-2 bombers and a number of other areas.\n  The whole question is how can we have any confidence that the \nMedicare cut is not going to be of a similar proportion in spite of his \nstatements made prior to the election. ``President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore are resorting to scare tactics falsely accusing \nRepublicans of secret plans to cut Medicare benefits.'' Bob Dole said \nthis just before the election in 1994. Haley Barbour said the same \nthing: ``As far as I'm concerned, the Democrats' big lie campaign is \nthat the Contract With America would require huge Medicare cuts. It \nwould not.''\n  Soon after the election, the GOP introduced their plan: $270 billion \nin cuts in Medicare to pay for $245 billion in tax cuts.\n  Republicans in Congress didn't stop with Medicare. They also proposed \ndeep cuts in Medicaid--a devastating one-two punch for senior citizens \nand the disabled. Under the GOP plan, 9 million Americans--children, \nsenior citizens, and the disabled--would have lost health care coverage \nunder Medicaid. They proposed to slash the program by $180 billion. \nThey also proposed to eliminate Federal nursing home quality \nstandards--not modify them, not improve them, but eliminate them.\n  No one should be forced to go back to the time before Federal nursing \nhome quality standards were enacted in 1987. Elderly patients were \noften allowed to go uncleaned for days, lying in their own excrement. \nThey were tied to wheelchairs and beds under conditions that would not \nbe tolerated in any prison in America.\n  Deliberate abuse and outright violence were inflicted on helpless \nsenior citizens by callous and sadistic attendants. Painful, untreated, \nand completely avoidable bedsores were widespread. Patients were \nscalded to death in hot baths and showers, sedated to the point of \nunconsciousness, or isolated from all normal life--all because fly-by-\nnight nursing home operators were profiteering from the misery of their \npatients.\n  Congress stopped all that by insisting that all nursing homes must \nmeet basic standards. Yet those are the standards that Bob Dole and \nNewt Gingrich tried to eliminate. They would also have removed \nprotections against impoverishing children and spouses of senior \ncitizens who need nursing home care.\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\n  Democrats opposed all of these Republican schemes. As the debate in \nCongress took place and the American people came to understand what was \nat stake, Republicans retreated from their most extreme proposals. But \nthe retreat was always grudging. The desire to roll back basic \nprotections was always there. If Republicans retain control of the \nCongress, we are likely to see a new Republican effort to enact these \ncruel and unfair proposals.\n  The Dole-Gingrich Republican plan for Medicare and Medicaid made a \nmockery of the family values they claim to support. Under their plan, \nmillions of elderly Americans would have been forced to go without the \nhealth care they need. Millions more would have to choose between food \non the table, adequate heat in the winter, paying the rent, or paying \nfor medical care. Senior citizens have earned their Medicare benefits. \nThey have paid for them. They deserve them. And we don't intend to let \nRepublicans take them away.\n  President Clinton and Democrats in Congress stopped the Republican \nassault for the time being. Now it is up to the American people to stop \nit for good, by the ballots cast in November. Republicans must never \nagain have the opportunity to turn Medicare into a slush fund for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  Younger Americans, too, deserve affordable health insurance for \nthemselves and their families. President Clinton has fought hard to \ngive all Americans the guarantee that health care will be there when \nthey need it.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill passed by this \nCongress will end some of the worst abuses in the current system. It \nguarantees that, as long as you faithfully pay your premiums, your \ninsurance cannot be taken away--even if you become seriously ill, or \nlose your job, or change your job. Under that bill, insurance companies \ncan no longer impose pre-existing condition exclusions on your \ncoverage, as long as you do not let your insurance lapse. The bill \nopens the door of opportunity for Americans locked in their current job \nand afraid to pursue new opportunities for fear they would lose their \ncoverage or face exclusions for preexisting conditions.\n  In the end, this legislation was bipartisan. It passed the Senate 98 \nto 0. But without President Clinton's leadership it would never have \nbecome law. The bill languished on the Senate Calendar for months, with \nno hope of passage, because Bob Dole refused to let the Senate act. It \npassed the Labor and Human Resources Committee 17 to 0 on August 2, but \nin spite of repeated requests Senator Dole refused to bring it up. He \nhid for months behind a series of rolling, anonymous holds placed by \nRepublican Senators at the insistence of the insurance industry.\n  Ultimately, Bob Dole, who controled the Senate Calendar, stalled, \nstonewalled, and sabotaged every effort to bring the bill forward and \nsucceeded in delaying it for 9 months. And, if he had his way, he would \nhave killed it.\n  The gridlock finally began to break when President Clinton \nhighlighted the bill in his State of the Union Address last January. \nWhen the press focused on the anonymous holds that were holding the \nlegislation captive and Senator Dole's refusal to bring it to the \nfloor, public pressure began to mount. But he still refused to act. \nOnly when the ``Nightline'' program confronted Senator Dole directly in \nNew Hampshire and demanded to know why he was holding up the \nlegislation did he finally agree to bring the bill to the floor.\n  How ironic that Senator Dole has the gall to claim credit for the \ninsurance reform bill. It passed the Labor Committee in August. It was \non the Senate Calendar by the beginning of October. Time and time \nagain, Senator Dole was asked to bring the bill up by Senator Kassebaum \nand myself. We asked for floor time in November, but he refused. \nSenator Kassebaum and I, we asked for floor time in December, but he \nrefused. We asked for floor time in January, but he refused. And he \nclaims credit for this legislation.\n  What was Bob Dole's excuse? Well, there were holds on the bill--\nanonymous holds. But those holds were not anonymous to the majority \nleader. He knew who was blocking the bill. And he knew that he could \nbring the bill to the floor any time he wanted. But he did nothing--\nbecause his friends in the insurance industry did not want the bill to \npass. And he claims credit for this legislation.\n  It was President's Clinton's call to pass this legislation in the \nState of the Union on January 23 that focused the attention of the \npress and the public on the Senate's failure to act. Editorials called \nfor action, but still Senator Dole refused. There were holds on the \nbill, he said--even though everyone knows that a majority leader can \noverride any hold from any Senator. But Bob Dole still refused to act.\n  The press kept up its drumbeat. What is this rolling hold? Where is \nSenator Dole? The press even identified some of the Senators placing \nholds--but where was Bob Dole? Did he urge any of these Senators to \nlift these holds?\n  And then came the breakthrough. ``Nightline'' confronted Senator Dole \non January 31 in New Hampshire. He refused to explain why he would not \nbring the bill to the floor. Miraculously, the next day, Senator Dole \nmoved to lift the holds. But he still tried to delay the bill as long \nas possible, so the health insurance industry could mobilize to kill or \ngut the bill.\n  He asked that the consent agreement delay the bill for an additional \n6 months, to the July 4 recess. When Democrats refused to go along with \nyet another delay, Senator Dole proposed to delay for 5 months--until \nMemorial Day. And he wants to claim credit for this bill.\n  Finally, with increasing pressure from the public, Senator Dole \nfinally agreed to schedule the bill--but he still delayed its \nconsideration to April 15, at the earliest.\n  Anyone would think that there was tremendously important legislation \ntieing up the floor for these many months. But what was Senator Dole \nfinding time for? Mostly nothing. Of course, there was work going on \noff the Senate floor on the budget, but for most of February, Senator \nDole kept the Senate out of session, so he could campaign. When he came \nback to Washington, his main priority was extending Senator D'Amato's \ninvestigation of Whitewater. He also found time to schedule votes on \nlegislation that would have gutted food safety, environmental safety \nand a host of other consumer protection for the benefit of big \nbusiness. But health insurance protection for the American people was \nnot on Senator Dole's priority list. And he wants to claim credit for \nthis legislation.\n\n  Even when the bill passed the Senate, Bob Dole and the House \nleadership still delayed it for months by their insistence on stacking \nthe deck of the conference to include a provision on medical savings \naccounts that was a giveaway to the Golden Rule Insurance Co. and a \nthreat to everyone with a comprehensive insurance policy.\n  As late as the day before the bill was finally passed, congressional \nRepublicans and their special interest allies in the insurance industry \nwere trying to weaken key provisions allowing people to buy individual \ninsurance coverage if they lost coverage through an employer.\n  For many months this moderate, non-partisan bill was adamantly \nopposed by insurance companies that profit from the worst abuses of the \ncurrent system. And Bob Dole was actively supporting their opposition \nand delay.\n  The story of insurance against mental illness is similar. The \nDomenici-Wellstone amendment to give the mentally ill and their \nfamilies fair treatment was a bipartisan effort. It received \noverwhelming votes in the Senate both times it was considered. But the \ninsurance industry opposed it. And so the Republican House leadership \ninsisted on dropping it from the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, and fought up \nto the last moment to keep it out of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. \nAnd Bob Dole never lifted a finger to help. He was MIA at every \ncritical stage of the debate.\n  Quality health care for the American people also depends on a strong \nFood and Drug Administration, to guarantee that food is healthy, that \nprescription drugs will cure and not kill, and that medical devices \nwill sustain and improve life, rather than end it.\n  But Republicans in Congress have a different priority. They want to \nturn critical functions of the FDA over to the tender mercies of \nprivate companies hired and paid for by the very\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nmanufacturers whose products they are supposed to regulate.\n  President Clinton and Democrats in Congress refuse to allow \nRepublicans to expose Americans again to drug disasters like \nthalidomide and DES and device failures like the Dalkon shield and the \nShiley heart valve.\n  And unlike Senator Dole, President Clinton and Democrats know that \ntobacco is addictive, and that children deserve protection from the \nunconscionable targeted assaults of tobacco advertising.\n  Another key health issue for families is the quality of the insurance \nthey purchase with their premium dollars. The growth of managed care \nand HMO's in recent years has been soaring. Today, more than half of \nall Americans with private insurance are enrolled in such plans. \nSeventy percent of covered employees in businesses with more than 10 \nemployees are enrolled in managed care. Between 1990 and 1995 alone, \nthe proportion of Blue Cross and Blue Shield enrollees participating in \nmanaged care plans rose from just one in five to almost half. Even \nconventional fee-for-service plans have increasingly adopted features \nof managed care, such as ongoing medical review and case management.\n  At its best, managed care can improve quality while reducing costs. \nBut at its worst, managed care puts the bottom line ahead of the \npatient's health--and pressures physicians to do the same. The most \nwidespread abuses include failure to inform patients of particular \ntreatments; excessive barriers to specialists for evaluation and \ntreatment; unwillingness to order appropriate diagnostic tests; \nevicting mothers and infants prematurely from hospitals; and refusal to \npay for potentially lifesaving treatment. In too many cases, these \nfailures have had tragic consequences.\n  President Clinton and Democrats--Senator Bradley, Senator Wyden, \nothers--have fought to end these abuses, and we will do more in a \nDemocratic Congress. We fought for the Mothers and Infants Protection \nAct, which guarantees that a mother will not be forced to leave the \nhospital too soon after her baby is born. We are urging legislation to \nbar HMO gag rules, to prevent insurance companies from prohibiting \nphysicians from giving all the facts to their patients. The Mothers and \nInfants Protection Act is on the verge of becoming law--because \nRepublican opposition was proving too costly with the public.\n  But just the other day, the Republican leadership in the Senate used \na parliamentarian technicality to kill legislation to prohibit managed \ncare plans from gagging doctors. Negotiations are continuing, and I \nhope this legislation can still be passed before the end of the year.\n  But if it does pass, it will be in large measure because President \nClinton and Democrats in Congress have championed it over relentless \nRepublican opposition.\n  We all know the many other serious health issues facing the country. \nDown-sizing, layoffs, cutbacks, the growth of the contingent work \nforce, and the escalating cost of health insurance are peeling back the \nprotections that most Americans count on for themselves and their \nfamilies. According to recent projections, less than half of all \nAmericans will enjoy reliable, on-the-job health insurance by the year \n2002.\n  President Clinton and Democrats in Congress will work to reverse \nthese trends and give all families the health insurance protection they \ndeserve. President Clinton has already proposed assistance to help \nworkers between jobs keep their health insurance. Democrats in Congress \nare pledged to put affordable health insurance for children within the \nreach of every family. That is leadership provided by my colleague and \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The Republican leadership in Congress and Bob Dole refuse to deal \nwith these issues. They oppose us every step of the way. Their record \nshows that they care more about protecting powerful special interests \nthan protecting American families.\n  It is ironic that Bob Dole in recent days has been attacking \nPresident Clinton on health care. Whether the issue is Medicare, \nMedicaid, health care for working families, safe and effective medical \nproducts, mental health parity, or protection against the abuses of the \nprivate insurance industry, the record is clear. President Clinton and \nDemocrats in Congress want to preserve and protect the benefits that \nthe American people have earned. We want to do more to meet the \nchallenge of providing adequate health care to senior citizens and all \nworking families.\n  By contrast, Bob Dole and Republicans want to turn the clock back. \nWhether the issue is slashing Medicare to pay for new tax breaks for \nthe wealthy, enabling insurance firms to reap greater profits at the \nexpense of senior citizens, and other families, Republican priorities \nare as clear as they are wrong. President Clinton and a Democratic \nCongress will reverse those backward Republican priorities in the next \n4 years.\n  Bob Dole is right. Health care is a defining issue, but the issue is \nnot, as he claims, whether the Government should run the health care \nsystem. That kind of charge is a smokescreen. The real issue is whether \nGovernment is on the side of American people, or allied with the greedy \nguardians of the status quo. On all of the critical issues of health \nreform, President Clinton and Democrats have consistently fought for \nbetter health care for families, and we will continue to do so in the \nyears ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOHN N. LEIN\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my senior \ncolleague from the State of Washington, to honor a very special \nindividual from our home State. I want to take a few minutes today to \nhonor Jack Lein, not only for his decades of service to Washington \nState, but for his tireless dedication and commitment to this Nation's \nhealth and education.\n  Mr. President, Jack Lein was born and raised near former House \nSpeaker Tom Foley in Spokane, WA. He served his country bravely during \nWorld War II as a medical corpsman atop the mountains of Idaho. Though \nJack would tell us he saw very limited military conflict above \nAmerica's prized potato fields, he did begin a career of medical \nservice that has now spanned generations.\n  After receiving his medical degree in 1955 and spending some time in \nprivate practice, he joined the faculty and administration of the \nUniversity of Washington where he has remained for over 32 years. Being \nmyself a proud alumnus of Washington State University, it is, indeed, \ndifficult to salute a man so entrenched in the success of our rival, \nthe University of Washington. But I am proud to say, Dr. Lein's tenure \nat the university has helped to produce one of this Nation's premier \nresearch and health science facilities.\n  Dr. Lein's career at the University of Washington has encompassed \nmost aspects of modern medicine, medical and health sciences education, \nuniversity administration and Federal relations. He founded the \nUniversity of Washington School of Medicine continuing medical \neducation program and was its director for 19 years. He was also \nassistant dean and then associate dean of the school of medicine. He \npioneered regionalized medical education and served as the university's \nvice president for health sciences, the highest academic administrative \nposition ever achieved by a UW graduate.\n  Dr. Lein's work will be seen by generations to come through his \nperseverance and foresight which has produced and will continue to \nproduce thousands of America's health professionals. His leadership has \nbeen noted by both his peers and the press. In 1993, Dr. Lein was \nhonored with the Recognition Award by the Society for Teachers of \nFamily Medicine. For the third consecutive year, the University of \nWashington School of Medicine was ranked the best primary care medical \nschool in the Nation. Among medical teaching disciplines, the UW ranked \nfirst in family and rural medicine, third in women's health care and \nfifth in pediatrics.\n  Although it may be appropriate to call the university's last three \ndecades the ``Lein'' years, that description would be far from \naccurate. As the director of Federal relations, Dr. Lein\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nhas transformed the university into one of the Nation's leading \nresearch universities. The University of Washington has been ranked in \nthe top five in receipt of Federal grant and contract dollars, which \naccount for 80 percent of the university's grant funding.\n  If anyone could document the history of Washington State's \ncongressional delegation over the last 50 years, it would be Jack. His \nwit is legendary around Washington State circles, and he can quickly \nrecount a story about Scoop or Dan Evans. Jack will tell you that \nMaggie thought ``foreign policy was anything outside Washington \nState.'' He was always there with either the right information or the \nright resource to find the answer.\n\n  Dr. Lein will step down from his position at the university at the \nend of this year. His absence will be felt by U.S. Senators, \ncongressional staff, college faculty, and students for many years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Washington State, I \nsalute Dr. Jack Lein and his wife, Claire, for a lifetime of dedicated \nservice to his alma mater, his State and his Nation.\n  Jack, we will miss you, but we will always know that you are close \nby.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the two of us who represent the State \nof Washington in the U.S. Senate, this is a day that is both joyous and \nsad. It is sad because on December 31 of this year, we will miss the \ncompany of Dr. Jack Lein who, for decades, has represented the \nUniversity of Washington before this body and with particularly, of \ncourse, the Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who \nrepresent the State of Washington.\n  It is a happy occasion, of course, because it gives us an opportunity \nto crown his career with at least a tiny share of the praise that it \ndeserves.\n  I can say, Mr. President, after a relatively long career in the U.S. \nSenate and an even longer one in the Government of the State of \nWashington, that no person, no individual representing an institution \nhas matched Jack Lein in the quality of his knowledge about the issues \nthat he brings to us, in his dedication to the university that he \nrepresents, or in the personal qualities which cause all of us to \nwelcome him into our office, to go out of our way to seek his company \nand to learn from him.\n  He has been nonpartisan or bipartisan in the highest sense of that \nterm, with an ability to tell wonderful and always affirmative stories \nabout the people he has met along the way, but with the overwhelming \nability to cause us, who obviously believe in our university and want \nto help our university, to go even further than we would otherwise do \nsimply because it is so important to please him and to help him.\n  He will be not just difficult to follow in that respect, he will be \nimpossible to follow in that respect. So from the point of view of this \nSenator--and I know that my sentiments are shared, as they have already \nbeen expressed, by my junior colleague--we are not just simply missing \nsomeone who represents a vital institution to us here in this body, we \nare going to miss a very close friend, a good and delightful companion, \na wonderful servant of this institution and his State and his medical \nprofession in Dr. Jack Lein. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold that request for \njust a moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11217-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11218-S11225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n    INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nleadership and the Members on both sides for allowing the VA-HUD, \nindependent agencies bill, H.R. 3666, to be passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 3666, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \n1997.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $84.3 billion and new \noutlays of $49.7 billion to finance operations of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $84.3 billion in budget authority and $98.7 \nbillion in outlays. The total bill is under the Senate subcommittee's \n602(b) nondefense allocation by $43 million for budget authority and by \n$8 million for outlays. The subcommittee is also under its defense \nallocation by $3 million for budget authority and by $4 million for \noutlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference \nagreement on H.R. 3666.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         VA-HUD SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT        \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Budget          \n                                                      authority  Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........       61\n    H.R. 3666, conference report....................       126        64\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal defense discretionary..............       126       125\n                                                     ===================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................       365    47,431\n    H.R. 3666, conference report....................    63,917    31,589\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........    64,282    79,020\n                                                     ===================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........    1,153\n    H.R. 3666, conference report....................    20,260    18,013\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget Resolution assumptions..................      -406       381\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal mandatory..........................    19,854    19,547\n                                                     ===================\n        Adjusted bill total.........................    84,262    98,692\n                                                     ===================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary...........................       129       129\n    Nondefense discretionary........................    64,325    79,048\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .......\n    Mandatory.......................................    19,854    19,547\n                                                     -------------------\n        Total allocation............................    84,308    98,724\n                                                     ===================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary...........................        -3        -4\n    Nondefense discretionary........................       -43       -28\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .......\n    Mandatory.......................................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Total allocation............................       -46      -32 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Note: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Prepared by SBC\n  Majority Staff, Sept. 24, 1996.                                       \n\n         Section 8 Multifamily Housing Portfolio Demonstration\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have questions \nconcerning the implementation of the section 8 multifamily housing \nportfolio demonstration--Section 8 mark-to-market--which was adopted as \npart of the conference report to H.R. 3666, the VA/HUD fiscal year 1997 \nAppropriations Act. The purpose of this statement is to clarify these \nquestions for my colleagues, as well as for HUD. The conference report \nadopts a bipartisan strategy to build on the section 8 multifamily \nhousing portfolio restructuring demonstration which was adopted as part \nof the HUD fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, H.R. 3019, a further \ndownpayment toward a balanced budget.\n  The conference report establishes a revised demonstration program to \nemphasize that portfolio restructuring needs to be undertaken to reform \nand improve the FHA multifamily housing programs from a financial and \noperating perspective, but not to abandon the long-term commitment to \nresident protection and ongoing low-income affordability. The revised \ndemonstration, therefore, continues to give HUD a\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\nnumber of flexible tools for restructuring section 8 assisted, FHA-\ninsured projects, while emphasizing the preservation of the existing \nstock as low-income housing by generally restructuring these FHA-\ninsured mortgages and reducing the cost of renewing the section 8 \ncontracts. I emphasize that this demonstration, including the concept \nof reasonable offer, is intended to preserve affordable low-income \nhousing, prevent the dislocation of current residents, preserve the \nrights of current owners who have complied with program requirements, \nand to not create any significant exposure of tax liability to owners.\n  The section 8 mark-to-market inventory covers some 8,500 projects \nwith almost one million units that are both FHA-insured and whose debt \nservice is almost totally dependent on rental assistance payments made \nunder section 8 project-based contracts. Most of these projects serve \nvery low-income families, with approximately 37 percent of the stock \nserving elderly families. Many of these projects are oversubsidized \nand, without the renewal of expiring section 8 contracts, are at risk \nof mortgage default. This raises concerns of owner disinvestment, \nresident displacement, and government ownership, management and \ndisposition of this housing inventory. While continuing the existing \nsubsidy arrangements would be very popular to both owners and tenants, \nthe combination of the Federal Government overpaying for the value of \nthis low-income housing resource as well as the growing tide of \ndiscretionary budget cuts require new policies and reforms to these \nprograms.\n\n  The cost of renewing the section 8 project-based contracts on this \nmultifamily housing inventory emphasizes the many difficult budget and \npolicy issues which need to be addressed as Congress reevaluates \nFederal housing policy. In particular, according to HUD estimates, the \ncost of all section 8 contract renewals, both tenant-based and project-\nbased, will require appropriations of about $3.8 billion in fiscal year \n1997, $10 billion in fiscal year 1998, and over $16 billion in fiscal \nyear 2000. In addition, the cost of renewing the section 8 project-\nbased contracts will grow from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to \nalmost $4 billion in fiscal year 2000, and to some $8 billion in 10 \nyears. Moreover, the unpaid principal balance [UPB] on the mortgages \nassociated with this FHA-insured housing inventory represents a \ncontingent liability of some $17 billion to HUD and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The section 8 multifamily housing portfolio restructuring \ndemonstration is designed as an interim strategy and as a stepping \nstone for more comprehensive legislation by the authorizing committees \nas well as consideration of associated tax issues by the tax \ncommittees. This demonstration will require HUD to renew for up to 1 \nyear all section 8 contracts with rents at or below 120 percent of the \nfair market rent for an area. In addition, project owners with expiring \ncontracts above 120 percent of fair market rent may opt to have their \nsection 8 contracts renewed at 120 percent of the fair market rent. \nThis safe harbor will cover many of the 240,000 units which are \nsupported by expiring section 8 contracts in fiscal year 1997, and will \nprovide HUD with the administrative ability to focus on those FHA-\ninsured multifamily housing projects with significantly oversubsidized \nrents. The projects with units which do not qualify for the contract \nrenewal safe harbor will be eligible to participate in the section 8 \nmultifamily mortgage restructuring portfolio demonstration and, at a \nminimum, will be renewed at budget-based rents.\n  The demonstration would encourage HUD to enter into contracts with \nqualified State housing finance agencies, local housing agencies, and \nnonprofits either as a partner or as designee to administer the program \nfor HUD. The conference report reflects the belief that balancing the \nfiscal goals of reducing costs with the public policy goals of \npreserving and maintaining affordable low-income housing requires an \nintermediary which is accountable to the public interest. Because of \nthe Department's capacity and management problems as documented by the \nInspector General and the General Accounting Office, the demonstration \nreflects the understanding that capable public entities and certain \nqualified nonprofits should be accorded an opportunity to restructure \nmortgages on behalf of the Federal Government. I believe that many \nState housing finance agencies [HFA's], local HFA's, and other State \nand local housing and community development entities have the requisite \ncapacity and expertise to implement the mortgage restructuring \ndemonstration program and that developing this capacity and expertise \nwill be important in the future for further establishing and building \non both new and existing public and private partnerships for the \ndevelopment of affordable housing. I emphasize that nonprofits must be \nfinancially sound and have a demonstrated record in the area of \naffordable housing issues. I warn HUD to be very careful that sham \nnonprofits are not to be included, especially where a nonprofit is \ndetermined to be acting as a tool for the interests of some other \nentity.\n\n  It also is expected that HUD and these public purpose designees will \ncontract and subcontract with other entities, including private \nentities such as financial institutions and mortgage bankers and \nservicers, to enhance the expertise and capacity necessary to ensure \nthat mortgaging restructurings are handled to the best advantage of the \nFederal Government, the project, the community, and the residents. It \nis hoped that these partnerships can be used to crossfertilize public \nand private approaches to low-income housing to create new strategies \nand leverage new funds for the preservation and creation of low-income \naffordable housing resources.\n  The multifamily housing portfolio restructuring demonstration will \nprovide HUD and the public agencies, and nonprofits, with a number of \ntools to restructure the FHA-insured mortgages and reduce the cost of \nsection 8 project-based housing assistance. These tools include broad \nauthority to restructure mortgages, including the forgiveness of \nmortgage indebtedness. For example, HUD could restructure a project \nmortgage so that a first mortgage would reflect the market value of a \nproject while HUD holds a soft second on the remainder of the project \ndebt. This would preserve the low-income character of the housing while \nreducing both the cost of the section 8 assistance and the risk of \nforeclosure. In exchange for mortgage restructuring, project owners \nwould have to agree to preserve the housing as affordable for low-\nincome families in accordance with requirements established by the \nDepartment or a designee. These requirements shall be balanced to \nensure the long-term economic viability of the housing.\n  The demonstration also allows HUD to implement budget-based rents to \nsqueeze out any inflated profits while covering the debt service, \noperating costs and a reasonable return to the owners of these \nfederally assisted projects. The use of budget-based rents are intended \nto be flexible enough to ensure the preservation of unique and \ncritically needed low-income housing projects, such as elderly projects \nin rural areas, projects designed to house large families, projects in \nlocalities with low vacancy rates, and projects with operating costs \nwhich exceed any comparable market rents. I emphasize that the \nDepartment should exercise a special sensitivity to certain projects, \nsuch as elderly projects in rural areas, that house a special \npopulation, especially where the availability of other affordable \nhousing is questionable.\n\n  The conference report has elected to focus the restructuring \ndemonstration on projects with contract rents above 120 percent of the \nfair market rents. According to recent HUD estimates, section 8 \ncontracts affecting approximately 35,000 project-based assisted units \nwill expire in fiscal year 1997. Of this amount, about 12,000 are \nassisted by HUD's section 8 new construction and substantial \nrehabilitation [NC/SR] programs. The program expects HUD to focus most \nof its mortgage restructuring efforts on the NC/SR assisted, or newer \nassisted portfolio since the costs of section 8 rental assistance \nattached to these properties are much greater than those assisted by \nHUD's section 8 loan management set aside [LMSA] program and the \nbudgetary costs to maintain this inventory is greater. Therefore, the \nconference believes that greater budgetary savings will be realized on \nrestructuring the newer assisted stock.\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\n  Further, unlike rents on the newer assisted stock, section 8 contract \nrents on the older assisted stock are regulated on a budget-based \nprocess. As such, the rents are supposed to be set already at the \nminimum level necessary to meet operating and debt service expenses. \nContract rents on the newer assisted stock also are higher than \nprevailing market rates due to the initial construction costs and \nautomatic rent increases that have been provided during the term of the \nassistance contract regardless of operating needs. Finally, \nrestructuring the debt on the older assisted portfolio would likely \nachieve only minimal section 8 subsidy savings since the UPB on the \nremaining mortgage is smaller than the UPB on the newer stock. For \nexample, older assisted properties have an average UPB of $14,000 per \nunit compared to an average UPB of $35,000 per unit for newer assisted \nproperties. Therefore, focusing on the older assisted properties for \ndebt restructuring likely would not necessarily be cost-beneficial \nespecially when considering the time and transaction costs of such a \nprocess.\n  The conference bill also requires at least 75 percent of mortgages be \nrestructured with FHA insurance. It is my belief that FHA mortgage \ninsurance and other forms of credit enhancement are necessary for debt \nfinancing considering the short terms of section 8 contract renewals \nthat are being provided in recent appropriation acts. Without long-term \nsection 8 contracts, debt financing likely is to be difficult for \nrestructured projects. If no insurance is provided when mortgages are \nrestructured, debt restructuring costs also will be likely be higher, \nor mortgage debt discount deeper, than if the mortgages were \nrestructured with insurance because private lenders would set the terms \nof the loans to reflect the risk of default. These projects could not \nhave been built or financed without the original FHA mortgage insurance \ndue to the inherent risks in developing low-income housing and the \nareas that these projects were built in.\n\n  Nevertheless, I emphasize that the use of FHA mortgage insurance and \nother forms of credit enhancement should be explored carefully to \nminimize the default risk to the Federal Government. In some cases, \nmortgage insurance may not be necessary when owners can obtain \nreasonable financing without insurance. As a result, the demonstration \nprogram allows some discretion in exploring and creating new forms of \ncredit enhancement that would reduce the default risk and credit \nsubsidy costs to the Federal Government. The demonstration also \nincludes the use of mortgage insurance under risk-sharing arrangements \ncurrently practiced under the mortgage risk-sharing programs enacted \nunder the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Mortgage \ninsurance under these risk-sharing arrangements would be encouraged by \nnot applying the current statutory limitations on the number of units \nthat can be made available for mortgage insurance under this program.\n  There is also concern about the Department's plans to sell its \nbenefits and burdens, including rights and obligations, under the FHA \nmortgage insurance program to public agencies as well as private \nentities. The demonstration permits HUD to sell to private entities the \nbenefits and burdens of FHA multifamily mortgage insurance on up to \n5,000 units. While it is important to test various restructuring \nstrategies under the demonstration, the Department needs to ensure that \nthe housing be preserved as low income, with residents and owners not \ndisplaced because of any risks associated with this mortgage \nrefinancing strategy.\n  The demonstration also allows HUD to test the use of vouchers on up \nto 10 percent of the units in the demonstration so long as the owner \nagrees and the residents are consulted. As a further protection for \nresidents, this strategy may only be implemented where it is determined \nthat residents will be able to use successfully vouchers to obtain \ndecent, safe, and sanitary housing.\n  Finally, this demonstration is an interim step to a more \ncomprehensive long-term solution to the preservation of section 8 \nassisted housing. It is expected that the authorizing committee, \nconsistent with hearings held by both the House and Senate authorizing \ncommittess, will consider reform of the section 8 mark-to-market \ninventory a priority for legislation during the next Congress.\n\n\n                      mark-to-market demonstration\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bond for \naddressing the expiration of thousands of section 8 housing assistance \ncontracts by including a FHA multifamily demonstration program in the \nVA-HUD appropriations bill. This demonstration program incorporates \nmany of the major principles of S. 2042, the Multifamily Assisted \nHousing Reform and Affordability Act of 1996, which I introduced last \nmonth along with Senators Bond, D'Amato, and Bennett. However, the \nsuccess of the demonstration program depends on HUD's implementation. I \nwould like to ask Senator Bond a few questions to clarify the intent of \nthe legislation.\n  First, the demonstration program would allow the Secretary to use \nnonprofit entities as ``designees'' to carry out the functions and \nresponsibilities of portfolio restructuring. Athough I believe that \nthere are legitimate and qualified nonprofits who could be used as \nrestructuring entities, I am concerned about the use of nonprofits that \ndo not have the support of the local community or residents. How does \nthe demonstration program address ``sham'' nonprofits?\n  Mr. BOND. I share the Senator's concern and believe that the \ndemonstration authority does address ``sham'' nonprofits. Specifically, \nthe demonstration requires the Secretary to select only these entities \nthat have a long-term record of service in providing low-income housing \nand meet standards of fiscal responsibility. I expect HUD to issue \ndetailed guidelines on what would constitute a qualified ``designee'' \nwhether it is a nonprofit or public entity.\n  Mr. MACK. My second concern is about the Department's capacity to \nrestructure up to 50,000 units in the demonstration program. Numerous \nstudies by the HUD IG and GAO and statements by HUD officials \nthemselves have indicated that there are serious capacity problems in \nthe multifamily housing area at HUD. HUD's response to these problems \nis to liquidate the inventory through sales of HUD-held and guaranteed \nmortgages to Wall Street investors. S. 2042, however, would protect the \nFederal Government's affordable housing investment by transferring the \nportfolio management responsibilities to publicly accountable entities \nsuch as State and local housing finance agencies. How does the \ndemonstration program address these issues?\n  Mr. BOND. The demonstration program is significantly based on S. \n2042. Like S. 2042, the demonstration program addresses the \nDepartment's capacity constraints by requiring HUD to form arrangements \nwith qualified third party public entities. The demonstration program \nassumes that the participation of public entities such as State and \nlocal housing finance agencies will be encouraged and utilized to the \nfullest extent possible by HUD. In response to the Senator's concern \nabout HUD's liquidation policy, the demonstration does allow HUD to \ntransfer or sell up to 5,000 units of HUD mortgages to private sector \nparties. This provision is not intended to be used as means of \nliquidating the housing stock. Instead, the intent is to test the \nefficiency and effectiveness of using private sector entities to \npreserve the affordable housing stock at the lowest possible cost to \nthe American taxpayer while recognizing the impact on communities and \nowners.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you again for your work and dedication to this issue \nand for considering the views of the authorizing committee in the \ndemonstration program.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's support and work on this issue, \nand I look forward to our continued cooperative effort to develop a \ncomprehensive portfolio restructuring program early next year.\n\n\n                      Section 8 Contract Renewals\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I have a question for the chairman Senator Bond. I \ncongratulate him for tackling the difficult problem of renewal of \nsection 8 contracts in a comprehensive manner, providing for renewal of \nall contracts with rents less than 120 percent of fair market rent at \nthe existing contract rent and permitting FHA-insured projects with \nrents\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\nover 120 percent of fair market rents either to accept rents at 120 \npercent of fair market rents, or to enter the demonstration. The \nSenator also permits projects financed or insured by State or local \nagencies, or under section 202, 811, and 515, to be renewed at current \nrents. However, there is an omission, with regard to conventionally \nfinanced contracts with rents over 120 percent of fair market rent, \nwhich are not explicitly covered by the legislation.\n  Many of these projects, including some in New Hampshire, were \ndeveloped in the early years of section 8, and I assume that the \nconferees did not intend to exclude them.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. Under present law, namely section \n405(a) of the Balanced Budget Down Payments Act I, HUD has the \nauthority to renew conventionally-financed section 8 contracts at up to \n120 percent of fair market rents. Indeed, in August HUD sent out a \nmemorandum stating that it would renew such contracts at rents not in \nexcess of 120 percent of Fair Market Rent. Nothing in this year's \nappropriations bill withdraws HUD's authority under section 405(a) to \nrenew such contracts. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the legal opinion by Judge Diaz, the General Counsel for HUD, \nwhich confirms this analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. Department of Housing and\n\n\n                                            Urban Development,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.\n     Memorandum to: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for \n         Housing--FEA Commissioner.\n     From: Nelson A. Diaz, General Counsel.\n     Subject: Expiring project-based section 8 contracts on \n         noninsured multifamily housing projects.\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for an \n     opinion from the Office of General Counsel (OGC) regarding \n     the legal authority to renew expiring project-based section 8 \n     contracts on noninsured multifamily projects which have rents \n     greater than 120% of the fair market rent.\n       Under Section 408(a) of the Balanced Budget Downpayment Act \n     I, HUD has the authority to renew conventionally-financed \n     section 9 contracts at up to 120% of the fair market rents. \n     This position was set forth in HUD Notice H 96-74, entitled \n     Project-Based section 8 Contracts Expiring in Fiscal Year \n     1997, issued on August 28, 1996. As it is currently composed \n     in the draft before us on September 23, 1996, it is OGC's \n     opinion that nothing in this year's proposed appropriation \n     bill withdraws HUD's authority under 405(a) to enter into \n     project-based maintenance contracts on those non-FHA insured \n     projects whose expiring contract rents exceed 120% of the \n     fair market rents for the market area in which the projects \n     are located.\n\n\n                            section 8 rents\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am concerned that this legislation \ndoes not adequately address the circumstances faced by certain unique \nproperties. Specifically, I am worried about situations where the \ncurrent section 8 rents exceed the fair market rents set by HUD by more \nthan 120 percent, but are below the comparable market rents. If HUD \ncannot renew these contracts at current rents, the low and moderate-\nincome residents of these properties may quickly find themselves \nwithout a decent place to live, especially in tight housing market such \nas we have in northern New Jersey. In this situation, I fear that an \nowner may have little choice other than to terminate the leases and \nrent the property to people who are willing to pay the real market \nrent. I do not believe that we have provided any sort of inducement for \nthe owner of this type of property to continue to house low and \nmoderate income people, many of whom may be elderly. Sticky vouchers \nwould have been a very good solution to this problem. However, I have \nbeen advised by staff that the budget-based rent provisions under the \ndemonstration address my concerns. I would like to be assured that this \nis, in fact, the case.\n  Mr. BOND. I would like to assure my colleague that the budget-based \nrent provisions can be used to address the concerns you raise. Under \nthe budget-based rent provisions, the owner of unique property located \nin a tight housing market which houses elderly families and where the \nmarket rates are greater than the current contract rents and the rents \nare in excess of 120 percent of the FMR, could be provided with a \ncontract renewal at the current contract rent level for 1 year. Also, \nCongress should look at the use of sticky vouchers in the future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBURG. So the budget-based rent provision is not limited to \nproperties where the operating costs exceed comparable market rents?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. Properties where the operating costs \nexceed the comparable market rents are eligible for the budget-based \nrent provisions, but eligibility for budget-based rents is not limited \nto such properties. I emphasize that the mark-to-market demonstration \nis designed to ensure that HUD is particularly sensitive to the need to \npreserve existing low-income housing for the elderly and disabled.\n  Mr. LAUTENBURG. What would induce an owner of the type of property I \ndescribed to continue to keep the property as an affordable housing \nresource?\n  Mr. BOND. The owner could be induced to continue to keep the property \nas an affordable housing resource by allowing the owner an adequate \nreturn on equity.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would the calculation of an adequate return on equity \ntake into account the true market value of the property in unique \ncircumstances such as the one I have described?\n  Mr. BOND. The Secretary would have the discretion to determine an \nadequate return on equity in this way if he so chose.\n\n\n                   section 8 housing for the elderly\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I am very concerned that in Nebraska and its neighboring \nStates, section 8 projects for the elderly will be disadvantaged under \nthe language in the conference report, unless a special effort is made \nto preserve them. Fair market rents in these areas for zero and 1-\nbedroom apartments are low which cause high rents necessary to sustain \nsection 8 projects with appropriate services for the elderly. These \nprojects often have elevators, additional facilities for food, \nrecreation and services, and extra management services such as 24-hour-\nin-house staff. They are above the 120 percent of FMR threshold for \nrenewal at current rents. In order to bring these project rents down to \nFMR, all or most of the debt services would have to be eliminated. Debt \nreduction of this magnitude would most certainly give rise to \nsignificant tax liabilities. Is it your intent that debt restructuring \noccur?\n  Mr. BOND. The legislation is intended to preserve section 8 housing \nfor the elderly and special populations. While debt restructuring may \nbe unnecessary in most cases, it may be advantageous in some. \nTherefore, the chairman's intent is for HUD to review carefully each \ncase and limit the use of debt restructuring to those rare cases where \nit is most advantageous. Furthermore, in any calculation HUD uses in \ndetermining the market rent for these projects, HUD must include \ncompensation to cover services that meet the unique needs of the \nelderly and special populations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask that the chairman clarify his intentions on \nthe limitations placed on HUD when considering debt restructuring.\n  Mr. BOND. HUD is instructed to use a three-pronged approach in \ndetermining whether the debt should be restructured. First, no tenants \nshould be displaced. Second, the owners should not be forced to sell \nthe project. Third, owners should not be subject to significant tax \nliability.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the chairman and look forward to assisting in the \noversight of the implementation of these legislative provisions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would also like to thank the chairman. It is \nincreasingly important that we preserve these projects for the elderly, \nespecially in rural areas.\n\n\n                      section 8 contract renewals\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Senator Cohen and I have been working \nextensively with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \nand the Maine State Housing Authority to clarify the status and \nhandling of contracts for 17 housing projects in Maine that were \noriginally subsidized under section 23 and were later converted to \nsection 8. We would like to confirm that these housing projects meet \nthe definition of ``project-based'' as defined under paragraph (5), \nsection 21 of the housing appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, of these housing projects, all of which \nreceive\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nproject-based assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, 14 are financed through the Maine State Housing Authority. \nNone of them are FHA-insured. We would like to further confirm our \nunderstanding that the project-based contracts for these particular \nhousing projects will be renewed for 1-year at the current rent level \nunder the terms and conditions of paragraph (2), section 211 of the \nhousing appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Maine is absolutely \nright.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bond, for incorporating report language \nclarifying that Congress does not intend for the Fair Housing Act to \napply to property insurance. HUD's assertion of authority over the \nconduct of the property insurance market overreaches, and in fact \ncontradicts, congressional intent as reflected in the plain language \nand legislative history of the Fair Housing Act.\n  HUD's attempt to regulate the business of insurance, notwithstanding \nthe lack of any reference to property insurance in the Fair Housing Act \nor its legislative history, also contradicts the statutory mandate of \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which requires that, unless a \nFederal law ``specifically relates to the business of insurance,'' that \nlaw shall not apply where it would ``invalidate, impair or supersede'' \nState law. HUD's assumption of authority to regulate property insurance \nhas the practical effect of invalidating, impairing and superseding the \nState laws which prohibit unfair discrimination by insurers, and it is \nthe type of duplicative regulation which Congress sought to avoid \nthrough McCarran-Ferguson.\n  We should not tolerate illegal discriminatory practices by anyone \ninvolved in the real estate market. However, every State provides \nrecourse for addressing complaints of unfair discrimination by \ninsurers. There is no need for HUD, which currently has difficulty \nmeeting its statutory mandates, to step into the shoes of State \nregulators to create a Federal regulatory regime without clear \njustification or authority.\n\n\n                     PROPERTY INSURANCE REGULATION\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I am \nfundamentally and adamantly opposed to discrimination in any form, \nincluding discrimination in the provision of property insurance. \nNevertheless, I believe that HUD has no authority under the Fair \nHousing Act to regulate the practices of the insurance industry, \nincluding practices related to the provision of property insurance. \nMoreover, HUD does not have the capacity or ability to address \ndiscrimination issues in the practices of the insurance industry, and \nany attempts to establish and enforce standards are likely to result in \nconfusion and questionable actions.\n  The purpose of both the Senate and House committee reports to the VA/\nHUD fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill is to ask HUD to focus its \nfair housing resources of $30 million toward activities designed to \nfight discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.\n  These are limited resources and the committee report language in both \nHouse and Senate reports is designed to ensure that this funding is \nused in a comprehensive and focused manner to fight housing \ndiscrimination.\n  Furthermore, while the courts have not always been consistent in the \napplication of the Fair Housing Act, I believe Congress has made it \nclear that the regulation of property insurance is outside the scope of \nthe Fair Housing Act and is contrary to the intent of the MacCarran-\nFerguson Act which states that the responsibility for insurance \nmatters, including property insurance, is the responsibility of the \nStates. The Fair Housing Act says nothing about Federal action with \nregard to discrimination in the provision of property insurance.\n  In fact, the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act indicates \nthat the Fair Housing Act does not apply to insurance. Notably, in the \nSenate floor debate on the 1980 amendments to the Fair Housing Act, \nSenator Heflin stated that it was * * *\n\n       * * *the decision of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, \n     acquiesced in by the full Senate Judiciary Committee, to \n     leave the regulation and oversight of the property insurance \n     business to the States and to reject extension of [the Fair \n     Housing Act] to that business.\n\n  HUD's property insurance activities are wholly unwarranted. Every \nState and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations addressing \nunfair discrimination in property insurance. We need to avoid \nduplication of effort and also avoid the risk of creating new and \ndifferent standards that will be confusing and administratively \nburdensome. The House and Senate reports to the VA/HUD fiscal year 1997 \nAppropriations Act are identical on the issue of fair housing and \nproperty insurance, and are designed to state the understanding of the \nHouse and Senate that HUD should not intrude upon the responsibilities \nof the States with regard to the regulation of insurance, including \nproperty insurance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on September 5, 1996, several senators \nexpressed concern about language regarding property insurance \nactivities by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity \ncontained in the committee report accompanying the VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriation bill.\n  For some time now, HUD has claimed it has jurisdiction under the Fair \nHousing Act to investigate complaints about alleged insurance redlining \npractices. Statements have been made that the committee report language \nis an effort to somehow exempt the insurance industry from civil rights \nenforcement. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not about \ncivil rights. It is about regulation.\n  Congress never intended to apply the Fair Housing Act to property \ninsurance for the simple reason that the insurance industry is subject \nto State regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. It is for this \nreason that the Congress chose specifically not to include the sale or \nunderwriting of insurance under the Fair Housing Act.\n  HUD's enforcement and regulatory activities regarding property \ninsurance is clearly a waste of resources because it duplicates State \nlaws and regulations. Virtually every State and the District of \nColumbia have laws or regulations governing unfair discriminatory \npractices by insurance companies. States are actively investigating and \naddressing discrimination where it is found to occur. HUD is just \nadding another wasteful and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.\n  Congress faces many hard choices in working to fulfill its commitment \nto eliminate unnecessary Federal spending and red tape. With respect to \nHUD, Congress must determine how to preserve essential programs while \ncreating a more efficient Federal Government and reduce the budget \ndeficit. If there is one area of Federal spending where Congress need \nnot struggle to determine whether cutbacks are appropriate, it is HUD's \nactivities regarding property insurance.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about HUD's \nattempts over the past few years to regulate property insurance under \nthe Fair Housing Act. Let me state for the record that I am committed \nto strict enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and its prohibitions \nagainst discrimination in housing.\n  The Fair Housing Act is one of the basic tenets of our country's \ncivil rights laws. Where outright discrimination in housing is found, \nenforcement must be swift and strong.\n  However, my concerns stem from two issues. First, HUD lacks the \nauthority to regulate property insurance. Second, regulation of \nproperty insurance is already being done by the States.\n  The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful ``to discriminate against any \nperson in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \nhome . . . Because of race.'' The language goes on to refer to the \nservices provided by mortgage bankers and real estate brokers. Nowhere \nin the language does the act refer to property insurance. The Fair \nHousing Act does not specifically relate to the business of insurance. \nCourts have held that Congress never intended the Fair Housing Act to \napply to insurance. HUD is clearly overstepping its authority by \npursuing any regulation in this area. In fact, it spent hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on outside legal help to write this regulation \nbecause the legal basis for doing so was so tenuous.\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\n  By pursuing this issue, HUD is assuming that States have not been \ndoing anything in this area. That assumption is wrong. All 50 States \nand the District of Columbia have enacted statutes or regulations, or \nboth, that address unfair discrimination in insurance practices, \nviolations of civil rights or which permit insurance departments to \ninvestigate unfair trade practices. I will submit for the record a \ncompilation of some of these State statutes or regulations governing \nunfair discrimination in insurance. States are active in investigating \ndiscrimination. There is strong protection against illegal \ndiscrimination. HUD's actions only add another unnecessary layer of \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  This is just another example of HUD trying to assert more Federal \npower and more Federal control in an area traditionally under the \ndomain of the States. HUD has shown, over the more than 30 years that \nthe department has been in existence, that it cannot perform well those \nprograms that are under its administration. What case can be made for \nHUD to take on yet another program. HUD is a failure. Regulation of \nproperty insurance is not within HUD's authority, and every effort \nshould be made to keep HUD out of this area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a representative sample of State \nstatutes or regulations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             STATE LAWS GOVERNING UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION IN INSURANCE                            \n   [Below is a compilation of laws and regulations in the 50 states and the District of Columbia which address  \n unfair discrimination in insurance practices, violations of civil rights, or which permit insurance departments\n   to investigate unfair trade practices.

Mr. President, during consideration of the VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill on September 5, 1996, several \nof my colleagues made statements about language contained in the report \naccompanying the bill that directs HUD to expend the limited funds \navailable for the Fair Housing Initiative Program [FHIP] only on such \nforms of discrimination as are explicitly identified under title VIII \nof the Civil Rights Act.\n  The Fair Housing Act makes no mention of property insurance. A \nreading of the legislative history of the act will disclose that \nCongress intentionally left out property insurance because insurance is \na State regulated activity. Since the States regulate property \ninsurance and have laws and regulations addressing unfair \ndiscrimination in property insurance, it was our conclusion that this \nis one area where HUD does not need to expend its resources.\n  Moreover, the report language was included in response to testimony \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development stating it had \nlimited resources available for the FHIP Program. It was our thought \nthat HUD should use its limited resources to address only those areas \nspecifically mentioned in the law that include the sale, rental, and \nfinancing of housing and in the provision of brokerage services.\n  Throughout all of its efforts and funding of outside groups to \ninvestigate insurance practices, it is interesting that neither HUD nor \nthe private groups it funds with public money have been able to produce \none individual who has failed to purchase a home because insurance was \ndenied to that person. So much for ``no insurance, no loan, no house.''\n  In a statement released September 11, 1995, Max Boozell, the Illinois \ndirector of insurance, stated,\n\n       I am very disturbed by the contention that major homeowner \n     insurance companies are redlining in Chicago. To the \n     contrary, our 1994 study of homeowners insurance not only \n     reflects a healthy, viable urban insurance market in \n     Illinois, but provides no hard evidence of institutional \n     redlining by any Illinois insurer.\n\n  Nor is this a civil rights debate as many would have us believe. \nActivities of the Justice Department under the Fair Housing Act have \nnot been curtailed, nor does the inclusion of this report language \nimpact the application to property insurance practices of section 1981 \nof the U.S. Code, which prohibits racial discrimination in the \nprovision of insurance and other services under contract.\n  Nowhere in the Fair Housing Act is property insurance mentioned. More \nthan 50 years ago, Congress wisely decided that, in the area of \ninsurance regulation, the States should be spared Federal interference. \nUnder the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, Congress explicitly provided \nthat, unless a Federal law ``specifically relates to the business of \ninsurance,'' that law shall not be deemed applicable to insurance \npractices. By applying the Fair Housing Act to insurance, HUD simply \ndisregards the fact that the law does not ``specifically relate to the \nbusiness of insurance.''\n  Mr. President, the courts are divided on this issue. It was \ndisappointing that the Supreme Court failed to grant certiorari in the \ncase of Nationwide Mutual versus Cisneros. The Court could have \nresolved the conflict that now exists in 2 circuits out of our 13 \nFederal circuit courts. The two courts that have found that the Fair \nHousing Act applies to property insurance practices have relied on \nHUD's regulations, which, without any statutory authority, refer to \ndiscrimination in property insurance. In other words, HUD did not have \na law, so the bureaucrats got to work and created one through \nregulations.\n  There is simply no justification for HUD continuing to expend funds \nfor insurance regulatory activities that duplicate comprehensive State \nregulation at the expense of the American taxpayer. HUD would do better \nto work within the framework of the law with its limited resources.\n\n\n             OFFICE OF FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 3666, the VA/\nHUD Fiscal Year 1997 Appropriations Act, included an amendment by \nSenator Bennett, that requires GAO to audit the operations of the \nOffice of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight [OFHEO] concerning staff \norganization, expertise, capacity, and contracting authority to ensure \nthat the resources are adequate and that they are being used \nappropriately to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are adequately \ncapitalized and operating safely. As Senator Bennett previously \nadvised, OFHEO is over 2 years behind in developing risk-based capital \nstandards which are intended to ensure the financial safety and \nsoundness of these Government-sponsored entities. Senator Bennett \nfurther advised that OFHEO needs to refocus its activities, away from \nsuch activities as trips abroad, to ensure that these critically needed \nrisk-based capital standards are developed and operative.\n  I also am very concerned over OFHEO's lapse in its responsibility for \nthe timely development of these risk-based capital standards, and I \nurge OFHEO to expedite these necessary rulemaking requirements. I also \nadvise that the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 \nestablished OFHEO as an independent office in HUD and not as a new \nFederal agency. Nevertheless, in a time of Government downsizing, OFHEO \ncontinues to request additional staff and funding, while focusing on \nactivities other than its primary responsibility to promulgate \nfinancial safety and soundness rules.\n  The 1992 housing bill, which I worked on, intended OFHEO, as a \npractical matter, to be a tripwire to alert Congress and the Nation to \nany significant financial risks that may be confronting Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. This is a critically important function and OFHEO's \nprimary function--I do not think that anyone intends or expects OFHEO \nto become a new agency or act as a political entity. I expect the GAO \naudit to lend some perspective to OFHEO's purpose, its ability to \nperform its purpose, and recommend ways to streamline and ensure \nOFHEO's capacity and expertise will meet its rulemaking and regulatory \nfunctions.\n\n\n                 drinking water health effects research\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, since completion of the VA-HUD conference, \nsome confusion has arisen as to funding of drinking water health \neffects research. First, let me state unequivocally that I strongly \nsupport funding for drinking water health effects research to ensure \nthat rules governing drinking water quality are based on the best \nscience and result in cost-effective protection of public health. As a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I advocated \namending the Safe Drinking Water Act to change the standard setting \nprocess and improve the scientific basis for regulations.\n  As chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have worked to fund fully the new State revolving fund \nprogram for the construction of drinking water plants. The conference \nreport before us includes $1.275 billion--$550 million as requested by \nthe President, and\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\nan additional $725 million to restore funds previously appropriated for \nthis program but released last month for clean water SRF's.\n  Unfortunately, delays in enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act \namendments precluded in VA-HUD subcommittee's consideration of the many \nadditional funding requirements associated with implementation of this \nlegislation.\n  However, the conference agreement acknowledges that the new \nlegislation will require resources, and states ``the conferees expect \nEPA to address any funding requirements for implementation of [this] \nimportant statute, such as drinking water health effects research, in \nthe agency's operating plan.''\n  Funding for drinking water health effects research--outside of the \namounts included in the science and technology account--was not in \neither House or Senate version of the VA-HUD bill, and hence was not an \nissue in conference. While I object to off-the-top setasides from State \nrevolving funds, I fully support funding for health effects research \nfrom the science and technology account, which funds all of EPA's \nresearch activities. Should EPA propose to increase the relative \npriority for health effects research as part of its operating plan, and \nrequest additional funding for such research within the $542 million \nappropriated for science and technology, it is my expectation that this \nwould be favorably received.\n  In conclusion, I encourage EPA to consider carefully the funding \nrequirements associated with this new legislation, and propose a \nredirection of funds for these important activities within the $6.7 \nbillion fiscal year 1997 appropriation.\n\n\n                coordinated tribal water quality program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the subcommittee for its \nhard and diligent work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate the \nearmark of $500,000 for the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality Program \nfor fiscal year 1997.\n  This program began in 1990 when the 26 tribes and tribal \norganizations in Washington State came together with a cooperative \nintergovernmental strategy to accomplish national clean water goals. As \na result of Federal court decisions, the State of Washington has \nrecognized the tribes as comanagers of water quality in the State. This \nprogram has been an effective tool for leveraging scarce public funds \nto create viable, watershed-based water quality protection plans.\n  It is my understanding that the $500,000 earmark in the committee \nreport is not intended to preclude the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality \nProgram from receiving the needed additional $2 million from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's existing funds under section 104(b)3 \nof the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is correct. The \nearmark is intended to be a floor from which the EPA may supplement the \nCoordinated Tribal Water Quality Program. The additional funding will \nallow the tribes to fulfill their roles as comanagers of water quality \nin Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the distinguished Chairman for this \nclarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the previous order, the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 3666, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, having \nbeen received, the conference report is agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider is tabled.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, passage of the Family and Medical Leave \nAct in 1993 was a true landmark for America's families. For the first \ntime, millions of working men and women were freed from the threat of \njob loss if they needed time off for the birth of a child or to care \nfor a sick family member.\n  The act has worked well--for employees and for their employers. \nEmployees are now able to take a leave of absence to be with their \nchildren or with a sick relative at a crucial time for the family, so \nthat they can provide the special care and compassion which are the \nglue that binds a family together. In the 3 years since its enactment, \nit has already helped millions of American families.\n  For seriously ill children it is particularly important. Having the \nemotional support of close family members can be a crucial element in \ntheir recovery. Allowing a parent the time to be with his or her child \nunder these circumstances can truly make a difference.\n  The impact on employers has been negligible. A research survey \ncommissioned by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 93 percent of \nbusinesses incurred little or no additional cost due to the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. There was no noticeable effect on productivity, \nprofitability, and growth resulting from the new law, according to 87 \npercent of the businesses surveyed.\n  In light of these facts, it is particularly shocking that Bob Dole \nwould attack the Family and Medical Leave Act as he did the other day. \nHe criticized the Family and Medical Leave Act as an example of ``the \nlong arm of the Federal Government'' interfering with the rights of \nbusiness owners. As he stated, ``My view is, why should the Federal \nGovernment be getting into family leave? * * * the Federal Government \nought to be out of it.''\n  Bob Dole is wrong about family and medical leave and many other \nissues. In more and more American homes today, both parents must have \njobs in order to support their families. A substantial majority of \nchildren live in families where neither parent is at home during the \nday because of their jobs. If we value families--if we are serious \nabout helping parents meet the needs of their children--then family \nmedical leave is essential. Family members must be allowed time off \nfrom work to care for a newborn infant, to nurse a sick child back to \nhealth, or to be with a sick parent or spouse in a time of medical \ncrisis.\n  The price of meeting these family responsibilities should not be \nlosing your job. That is why family and medical leave is essential. Bob \nDole may not understand this, but American people, by an overwhelming \nmajority, do understand it.\n  The current law has made a dramatic difference for working families. \nBut, it does not address another very important issue for such \nfamilies--the need for a brief break in the workday to meet the more \nroutine, but still very important, demands of raising children. At a \ntime when more children than ever are growing up in one parent homes or \nin families where both parents work outside the home, this flexibility \nis becoming more and more essential.\n  Every working parent has experienced the strain of being torn between \nthe demands of their job and the needs of their children. Taking a \nchild to the pediatrician, meeting with a teacher to discuss a problem \nat school, accompanying a child to a school event, watching a child \nperform in a special recital or in the big game--all of these often \nrequire time off from work. No parent should have to choose between \nalienating the boss and neglecting the child.\n  Many employers understand this, and allow their workers to take time \nfor family responsibilities. But many other companies refuse to \naccommodate their workers in this way. The ability of parents to meet \nthese family obligations should not be dependent on the whim of their \nemployer. In a society that genuinely values families, it should be a \nmatter of right.\n  Under proposed Democratic amendments to the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, working parents would be entitled to 4 hours of unpaid leave a \nmonth, up to a total of 24 hours of leave a year, to participate in \ntheir child's school and community activities or to take that child to \nthe doctor.\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n Employers would have to receive at least 7 days advance notice of each \nabsence, so that employers will have ample opportunity to arrange work \nschedules around the brief absence of the employee.\n  Clearly, this legislation is needed. A recent survey of 30,000 PTA \nleaders found that 89 percent of parents cannot be as involved in their \nchildren's education as they would like because of job demands. A \nRadcliffe Public Policy Institute study completed last year found that \nthe total time that parents spend with their children has dropped by a \nthird in the past 30 years. This disturbing trend must be reversed.\n  Greater involvement of parents in their children's education can make \na vital difference in their learning experience. A big part of that \ninvolvement is more regular contact between parent and teacher, and \nmore regular participation by parents in their children's school \nactivities.\n  Many of those meetings and activities are scheduled during the \nworkday. As a result, millions of parents are unable to participate \nbecause their employers refuse to allow time off. Permitting a modest \nadjustment in a parent's workday can greatly enrich a child's \nschoolday. All children will benefit from this kind of parental support \nand encouragement, and so will the country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11225-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11226-S11227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WIFE AND CHILD ABUSERS CAN STILL OWN GUNS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 12, the U.S. Senate, by a \nvote of 97 to 2, approved an amendment that I sponsored to ban wife \nbeaters and child abusers from having guns. Last night, I learned \nsomething about this place that shocks me, and I am here now for 14 \nyears. I learned that even a mandate, voted on 97 to 2, can be \ndispensed with by a wink of the eye and a nod of the head, with the \nRifle Association looking over Members' shoulders. I was told last \nnight that, behind closed doors, the Republican leadership has decided \nto entirely gut this legislation and say that someone who beats his \nwife and beats his child ought to be able to own a gun. In other words, \nthe gun is more valuable than the life that may be in jeopardy.\n  According to the information I received, the continuing resolution \nnow will contain language that seems to have been drafted directly by \nthe National Rifle Association. This new language would allow child \nabusers to have guns. It also lets off the hook all wife beaters who \nare convicted in a bench trial, that is, as opposed to a jury trial, \njust a judge sitting there. And it contains special notification \nrequirements that will allow many wife beaters to hold on to their \nguns, and that will say to these wife beaters: For you, unlike for \neveryone else in our society, ignorance of the law is an appropriate \nexcuse.\n\n  Mr. President, perhaps it is obvious, but I am absolutely outraged by \nthis proposal, and I hope Americans across our Nation will be outraged, \nparticularly those who have a sister, a mother, a daughter, those who \ncare about what happens with women in our society. It represents a \ncomplete cave-in to the most radical fringe of the gun lobby. It will \njeopardize the lives of thousands of battered women and children around \nour Nation.\n  I am especially outraged because the language approved by the Senate \nhad won such broad, bipartisan support. Among those who approved this \nlegislation were Senator Craig, Senator Lott, the distinguished \nmajority leader, and Senator Hutchison from Texas. They all agreed to \nthis. That is why my amendment passed this body by a vote of 97 to 2.\n  Unfortunately, the gun lobby is now intruding in the legislative \nprocess and emasculating this legislation. The NRA language, apparently \nbeing placed in the CR, would completely gut the protections in our \namendment. It would put guns directly in the hands of people who have \nbeaten their wives or abused their kids. The end result, without any \nquestion, would be more shootings, more injuries, and more death.\n  Mr. President, this new language has several flaws, and I want to \ntake a moment to explain them. First of all, this amendment would \ncompletely exempt child abusers from the ban on firearm possession. OK, \nyou can beat your kid, you can still have your gun. Is that the kind of \nsociety that we want? I don't think so.\n  As I have explained, my proposal, as approved by the Senate, applies \nboth to those who abuse their spouses and those who abuse their \nchildren. The new language in the Republican bill stands for the \nproposition that child abusers may continue to possess their guns.\n  Mr. President, that is absurd, it is outrageous, infuriating, and it \nis an insult to women in our society. It is an insult to men who think \npositively about the females in their lives. If someone assaults his \nown child and is convicted for it, that abuser, in my legislation, has \nsacrificed any claim to a gun. That is the way I think it ought to be, \nand 97 Senators agreed with me. That was the second vote, by the way, \non my legislation. One time it was unanimous, by a voice vote, with not \none objection. More importantly, the child needs protection, and he or \nshe deserves it.\n  If we can't protect the most vulnerable among us, our abused \nchildren, what does that say about us? What does it say about this \ncowardly Congress? What does it say about the power the National Rifle \nAssociation has over our entire society?\n  Mr. President, excluding child abusers from this ban would be reason \nenough to defeat this amendment. But there is more. This amendment \nwould also allow many wife beaters to continue to possess firearms. The \namendment would entirely exempt from the ban anyone who has been \nconvicted in a trial that was heard solely by a judge. Only convictions \nfrom a jury trial would be subject to this watered-down ban.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that many wife abusers in my State of \nNew Jersey are convicted in a bench trial. They are brought before the \njudge and he renders a verdict. These convictions are entirely valid. \nThey can send someone to jail or declare it a misdemeanor. There is no \nbasis for excluding those charged and convicted by a judge--excluding \nthem from the prohibition.\n\n  Mr. President, States vary considerably with respect to the types of \ncrimes for which a jury trial is required. In some States, jury trials \nare used in most domestic violence cases. But in others, judges handle \nmany of these cases.\n  So the effect of this amendment would be to exclude from the ban a \nlarge number of wife beaters, who happen to beat their wives in a State \nthat has a bench trial rather than a jury trial. These wife beaters may \nhave been just as violent as those in other States, where other abusers \nwould be tried by a jury. But under this new language, these wife \nbeaters would have a special exemption. They would be off the hook. \n``Aha, you didn't try me by a jury, so I want my gun while I beat my \nwife.'' Meanwhile, the wives and kids will remain unprotected from gun \nviolence and, for some, that will mean, very simply, they are going to \ndie. The difference often between the beating and a murder is the \npresence of a gun. Mr. President, it is wrong.\n  It is time to establish a very clear rule. If you are convicted of \nbeating your wife or your child, you lose your gun. If you are \nconvicted of abusing your child, you lose your gun, no ifs, ands, or \nbuts.\n  Mr. President, another problematic provision in the new CR language--\nthe continuing resolution is going to determine how we finance most of \nGovernment, and I want everybody to understand that, starting with the \nfiscal year, October 1. That is how we are going to finance Government. \nIn that is this language that gives special exemption to wife beaters. \nThe new language says to wife beaters: We are going to create a special \nexemption for you if you have been convicted by a judge.\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\n  In general, as most Americans know, ignorance of the law is no \nexcuse. But, here, there is another out for the wife beater. For some \nreason or other, under this amendment, wife beaters would not be \nsubjected to this rule. This amendment says that a wife beater must \nexplicitly be given notice of the firearm ban at the time he is charged \nor notified of the complaint. Otherwise, if the notice is not given at \nthe time of complaint or charging, the wife beater will be entirely \nfree to have the gun. In other words, ``Aha, I wasn't told that if I \nbeat my wife, I might lose my gun, so therefore, it is my gun and my \nwife, and if I want to beat her, I will beat her.'' That is what they \nare saying.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am all for telling wife beaters they can't have \na gun at any time. That is the best way, and it ought to be. It should \nnot be a prerequisite for a ban. After all, it is not a prerequisite \nfor anyone also. Felons are prohibited from having guns, regardless of \nwhether they have ever been officially given notice. For them, \nignorance of the law is no excuse. But under this amendment, it would \nbe an excuse for a wife beater.\n  In fact, this amendment is constructed so poorly, that it would even \nallow wife beaters to get guns if they did get notice, if the notice \nwasn't at the time of the complaint or charging. In other words, if \nsomeone is only given notice about the ban when they're convicted, they \ncould still possess guns.\n  Another effect of this language, Mr. President, is that it would \ncompletely exempt from the ban anyone who beat their wife, and was \nconvicted, before the CR gets enacted, if they want to make it easy for \nthese wife beaters to escape. This means that huge numbers of battered \nwives and abused children will remain vulnerable to firearm violence.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the provision apparently to be \nincluded in the CR is not serious legislation even though Speaker \nGingrich said on a Sunday show that was witnessed by millions of \nAmericans when he said he would accept this proposition, this \nlegislation that I put forward. He promised he would do it. But once \nthe NRA got hold of him and pulled on his coat a little bit he said, \n``Well, OK. Maybe we will just water it down a little bit.'' The same \nthing happened on the floor of this body.\n  It's little more than a sham. It claims to establish a gun ban for \nthose committing domestic violence. But it's been drafted cleverly by \nthe gun lobby. And, not surprisingly, it's got loopholes large enough \nto drive a truck of wife beaters through.\n  Mr. President, the problems with this amendment go on and on. And \nthat's because this is not a serious amendment. It's a sham. It is a \ndodge. It is a shame.\n  It's a desperate attempt to let wife beaters and child abusers keep \ntheir guns. And nobody should be fooled into believing otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I know the NRA has a lot of power around here. We see \nit exhibited all the time--raw power. I do not know how many members \nthey have. It is estimated, as I understand it, at 3 million but they \nhave 260 million other Americans in the grip of their hands. But isn't \nthere some point at which we draw the line? Isn't their some point at \nwhich we draw the line? Isn't their some point where we say enough is \nenough? Isn't their some point where they want to protect their own \nwives, or their own children? Isn't there some point when we can stand \nbehind a 97 to 2 amendment approved in the U.S. Senate and say, ``Yes, \nwe meant it?'' Or did we say in some cases we meant it until we got \ninto the darkness of a closed room and then we made our deal, and in \nthe light before the public? Oh, no. We are good guys. We do not want \nthose wife beaters to have guns, those child abusers to have guns. But \nin the secret of a dark room they said ``Yes. The guy ought to have a \ngun. What the heck. He only beat his wife.'' If he beat the wife next \ndoor he would be in jail for 5 years; or, if he abused the child next \ndoor he would be in jail 5 years, or maybe in some States they want \nchild abusers to be in jail for life. But if it is your own kid, if it \nis your own wife, it is like that is chattel property, you know. Just \ndo as you please.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will keep something in mind when \nthey think about this provision. This is nothing short of a matter of \nlife and death.\n  Somewhere out there, there are thousands of battered wives and abused \nchildren. Thousands of innocent Americans who are virtually helpless \nagainst their abusers.\n  Mr. President, every year, there are about 2 million reported cases \nof domestic violence. Very few of them get prosecuted because they are \nconvinced or frightened by the abuser that it would be tough. He wants \nto be forgiven. In approximately 100,000 of these cases a gun is \ninvolved--some put this figure at 150,000. In other words, an argument \nensues, a gun is held, aimed and pointed to the head of the woman, and \nhe says, ``If you do not do this I am going to blow your head off.'' \nAnd the child witnessing that carries that trauma for life.\n  There is no question that the presence of a gun dramatically \nincreases the likelihood that domestic violence will escalate into \nmurder. According to one study, for example, in households with a \nhistory of battering, the presence of a gun increases the likelihood \nthat a woman will be killed threefold.\n  As Senator Wellstone put it so beautifully and succinctly on the \nfloor one day, all too often, the difference between a battered woman \nand a dead woman is the presence of a gun.\n  Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that for many women \nand children, we have their lives in our hands.\n  We can save their lives by enacting the Senate proposal, and keeping \nguns away from their abusers. Or we can cave in gutlessly to the NRA. \nAnd they will die. And they will be buried in their communities. But \nsome of the grief has to extend to this place.\n  Mr. President, my message is simple. Wife beaters should not have \nguns, and child abusers should not have guns. And I urge my colleagues \nto stand up for the victims of domestic violence, to reject this sham \nlegislation, and to enact meaningful law to keep guns away from wife \nbeaters and child abusers.\n  And if the NRA and their supporters insist on pushing a sham ban, I \nwant to put everyone on notice that I intend to fight this every step \nof the way with all the tools at my disposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the President's \nveto of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions.\n  The President should have signed this legislation and helped us ban \nthe shocking procedure known as partial-birth abortions. Instead, he \nignored the overwhelming evidence that compels the need for this \nlegislation to become law. I heard testimony on this matter from \ndoctors before the Judiciary Committee and without any doubt, the \navailability of this procedure is indefensible.\n  The former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, stated, and I quote, \n``In no way can I twist my mind to see that partial-birth --and then \ndestruction of the unborn child before the head is born--is a medical \nnecessity for the mother.''\n  Mr. President, one important issue that must be addressed here is the \nconstitutionality of the partial-birth abortion ban. I believe that \nbased on Supreme Court rulings in this area, the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act of 1995 would survive a constitutional challenge. In fact, in \nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania versus Casey the \nSupreme Court stated, ``The woman's liberty is not so unlimited * * * \nthat from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of \nthe unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's \ninterest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to \nterminate the pregnancy can be restricted.''\n  The Casey decision established the undue burden test with the \nthreshold question being whether the abortion-related statute imposes \nan undue burden on a mother's right to choose to have an abortion.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n1995\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\nwould survive constitutional challenge and would be subject to the \nrational basis scrutiny because it does not impose an undue burden on \nthe mother's right to choose to have an abortion. The legislation is \nconstitutionally sound, serves a legitimate governmental interest, and \nshould become law.\n  The House recently voted to override the President's veto of this \nimportant bill and we should join them when the Senate votes on \nThursday. I urge my colleagues to override the President's misguided \nveto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995.\n  I wish to thank the able Senator from North Dakota for allowing me to \nspeak at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak in morning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11227-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11228-S11229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this morning, as is often the \ncase, in the Senate we had a number of Senators come to the Senate \nfloor with a message that essentially the folks who sit on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle have not been very constructive in their \nlegislative approach, and the Republican legislators have been carrying \nthe issues that were important to the American people. They take on the \nPresident, and they take on the Democratic leader of the Senate. We \nhave to come to the floor occasionally to respond to these, and I do so \nagain today.\n  It is interesting. Today we were told that the Democratic leader of \nthe Senate, Senator Daschle, was wrong in his assessment of the 104th \nCongress. They said he didn't know what he was talking about with \nrespect to the 104th Congress. Why, this was a wonderful Congress. What \na productive Congress it was.\n  I would like to talk a little about that because at the first part of \nthis Congress I recall seeing someone stand on the other side of the \nfloor and offer a message to the American people, saying we ought to be \nashamed of the last 50 years; what an awful place this country has \nbecome--50 years downhill for America. Who caused it? The Democrats, of \ncourse, according to that speaker. I rose that day, and I said we must \nbe living in different countries.\n  Let me stand up and say I am proud of the last half century in this \ncountry. I am proud of what we have done. In fact, some of the same \npeople who tell us that this country has gone to hell in a handbasket, \nthey would say, are suggesting that we build a fence to keep immigrants \nout.\n  Why would someone suggest we need to build a fence around this \ncountry to keep people out if it is such an awful place? This country \nis a strong, resourceful, wonderful country that a lot of the people in \nthe rest of the world want to come to because it is a beacon of hope \nand opportunity.\n  The fact is this Congress is a very unusual Congress. At the start of \nthis Congress, Republicans were elected to control the House and the \nSenate. The American people made that choice, and I respect that \nchoice. But they came to town, elected a new Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, and they had a victory lap like peacocks in full \nmating season. It was almost like a coronation at the start of this \nCongress. And full of themselves, they proposed a range of issues. They \nsaid, look, the first thing let's do, let's invite the polluters into \nthe U.S. Capitol in something called project relief. We will tell those \ncorporations in America who are disadvantaged by the clean air and the \nclean water laws: Come in. Help us to rewrite the clean air and clean \nwater laws to make it a little easier for polluters. A couple hundred \nrepresentatives of industries that pollute in America were told by the \nmajority: We would like to make it easier for you.\n  Now, the background here is that in the last 20 years our country has \ndoubled its use of energy. But in 20 years, while we doubled the use of \nenergy, we also have cleaner air and cleaner water. Why would that be \nthe case? Because the American people decided and Congress responded to \nsay to those who are polluting: You must stop polluting, and if you do \nnot, there will be severe penalties. Regulations requiring clean air \nand clean water have cleaned up America's airshed and cleaned America's \nwaters--not perfect, but it is on the road to substantial improvement \neven though we have doubled our use of energy.\n  The majority party said, by the way, we will make available some \noffice space for you. You all come in and tell us how we can back away \nfrom clean air and clean water regulations. A significant calculation, \nbut that was just the tip of the iceberg. They seemed to think that \ntheir mandate was this country would want more pollution and less \neducation and more defense but less health care; proposals that said \nlet us provide a very significant tax break that will provide a $30,000 \ntax refund if you happen to be making $300,000 a year. Smile all the \nway to the bank. And in order to pay for that, we are going to tell \nlittle children in school: If you are a poor kid going to school, in \nthe middle of the day you no longer have entitlement to a hot lunch. Or \nsay to people who are disabled: We are going to make sure that you no \nlonger have an entitlement to health care if you are disabled.\n\n  You think that was not the case. It was. One hundred proposals in the \nfirst 100 days, some of them so bizarre, so extreme, so far off the \nchart that I think the American people took a look at this and said: \nThat is not what we wanted. We want good Government. Not more \nGovernment, we want good Government. But we do not want people taking \nGovernment apart in circumstances where it is important to help the \nlives of the American people. We want better schools. We want police \nprotection. We want a good Defense Department. We also want to care \nabout the disabled. We want to care about poor kids in school who are \nhungry in the middle of the day.\n  That is what this has been about.\n  The manifestation of all of this was that some of us said we will not \nagree to cutting Medicare $270 billion so that you can have a tax cut \nof $245 billion, the majority of which will go to the upper income \nfolks. We will not agree to that. We will not agree to saying to poor \nkids in school that you no longer can get a hot lunch. We will not \nagree to stripping the entitlement for health care for the disabled.\n  What happened as a result of that? As a result of that, we had a \npique of anger, a fit of anger, and the Government was closed down \ntwice. We will just close it down, they said. We do not care about \nGovernment anyway. Just close it down. And they closed it down.\n  The American people said: What kind of behavior is this? Do they need \nadult supervision? What kind of behavior is this in this Congress?\n  They quickly turned against the majority in this Congress.\n  It is interesting; the second half of this Congress has been markedly \ndifferent. It is exactly as the Democratic leader portrayed it. The \nsecond half we have accomplished some things which largely represent \nthe agenda of those of us who fought for constructive changes. We have \nsaid there are health care changes that we ought to make, and initially \nit was blocked and then embraced by the majority party, and we passed \nthe health care reform bill. We said we ought to have an adjustment in \nthe minimum wage; it has been 7 years. Initially, it was blocked and \nthen embraced by the majority party, and we passed a bipartisan minimum \nwage bill.\n  There are a number of steps which have occurred that represent \nbipartisan achievements finally in the latter stages of this session. \nAnd now this session limps to a close. We have not yet enacted five of \nthe appropriations bills so we will have those put into what is called \na continuing resolution.\n  I think the record of this Congress is going to provide some of the \nmost remarkable reading for historians a century from now. They will \nlook at this and they will scratch their head and say: What on Earth \nhappened in 1995 and 1996? They will see two different Congresses, one \nconfrontational, belligerent, give no quarter, extreme, pushing and \npushing and pushing for a philosophy which believes that America is \nhelped if you somehow put something in at the top and let it all drip \ndown and filter down and trickle down to the rest, fought tooth and \nnail by others\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\nwho believe that America's economic engine is represented by the folks \non the foundation at the bottom who are working every day, working hard \nto try and make do for themselves and their families. We call that the \npercolate up belief in this economy. Hubert Humphrey used to say \ntrickle down, percolate up. He said trickle down, now that is the \ntheory where if you feed the horse some hay, later on the birds will \nhave something to eat. Anyone who has been around horses knows what all \nthat means. That is trickle down. Supply-side economics, some call it. \nSupply-side, that is when the other side gets all the supplies. That is \npretty easy to understand.\n\n  My only point today is to say those who characterize this Congress as \na Congress constructive only by the majority party over the objections \nof the minority misconstrue the record of this Congress. This Congress \nstarted in a set of circumstances that represented the most extreme \nproposals, including finally Government shutdowns because we would not \ngo along, and then Congress changed and the second half of this \nCongress has been more productive because it has been bipartisan and \nbecause we have seen the embracing of some of the constructive things \nthat we think, policies that we think will make life better in this \ncountry for the American people.\n  My point is this. This Congress does not work, cannot work, and will \nnever work with one party trying to make it work. Congress will always \nwork and work best if you find bipartisan consensus. The fact is, \nSenator Dole sat over there during his Senate career. I have said \nbefore and I will say again that Senator Dole is a wonderful American \nwho has provided enormous service to this country, and I deeply admire \nhim. He served here many, many years. While I might disagree with him \non some policies, he, I think, was a remarkable Senator. I have said \nbefore and let me say again, I would not trade Senator Dole for all 73 \nfreshmen House Republicans who came here bragging they had no \nexperience, and quickly showed it. The fact is, there are people \nserving in this Congress, Republicans and Democrats, for whom I have \nthe most enormous respect, who have the kind of experience which can \nprovide solid, stable leadership for this country, who will help this \ncountry advance and grow, help our economy produce new opportunities, \nhelp maintain this country's leadership in the rest of the world. We \ncan, it seems to me, and should, it seems to me, in the 105th Congress \nnot talk about just what we do right and the other party does wrong. We \nshould talk about what we can do together. And part of the \ndemonstration of that is in what we have done toward the end of the \n104th Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11228-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11229-S11230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WHITEWATER PARDONS\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on what I consider a \ntravesty that I believe to be imminent. Mr. President, yesterday a \nnumber of newspapers reported that President Clinton refused to rule \nout a pardon for his Whitewater business partners James and Susan \nMcDougal and former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. He would not rule it out, and, \nMr. President, I believe that he has ruled it in.\n  The President said that such pardons would be handled in a routine \nfashion. I do not see how he can think about handling the McDougals and \nGovernor Tucker in a routine fashion. That is absurd.\n  His statements should serve as a warning to voters of what to expect \nafter the election. It is very possible that there will be pardons for \nall those involved in Whitewater, and the significance of this outrage \nshould not be lost on the public. The President was sending a strong \nmessage to the McDougals and their friends. Susan McDougal is in jail \nfor contempt of court because she refuses to answer legitimate \nquestions before a duly constituted Federal grand jury that is \nattempting to investigate Whitewater. Her defiance is a challenge to \nthe foundation of our judicial system, and, Mr. President, her attempt \nto politicize her criminal convictions, handed down by a jury of fellow \nArkansans, is outrageous.\n  She clearly got the message yesterday, however, when she read the \nheadlines. Essentially, the message was, ``Hang in Susan. The cavalry \nis coming. Don't break down and cooperate. The pardon is on the way \nafter the election.''\n  The same message went to her former husband, Jim McDougal. He is \nfacing 84 years in prison for his conviction last May, and he is \nsupposedly cooperating with the Independent Counsel in an attempt to \nreduce his prison sentence. Nonetheless, the President comes forth and \nsays, ``Jim, I'm raising the bid. I am offering a better deal. Don't \ncooperate with the prosecutors and I will reduce your sentence to \nnothing because I will pardon you even before you start serving time.''\n  How can the prosecutor attempt to compete with a complete pardon from \nthe President? The message also went out to Jim Guy Tucker. Now, Mr. \nTucker received a light sentence that included no jail time, but he \npotentially faces other charges that Mr. Starr could bring. In exchange \nfor dropping those charges, Mr. Tucker could cooperate more fully than \nhe has. But now he has gotten the President's message: Hold tight, sit \nstill, the election will be over in November and win, lose, or draw, \nyou will be pardoned.\n  Mr. President, I would remind people that 12 fellow Arkansans \nconvicted the McDougals and Jim Guy Tucker. They were convicted of \nmisusing taxpayers' money. Mrs. McDougal used a $300,000 Government \nloan intended for disadvantaged people to increase her real estate \nholdings and to redecorate her home. Who is going to pay for the \n$300,000 loss? The hard-working taxpayers in this country. The \nMcDougals ran a savings and loan into the ground and into bankruptcy. \nThat cost the American taxpayers $68 million. Today, on the Senate \nfloor, we will very likely consider legislation to address the problems \nof funding the savings and loan crisis. It is still with us. Banks and \nsavings and loans that had nothing to do with creating the crisis are \ngoing to be taxed to pay billions of dollars more to help end this and \nsolve the problem.\n  You can rest assured that there are job losses in this country, and \nmany of them, because of the billions that the banking industry will \nhave to pay back to further solve the savings and loan crisis. But I \nhave not heard anybody complaining about the job losses. Yet, you see a \nnightly sympathetic portrayal of the position of Susan McDougal, who \ncontributed to the losses significantly, and about the plight of her \nlife now that she has been caught and convicted.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the American people would not be fooled by \nPresident Clinton's action. I can only conclude, and I do not think \nanybody can conclude otherwise, that he intends a full pardon, which \nwould amount to a full-blown coverup of Whitewater, between November \nand his exit from the Presidency, in January. He just needs to keep \neveryone tight-lipped until the November election and then he will \neliminate Whitewater as an issue altogether.\n  Can you imagine what would have happened, how changed things would \nhave been, if Richard Nixon had been so bold? What if he had simply \npardoned all Watergate burglars immediately after his election? If he \nhad, Watergate would not be in the vernacular of politics today and he \nnever would have been forced into a resignation.\n  Mr. President, the American people need to be forewarned and alerted. \nIf reelected, or not reelected, I believe that Bill Clinton has every \nintention of pardoning his friends in the Whitewater case. What does \nthis say about his supposed innocence in the affair?\n  Many people would like to suggest that Whitewater is not a story, \nthat it is old news, that it has no relevance for today. They are \nwrong. Today's headlines, ``Whitewater Pardons Possible'' speaks \nvolumes about this administration and its integrity. This can be \napplied to a whole host of issues that have come before this \nadministration, and it is a good glimpse into how Mr. Clinton would \nconduct the Presidency if he were to be elected for 4 more years.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nNevada\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\nhas 15 minutes under a unanimous consent as agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not believe I will object but I would \nlike, for clarification purposes--I intended to speak right after the \nSenator from Nevada. Would the 10 minutes be included as part of his 15 \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. No. The unanimous consent was to give him 10 minutes. I did \nnot say when it would be, but it would be as in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would not object if I would be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes prior to that.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that be part of the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11229-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11230-S11231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated last week, one of my concerns \nis how people feel about Government. We hear so much negativism that it \nseems that nothing good ever happens in Government. Whenever I return \nto Nevada, and especially when I go to the elementary and secondary \nschools, and universities, I always tell those young people that \nGovernment has done good things for people and continues to do good \nthings for people.\n  What I want to do is, certainly, not whitewash what Government has \ndone or is doing, because we all know we can do better and could have \ndone better in the past. What I want to do, on a periodic basis, is \ntalk about some of the things that are happening in Government that are \ngood.\n  Every summer, communities up and down the east coast keep a wary eye \nout for the hurricane season and the havoc that hurricanes wreak. It is \nhard for me to comprehend the devastation that has taken place in the \nState of Florida, as an example.\n  Here in Washington, we only have to look back a few weeks to the \nchaos caused by Hurricane Fran. But just getting a little bit of that \nvicious storm, the Potomac overflowed its banks, we have roads that \nwere washed out, and people all across Virginia have soaked \nbasements. Commuting became very difficult.\n\n  Out in the western part of the United States, we have problems that \nare also created by nature. It happens almost on a yearly basis, and \nthat, Mr. President, is the calamity of wildfires. I am sure people \nfrom the East have difficulty understanding how these fires will rage \nover thousands and sometimes millions of acres of land. They are very \ndifficult to stop. The dry hot weather, mixed with the brittle \nunderbrush, makes millions of acres nothing more than tinderboxes \nwaiting for a flash of lightning, or a careless act by a human being.\n  So far this year in 1996, almost 6 million acres have been consumed \nby fires across the United States. About 90,000 fires have started. \nFirefighters have managed to quell most all the fires. Those they have \nbeen unable to defeat are in the hundreds.\n  The manpower required to battle Mother Nature is mindboggling. Mr. \nPresident, 25,000 firefighters worked this summer to save communities \nfrom these wild raging fires. On August 30, it reached its peak; that \nis, the battle of man against nature, when 22,000 men and women in 1 \nday were on the fire lines trying to control these fires.\n  The efforts of these firefighters are coordinated through a \nGovernment agency called the National Interagency Fire Center, which is \nbased in Boise, ID. This agency was established 31 years ago as a \ncooperative project with the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest \nService.\n  When a fire breaks out, local firefighters usually can handle it, but \nif they cannot, it is then that they call the National Interagency Fire \nCenter, in effect, asking for help. Then the Fire Center calls in \nresources from the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife \nService, National Park Service, Forest Service, and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, or any combination thereof. As ground and air crews \nbattle these fires, the National Interagency Fire Center--experts in \nfire ecology, fire behavior--work with the National Weather Service \npersonnel to plan strategies for fighting these raging fires while \nkeeping an eye, of course, on changing weather patterns. These fires \nbecome so intense, Mr. President, that they, on occasion, create their \nown weather.\n  As we all know, firefighting is a dangerous and unglamorous business. \nBut fighting wildfires is more grueling than most can imagine.\n  There are different types of firefighters. There are the major league \nfirefighters and there are firefighters who are referred to as type 2 \ncrews.\n  What are type 1 crews? They consist, first of all, of smokejumpers. \nWhen the fire breaks out and the National Interagency Fire Center is \ncalled, usually who they send in first are these very courageous, well-\ntrained men and women who are smokejumpers.\n  There are only 400 of them in the United States, but they do so much. \nThey are chosen for their incredible physical and mental stamina. These \nelite crews parachute into areas that are otherwise inaccessible. They \ncarry with them packs that can weigh over 80 pounds. They jump from \nthese airplanes with packs, as I indicated, weighing over 80 pounds. In \nthe packs, they have firefighting equipment, and they have food and \nwater, enough to last them for up to 3 days.\n  They are the first line of defense most of the time in stopping one \nof these fires. When they are in the middle of one of these infernos, \nthey push on and go for as many as 3 days without sleeping.\n  We also have as first line fire crews people who rappel into an area \noff helicopters. Helicopter firefighting is something that is \nrelatively new, but these helicopters also take these people into very \nremote areas. Once they have reached their destination, these brave \npeople rappel down to the fire and begin their work.\n  They, too, carry huge packs. There are 400 smokejumpers. There are \nonly 200 of these so-called heli-rappellers working for the Forest \nService.\n  Hotshots are also part of the type 1 crews. These firefighters, part \nof an elite ground crew, are working the front lines of fires that have \nraged out of control. Many times we have the smokejumpers come in, we \nhave the heli-rappellers come in and then if a fire cannot be \ncontained, you have these hotshots come in and work the front lines of \nfires that have raged out of control.\n  Mr. President, very recently, I called a man at one of the hospitals \nin Nevada. He was at the university medical center. He was there \nbecause it is the best and perhaps the only intensive care facility for \npeople who are badly burned in all of the State of Nevada. He was \ntransported about 400 miles from a fire that he had been fighting. He \nhad to be transported because Dave Webb, the man who I called on the \ntelephone, had been badly burned in a fire near Winnemucca, NV. He had \nsecond- and third-degree burns on his face, hands, and legs.\n  When I called, he was not able to handle the telephone. Someone had \nto handle the telephone for him. He is one of the very brave men who \nevery summer endanger their own lives to go into these areas where it \nis difficult to comprehend people would be willing to go into.\n  I talked with him about what had happened, and he explained it to me, \nwith a lot of humility, embarrassed that the fire had gotten to him and \nburned him so badly. He felt that he had been a failure. Of course, he \nhad not been a failure. He had worked in many of these fires.\n  This happens every summer. He was one of the lucky ones. He was not \nkilled.\n  These type 1 crews, like Dave Webb, have worked together for many \nyears. They know each other. They are, in effect, the Green Berets of \nthe firefighters. I extend my appreciation to the type 1 firefighting \ncrews, those who jump out of airplanes, climb out of helicopters, who \nwork the front lines.\n  Mr. President, there are others, though, thousands and thousands of \nothers who do not jump out of airplanes or helicopters or are not \ntrained to be hotshots, but are extremely important. These are the type \n2 crews.\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\n They come in, they fight fires. They watch fires after they have been \nput out, because one of the real dangers we have with fires is they \nappear to be out, but some of the worst forest fires we have had have \nbeen initiated after the fire has been put out, when people thought the \nfires died down.\n  Over 3,000 fires in the Great Basin alone burned almost 2 million \nacres this summer, and communities across the State of Nevada were \nwitness to the dramas that played out in the hills and mountains above \ntheir homes.\n  Driving just 2 miles out of Reno on Highway 80 going to the west, you \nsee the results of one fire they had there this summer. There in the \nBelli Ranch area, 7,000 acres were consumed by a fire that is suspected \nto have been caused by an arsonist. This cost the taxpayers at least $2 \nmillion.\n  As you go past the Belli Ranch area and drive into the community, you \nare confronted by really a breathtaking scene.\n  You can see the black sweep of the fires that rolled up and down hill \nafter hill. Then, almost magically, the black gives way to the \nbeautiful green of the sage and other brush and grasses. This green is \nthe buttress of only about 10 or 20 feet from the homes. The fire got \nwithin 10 to 20 feet of the homes. Saved and intact, the homes in the \ncommunity are alive with the daily hustle and bustle of life, having \ncome so close to having been consumed, as other homes in Nevada and the \nWest were consumed this summer.\n  So people in Nevada and other parts of the West are grateful to the \nmen and women who put their lives on the line to stop the fires before \ncommunities were swallowed up, just like the homes that were saved in \nthe Belli Ranch fire.\n  This fire season is drawing to a close, Mr. President, and we in the \nWest breathe a sigh of relief that we have been able to endure again \nthe wrath of mother nature, or sometimes an act of malice, or \ncarelessness by man.\n  We say thanks to the 22,000 firefighters that have been employed by \nthe Federal Government during this fire season. To the pilots who fly \ninto the face of these fires, the crews that jump out of these \nairplanes, out of these helicopters, the ground crews that struggle \nagainst the infernos that threaten communities, to the people of the \nNational Interagency Fire Center who coordinate so well so much of the \nbattle, I say thank you. And to my fellow Americans, Mr. President, I \nsay, that is how Government works for you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I happened to be presiding this morning \nwhen the very distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, made a number of comments. I know that he would not \nintentionally say anything that is not totally accurate in reflecting \nupon the positions and past performances of Senator Bob Dole, but I \nthink inadvertently he misrepresented his stand on a number of issues. \nI would like to just briefly go over a couple of these.\n  First of all, it seems as if it has been over a year now since the \ndemagoging of Medicare has taken place on this floor. I was very \npleased a year ago today, I believe it was, to read an editorial in the \nWashington Post. And, Mr. President, I do not think anyone has ever \naccused the Washington Post of being a Republican publication.\n  So, finally, I feel that they looked at this and thought this is such \na serious thing, that the Republicans had a program to save Medicare, \nand that by the admission of the board of trustees that was appointed \nby President Clinton, if we did not do something, Medicare would have \ngone broke by the year 2002, then that was updated a year later and \nthey said it really would be 2001, and the Republicans had a program to \ncontrol growth, not cut--there has never been any intention to cut \nbenefits of Medicare to the American people--but have controlled \ngrowth, do away with waste and fraud and abuse and install some other \nthings that would make it a viable program.\n  So, finally, the editorial boards around the country, that are \nnormally not sensitive to Republican causes, rallied and said, we are \ngoing to have to do something about it.\n  I would like to read the last two sentences of an editorial found in \nthe Washington Post a year ago, just about now. I believe it was a year \nago today. It was called ``Medagogues, Cont'd.'' This is the second \none. A week before that they had one where they demonstrated very \nclearly and very persuasively that what the Republicans were trying to \ndo was to save Medicare. The last two sentences are:\n\n       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut \n     connection because it is useful politically. It allows them \n     to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. \n     We think it's wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, the editorial entitled ``Medagogues, Cont'd'' from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the second attack on Senator Bob Dole by \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts had to do with the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill, implying that Bob Dole was opposed and had been \nopposed to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. I would suggest to you, Mr. \nPresident, that one thing that Bob Dole was opposed to was a single \npayer Government-run system which the President had advocated earlier \nin his administration. In other words, socializing medicine, taking \nabout 12 percent of the economy of this country and putting it in the \nhands of Government because they can do it so much better than the \nprivate sector can do it.\n\n  That is what Senator Dole was opposed to. He was not opposed to some \nof the reforms that were found in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. There \nwere a couple of reforms that he wanted that ended up being in the \nbill. In fact, the President said that if the MSA's, medical savings \naccounts, were added to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, at one point he \nsaid he would veto it. Many of those on the other side of the aisle \nsaid that if the MSA's are in, it would be vetoed.\n  Why were people concerned about the MSA's? They were concerned about \nthem because those people who would want to have a socialized approach \nto health care delivery in this country know that once we have MSA's, \nwe will never go back to that system.\n  What do MSA's do? They merely allow the choice of individuals so that \nif an individual wants to shop around for his health delivery services, \nand he can save money doing so, then he can benefit and have the \nrewards of what he has saved. I think that our health delivery in \nAmerica is the only product or service known that actually has a built-\nin disincentive to save. And I am guilty like everyone else. You know, \nif I have my deductible and I go ahead and pay that, then I am inclined \nto go and get any kind of medical or health service that is out there \nbecause it no longer costs me any more money. That is human nature.\n  We finally got a modified medical savings account system put into the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill. I say ``modified.'' It is only on a trial \nbasis. It is going to prove itself. I heard estimates that we could \nactually reduce the total cost of health care in this country by as \nmuch as 50 percent just by having MSA's.\n  Mr. President, there is another thing we need to do that is not in \nthis bill, and that is to have some kind of medical malpractice so we \ndo not have such a high defensive cost. But anyway, the fact that MSA's \nare in there now--the President had said he would veto it if they were \nin there. He did not veto it. I am glad he did not veto it. But \ncertainly it was never Bob Dole's intention to oppose the Kennedy-\nKassebaum bill with the reforms in it that he felt\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\nwere in the best interests of the American people.\n  The third thing that Senator Kennedy said about Senator Dole that I \nthink was misleading, and it was a misrepresentation of his position, \nwas in reference to tax cuts. It is true that Senator Dole, if elected \nPresident, wants to come to Congress, which I believe will still be \ncontrolled by the Republicans, and come with tax cuts.\n  He outlined five major tax cuts. I am very supportive of all five of \nthose tax cuts. People ask, how are you going to pay for them? I think \npeople forget about the fact that three decades in the last 100 years \nPresidents have decided to have tax cuts, and in all three decades it \nhas dramatically increased the revenues.\n  It is ironic that Senator Kennedy would be talking about tax cuts and \nall the damage that is being done when it was John Kennedy in 1962, \nwhen he was President of the United States, who said, and I quote:\n\n       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too \n     high today and tax revenues are too low. And the soundest way \n     to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut rates now. \n     The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget \n     deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding \n     economy which can bring a budget surplus.\n\n  That was what President Kennedy said in 1962. And that is exactly \nwhat happened during the 1960's with the massive tax reductions, and we \nwere able to have revenue increases--revenue increases.\n  Look what happened. The marginal rates of our tax system in 1980 \nproduced $244 billion. In 1990, it almost doubled to $466 billion, and \nthat was during a 10-year period when we had the most massive cuts in \nour tax revenues.\n  So I think that it would be good to go back and look at history and \nsee that this country, when it has been overtaxed in the past, that \nthey reduced taxes and had the result of increasing revenues. \nCertainly, we are in an overtaxed posture right now.\n  I have often said there are three things that make this country \nnonproductive, on a global basis, and noncompetitive: One is our high \ntax rates; one is overregulation; the other is our tort laws. There is \nnot time in this brief time to cover that.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by saying when Senator Kennedy assailed \nSenator Dole for talking about tax cuts, that he start realizing those \nindividuals--those of us who want to have tax reductions--are the same \nones that were trying to stop the 1993 tax increase. In 1993, when \nPresident Clinton had control of both the House and the Senate, he \npassed a tax increase that was characterized not by Republicans but by \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which was Senator \nMoynihan, who said it was the largest single tax increase in the \nhistory of public finance in America or any place in the world.\n  I think, essentially, what we--what Senator Dole, and what the \nRepublicans and the conservatives in this body and in the other body--\nwant to do is merely undo the damage that was done by that massive tax \nincrease and actually repeal the taxes that were increased in 1993. \nEssentially, that is what Senator Dole wants to do. I believe that is \nan accurate characterization of his program.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 5, 1996]\n\n                               Medagogues\n\n       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard \n     Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the \n     Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems \n     to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about \n     everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to \n     cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out \n     of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance \n     program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program \n     to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other \n     than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . . \n     . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a \n     sacred trust.''\n       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress \n     has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular \n     basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the \n     program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years \n     the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which, \n     despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be \n     little more than accounting devices and possible warning \n     lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to \n     reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because \n     Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid \n     together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all \n     spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is \n     done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the \n     baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.\n       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant. \n     Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive \n     up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out \n     other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes. Or \n     it can cut them back.\n       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step. \n     This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire \n     society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot \n     of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it \n     on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan \n     is still gauzy. It is not year clear how tough it will \n     finally be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on \n     grounds that it seeks to cut too much from the program and on \n     grounds that it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn \n     out to be true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to \n     have other flaws as well.\n       They have nonethless--in our judgement--stepped up to the \n     issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling \n     for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn \n     is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away \n     your Medicare. That's their only message. They have no plan. \n     Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the \n     Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their \n     tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the \n     right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong \n     one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not be a tax \n     cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the Republicans \n     propose. But that has nothing to do with Medicare. The \n     Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection \n     because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack \n     and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think \n     it's wrong.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to make a few \nbrief remarks about United States policy in Indonesia.\n  I am deeply concerned about some of the views being expressed by some \nmembers of the Clinton administration, and am particularly concerned \nbecause the administration has been quite culpable in the past with \nregard to aspects of our Indonesia policy. Despite a violent crackdown \nin Jakarta on July 27--not quite 2 months ago--this administration says \nit still intends to go forward with the sale of nine F-16 fighter jets \nto Indonesia.\n  Mr. President, the administration had fully intended to send up \nnotification of this sale earlier this month. Fortunately, objections \nfrom myself and many of my colleagues convinced the administration that \nnow was not the right time to announce officially the intention to sell \nfighter jets to Indonesia.\n  I am pleased that--for the time being--this sale cannot move forward, \nat least until Congress reconvenes in January.\n  But what concerns me today, Mr. President, are recent statements that \nsuggest that the administration necessarily will attempt to notify \nCongress again in January--apparently without conditioning this move on \nany actions by the Indonesian authorities either in the past or in the \ncoming months.\n  Given the history of human right abuses in Indonesia, as well as the \nevents of July 27, I find this attitude difficult to accept.\n  Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on \nUnited States policy toward Indonesia. We heard from two very capable \nadministration witnesses and four distinguished private panelists, \nincluding a political science professor from the University of \nWisconsin, Madison.\n  As one of the witnesses commented, this may have been the first \nhearing in many years to look at the full scope of American ties to \nIndonesia.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that Indonesia is an important country and \na valuable ally. It is the largest country in Southeast Asia, and its \npopulation\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\nof more than 200 million people is the fourth largest in the world. It \nplays a significant role in Asian affairs, and has been instrumental in \nconflict resolution efforts in the region. It also has been an \nimportant ally of the United States in international forums, such as \nthe United Nations.\n  I also salute Indonesia's economic success, and believe there are \nmany valuable lessons in Indonesia's experience which can be applied to \nother developing countries across the world.\n  Mr. President, these achievements cannot--and do not--excuse \nIndonesia's consistently dismal record on human rights and its \ncontinuous assault on democratic freedoms.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about the massive human \nrights abuses that continue in East Timor.\n  As we all know, Indonesia has sustained a brutal military occupation \nof East Timor since 1975. Human rights organizations from around the \nworld, as well as our own State Department, continue to report \nsubstantial human rights violations by the Indonesian military--\nincluding arbitrary arrests and detentions, curbs on freedom of \nexpression and association, and the use of torture and summary killings \nof civilians.\n  More recently, we have heard reports of the Indonesian military \nconducting systematic training of East Timorese youth to take part in \nlocal militia groups. We also have heard disturbing reports of \nincreasing religious and ethnic tension in East Timor, which at times \nis exacerbated by government inaction.\n  On top of the ongoing pattern in East Timor, the July 27 events in \nJakarta reinforce my perception of an Indonesian regime that squashes \nalternative political discourse.\n  On that day, hundreds of people rioted after President Soeharto \nattempted to oust Megawati Sukarnoputri, a popular opposition leader, \nfrom her position as chair of the Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI.\n  During the riot, arson-led fires caused considerable property damage. \nAt least five people were killed, at least 149 injured, and hundreds \narrested. But, as Human Rights Watch reports, many of those arrested \ndid not appear to be responsible for initiating the riot. Instead, most \nwere linked, or accused of being linked, to the reform movement or \nspecifically to the Megawati camp.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na September 20, 1996, article from the Washington Post which describes \nhow difficult it is for Megawati to operate as an opposition candidate \nafter government officials ousted her as party leader, threatened to \nshut down party headquarters, and arrested many of her supporters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 20, 1996]\n\n              Indonesian Says Slow Approach Avoids a Trap\n\n                         (By Keith B. Richburg)\n\n       Jakarta, Indonesia, Sept. 19--Police are still hauling in \n     her supporters for questioning. Already more than 100 \n     languish in jail, and dozens others are missing. A member of \n     parliament, she has been left off the list of candidates for \n     next year's parliamentary elections, meaning she may lose her \n     only official platform for challenging the government. Now \n     the police say they will shut down her new headquarters \n     because it violates local zoning laws.\n       These are trying times for Indonesia's premier opposition \n     leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Just a few months after she \n     emerged from virtual obscurity to become the first real \n     rallying point for opposition to President Suharto's 30-year \n     rule, Sukarnoputri finds herself besieged, harassed, called \n     in for questioning like a common criminal, facing the \n     likelihood of being sidelined from her country's tightly \n     controlled political process--and grappling with the mounting \n     impatience of her own supporters.\n       But even with these pressures weighing on her, Sukarnoputri \n     remains surprisingly sanguine, unhurried, almost eerily \n     serene. She is not out on the streets, not leading rallies, \n     not exhorting her followers. This morning, she is seated at \n     the dining room table of her spacious house in Jakarta's \n     south suburbs, taking a Spanish lesson from her regular \n     tutor.\n       What has learning Spanish got to do with leading a ``people \n     power'' movement against Asia's longest-serving and most \n     durable leader?\n       ``I think it will be easier for me to communicate with \n     Latin American people,''; Sukarnoputri explains later, after \n     the tutor has left for the day. ``And also Spanish is more \n     important in the United States,'' she adds, citing the \n     increasing Hispanic population there.\n       Sukarnoputri clearly has her own agenda. And while her \n     backers and sympathizers may be growing frustrated, she is \n     determined to proceed at her own slow and steady pace, \n     careful not to engage the government in direct confrontation \n     and not be goaded by her more radical followers.\n       ``They want me to do something more concrete, like have a \n     rally,'' she said. ``But at the moment, I think that is not a \n     good tactic, because so many people are still intimidated.''\n       She said the political situation remains tense after a July \n     27 riot--prompted by a government raid--in which five people \n     were killed and several banks and government offices gutted \n     by fire. The government used the riot as a pretext to launch \n     a widespread crackdown on opposition organizers, labor \n     leaders, human rights activists and anyone else suspected of \n     links to the long-dormant and outlawed Indonesian Communist \n     Party, which tried to foment revolution here three decades \n     ago.\n       The most serious anti-government outburst in recent memory, \n     the July riot erupted after police backed by army troops \n     raided the old headquarters of the officially sanctioned \n     Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, to oust a group of \n     Sukarnoputri supporters who had occupied the building in \n     protest of a government-orchestrated party coup that replaced \n     her as party leader. The government apparently feared that \n     Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's charismatic first \n     president, Sukarno, could become a potent challenger to the \n     incumbent Suharto.\n       Sukarnoputri said today that she did not believe her \n     supporters were involved in the rioting, but that the \n     violence was sparked by government agents who wanted to \n     discredit her movement and use the unrest as the pretext for \n     the wider crackdown that followed.\n       ``It could not have been common people,'' she said. ``It \n     must have been professionals. . . . I think there was some \n     engineering. How could common people burn so many high \n     buildings in such a short time? I think they wanted to make a \n     trigger, a trap, for people who are pro-democracy.''\n       Sukarnoputri said her go slowly, softly approach--for \n     example, not calling any new street protests and, thus, not \n     defying a government ban on rallies--is to avoid falling into \n     another ``trap.'' She said: ``So many people try to make \n     moves, to push, to push PDI to use violence or hard action. \n     But if we do, they will trap us, just like that riot.''\n       Some observers here--Western diplomats, journalists, \n     academics--say Sukarnoputri may be correct, that moving too \n     quickly with mass actions will expose more of her supporters \n     to arrest, prison, or worse.\n       But many also say that with her quiet approach, \n     Sukarnoputri may have let her moment pass, that the momentum \n     and publicity generated by the government's heavy-handed \n     takeover of party headquarters may already be lost.\n       ``I don't think she's in an enviable position,'' a Western \n     diplomat said. ``She can maintain her status as a symbol of \n     opposition, but without doing anything, that fades.''\n       The other legal challenges and obstacles Sukarnoputri faces \n     may prove even more damaging to her long-term ability to \n     mount a credible challenge to the regime.\n       On Monday, the day for filing candidate lists for next \n     June's parliamentary elections, the anti-Sukarnoputri faction \n     of the Democratic Party showed up early in the morning at the \n     National Election Commission offices with a list of names \n     that did not include Sukarnoputri or any of her supporters. \n     When a Sukarnoputri deputy came that afternoon with a \n     separate ``Megawati slate,'' election officials refused to \n     accept it.\n       Sukarnoputri is challenging her ouster as party leader in \n     Indonesian courts, and she said she also will file suit to \n     have her candidates' list accepted. If she is not a candidate \n     next year, she will lose her seat and whatever slim chance \n     she may have had of running against Suharto for the \n     presidency in the next election in two years. (The Indonesian \n     president is not directly elected but voted on by a people's \n     assembly.) Under Indonesia's restricted political system, if \n     Sukarnoputri loses her current parliamentary seat, she will \n     be unable to gather supporters, make speeches or call \n     political rallies.\n       But Sukarnoputri is undeterred. She said she insists on \n     exhausting all legal remedies first, mainly as a way to test \n     the independence of the country's judiciary. If she is \n     prevented from running for office next year, she said, her \n     exclusion will serve to point out flaws in the electoral \n     process.\n       ``It will be a big problem for the government,'' she said. \n     ``There are already so many people protesting to the \n     government [about] why I, a popular and sympathetic person in \n     the country, am not on the national list. People will see the \n     election is not free and fair.''\n       But even if she loses, Sukarnoputri disagrees with the \n     analysis that her stature will fade.\n       In our culture, there is not only a formal leader. There is \n     also an informal leader,'' she said. ``Sometimes the informal \n     leader can be more powerful than the formal leader. You can \n     see how my father, even though he has already passed away, in \n     spirit still lives inside the Indonesian people.''\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\n       She added, ``I'm sure about that.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The climate described in the article clearly is not one \nthat supports freedom of expression, freedom of the press or freedom of \nassociation.\n  The events of July 27 underscore the Government's intention to foster \na repressive climate in the months leading up to the 1997 parliamentary \nelections.\n  As the New York Times declared in a recent editorial, ``This is no \ntime to be selling high-performance warplanes to Indonesia.''\n  The administration says its policy is ``to make available to \nIndonesia military equipment that will support legitimate external \ndefense needs.'' At the same time, the United States will not export or \ntransfer to Indonesia small arms, crowd control equipment or armored \npersonnel carriers until we have seen significant improvement in human \nrights in the country, particularly in East Timor.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Congress and the administration \nhave worked together to develop a policy linking the sale of small arms \nto Indonesia to its human rights record. This policy evolved from an \namendment that I offered to the foreign aid appropriations bill several \nyears ago.\n  But I believe that we are missing an important opportunity to apply \npressure to the Indonesian regime by failing to impose comparable \nconditions on the F-16 sale. In fact, in public statements since \ncongressional notification was delayed, the administration has not even \nmentioned human rights or democratic values in connection with the \nsale.\n  Instead, it continues to state publicly that it intends to go through \nwith the sale as early as January.\n  I believe official advocacy of the F-16 sale sends the wrong message \nto the Indonesian military. It sends the message that--despite our \nconcerns about the lack of respect for human rights in East Timor and \ndespite the continued failure of the Indonesian military to respond \nsubstantively to these concerns--the United States will continue to \nsupply substantial amounts of lethal military equipment to Indonesia.\n  If the events of July 27 tell us nothing else, they should signal to \nus that Indonesia still has a long way to go in terms of respect for \nhuman rights and democratic values.\n  I believe that we should support progress in these areas--only when \nreal progress actually is achieved. Instead, within weeks of a major \ncrackdown by the Indonesian authorities, the administration persists in \nits plans to provide Indonesia with nine advanced military planes.\n  I do not think now is the time to be rewarding Indonesia with nine \nplanes. Only when we see some improvement in Indonesia's conduct should \nwe be elevating the level of our military ties to the country.\n  In sum, I continue to believe that--in Indonesia, as elsewhere--we \nmust consider a military's human rights record as one of the \ndetermining factors in deciding whether or not the U.S. Government \nshould license or facilitate a foreign arms sale.\n  As a result, I oppose the administration's plans to allow the \ntransfer of the F-16's to Indonesia at this time, or in the near \nfuture, and I intend to work with a number of other Members of the \nSenate who share that view to persuade the administration that a change \nin policy is warranted here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the scheduled adjournment of the \n104th Congress quickly approaching, I wanted to say a few words about a \nvery accomplished legislator who, unfortunately, will not be returning \nto this body next January: Senator Bennett Johnston.\n  I was saddened to hear of his decision to retire at the conclusion of \nthis Congress, and I know he will be missed by his colleagues as well \nas his constituents in Louisiana. Senator Johnston does not depart, \nhowever, without leaving a significant legacy of accomplishment. He is \na skilled negotiator, and has demonstrated a tremendous ability to \nnavigate the tumultuous legislative waters, even when faced with the \nmost difficult obstacles.\n  I had the privilege of working closely with Senator Johnston while I \nserved on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with him during my \nfirst term as a Senator. As chairman of the Energy Committee, and now \nranking member, Senator Johnston has been a leading advocate of a \ncomprehensive national energy strategy. Under his leadership, Congress \npassed the landmark 1992 Energy Policy Act, which promoted increased \nconservation, increased competition in the wholesale electricity \nmarkets, and encouraged additional development of domestic sources of \nenergy. With this country now importing more than 50 percent of the oil \nwe consume every year, Senator Johnston has been fully committed to \ndeveloping new domestic sources of energy to help reduce our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Senator Johnston has also addressed a myriad of other energy-related \nissues during his distinguished Senate career. He shepherded \nderegulation of the natural gas industry through the Congress; he \nhelped defeat the ill-conceived Btu tax; and he has been a leading \nadvocate of maintaining our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an important \ninvestment in protecting our Nation's energy supply from disruption.\n  Senator Johnston's work in the Senate has not been limited to energy \nissues. I have also had the privilege of serving with the Senator on \nthe Budget Committee, where he has served with great distinction. As \nthe past chairman, and now ranking member, of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Johnston has \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to developing and maintaining our \nNation's water resources, an issue of great importance to Western \nStates like North Dakota. Senator Johnston has also been a leading \nadvocate of maintaining an adequate B-52 bomber fleet, our most cost-\neffective, reliable, and only battle-tested bomber.\n  Mr. President, Senator Johnston will be long-remembered as an \nextremely capable and responsible public servant, who addressed issues \nwith a zeal few can bring to this body. All in public life owe Senator \nJohnston a debt of gratitude for his tremendous contributions, and I \nwish the senior Senator from Louisiana all the best in his future \nendeavors, no matter what path he chooses to follow upon departing this \nbody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11234-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11234-S11235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WALTER DROSKIE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, last Wednesday night, as I looked around \nthe Russell Caucus Room at the many wonderful people that have served \non my staff these past 18 years, I was filled with pride. I will always \nremember the loyalty and hard work of my staff--the greatest in the \nSenate. Today I would like to honor one such staffer, Walter Edwin \nDroskie.\n  Walter Droskie is retiring at the end of the 104th Congress after 35 \nyears as a Senate employee, serving 6 senators over the years. In 1962, \nSenator Patrick McNamara from Michigan, was the\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\nfirst senator to realize Walter s potential. Hired as a data entry \noperator, Walter started off on his long journey of service to his home \nState of Michigan and eventually the States of Texas and Arkansas. In \n1966, Walter continued working for the State of Michigan by joining the \nstaff of Senator Robert Griffin and spent 13 years there. By now Walter \nwas developing a reputation for his expertise as mailroom manager. In \n1979 Senator John Tower from Texas heard about Walter and offered him \nhis next job. He continued this pattern of invaluable service to the \nState of Texas by going to work for Senator Lloyd Bentsen in 1984. When \nBob Krueger filled Lloyd Bentsen's seat in 1992, Walter was wisely kept \non staff.\n  In 1993, I was fortunate enough to finally get Walter Droskie on my \nstaff. We had been hoping to catch him between Senators for a long \ntime--he was always in demand. Walter has brought so much to my office. \nThe mailroom has never run smoother, and Walter's wonderful disposition \nhas won him the friendship of everyone on my staff--past and present. \nAs he retires this year, I hope Walter Droskie realizes how much he has \ncontributed not only to my office, but all the offices he has worked \nfor during these past 35 years. His dedication and tireless hard work \nhave won him the respect and gratitude of all he has known. I wish him \nthe best during his retirement. The U.S. Senate will surely miss the \nmany contributions of this fine man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11234-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING CHARLES N. QUIGLEY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Charles N. \nQuigley, who participated in CIVITAS at Bosnia-Herzegovina, an \nintensive program from July 17-27, 1996, to train local teachers in \neducation for democracy. Mr. Quigley was part of a team of 18 American \neducators and 15 teachers from the Council of Europe who were assigned \nto key cities throughout the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  The summer training program was developed by the Center for Civic \nEducation as part of a major education initiative in Bosnia-Herzegovina \nsupported by the United States Information Agency and the United States \nDepartment of Education. The goals of the program are to help prepare \nstudents and their communities to participate in elections and other \naspects of poltical life in emerging democracies. Achieving this goal \nwill contribute to the reconstitution of a sense of community, \ncooperation, tolerance, and support for democracy and human rights in \nwar torn areas.\n  I am also pleased to announce that the curricular materials used for \nthe program in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been adapted from the ``We the \nPeople . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' and the ``We the People \n. . . Project Citizen'' programs, as well as other programs supported \nby the Congress which are used in schools throughout the United States. \nInitial reports evaluating the summer program indicate the materials \nand teaching methods were enthusiastically received and can be adapted \nfor use in classrooms throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  Mr. Quigley is the executive director of the Center for Civic \nEducation which is located in Calabasas, CA. Mr. Quigley has traveled \non four different occasions to Bosnia-Herzegovina to promote education \nfor democracy efforts in the schools of that country.\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend Charles Quigley for his dedication \nand commitment during the CIVITAS at Bosnia-Herzegovina summer training \nprogram. His work is helping to achieve the overall objective of \nbuilding support for democracy on Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11235-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before the end of the 104th Congress, I \nwanted to take a moment to pay tribute to Senator Paul Simon of \nIllinois, who is retiring this year. Paul Simon is quite simply one of \nthe most respected and honorable Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Simon has been a dedicated public servant for more than 40 \nyears. He has served in the Illinois House and Senate, as Lieutenant \nGovernor of the State of Illinois, and in the U.S. House and Senate.\n  Even as he tirelessly served in public office, Paul Simon also found \nways to pursue his second career--that of a distinguished and \nthoughtful writer. A former newspaperman, Simon has written numerous \nbooks on our political process and democratic values. He still types \nhis manuscripts out on an old manual typewriter.\n  Senator Simon's top legislative priority for years has been passage \nof a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Paul Simon \nunderstands that the greatest threat to future generations is the \nFederal budget deficit and our enormous national debt. Eliminating our \nbudget deficit is the most important thing we can do for our Nation and \nPaul Simon pursued this goal with steadfast tenacity.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Simon on the Budget \nCommittee since 1987. Paul Simon will be most remembered there for his \nefforts to restore equity between defense and nondefense spending. \nSenator Simon and I also joined together last year in offering an \nalternative budget reconciliation measure. I was proud of that effort.\n  Paul Simon will also be remembered as a staunch supporter of \neducation and an advocate for people with disabilities. While serving \nin the Illinois Legislature, he was among the first to introduce \nlegislation to provide public education for children with disabilities. \nYears later he was one of the original sponsors of Public Law 94-142, \nthe first Federal law to ensure that all children with disabilities \nwould receive free and appropriate public education. This landmark \nlegislation was signed in 1975.\n  Because of Simon's devotion and perseverance, Congress passed the \nNational Literacy Act, to create literacy centers and to authorize \nfunding for adult education and literacy programs. Simon also \nchampioned the direct college loan program, originally passed in 1991 \nand expanded in 1993, which made fundamental changes in our Nation's \nstudent loan program.\n  Although some may remember Simon for his bowties, I will always \nremember his simple honesty, integrity, and character. Paul Simon not \nonly remembered the bipartisanship and comity that used to be standard \noperating procedure in the Senate, but he continued to serve in that \ntradition, even as Congress changed around him.\n  I know Senator Simon will be happy to return to his home in southern \nIllinois. He'll be heading up the Simon Public Policy Institute at \nsouthern Illinois University at Carbondale. He'll have more time for \nhis grandchildren, more time to write. But he'll be missed in the U.S. \nSenate, by the people he represented and by those who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11235-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11235-S11237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CUTTING TAXES AND BALANCING THE BUDGET--THE POSSIBLE DREAM\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as the Presidential campaign heats up, it \nis clear that a central issue will be economic growth. Despite recent \npositive economic news, the long-term outlook is not good. Growth is \nslow and family incomes are down. At the same time, the tax burden on \nAmericans is at an all-time high, squeezing families while discouraging \nsavings and investment.\n  In response to this disturbing trend, Bob Dole has proposed an \naggressive plan to both cut taxes and balance the budget by the year \n2002. The goal of the plan is to spur economic growth by reducing both \nthe size and tax burden of the Federal Government. Its centerpiece is a \n15-percent, across-the-board income-tax cut designed to lower taxes on \nfamilies and small businesses while spurring job creation and \ninvestment. The Dole plan would also provide families with a $500 per \nchild tax credit, improved IRA's, and lower taxes on capital gains. For \na typical family earning $30,000, his plan would allow them to keep an \nadditional $1,261 per year, enough to pay tuition to a private school, \nmove into a better neighborhood, or save for an early retirement.\n  People like the idea of a tax cut, but they wonder how it can be done \nwithout increasing the Federal budget deficit or gutting essential \nFederal programs. In a recent radio address, President Clinton sounded \nthat theme, attacking Bob Dole's plan by arguing that the tax cut is \ntoo big and asserting that Dole has failed to explain how\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\nwe can pass them without ballooning the deficit. Neither claim is \naccurate.\n  First, Bob Dole's tax cuts are an appropriate and necessary response \nto the record tax burdens American families currently face. Following \nPresident Clinton's World's Largest Tax Increase of 1993, the Federal \ntax burden has risen to 20.5 percent of GDP--its second highest level \never. Meanwhile, the combination of Federal, State, and local taxes now \nconsumes more than 38 cents out of every dollar the family earns.\n  The Dole tax cut would help relieve this burden by reducing taxes \nacross the board while targeting additional tax relief toward families \nwith children. Fully implemented, the Dole tax cut would reduce the tax \nburden back to where it was before Bill Clinton began raising taxes in \n1993. That's hardly an excessive goal.\n  The second objection to Bob Dole's tax cut proposal is that it will \ncause the deficit to balloon. That is the issue upon which I want to \nfocus today. Far from being vague and irresponsible, the Dole tax cuts \nare in fact both detailed and well within the ability of Congress to \ncarry out.\n  Under the Dole plan, cutting taxes on families and small businesses \nwould reduce Federal revenues by $548 billion over the next 6 years. \nHow does the Dole plan offset these cuts while balancing the budget? \nFirst, it slows the growth of the Federal Government over the next 6 \nyears. Second, it encourages economic growth to help offset a portion \nof these tax cuts.\n  Let me begin with slowing the growth of Government. The Dole plan \nbuilds upon the comprehensive balanced budget resolution Congress \nadopted in June. That resolution calls for reducing the growth of \nspending by $393 billion over the next 6 years, including the phase-out \nof farm support payments, welfare overhaul, and Federal prison reform.\n\n  On top of the balanced budget resolution, the Dole plan proposes \nsavings of an additional $217 billion over 6 years, targeting wasteful \nprograms like the departments of Commerce and Energy and reducing \nGovernment overhead.\n  Mr. President, there has been much criticism and misinformation \nregarding these proposed savings. I have seen reports from several \noutside groups, both conservative and liberal, who claim these savings \nwould literally gut whole portions of the Federal Government. This is \ncompletely false.\n  First of all, in the spending restraints assumed in the Dole plan \nbeyond those contained in the balanced budget resolution, Bob Dole has \nmade it clear that they will not come from reductions to Social \nSecurity, Medicare, or Defense. Those programs are off-limits. Under \nthe Dole plan, Medicare spending would increase by 44 percent between \n1996 and 2002--a 6.2 percent growth rate, or more than two times the \nrate of inflation. Spending would increase from $5,200 per beneficiary \nin 1996 to $7,000 in 2002.\n  Subtracting Social Security, Medicare, Defense, and interest expenses \nfrom total Federal spending over the next 6 years leaves $3.9 trillion \neligible for savings under the Dole plan. Contrary to those groups that \nhave portrayed this proposal as unreasonable, the Dole plan proposes to \nreduce this amount by just 5 percent--5 cents on the dollar.\n  Let's look at it on a year-by-year basis. Projected Federal spending \nnext year is $1642 billion--or $70 billion more than we expect to spend \nthis year. Under the Dole plan, Government spending would continue to \ngrow, but by $37 billion instead.\n  Let's compare the Dole plan to President Clinton's own \nrecommendation. Whereas President Clinton would allow Government \nspending to grow by 20 percent over the next 6 years, the Dole plan \nwould hold spending growth to 14 percent--or about 2 percent per year. \nIn other words, limiting spending growth to 2 percent per year will \nproduce the savings necessary to cut taxes and balance the budget.\n  Is holding the growth of Government spending to 2 percent per year \nreasonable? Absolutely.\n  Under Republican leadership--and with no help from congressional \nDemocrats or President Clinton--Congress has successfully reduced the \ngrowth of Federal spending over the last 2 years by $53 billion, or \nabout $26 billion per year. Moreover, just this summer, we enacted a \ncomprehensive welfare reform measure. In other words Mr. President, in \nresponse to those who claim the Dole economic plan's spending savings \nare too severe, I would point out that we have already succeeded in \nreducing the growth of Government by similar amounts. The Earth didn't \nstop rotating. The Sun hasn't stopped shining. And in the process, we \nhave made the Government more efficient and more responsive to the \nwishes of the American voters.\n  In addition to slowing the growth of government, the Dole plan also \nassumes that his pro-growth tax cuts will produce enough extra economic \nactivity to offset 27 percent of their cost--$147 billion over 6 years. \nAnd just as we have seen with the budget savings, this assumption has \nbeen the focus of numerous criticisms from various groups. Mr. \nPresident, contrary to what some have said, assuming additional \nrevenues from economic growth--or revenue feedback as it is called--has \na long and credible history on both sides of the political aisle.\n  In 1982, the Congressional Budget Office found that ``between roughly \none-tenth and two-tenths of the static revenue loss'' from an across \nthe board tax cut would be recouped through revenue feedback during the \nfirst year. In later years, the CBO estimated that between one-third \nand one-half would be recouped in later years.\n  More recently, Clinton's Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee that reductions in American tariffs \nwould more than pay for themselves through increased exports and jobs.\n  And just this summer, Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist for the \nliberal Economic Strategy Institute argued in the Washington Post that \n``credible evidence overwhelmingly indicates that revenue feedback from \ntax cuts'' could be as high as 35 percent.\n  For those who are unimpressed with the estimates of economists and \naccountants, let me give two examples of how this feedback effect puts \nreal dollars in the pockets of both American families and Uncle Sam. In \n1981, the tax burden was at a similar record high as it is today. In \nresponse, newly elected President Ronald Reagan cut tax rates across \nthe board by 25 percent. Mr Reagan could have cut taxes in any number \nof ways, but he chose reducing marginal rates because he understood--as \ndoes Bob Dole--that cutting marginal rates encourages people to work \nharder, save more, and invest in economic growth and job creation.\n  The Reagan tax cut worked. In 1984, real GDP growth reached 6.8 \npercent--the highest single year growth since 1951. In President \nReagan's second term, growth averaged 3.4 percent per year--well above \nthe anemic 2.5 percent growth we have seen under President Clinton.\n  How did these tax cuts affect families. In addition to lowering their \noverall tax burden, the tax cuts of 1981 helped save family incomes \nfrom declining, as they had under President Carter. Instead, median \nfamily incomes grew 1.7 percent per year under Reagan, putting an \nadditional $4,000 in the typical families pockets every year.\n  Mr. Reagan was not the only President to recognize the growth \npotential of reducing marginal tax rates. In 1962, John Kennedy was \nalso adamant about cutting marginal tax rates. When he announced his \ntax cut plan in 1962, he explained his thinking with the following \nwords: ``I am not talking about a `quickie' or a temporary tax cut, \nwhich would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. . . . I \nam talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our \npresent tax system, developed as it was, during World War II to \nrestrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peacetime; that \nit reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, \nand risk-taking.''\n  The Kennedy tax rate cut proved to be one for the greatest economic \nsuccesses of the postwar era. Real GDP growth jumped to 5.8 percent in \n1964 and to 6.4 percent in 1965 and 1966. Today, the media calls growth \nrates half that size a surge.\n  Clearly there is a consensus that a tax cut like Bob Dole's will \npartially pay for itself through income revenue growth. As Nobel \nlaureate Professor\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\nGary Becker put it, the revenue feedback effect is ``basically Econ. \n101. Investors and workers in the economy respond in an important way \nto incentives, including tax incentives.'' Becker then points out that, \nif the Dole plan increases GDP growth from its current 2.3 to 3.5 \npercent over 6 years, the income growth effect will be ``far in excess \nof $147 billion. It would be more like $200 billion.''\n  Mr. President, I have a list of over 100 prominent economists, \nincluding four Nobel Laureates, who share Dr. Becker's support of \ncutting taxes and balancing the budget. These economists are from all \nover the country, but they have one thing in common--faith in the \nAmerican family and the ability of the American economy to grow faster \nthan 2 percent per year. By cutting marginal tax rates and allowing \nfamilies to keep more of what they earn--so they can spend it on their \npriorities rather than Congresses--the Dole plan will help the economy \ngrow faster, resulting in more jobs, more opportunity, and a higher \nstandard of living for everyone.\n  How do we offset the tax cuts? We restrain the growth of Government. \nBy limiting the future growth of Federal spending to 2 percent per \nyear, we can reduce income tax rates by 15 percent for every taxpayer, \nprovide a $500 per child tax credit for middle-class families, and cut \nthe capital gains tax rate in half--all while balancing the budget in \n2002. The Dole plan is the possible dream that will result in a \nsmaller, more efficient Government that allows families to keep more of \nwhat they earn, so they can spend it on their priorities rather than \nWashington's.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of economists be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Statement in Support of Bob Dole's Plan for Economic Growth\n\n       ``This is an excellent economic program.''--Milton \n     Friedman, Nobel Laureate.\n       ``The Dole Economic Growth Plan is much superior to the \n     Clinton do-nothing alternative.''--James M. Buchanan, Nobel \n     Laureate.\n       ``Senator Dole's plan . . . can raise the growth rate of \n     the economy to well over 3 percent per year.''--Gary Becker, \n     Nobel Laureate.\n       ``The Dole-Kemp program makes real economic sense at this \n     time.''--Merton H. Miller, Nobel Laureate.\n       Slow economic growth is America's number one economic \n     problem. Bob Dole's plan for Economic Growth, ``Restoring the \n     American Dream,'' is a bold, doable plan that addresses this \n     problem. By lowering marginal income tax rates and reducing \n     disincentives to save and invest--first steps to a \n     fundamentally lower, flatter, simpler and more savings-\n     encouraging tax system, balancing the budget through a \n     reduction in the growth of government spending, reforming our \n     education and job training system, and cutting back \n     government regulation and eliminating litigation excesses,\n\n     the plan will significantly increase economic growth, raise \n     real wages, and provide greater opportunities for all \n     Americans.\n       The numbers in Bob Dole's year-by-year strategy to both \n     reduce taxes and balance the budget are credible, including: \n     the baseline revenue projections; the income growth effect, a \n     simple implication of elementary economics through which the \n     economic growth plan changes incentives, raises taxable \n     income, and thereby offsets part of the revenue loss of the \n     tax cuts as described by the plan; the planned budgetary \n     savings achieved by reducing the growth of government \n     spending.\n       Bob Dole's plan is far superior to the approach of the \n     Clinton Administration, during which productivity growth has \n     slowed to a historic low and real wages have stagnated.\n           Signed,\n       Annelise Anderson, Hoover Institution; Martin Anderson, \n     Hoover Institution; Wayne Angell, Bear Stearns, Fmr Governor \n     of Federal Reserve Board.\n       Bruce Bartlett, National Center for Policy Analysis; Ben \n     Bernanke, Princeton University; Michael Boskin, Stanford \n     University, Fmr Chair, Council of Econ Advisers; David \n     Bradford, Princeton University; Stuart Butler, Heritage \n     Foundation; Richard C.K.

Mr. President, with the adjournment of the 104th \nCongress, the Senate will lose one of its most respected and \naccomplished members, Senator Claiborne Pell.\n  For a period that spans more than three decades, Senator Pell has \nserved Rhode Islanders and the Nation in the finest tradition of our \nelected civil servants. His accomplishments since coming to the Senate \nin 1961 are extraordinary; particularly in the areas of the arts and \nhumanities, environmental protection, foreign affairs, human rights, \nand education. He has without question touched and improved the lives \nof every American family.\n  Early in his Senate career, Senator Pell was the principal architect \nof the 1965 law establishing the National Endowment for the Arts and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities. One year later, he authored \nthe National Sea Grant College Act, legislation to encourage the \ncareful use of our resources from the sea, and to establish marine \nsciences programs at universities across the country.\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\n  Unquestionably, Senator Pell's most significant contribution in \neducation has been his effort to ensure that every student has the \nopportunity to pursue education and training beyond the high school \nlevel--financial barriers should not prevent a student from continuing \neducation. In pursuit of this goal, Senator Pell introduced legislation \nto establish the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, a program later \nnamed the Pell Grant Program in 1980. Last year alone, more than 3.6 \nmillion Pell grants were awarded to students attending institutions of \nhigher education. Since 1973, when the first Pell Grants were awarded, \nmore than 60 million grants have enabled students to meet their \neducational goals through this student financial assistance program.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell's remarkable record in the Senate has not \nbeen limited to education and the arts. Over the years, and through his \nleadership in foreign affairs as chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Pell has worked tirelessly on behalf of \nrefugees, against human rights abuses, and to reduce the threats from \nweapons of mass destruction. As a result of these efforts, treaties \nhave been ratified that reduce nuclear weapons, prohibit the \nemplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, and the use \nof environmental modification techniques as weapons of war.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell's legacy is one of hope, opportunity, and \nintegrity. For those of us who remain in the Senate, we are challenged \nto continue his important work on behalf of peace, and to ensure that \nour children can realize their fullest potential through the widest \npossible educational opportunities. We have all been enriched by \nSenator Pell's service in the Senate, and are deeply grateful for his \nimmeasurable contributions to the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11237-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr President, over the weekend I had the opportunity to \nread a report to the Foreign Relations Committee prepared by the \ndistinguished ranking minority member of the Committee, Senator \nClaiborne Pell.\n  The report, entitled ``Democracy: An Emerging Asian Value,'' details \nthe Senator from Rhode Island's recent trip to Asia. I was very \ninterested in the report because the countries Senator Pell visited--\nTaiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia--fall within the jurisdiction of the \nsubcommittee I chair, the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs. In fact, all three have been of special interest to me and \nhave been the subject of several hearings in the subcommittee.\n  I found the distinguished Senator's observations about this dynamic \nregion to be particularly cogent, and believe that our colleagues--and \nthe public at large--would benefit from having those observations \naccessible to them in the Record. However, since the report is somewhat \nlengthy in terms of it being reproduced in the Record, I am going to \ntreat one country at a time; today, Mr. President, I would direct the \nSenate's atttention to the portion of the report on Indonesia.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that pages 9 to 17 of S. \nPrt. 104-45, the section on Indonesia, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THOMAS. In closing, I must say that it has been a unique pleasure \nand honor to serve on the committee with its former Chairman, Senator \nPell. I appreciate his views and opinions, as well as his frequent \nparticipation in the work of my subcommittee. His departure from the \nSenate is a loss both to the committee and to the whole institution; he \nwill be missed.\n\n                    Excerpt From Senate Print 104-45\n\n                               Indonesia\n\n\n                            a. introduction\n\n       Indonesia is a vast, dynamic and complicated country. It \n     has the fourth largest population in the world and the \n     largest Muslim population in the world; yet it remains \n     strongly secular. The government is an authoritarian one, led \n     and dominated by President Soeharto, a small number of his \n     advisors and the military. There is no apparent successor to \n     Soeharto and no tested process in place for a transition of \n     power. The economy is increasingly open and deregulated, but \n     subject to widespread corruption and influence peddling.\n       There are a number of issues of interest to the United \n     States in Indonesia. Indonesia has had an impressive economic \n     development and an impressive increase in the average life \n     expectancy. There is a developing middle class. The \n     government has developed and implemented a model population \n     control program. The focus of my trip, however, was a visit \n     to East Timor. When I was in Indonesia in 1992, President \n     Soeharto refused my request to visit East Timor because it \n     was not convenient at that time. I appreciate his willingness \n     to allow me to visit during this trip.\n       It is important to note that there are other human rights \n     problems in Indonesia aside from those in East Timor. Many \n     independent human rights observer groups criticize government \n     policies in Ache and Irian Jaya. Issues such as freedom of \n     the press, freedom of speech, the right to form political \n     parties and the development of the rule of law are all of \n     substantial concern in Indonesia today.\n       In response to a request by the UN, Indonesia establishes a \n     National Commission on Human Rights to investigate human \n     rights issues country-wide. I met with several \n     representatives from the Commission in Jakarta and was \n     impressed with their dedication to improving the lives of \n     ordinary Indonesians. Their investigations are hampered, \n     however, by a lack of funding and staff. Still, they seem to \n     be operating truly independent of the government and I \n     commend their efforts.\n       That our delegation did not focus on human rights issues \n     outside of East Timor does not mean they are unimportant or \n     that they are unworthy of international attention. The \n     broader spectrum of human rights concerns will likely \n     continue to be an issue for U.S.-Indonesian relations for the \n     foreseeable future. Time limitations of our trip caused us to \n     focus our scrutiny primarily on East Timor.\n\n\n                             b. east timor\n\n       In December 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former \n     Portuguese colony, during a period of great political \n     upheaval in Lisbon, which meant that Portugal was in no \n     position to resist. The Indonesian military has committed \n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in the 20 \n     years since the invasion. The number of East Timorese who \n     have died from violence, abuse or starvation in these 21 \n     years will probably never be known, but there are credible \n     estimates that they could number as many as 200,000. A \n     particularly egregious incident took place on November 12, \n     1991, when the Indonesian military shot and killed over 200 \n     people (by most credible estimates, although the actual total \n     will likely never be known), during a peaceful demonstration. \n     By all accounts, the protesters were unarmed. This became \n     known alternatively as the Dili or Santa Cruz Massacre. While \n     no events on this scale have been reported since then, \n     widespread reports of abuse continue, including arbitrary \n     arrest, torture, disappearances and killings. I heard several \n     credible reports of these types of abuses while I was there.\n       Since I have been back in the U.S., there has been yet \n     another conflict between Indonesian troops and East Timorese \n     youth. The most recent disturbance took place in Baucau, a \n     small city on the northern coast, to the east of Dili. Early \n     news reports indicated that Catholic East Timorese had taken \n     to the streets to protest reports that Muslim Indonesians had \n     torn a picture of the Virgin Mary. The U.S. State Department \n     reported that roughly 80 were arrested and that the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been \n     given access to all of them. There were additional press \n     reports quoting East Timorese leaders saying that some of \n     those arrested had been mistreated.\n       Indonesia and Portugal have not had diplomatic relations \n     since the takeover. Since 1992, the foreign ministers of each \n     country have held talks under the auspices of the UN \n     Secretary General on East Timor, but these talks have \n     produced little. I met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali \n     Alatas in Jakarta and was particularly pleased to hear him \n     speak highly of Portugal's relatively-new Foreign Minister \n     Jaime Gama. For my part I attended the inauguration of \n     Portugal's new President, Jorge Sampaio, in April and was \n     struck by the new Government's interest in seeking some \n     accommodation with the Indonesians.\n       Alatas felt that Gama showed a new willingness to listen to \n     Indonesia's views, in contrast to his predecessor. I, too, am \n     impressed\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\n     with Gama and know his personal sense that the issue of East \n     Timor should be resolved. Alatas told me that they could work \n     toward a solution that would satisfy both countries and \n     the international community as long as both sides were \n     ``realistic'' in their position.\n       Sadly, Alatas did not mention the need to satisfy the \n     wishes of the people of East Timor, although, when I raised \n     it, he agreed it was important. I encourage continued talks \n     between Portugal and Indonesia and welcome positive movements \n     toward a solution. But I believe that any solution which does \n     not make the desires of the East Timorese as a paramount \n     concern will ultimately fail.\n       One of the most obvious issues for most East Timorese is \n     the strong presence of Indonesian military (ABRI) troops \n     stationed there. Government officials in East Timor, \n     including Governor Abilio Soares and Colonel Mahidin \n     Simbolon, the military commander, told me that Indonesia \n     stations in East Timor 15,403 troops (including police who, \n     in Indonesia, are a branch of the military). Government \n     officials in East Timor and in Jakarta said that there were \n     two primary reasons why such a force was needed in East \n     Timor.\n       First, they are said to be required to keep the peace \n     threatened by rebels, known as FRETILIN, of whom, according \n     to Colonel Simbolon, there are 188, armed with 88 weapons.\n       Second, the military force is needed to perform public \n     works projects such as building bridges, roads and houses. \n     The military commander told me that not only were ABRI troops \n     the only ones willing to go into remote villages to do such \n     work, but that when the government did pull some troops last \n     year, local leaders and villagers protested. He argued that \n     it was much less expensive to have military troops do these \n     projects than to have civilians do then.\n       I should note that East Timorese not in the government \n     strongly and repeatedly disputed the claims that only the \n     military can perform these tasks and that locals would \n     protest the removal of troops.\n       The vast majority of these ABRI troops are not East \n     Timorese. When asked why so few East Timorese held high level \n     positions in the military, Colonel Simbolon argued that not \n     enough East Timorese had gone through the military academy. \n     He told us only eleven East Timorese had graduated from \n     Indonesia's military academy and, of those eleven, one is a \n     first lieutenant and two are second lieutenants. These are \n     the highest-ranking East Timorese officers in ABRI. On the \n     police side, the highest-ranking East Timorese is a Major, \n     who is a traffic chief. Again, Simbolon made the argument \n     that the East Timorese were not qualified enough.\n       The presence of this armed, uniformed, non-Timorese force \n     in East Timor causes immense friction and conflict. The East \n     Timorese are ethnically different in culture and appearance \n     from other Indonesian ethnic groups. I was repeatedly told \n     that Indonesian military and police routinely treat the East \n     Timorese with disdain and even contempt. Simply put, the \n     people of East Timor feel they are subjected by a foreign \n     army of occupation.\n       I firmly believe that a tremendous amount of the tension \n     and conflict which exists in East Timor could be relieved if \n     Indonesia were to slash its troop levels there and turn over \n     authority at all levels to East Timorese citizens. Governor \n     Soares and Colonel Simbolon agreed that this could help the \n     situation, but offered no ideas on how such a change could \n     come about.\n       Governor Soares and Armindo Mariano, head of the Golkar \n     Party in East Timor, are both East Timorese and both stressed \n     in our meetings that they were working to improve the \n     ``Timorization'' of the local government. Mariano has been a \n     participant in the All-Timorese dialogue, a forum sponsored \n     by the UN Secretary General for East Timor--current residents \n     and those in exile--to explore practical measures to improve \n     the situation there. It is not a forum for discussing East \n     Timor's political status.\n       Both Soares and Mariano are firm in their conviction that \n     East Timor will develop and prosper only as a part of \n     Indonesia. When asked how many East Timorese supported \n     integration with Indonesia, both said the majority did.\n       But East Timorese who are not a part of the government and \n     other observers living in East Timor quickly and insistently \n     contradict this. When asked how a plebiscite on the issue of \n     independence versus integration would turn out, I was told \n     that over 90% of the people would choose independence and \n     that number would include some who formerly supported \n     integration.\n       The personification of East Timorese resistance to \n     Indonesia's occupation of the territory is Commander Xanana \n     Gusmao, who, at the time he was captured in 1992, was the \n     leader of the armed resistance. He remains the titular head \n     of the East Timor-based National Council of Maubere \n     Resistance (CNRM), which he founded in 1988 to unify East \n     Timor's various political and armed resistance groups.\n       Since his arrest and trial he has been imprisoned in \n     Jakarta where, he is visited regularly by the ICRC and by all \n     accounts is treated in accordance with international norms. \n     Xanana, as he is commonly known, has attained a status for \n     East Timorese similar to that which Nelson Mandela had for \n     black South Africans while he was in prison.\n       I was eager to meet with him while I was in Jakarta both to \n     get to know a person who has such a reputation in East Timor \n     and to learn his current thinking on the possibilities for a \n     political settlement of the East Timor situation.\n       Through I made a request of the Indonesian government for \n     permission to visit Xanana before I left the U.S. and \n     repeated the request in each of the meetings I had in \n     Jakarta, I did not receive permission to see him.\n       From East Timor I wrote him a letter inquiring about the \n     conditions of his imprisonment and his views on East Timor's \n     future. (A copy is printed at the conclusion of this report.) \n     I then request the letter be delivered to him, but that \n     request was refused. The Indonesian Correctional Authorities \n     deemed my message to Xanana ``political'' and therefore \n     prohibited.\n       Whenever the possible independence of East Timor is \n     discussed, talk quickly turns to its potential economic \n     viability. The territory has few natural resources, but \n     advocates of independence point out that many independent \n     Pacific island nations also have few or no resources. One \n     person questioned what economic independence meant in an era \n     of increasing international economic interdependence.\n       Florentino Sarmento, the head of East Timor's largest non-\n     governmental organization, Etadep, and a delegate to the All-\n     Timorese dialogue, acknowledged that going it alone would be \n     difficult, but was convinced that a solution could be found \n     especially with consultation with political leaders abroad.\n       In regard to natural resources, East Timor's most valuable \n     crop is coffee. I was able to visit a coffee cooperative \n     started last year and funded by USAID. The cooperative, \n     carried out by the National Cooperative Business Association, \n     started with only 700 farming families and $7 million in \n     USAID seed money. It now boasts 6,700 families and expects to \n     turn a profit as early as the end of this year. Project \n     director Sam Filiaci stressed he is not there for charity; he \n     is developing a money-making organization that will provide \n     lasting economic advantage to all involved, and especially to \n     East Timorese coffee growers.\n       On the day I visited one of their processing plants in a \n     remote mountain location, farmers from miles around gathered. \n     Proud of their skill and of their new facilities, these \n     people also told stories of harassment by the military and \n     police (who turned out in a large force for my visit) and of \n     insistent pressure on the farmers to move out of the \n     mountains and down to the more populous areas on the coast.\n\n\n                          c. the church's view\n\n       East Timor is an overwhelmingly Catholic entity. More than \n     90% of the population is Catholic and the Church occupies a \n     critical role in the lives of its citizens. The Church also \n     plays a large role in the communication between East Timorese \n     and those in the United States who are interested in the fate \n     of this land. A number of Portuguese priests previously \n     stationed in East Timor, along with a number of Timorese \n     priests, now live in the U.S.\n       I had hoped to meet with the Bishop of East Timor, Msgr. \n     Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo. Bishop Belo is widely admired for \n     his forthright objections to Indonesian human rights abuses \n     and is a vital leader of his people. Regrettably, he was away \n     from East Timor during my visit, through we were able to talk \n     by phone.\n       I was able to meet with eleven priests from a variety of \n     East Timorese parishes in what was by far the most fruitful \n     and dramatic meeting of my trip. Sitting in a large room with \n     open windows, using a microphone to be heard and taping the \n     conversation, these priests gradually and fearlessly opened \n     up to me and told me what they had seen and heard in their \n     parishes over the last 20 years.\n       They spoke of military harassment of the Church that varies \n     from obstructing their ability to meet with their \n     parishioners to trying to create mistrust among the people of \n     the Church. One priest told me ABRI tries to reinterpret his \n     interest in the welfare of his parishioners as political \n     opposition to Indonesia and integration. No one at the \n     meeting had ever been arrested by the Indonesian authorities, \n     but several had been detained and interrogated by them, for \n     up to ten hours at a time. One told me of receiving a letter \n     signed by the police insisting that he leave town for a \n     month, although he proudly said he never left. The worst of \n     these interrogations took place in 1991 and 1992, in the \n     aftermath of the Santa Cruz massacre.\n       None of the priests had been present at the 1991 massacre \n     but one told us, with great emotion, of his experiences that \n     day and in the months afterwards. His home is near the Santa \n     Cruz cemetery where the massacre occurred. He had heard the \n     shots that morning, but thought at first they were the \n     rumblings of a storm. When he went out later, he heard from \n     people what had happened and he went to the cemetery and \n     tried to give last rites to those who were dying or dead. The \n     military would not let him approach and tried to make him \n     leave. He stayed anyway and soon saw three large military \n     trucks approach and be loaded with corpses. Then he saw other \n     trucks come that were filled with water and he watched them \n     spray the blood off the ground where the killings had taken \n     place.\n       The wounded were all taken to military hospitals, he said. \n     He then proceeded, without prompting, to confirm the stories \n     I had read and been told earlier, that no one was\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\n     allowed to visit these wounded in the hospitals, not even the \n     priests. Again, he was unable to give last rites to the \n     dying. He estimated that in the month following the massacre \n     as many people died in the hospitals, either from poor \n     treatment or from torture, as had been killed in the \n     cemetery. He told of hearing eyewitness accounts of mass \n     graves holding as many as 100 corpses in one pit. He said the \n     month following the massacre came to be know as ``The Second \n     Massacre.''\n       When asked about the type of human rights abuses that occur \n     today, the priests argued that the fundamental human right of \n     any people is that of self-determination. The people of East \n     Timor have been denied that right for over 20 years and all \n     other rights abuses follow from that fact. They asked me how \n     far the U.S. government and the U.S. people were willing to \n     go in helping East Timor in its struggle for self \n     determination? They asked why, if the U.S. government says it \n     cares about human rights and cares about human rights abuses \n     in East Timor, it still continues to support the government \n     of Indonesia on its occupation of East Timor?\n       Emotions around the room continued to rise, both from those \n     telling the stories and those of us listening to them. I was \n     struck by the knowledge that 5 years previously this group \n     would have risked the sudden intrusion of armed ABRI \n     officials, as the priests systematically contradicted \n     everything Indonesian government officials in Jakarta and in \n     Dili had said, the people of East Timor resist integration \n     into Indonesia as strongly now as they did 20 years ago. \n     There is an ``ebb and flow'' quality to the resistance; the \n     Indonesians gain the upper hand [through various forms of \n     intimidation] and the East Timorese temporarily retreat. When \n     Indonesia seems to lighten up a bit, and the East Timorese \n     ``have the courage to shout,'' the resistance pushes back, \n     but ABRI always comes back again, in a ``continuous game.'' \n     They provided a document listing the exact type and number of \n     troops located throughout East Timor (a translated copy of \n     this document is attached as an appendix to this report) to \n     show us how pervasive and strong the military is there. When \n     asked about Indonesia's argument that it has poured more \n     economic investment into East Timor than into any other \n     province in Indonesia, they responded disdainfully that ``the \n     people are not willing to sell their liberty for all the gold \n     in the world.''\n       Finally, I asked the fundamental question I had asked in \n     all the meetings: if it were possible to hold a plebiscite in \n     East Timor, offering a choice of political arrangements from \n     autonomy to integration, how would the people vote? This \n     classical political science-approach to finding a solution \n     was met with hard nosed realism: how can you even hold out \n     this approach to a people who have suffered so much for 20 \n     years? More importantly--and fundamentally--after over 20 \n     years of continued resistance in the face of abuse, even \n     torture and death, have not the people of East Timor already \n     made their preference clear? Does not their resistance itself \n     constitute a referendum? What more proof do you need that the \n     people of East Timor want independence from Indonesia?\n       To confirm this message, the acting rector of the \n     University of East Timor, handed me a letter at the airport \n     as we were leaving Dili, in full view of my ever-present \n     official escort. By all accounts I have heard, I believe he \n     was probably questioned after we left; one only hopes that \n     his position will protect him from rougher treatment. The \n     letter was written and signed by five university students, \n     and asks the U.S. Congress to support East Timor in its \n     struggle for independence from Indonesia. (A copy of the \n     letter is printed as an annex to this report.) The end of the \n     letter was particularly moving, as it thanked me for coming \n     and hoped that my visit was ``independent,'' because they \n     were concerned that Indonesia sponsored the visits of other \n     delegations in order to ``shut their mouth and close their \n     eyes.''\n\n\n                    d. conclusion and recommendation\n\n       By the time of my departure, it was clear to me that the \n     people of East Timor continue to resist the often heavy \n     handed occupation of their island by Indonesia. The \n     resistance takes many forms and, while armed resistance and \n     physical resistance may have diminished, it was evident that \n     the people of East Timor practice an emotional and \n     intellectual resistance that no amount of military pressure \n     will ever be able to suppress.\n       Yet it was also evident that Indonesia will not, in the \n     foreseeable future, grant East Timor either the autonomy it \n     clearly wants or a process for determining its own future. \n     How, then, can U.S. policy bridge the gulf?\n       The U.N. can both help and hurt. The U.N. sponsored talks \n     between Portuguese Foreign Minister Gama and Indonesian \n     Foreign Minister Alatas can bring positive results. But these \n     talks run a serious risk of ignoring the views and wishes of \n     the East Timorese themselves. The All-Timorese dialogue \n     offers more hope, although for the moment the political \n     status of East Timor is not on the table for discussion. The \n     best outcome of these two series of talks would be the \n     implementation of confidence-building measures such as some \n     form of autonomy for East Timor; a reduction in Indonesian \n     troop strength; and an increase in the number of East \n     Timorese in leadership positions in Dili.\n       Progress in any of these areas would, I believe, be welcome \n     in East Timor and would ease some of the stark anti-\n     Indonesian sentiment there. Passions could calm and economic \n     initiatives, such as the coffee project, could develop. Then \n     a compromise solution between the East Timorese and the \n     Indonesians might be found. The key is that the East \n     Timorese themselves must be a part of the solution from \n     the beginning. A deal struck between Portugal and \n     Indonesia or between Alatas and Boutros Ghali, or between \n     Jakarta and Washington will not provide the solution. No \n     true and lasting solution can come without East Timorese \n     input; no solution that is seen as being imposed from \n     above will work.\n       Indonesia is one of the most important countries in the \n     region and will grow increasingly important. It is evident \n     that the U.S. should have close relations with Indonesia. \n     Both countries have mutual strategic, economic and \n     environmental interests and would benefit from increased \n     cooperation in those areas.\n       But Indonesia also has serious shortcomings in the way it \n     treats the East Timorese and others of its citizens and it is \n     important that, in our dealings with Indonesia, we not ignore \n     or downplay the fact of these serious human rights problems.\n       When we have an important bilateral relationship with a \n     country in which there are human rights problems, there are \n     those who argue that we should downplay the human rights \n     concerns and focus, instead, on those areas of mutual \n     interest, such as strategic or economic, which can strengthen \n     the relationship. Their theory is that a stronger \n     relationship might encourage more progress on human rights. I \n     do not agree with that approach.\n       U.S. support for human rights in other countries does \n     matter. All the East Timorese I met told me that foreign \n     pressure, and especially U.S. pressure, had succeeded in \n     moving the Indonesian government. Our ability to effect \n     changes in the human rights politics of Indonesia and other \n     countries may be limited, but it is important for our nation \n     to make every effort to do so.\n       I believe we could have a better and closer relationship \n     with Indonesia if the government would take what seem to me \n     to be relatively easy steps. If, for example, they would \n     switch from a ``heavy'' hand to a ``light'' hand in East \n     Timor, they would gain improved relations with the U.S. and \n     other countries and would, in my view, lose little.\n       Quite aside from its policies toward East Timor, Indonesia \n     is quickly approaching a critical point in its political \n     development. President Soeharto's sixth 5-year term in office \n     will end in 1998. While he has been quoted in the press as \n     saying he will not run for a seventh term, most political \n     analysts fully expect him to be in office for life. There is \n     no chosen successor nor established process for succession.\n       Indonesian citizens cannot change the government by \n     democratic means. The government is still heavily dominated \n     by GOLKAR, the President's party. The government appoints \n     half the members of the People's Consultative Assembly, \n     theoretically the highest authority of the state, and the \n     Assembly in turn elects the President and Vice-President. The \n     military is automatically given 15% of the seats in the \n     National Parliament and while 80% of the Parliament is \n     elected, there are only three legal political parties. Civil \n     liberties, such as freedom of speech and assembly or freedom \n     of the press, are severely restricted.\n       Indonesia has actively worked to open its economy while \n     keeping its political system relatively closed. Deregulation \n     and moving away from central control has brought tremendous \n     growth and development, of which the Indonesian government is \n     rightfully proud. Could not the same be done in the political \n     sphere?\n       Indonesia has the potential to be a great nation with \n     world-wide influence. But it will never reach that goal with \n     the anachronistic, authoritarian style of government it \n     currently has. There are limited signs that this system may \n     be loosening. The Court system has taken steps toward \n     functioning independently, but it is not yet truly \n     independent. There are some non-government organizations that \n     criticize government policies, but they still operate in an \n     atmosphere of surveillance and fear of retaliation.\n       Indonesia should follow the example of Taiwan in the late \n     1980s and 1990s and take strong steps toward a true \n     democratic system. One important change it could make now \n     would be to legalize the formation of other political \n     parties. The region and even the world has much to gain from \n     a democratic Indonesia. The U.S. should offer assistance and \n     encouragement where ever possible and adopt policies that \n     will help move Indonesia toward that goal.\n       I hope that Jakarta will take seriously the recommendations \n     in this report, work for a solution that is acceptable to all \n     parties, put the issue of East Timor behind them, move toward \n     democracy, and become the important international power it is \n     meant to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11238-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11240-S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Bill Cohen's decision not to seek \nreelection at the end of the 104th Congress deprives the U.S. Senate of \none of its most respected Members.\n  Senator Cohen leaves behind a long and impressive career of public \nservice for the people of Maine. With his election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1973, Senator Cohen represented his constituents \nfrom Maine\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\ndiligently, and continued his efforts upon his election to the U.S. \nSenate in 1978.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cohen has remained a moderate and thoughtful \nvoice in a Senate that is increasingly marked by strident and partisan \ndebate. Senator Cohen has attempted to rise above partisan politics to \naccomplish what is best for the people of Maine and the Nation. In \n1991, Senator Cohen voted to override a veto of an extension of \nunemployment benefits, at a time when America's families were beginning \nto feel the effects of an economic recession. In the 103d Congress, \nSenator Cohen participated in a bipartisan coalition that attempted to \noverhaul the U.S. health care system, after the administration's \nefforts were not successful.\n  During the 104th Congress, I have had the distinct pleasure of \nworking with Senator Cohen in the Centrist Coalition. A group of about \n20 Senators, the Centrist Coalition worked to reach agreement on a \ncomprehensive budget alternative to those put forward by President \nClinton and the Republican leadership. The plan we developed built upon \nthe suggestions of the National Governors' Association with respect to \nthe Medicaid and welfare programs. It also built in needed flexibility \nfor States, while preserving the social safety net for our Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations. It was the only bipartisan budget \nalternative that received significant support in the 104th Congress, \nand I am proud to have been part of that effort.\n  Mr. President, throughout his political career Senator Cohen has held \ngovernment officials accountable to the high ethical standards that \npeople expect of their elected leaders, regardless of party \naffiliation. This was evident during courageous votes he made during \nWatergate and the investigation of the Iran Contra affair.\n  Senator Cohen also helped create the independent counsel law, which \nmandates the appointment of an independent counsel to probe allegations \nagainst certain high executive branch officials. Further, Senator Cohen \nsponsored legislation to require that contacts between lobbyists and \nMembers of Congress are officially reported.\n  Mr. President, we are all grateful for Senator Cohen's dedicated \nservice and tireless efforts in the U.S. Senate. Senator Cohen's \ndistinguished Senate career is a testament to his hard work on behalf \nof the people of Maine and the Nation. His insightful approach to the \nchallenges we face as a nation will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11240-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11241-S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAREWELL ADDRESS TO AMERICA\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, all Members of the Senate are faced with \ndifficult decisions almost on a daily basis. The day of my announcement \nnot to seek a fourth term in the Senate--March 29, 1995--was one of the \nmost difficult of my life. By that day, I had been wrestling with this \ndecision for some time. There had been some health problems, but I was \nfully confident of running for and winning a fourth term. I have always \nloved campaigning, and getting back on the trail was a powerful \ntemptation. The reality was, however, that another term would have \ntaken me well beyond the normal age for retirement. I am 75 and would \nhave been 81 by the end of another term. Ultimately, the decision was \nthat the time had come to pass the torch to another generation.\n  Anyone who has ever held a Senate seat understands the magnitude of \nthis great constitutional responsibility. The Senate is an awesome \ninstitution, and the opportunity to serve there is one of the highest \nhonors that can be bestowed upon any individual. For anyone in public \nlife who has attained the confidence of the people to carry out such a \nresponsibility, the decision to leave voluntarily is a difficult one, \neven when we know that it is best for ourselves, our State, and our \nNation. It is a bittersweet decision that stems from a solemn \nresponsibility. Those returning to the 105th Congress already know \nthis; those who will be joining that Congress in the coming days will \nsoon come to that realization.\n  As Senators, we have to be students of the issues. It is important to \nbe impartial, fair-minded, and willing to listen to opposing views. My \ndecisions and votes have been based upon conscientious beliefs \nmotivated by what I thought was in the best interests of my State and \nNation, but sometimes tempered by the views of a sizable portion of my \nconstituency. No doubt, Alabamians and my party were confounded at \ntimes, but hopefully, they understood that my positions were based on \nwhat I believed to be right.\n  One of our responsibilities as Senators is to sometimes take stands \nand positions with which the majority of citizens in our States do not \nagree. The difficulty of taking such unpopular stands and decisions \ncannot be overestimated. It can be a wrenching experience, as was the \nvote on the 1993 budget reconciliation legislation which raised taxes--\neven though primarily on a small number of wealthy individuals--but \nwhich also headed us in the right direction in terms of deficit \nreduction. This 1993 budget reconciliation bill had been grossly \ndistorted and mischaracterized by its opponents almost beyond \nrecognition. Several courageous Members of Congress who supported it \nwere defeated in the next election. Since then, the economic and \nbudgetary figures and forecasts show that supporting that bill was the \nright thing for the Nation.\n  In any case, since our first duty under the Constitution is to our \ncountry as a whole, these times and politically difficult situations \nwill inevitably arise. Rather than running away from these stands, \nSenators have to meet them directly, stand firm, and explain to our \nconstituents why we believe we are right. Although they might never \nagree with us, over time, they will understand and respect us for \nassuming responsibility. This will be even more true in the new \nCongress, the Congress whose leaders, along with the President sworn in \non January 20, 1997, will take the country right into the new century \nand millennium.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have had to oppose Supreme \nCourt nominees I thought to be ill-suited by temperament or background \nto serve on the Nation's highest court. On other occasions, I have \nsupported nominees whom I knew not to be popular among my constituents, \nbut who deserved my support.\n  Despite criticism that the Senate is no longer the great forum for \ndebate and policymaking established by the Founders, there have been \nmany examples of such debate during my tenure. These are times when the \nSenate as an institution soars, when Members are the statesmen they are \nelected to be.\n  One such time was the debate on the resolution authorizing military \naction in the Persian Gulf in early 1991. It was one of those rare \nmoments when each and every Member had to look deep within his or her \nsoul and go on record telling the American people either why they would \nallow young men and women to be sent into harm's way without a \ndeclaration of war, or why they could oppose the President of the \nUnited States and an entire world coalition poised to thwart \naggression. As each Senator spoke, you could see and feel the deep \nemotion that seemed to emanate from the very heart of each speaker. \nEach decision, each vote, was profoundly personal. Many of us had \nserved in the military and knew something of the horrors of military \noperations, even if those operations were successful. I know of no one \nwho did not understand the gravity of what we were deciding.\n\n  Ultimately, the Senate voted narrowly, 52 to 47, to authorize the use \nof force to eject Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait. Despite \nreservations and uncertainty, I was one of a few from my party who \nsupported the authorization. All we could draw from in making this \ndecision was our own experience and knowledge, our faith in the \nAmerican Armed Forces, and the collective will of the civilian and \nmilitary leaders to ensure victory. I would venture that most of us \nsaid a private prayer before casting our votes, hoping that we were \ndoing the right thing and that events would vindicate us. I was struck \nat the sincerity and emotion surrounding this debate, and, as a \nSenator, was proud to have taken part. I thought to myself that this \nwas the kind of debate the Founders envisioned.\n  Another one of these dramatic and emotional debates took place on the \nSenate floor on July 22, 1993. One Senator had offered an amendment to \npending legislation to grant an extension of the United Daughters of \nthe Confederacy patent outside the normal\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\nprocess established by the Patent and Trademark Office. Only a very \nsmall number of organizations had ever been granted patents by the \nSenate, with the United Daughters of the Confederacy being one of \nthose. This extension by the Senate would place that body's stamp of \napproval on the group's patent. Part of its insignia is a Confederate \nnational flag.\n  Freshman Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, the only black \nMember of the Senate and the first-ever female black Member in all its \nhistory, came to the floor to oppose the amendment. She spoke \neloquently on the floor of the issue of race, of symbolism, of \ndivision, and of intolerance. Her passion, candor, spirit, emotion, and \ndetermination moved the Chamber in a way that I have rarely witnessed. \nOne by one, Members began articulating very personal statements about \ntheir feelings on race relations in this country and the lingering \nsymbolism and emotions that complicate those relations.\n  As I listened to the debate, I felt a deep personal conflict as to \nhow I should vote on this amendment. I was torn between my love for my \nnative South and the racial conflicts which remain in America today.\n  I come from an ancestral background deeply rooted in the Old \nConfederacy. One of my great-grandfathers was one of the signers of the \nOrdinance of Secession by which the State of Alabama seceded from the \nUnion in 1860. My paternal grandfather was a surgeon in the Confederate \nArmy. History always provides perspectives on a particular time in the \nlife of a nation, and I have always had a firm belief with regard to my \nfamily's background that they did what they thought was right at that \ntime and in those circumstances. I have always revered my family and \nrespected those who thought what they were doing at that particular \ntime in our history was morally correct.\n  Ultimately, it became clear that the issue was primarily one of \nsymbolism. By adopting this amendment, which would put the Senate's \nstamp of approval on an insignia carrying the Confederate flag in a \nvery special and honorific manner, we would not serve the causes of \nadvancing race relations or healing wounds. It would not be a step \nforward. I felt that if my ancestors were alive today and witnessing \nthat debate, they would stand for what is right and honorable and would \nwant to take a symbolic step forward.\n  In this case, one Senator, acting upon the courage of her convictions \nand her unique perspectives as an African-American, helped reverse a \ndecision of the Senate. I thought again about how the Senate as an \ninstitution was fulfilling the promise of the Founders. New and \nreturning Members of this body, as well as the House of \nRepresentatives, will no doubt face similar debates and issues which \nwill test and challenge the Congress.\n  Despite these proud moments in the life of the Senate and Congress, \nthere is still the perception among the vast majority of Americans that \nthe system as a whole does not work as it should. They feel strongly \nthat government does not respond to their needs. In many cases, they \nview it as being totally irrelevant to their daily lives and \nexperiences. Ironically, as more and more information about government \nhas become available over the last decade, the alienation of the \ncitizenry has increased. Despite the C-Span cameras, the proliferation \nof constituent-service staff, and the plethora of news, both written \nand broadcast, people still feel that they are somehow cut out of the \npolitical process. This is one of the gravest problems the new Congress \nand administration will face as they approach the next century, since \nit undermines the very legitimacy of our democratic form of government.\n\n  There are any number of reasons for this ongoing alienation. Gridlock \nbetween the two Houses of Congress, between the political parties, and \nbetween the Congress and White House is most often cited as the primary \nreason for the public's disgust. A certain amount of what is called \ngridlock, however, is built into the system by the Constitution. \nCongress is, by design, an institution which moves rather slowly in \nmaking law. This is especially true of the Senate, where the wishes of \na cohesive minority hold considerable sway. This is so the passions of \nthe moment are allowed to cool before laws are passed. Careful \ndeliberation, analysis, and long-range thinking were important to the \nFounders, and these are usually necessary ingredients in legislating. \nIf anything, the Congress which will be sworn in shortly will not have \nenough of these ingredients. Few in their right mind will argue that it \nsuffers from too much deliberation, analysis, or thought. In fact, it \nwill need more.\n  If we look back over the last few years and compare passed conditions \nwith those in mid-1996, we see that we have made tremendous strides. We \nwon the cold war; our economy is healthy; we have the lowest combined \nrates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years; the budget deficit is \ndecreasing even faster than rosy projections earlier predicted; and our \nnational defense and international diplomatic structure are strong. \nMillions of new jobs in basic industries like automobiles and \nconstruction have been created and for 3 years in a row, we have had a \nrecord number of new businesses started in our country. More and more \nbusinesses are making capital investments, a strong sign of economic \nprosperity. The rate of violent crime is coming down all across \nAmerica, although we still have a long way to go to make our streets \nsafe. Race relations are still not anywhere near what they should be, \nbut civil rights laws have helped secure the promise of America for \nmore of our citizens than ever. The road toward equal opportunity for \nall persons, regardless of race, color, gender, creed, or other station \nin life has many miles to go, but we should be proud of the progress we \nhave made and build upon it for the future.\n  In terms of the institution of Congress itself, there is no doubt \nthat it has made great strides in terms of ethics and behavioral \nstandards. People might not want to hear it or believe it, but the \npeople we have serving in Congress today are the most ethical and least \ncorrupt of any in its history. I served on the Senate Ethics Committee \nfor a total of 13 years as either chairman or vice chairman, and can \nsay definitively that the vast majority of Members tried their best to \ncomply with ethical standards and rules. The perception that they are \nhere to enrich themselves at taxpayers' expense is simply false. \nSenators were always coming to the Ethics Committee trying to comply \nwith the rules, not to get around them. Of course, there are inevitable \nlapses, as would be the case with any large organization made up of \npeople from all over the country and from all kinds of backgrounds, \nsome of low standards of integrity. From the perspective of ``how it \nused to be,'' the taxpayers are vastly better off now than in decades \npassed, regardless of the perceptions and media distortions.\n  We have accomplished a great deal and have made tangible progress. \nWhy don't people recognize these areas of progress? Part of the answer \nundoubtedly lies in the fact that we no longer have a common, external \nenemy at which to direct our considerable energies. For the first 40 or \nso years after World War II, communism was our greatest threat. It \ncaused the Government and the public to rally together toward its \nultimate defeat. In the early 1990's, as that promise was realized, \npeople seemed to turn toward one another and ask ``What now?\"\n  As I watched in amazement as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, I couldn't \nhelp but feel that somehow, many Americans were missing the event's \ntrue significance. Our victory in the cold war did not seem to have the \nresonance around the country that one would expect. For decades, our \nentire defense and foreign policy had been formulated around the goal \nof fighting communism. It was truly astounding that our resources could \nnow be channeled elsewhere. And yet, the passion, the excitement, the \nrelief just didn't seem to be there. Almost immediately, a sizable \nsegment of the population seemed to begin searching for another enemy. \nUnfortunately, there are those whose primary motivation is the hatred \nof an enemy. There was talk of a peace dividend. Various special \ninterest groups staked their claims to pieces of that dividend, while \nothers wanted to substantially reduce taxes. New enemies were found \nwithin our own borders as the competition arose for still-scarce \nresources.\n\n  As the cold war ended, the mounting budget deficit and national debt \nbecame a policy issue. There would really\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\nnot be a peace dividend, as such, since our fiscal house was not in \norder. I had long supported a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget, but by the mid-1990's, it had gained broad public \nsupport and majority support in Congress, but still not the two-thirds \nneeded to send it to the States for ratification.\n  Sadly, what brought us to such a serious budgetary state was a \nfailure on the part of our Government to address our fiscal problems \nbefore they nearly spiralled out of control. It was the fault of the \npolitical parties, the Congress, and the President. But it was also the \nfault of the public for expecting and demanding so much, much of it \ncontradictory to the long-term health of our economy. Government \nleaders should have had the courage to say no much more often than they \ndid. We all have to accept responsibility for our mistakes if we are to \nmove forward and continue to bring down the deficit. It does no good to \nblame each other; it does profound good to acknowledge mistakes and \ncollectively dedicate ourselves to fiscal discipline and the modest \nsacrifice it requires.\n  Regardless of the legitimacy of public perceptions, the alienation \nand frustration with our Government are real threats to the stability \nof our Nation. Unless they feel like they are a part of the process and \nable to influence its outcome, the alienation and frustration will only \ngrow and intensify.\n  For much of our history, our national leaders and political parties \nadopted mainstream, centrist policies aimed at securing economic \nsecurity and promoting opportunity. Of course, there are times when \nthis has not been the case, but Government has worked best when it has \noperated from the center of the spectrum. Only when we have strayed too \nfar to the left or right have we fallen so out of favor with the \ncitizenry. To a great degree, that is what has happened over the last \nfew years, with Democrats becoming more liberal and Republicans \nbecoming more conservative. Since the vast majority of the people are \npolitically moderate in their beliefs and values, they have become, in \na sense, alienated from both sides, not comfortable with the extreme \nviews the parties have adopted. The bipartisanship that is so crucial \nto the operation of Congress, especially the Senate, has been abandoned \nfor quick fixes, sound bites, and, most harmfully, the frequent \ndemonization of those with whom we disagree.\n  It is supremely ironic that as we try to foster democratic principles \nthroughout the rest of the world and have seen democracy make great \nstrides in many areas, we seem to face our strongest threat from \nwithin. Some elected officials, media personalities, extreme elements \nwithin political parties, and single-issue organizations strive to pit \none group of Americans against another. The focus on divisive issues \nhas increased the alienation and driven us farther and farther apart.\n  In my judgment, much of the answer to this alienation lies in what I \ncall compassionate moderation. Instead of being so concerned with \npolicies which are left and right, Government should be concerned with \nthe principles of right and wrong that come from approaching issues in \nmeasured, moderate, and compassionate tones. Both compassion and \nmoderation must be seeded in basic conservatism and responsibility, \nrooted to induce individualistic growth and opportunity. Even where \nvoters opt for change, they do not favor extremism; instead, they want \ncarefully crafted and nuanced policies that address the concerns of the \nmajority and, where needed, the disadvantaged in our society. This is \nthe kind of responsible and compassionate moderation upon which our \nNation was founded. Our Constitution itself came about through a series \nof great compromises; it was not written by ideologues who clung to \ntheir way or no way. Compromise and negotiation--the hallmarks of \nmoderation--aimed at achieving moderate, centrist policies for our \ncountry should not be viewed as negatives. They should be valued, for \nthat is the only way to reach consensus on complicated issues and \nproblems that face us.\n  By being compassionately moderate in our attitudes, we can govern \nourselves responsibly and reach the potential which we have yet to \nattain. Thomas Jefferson demonstrated a belief in the concept of \ncompassionate moderation when he called for basic republican simplicity \nin institutions and manners. He knew that a limitation on Government \ndid not mean the abdication of the Government's responsibility. \nSimilarly, in his own farewell address to the Nation, President \nEisenhower said that:\n\n       It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to \n     integrate forces, new and old, within the principles of our \n     democratic system--ever aiming toward the supreme goals of \n     our free society.\n  Both of these great leaders envisioned a strong, but limited, \nNational Government which could balance competing interests in the \npursuit of overall liberty and equality.\n  During his term as Vice President, Jefferson once asked for a room in \nBaltimore's preeminent hotel. Not recognizing the Vice President, who \nhad shown up alone and in soiled working clothes, the owner turned him \naway. Shortly after Jefferson's departure, the owner was told that he \nhad just sent away the Vice President of the United States. The \nhorrified proprietor immediately dispatched some of his workers to find \nJefferson and offer him as many rooms as he liked. The Vice President \nhad already taken a room at another, more modest, hotel, and sent the \nman who found him back to the owner with this message:\n\n       Tell [the owner] that I value his good intentions highly, \n     but if he has no room for a dirty farmer, he shall have none \n     for the Vice President.\n\n  Our Government's greatest successes have come about precisely because \nit has made room for dirty farmers and all kinds of hard workers. It \nhas made room for those who want to work hard, but who might be \ndisadvantaged by poverty, injustice, or oppression. It has never been \nthe task of Government to guarantee success to everyone across-the-\nboard. Instead, it has been to ensure, through responsible sensitivity \nand compassion, that everyone has the opportunity to work toward the \nkind of life and success for which we all strive given the same \nopportunities. When we fall short, it should not be because Government \nhas done the wrong thing, whether too much or too little--it should be \nonly because we as individuals did not take advantage of the \nopportunities afforded by our free society through our Constitution and \nbacked up by representative, democratic Government.\n  The extreme elements of our Government must realize that compromise \nis not bad, that we can be compassionate and responsible at the same \ntime by being moderate in our approach to public policy. No one of us \ncan remake Government or society in our own image. With 535 Members of \nCongress, thousands of executive branch officials, constitutionally \nmandated checks and balances, shared power, and a strong two-party \npolitical system, compromise is an inherent necessity. If compromise is \nabandoned for rigid ideology, the system cannot work as it was \nintended. Frequently, it becomes a hostage to gridlock and inaction.\n  If we look back over history, we see that moderation and centrism in \nGovernment have led to some rather remarkable achievements. As we \nponder the cynicism and disfavor with which the Government is viewed \ntoday, it occurs to me that we may have, in some ways, become victims \nof our own successes. As more and more is taken for granted, standards \nare set higher, often unrealistically so. This results in recurring \ndisappointment.\n  In 1954, ours was a country where poll taxes separated millions of \ncitizens from their basic right to vote. Restaurants, hotels, schools, \nand neighborhoods were totally segregated by race. Through the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and subsequent \nlegislation, these Americans have been brought into the process and \nenfranchised. The Head Start Program, for example, remains one of the \nsingle most effective program ever designed for keeping high-risk \nchildren in school.\n  My own civil rights record is one of which I am exceedingly proud. It \nhas been publicly stated by black leaders that I was the first Senator \nfrom my State who believed in and supported the civil rights movement. \nI worked to secure the extension of the Voting Rights Act; to appoint \nAfrican-Americans and women to the Federal bench and other Federal \noffices; to support historically black colleges; to ensure passage of \nthe civil rights restoration bill; to help pass the fair housing bill;\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\nand to establish a national holiday honoring the late Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. My philosophy on the issue of civil rights has always been \none of moderation, of trying, where possible, to get people to lower \ntheir voices and work together for progress. Again, by avoiding the \nlightning rod rhetoric of the extreme positions, we can successfully \nmove forward.\n  In 1955, only 63 percent of our high school students graduated. Those \nwho did stay in school did not have access to advanced science or math \ncourses in a majority of school districts until passage of the Defense \nEducation Act of 1958. Higher education had traditionally been the \npreserve of the well to do. A full decade after the GI bill was signed \ninto law, there were still only 430,000 college graduates each year. \nFollowing passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, college \nenrollment increased by 300 percent.\n\n  Perhaps the largest public construction project in American history \nbegan with the Interstate Highway Act of 1956, which ultimately doubled \nthe Nation's highway system and provided new corridors of growth. The \nNational Highway System of today is the envy of the world and is a \ngrowing testimony to the strong, steady leadership of President \nEisenhower, who did not shy away from the moderate label. Indeed, he \neloquently championed the concept of balance in public affairs \nthroughout his January 1961 farewell address to the Nation. Other \nlegislation and policies guided technology into the marketplace. The \nleadership and vision of President John Kennedy in terms of space \nexploration led to the lunar landings, the commercialization of space, \nand numerous scientific advances. These projects were not advanced in \nthe pursuit of a party's retaining power or in the interest of a \nparticular ideology being thrust upon the American people. They were \nadvanced because there was a bipartisan consensus that they were good \nfor the future of the country. They came from the center, not the \nextremes.\n  In the America of 1954, poverty and age were often indistinguishable, \nespecially in parts of the South. The average monthly Social Security \nbenefit was only $59. A child was three times less likely than today to \nsurvive its first year of life. The success of the Social Security \nProgram has helped lower poverty rates among senior citizens to the \nlowest level in the population. The Medicare Program brought 32 million \nseniors into the health care system. The Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram began to reduce infant mortality and aid to families with \ndependent children brought vulnerable children basic sustenance. \nRevelations of child hunger during the 1960's gave rise to the school \nlunch program. Later, deregulation of the airline, trucking, and \ntelecommunications industries produced millions of new jobs and lowered \nprices for transportation and telephone services.\n  The agricultural community is considerably better off today than when \nI came to the Senate in 1979. We have strived to craft farm policy \nwhich provides market stability and allows American farmers to \naggressively pursue international markets. At the same time, these farm \nprograms have dramatically reduced the cost to the U.S. Treasury.\n  When I came to the Senate, one of my major goals was to help \nmodernize and reform our Federal courts, much as we had done on the \nState level while I was on Alabama's Supreme Court. My efforts were \nfocused on improving the Federal judicial system and relieving court \ncongestion in criminal and civil cases. We were successful to a large \ndegree, particularly in the areas of criminal justice and bankruptcy, \nalthough much could still be done.\n  Today, our system of civil justice faces one of the greatest tests in \nits long history. The very foundation of our civil justice system and \nmore than 500 years of the development of common law are under attack, \nincluding the right of trial by jury. We must continue to face these \nassaults by improving the administration of justice and maintaining its \nhistoric role in protecting the weak and disadvantaged.\n  Of course, the programs mentioned above, as well as many others, are \nin need of reform. We all agree they should be streamlined and made \nmore efficient. We should implement incentives for those on public \nassistance to work and become self-sufficient. The task of government, \nhowever, should just that--reform, streamlining, and improving \nefficiency. It should not be to tear down, eliminate, and dismantle \njust for the sake of reducing government.\n  These government success stories and others are the result of \ncompassionate, moderate, democratic government aimed at securing \nopportunity for and promoting responsibility among all Americans. No, \nthese accomplishments did not result in the Great Society as envisioned \nby President Johnson and much-maligned in some political circles today. \nSome want to label all the Great Society programs as failures. It is \nfashionable to make them euphemisms for liberal big-spending \ngovernment.\n  Some of these programs were indeed disappointments worthy of the \ncriticism they receive today. Certainly, there was some idealistic \noverreaching, which resulted in a pattern of dependency we are trying \nto combat through current welfare reform efforts. Even so, many good \nthings came about, resulting in a better society, one that has come \nabout due to more Americans than ever having basic opportunities to \nsucceed and pursue their dreams. Instead of focusing on our failure to \nreach some sort of utopia, or unduly blaming each other for the \noverreaching that led to dependency among some segments of the \npopulation, we should take enormous pride in the fact that when it has \nbeen needed, our Government has usually done the right thing for our \npeople.\n\n  At the same time, we cannot rest on our laurels, but must learn from \nsuccess--and from our failures--in order to reach even greater success \nand avoid the same shortfalls in the future. In this way, personal \ninitiative can be enhanced where it is needed. In an era of shrinking \ngovernment, programs designed to provide incentives for the private \nsector to search for solutions to public problems will become \nincreasingly important.\n  What can we do specifically to enhance the concept of moderation and \npromote its ability to yield the kinds of centrist government actions \nthat help the vast majority of our citizens? How can the leaders of the \nnext American century put aside personal ideology and work for policies \nand programs that promote opportunity and individual initiative, and \nthat promote the public good? What can the new Congress do to change \npublic perceptions about government?\n  To begin with, bipartisanship should be one of the most used--if not \nthe most used--guide for Congressmen and Senators when they initiate \nand pursue legislation. The lessons of the 1993 budget debate, health \ncare reform in 1994, and most elements of the Contract With America in \n1995 and 1996 point to the obvious pitfalls of one party trying to \ngovern by itself.\n  To promote more bipartisanship, ways should be found to bring about \nmore informal togetherness among Members of opposite parties. One of \nthe wonderful byproducts of the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast \ngatherings has been the friendships forged across party and ideological \nlines. These friendships have led to more openness and willingness to \ndiscuss issues on a cordial basis. They promote the identification of \ncommon ground. This informal togetherness concept could be expanded to \nSenate standing committees like Agriculture, where I serve. Members \ncould hold regularly scheduled luncheons and dinners among themselves \nand occasionally with their spouses.\n  Another way to foster bipartisanship would be to have more committee \nhearings outside Washington in various regions of the country. These \nshould be scheduled during recess periods, when Members are usually out \nof Washington anyway, or during extended weekends. Committee members \ntraveling together get to know each other on a personal basis much \nbetter. Friendships and better understanding will no doubt be among the \nresults.\n  Issue discussions in informal settings should be frequent \noccurrences, particularly between the leadership of the respective \nparties and should, on occasioin, include White House leadership. \nSimilar informal togetherness gatherings should occur among staff \nmembers. Such recommendations to enhance a spirit of bipartisanship and\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nto foster personal relations among Members of Congress might seem to be \nstating the obvious, even trivial in light of all the challenges we \nface. This spirit and these relationships have suffered greatly in \nrecent years, however, and can only be restored through focusing on \nthem. Congress, and especially the Senate, is only as strong and \neffective as the links between its Members. Newcomers to the \ninstitutuion will soon learn the importance--the necessity--of working \ntogether and compromising. The basic point is to soften the lines of \npartisanship and division that often impede the legislative process.\n  Along with sincere efforts to increase bipartisanship, overall \nexpectations must be lowered. There is a consensus in both parties and \namong the public at large that Government cannot be expected to do all \nthings for all people. Constituents cannot continue to make \ncontradictory calls for a downsizing of Government and a lowered \ndeficit while at the same time demanding more services and benefits. \nMembers must have the political courage to tell this truth and to point \nout this reality.\n  The realities of our two-party system dictate that there will be \nissues upon which the parties will never agree. After all, the parties \ndo hold competing views for the future of the country. This is not \nnecessarily bad. It creates alternatives and requires leaders to \narticulate a vision. But, there are enough large issues that confront \nus that bipartisanship is the best way--perhaps the only way--to \nachieve success. By focusing on broad goals that come about through \ncompromise, Members do not foresake their parties or philosophies.\n\n  Where bipartisanship and working together are not possible, perhaps \nit is best to pull back and perhaps wait for another time to pursue \naction. This is in stark contrast to the tendency in recent Congresses \nto forge ahead, even where failure is certain, and then blame the other \nside or party for the failure. Sometimes legislation and ideas need to \nsimmer and gel before being acted upon.\n  There should be a ladies' and gentlemen's agreement making it a taboo \nto demonize your political opponents. Far too much of today's debate \nconsists of trying to promote one's position through the character \nassassination of an opponent. Even in circumstances where this tactic \nsucceeds, the victory is inherently hollow and will not stand the test \nof time. Both major parties could have their campaign committees \ndesigned to work together to create less negativity and friction in \npolitical campaigns. The first agreement should be to ban negative \ncampaign ads.\n  In the spirit of President Eisenhower, the status of his self-\nproclaimed moderation should be returned to that of a political virtue \nrather than a governing liability. Regardless of the personal \nideologies and views of individual Members of Congress, the national \nlegislature should reflect the moderate course of a moderate populace. \nThis does not mean that ideology and political passion do not or should \nnot count; it does mean that sometimes they should be suppressed in the \nbest interests of the Nation as a whole. In such a complex, diverse, \nand large country as ours, extreme, rigid views on either side can only \nperpetuate alienation from and dissatisfaction with Government.\n  It has always struck me as rather interesting that the vast majority \nof the policy foundations, issue study centers, and think tanks are \neither identifiably conservative or liberal in their orientation. There \nare very few that are seen as centrist in their outlook. Perhaps \nprivate sources could establish an Institute for reason and moderation \nor a center for responsible government to review and monitor \nlegislation under broad guidelines designed to produce a scholarly \nmoderate approach to and evaluation of issues.\n  As I leave the Senate and public service, I want to thank the people \nof my State for their faith and trust over the years. As I pass the \ntorch to a new generation, I also want to thank my Creator for the \nblessing of health and energy during my lifetime so far, and for giving \nme the opportunity to serve our great Nation and my fellow citizens.\n  As my time in the Senate draws to a close, I am reminded of the fact \nthat our Nation--the United States of America--is not based on any one \nlanguage, culture, or geographic area as are most older nations. \nInstead, it is based on a set of ideals, which, while relatively few in \nnumber, really encompass all the elements that constitute the core of \nwho we are as a people. These are liberty, freedom, democracy, \nequality, opportunity, human dignity, and respect for others. These are \nthe great ideals that brought us to these shores in the first place, \nand which will take us into the next century.\n  Since our country is still so much a work in progress, I still \nbelieve that our best years are ahead. Sure, growing pains, in the \nnature of social problems, world threats, and ideological divides, will \ncontinue to occur. But by weathering these storms and finding remedies \nfor them, we become stronger and better able to meet and adapt to \nchanging demands and conditions.

Senator \nHatfield's career in the Senate has spanned three decades, a record of \nservice that the State of Oregon, as well as the rest of the Nation, \nshould be proud of.\n  Senator Hatfield has devoted his entire adult life to serving the \npeople of Oregon, as an educator, a statesman, a public servant of the \nhighest caliber. Senator Hatfield's long and distinguished career began \nas college professor and dean at Willamette University. He has served \nin both the Oregon House and Senate, as Oregon's youngest secretary of \nstate, its Governor, and, since his election in 1966, as the longest-\nserving U.S. Senator from the State of Oregon. Senator Hatfield's \ncommitment to the people of Oregon is unquestionable. In announcing his \nretirement, Senator Hatfield explained, ``Thirty years of voluntary \nseparation from the State I love is enough.'' As I am sure my \ncolleagues will agree, Oregon's gain is the U.S. Senate's loss.\n  Senator Hatfield served as the chair of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee from 1981 to 1987, and in 1995 he returned to the helm of \nthat committee. As chairman and in the Senate as a whole, he often \nhelped fashion bipartisan compromises, putting the good of the country \nahead of partisan politics. I had the good fortune to work with Senator \nHatfield as part of the Mainstream Coalition, which tried to break the \ngridlock surrounding health care reform.\n  Senator Hatfield is not afraid to stand up for what he believes is \nright, even when it means going toe-to-toe with his own party or \ndisregarding popular public opinion. In 1995, during the fight over the \nbalanced budget amendment, Senator Hatfield stood by his beliefs, in \nthe face of enormous pressure from his own party, and voted against the \namendment.\n  In addition to his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Mark Hatfield also \nserved his country as a Navy Lieutenant in the Pacific theater in World \nWar II. He was at the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and served in \nthe occupation of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb. This \nexperience gave him a deep and unshakable commitment to peace, leading \nhim to vigorously oppose war and nuclear proliferation. As Governor of \nOregon, he spoke out against Lyndon Johnson's policies on Vietnam. He \nhelped author legislation passed by the Senate in 1992 calling for an \nend to U.S. nuclear testing, legislation that I supported. He also \nhelped found the Oregon Peace Institute and the U.S. Institute for \nPeace.\n  Mr. President, I have the deepest respect and admiration for our \nfriend and colleague from Oregon, and I say with confidence that he \nwill be deeply\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\nmissed by every Member of this Chamber. I wish him all the best as he \nreturns to his home State of Oregon and resumes his career in \neducation, and I thank him for his dedicated service to this body and \nthe Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11245-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Bill Bradley, who has, unfortunately, decided to \nretire from the Senate after three terms.\n  Bill Bradley has brought to the Senate a keen mind and an athlete's \ndrive to cut through highly complicated, but vital issues affecting the \neconomy of the United States, especially the Tax Code's treatment of \nthe middle class, and the need to eliminate the accumulation of \ndeductions and special interest provisions which have skewed our tax \ncode in multifarious and unfair ways.\n  In tackling the most vexing and wide-ranging problems affecting the \neconomy, Senator Bradley had a central impact on the Tax Reform Act of \n1986 after 4 years of hard work, perseverance, and studious attention \nto these very difficult issues. Using the springboard of his seat on \nthe Finance Committee to grind away at his colleagues and the Senate as \na whole as to the need for basic reform of the Tax Code, Bill showed \nthat he could go the extra mile, and through sheer determination use \nthe legislative process in textbook fashion. He produced far-reaching \nproposals on issues that have made a real difference for Americans, \nbased on careful study and on convincing the rest of us to stand up, \npay attention, and support the soundness of his position.\n  He has tackled a variety of other tough and central problems facing \nAmerican society, including deficit reduction, pension reform, college \nloan programs, Medicaid reform, and a variety of initiatives in the \nenergy area through his active membership on the Senate Energy \nCommittee. In addition, he has been extremely industrious as a \nlegislator on a wide range of issues in the education field, from \ncommunity-based initiatives involving families, to reform of higher \neducation. Bill Bradley has gone much further than legislative \ninitiatives, however. He has sponsored a number of enduring seminars \nand special programs for high school and college students and athletes, \nall with a dual focus on effective citizenship and educational \nexcellence.\n  Senator Bill Bradley added his engaging personality, integrity, and \nstudious manner to the mosaic of the Senate, and gave this body another \ndimension. His unique background as a Rhodes Scholar, and as a former \nprofessional basketball player turned U.S. Senator sent a message to \nour young people that intellectual and athletic excellence need not be \ntwo competing worlds.\n  In all his work in the Senate, Bill has performed with dignity, \ngrace, and with great respect for the opportunity that the Senate \naffords for informed debate. Unfortunately, informed debate has not \nalways been a great hallmark of recent years in the Senate, and I \nregret that this body will no longer have the benefit of Bill Bradley's \nkeen mind and tenacious, yet gentlemanly approach to the issues of our \nday.\n  Senator Bradley is a young, vibrant, vigorous man with, God willing, \na long span of productive years ahead of him. I am pleased to note that \nhe has recently been writing and speaking out on a variety of \nfundamental issues concerning the Nation, including race relations; the \nneed for a more responsible civil society where grassroots and local \ninstitutions assume more responsibility for our civic life; on the need \nfor campaign finance reform; on the need for economic transformation \nand growth more fairly shared across the full range of economic groups \nin American society; and on the role of faith in the fabric of American \nsociety. Of particular interest is his comparison of American society \nwith a three-legged stool made up of the private sector, government, \nand civil society. Obviously Senator Bradley is correct when he points \nout that our future depends on all three.\n  Bill Bradley is an independent, and thoughtful thinker on some of the \nmost fundamental issues confronting our Nation.\n  Senator Bradley has focused his considerable mental powers well on a \nbroad landscape of difficult problems which will trouble our Nation in \nthe years ahead.\n  The breadth of issues on Bill Bradley's plate clearly shows that he \nintends to make an indelible mark on the continuing American dialogue \nabout solutions to these problems, and I, for one, encourage him and \nlook forward to his contribution. It would not surprise me to see \ncitizen Bill Bradley at the witness table at future Senate hearings \ngiving us his views on many fundamental issues.\n  I wish Bill and his wife, Ernestine, the best as he departs from this \nlatest stopping place in his varied and successful life, knowing that \nthere is much more to come, and with the hope that he will return \nfrequently to include the Senate in his personal quest for a better \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11246-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator \nBill Bradley's distinguished service in the U.S. Senate.\n  From his election to the Senate in 1978, Bill Bradley has influenced \nthe policymaking agenda in Washington by plunging into the intricacies \nof an impressive array of interests and learning the strengths and \nweaknesses of his opponents' arguments better than they did. His sheer \nintellectual dominance of issues has allowed him to succeed against the \npolitical odds on issues as far-ranging as tax reform and water-use \npolicy.\n  Senator Bradley has been a true leader on tax reform and fiscal \nresponsibility. He was an early and persistent voice urging us to put \nour fiscal house in order. If we had had more Bill Bradley's in the \nSenate in the early 1980's, we could have avoided the deficits of the \nReagan era and subsequent years that have left us with our enormous \nnational debt. Last year, I was privileged to work closely with Bill \nBradley in putting together a fair share budget plan that would have \nbalanced the unified Federal budget. His advice was absolutely central \nto developing the specifics of the plan and bringing together a \ncoalition of supporters.\n  In 1986, Bill Bradley almost singlehandedly pushed through a tax \nreform bill that dramatically reduced the number and size of tax \nloopholes, gave middle-class American families tax relief, and greatly \nsimplified the Tax Code. Since joining the Finance Committee, I have \nhad the opportunity of working with Bill on tax policy, and his \nknowledge of the intricacies and politics of our Tax Code is truly \nastounding. We will sorely miss his knowledge on these issues as we \nconsider tax issues in the future.\n  Senator Bradley has also been a courageous voice on other issues that \nmany politicians choose to avoid. For example, he has been one of a \nvery few Members of Congress to move beyond sound bites and talk \nhonestly and directly about the issue of race in America. And he was a \nstrong voice criticizing those who seek to use race to divide us for \npolitical purposes.\n  Senator Bradley also devoted a great deal of time to foreign policy. \nWhenever a complex foreign policy issue forced itself upon the Senate, \nit seemed like Bill had found time to think through the options and \nU.S. and regional interests involved.\n  In short, Mr. President, Bill Bradley has been an intellectual giant \nin the Senate. The U.S. Senate is losing a champion for average \nAmerican families and particularly for the least fortunate among us. \nBut I do not doubt that he will continue these fights. As he said when \nhe announced his decision not to seek reelection, there are other \nplaces where he can put his skills to work making our country better \nand stronger. I wish him well as he seeks out the best place and way to \ncontinue his calling to public service.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11246-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11246-S11248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak not to an \nissue but to speak to a man--about a man.\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning on the floor of the Senate to \nperform a task that I am anxious to perform but, at the same time, \nreluctant to perform.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 24 years. I have had the \nopportunity in those 24 years to serve with some very famous, \nsignificant political figures in modern American history. When I \narrived here in 1972, Richard Nixon was President. The Senate was \nmarkedly different in terms of its makeup and membership, so much so \nthat I now find myself--I was No. 100 in seniority--I now find myself \nsomewhere in the low teens in seniority, and finding only a half a \ndozen or so Democrats who have been here longer than I have.\n  The reason I bother to mention that is I have had an opportunity to \nmeet and work with and become friends with some truly great and famous \nMembers of the U.S. Senate. The loss--in some cases by death, such as \nin the case of Hubert Humphrey and Dewey Bartlett and others; in some \ncases as a consequence of having lost an election, in the case of \npeople like Frank Church and other great leaders such as Jacob Javits; \nthe loss in some cases on the part of a Senator deciding he did not \nwish to run again, like Senator Mansfield and others--has impacted on \nthe Senate and has impacted on the country.\n  I know my Grandfather Finnegan--God rest his soul--was right when he \nalways used to say, ``Joey, don't forget Paddy's a 9-day wonder. When \nyou're gone, you're gone.'' In one sense that is true. In another sense \nit is not true because every once in a while someone passes this way. \nEvery once in a while someone assumes a position in the U.S. Senate, or \ntakes the place on the floor of this august body, who changes not only \nthe nature of our laws and the attitude of our country about major \nissues but who impact upon how this institution functions.\n  In my mind, and I believe I reflect the view of the American public \nin this case, one of the things that is most troubling in our discourse \nis a growing lack of civility, not only in our public discourse but in \nour private discourse.\n  You need only go down this long aisle to the next, patterned after \nthe Parliament in Great Britain. Look out this door. Many people who \nwatch us on C-SPAN don't realize that you walk through the door of this \ninstitution, this floor, and look out that door, and you look straight \nall the way through, you will see a similar set of doors at the other \nend that lead into another Chamber called the House of Representatives. \nFor years and years, we have avoided the kind of invective that seems \nto have infected the debate on that end of the Capitol. And one of the \nreasons we have avoided it is because there have been men and women on \nthe floor of this Senate who will not tolerate that kind of discourse \nand constantly remind us of our moral conscience: that we, as the \ngreatest institution--not as individuals, but as an institution--should \nnot stoop to the level of engaging in uncivil conduct.\n  If the Presiding Officer, the former Governor of Missouri, will \nexcuse my personal reference, it is like using profanity. You know that \none may engage in using profanity in the locker room with a bunch of \nguys when you are in high school, but you would never do that in front \nof your mother. You would never do that in front of your grandmother. \nYou would never do that in front of the people you most respected, even \nif you slipped and did it in front of the guys.\n  Well, the presence of Claiborne Pell on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate--just, literally, his physical presence on the floor--\ninhibits Members from yielding to the temptation of engaging in uncivil \nconduct, in conduct that, quite frankly, we should all realize is \nbeneath us and demeans the public debate and demeans this institution. \nAnd I can say, without reservation, that in the 24 years I have served \nhere there is not a single, solitary person whose mere physical \npresence in a committee, in a caucus room, on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate--just his presence inhibits negative behavior on the part of all \nof us. He is a man of such character, such gentility, such class, and \nsuch persuasion by his actions. I mean it. Think about it. I say to my \ncolleagues who may be listening to this in their offices: Name for me a \nsingle solitary person with whom we have ever served who has that kind \nof impact--he walks into a room, and his mere presence exposes \ndemeaning conduct that any of us, including myself, may be engaging in \nin the course of political discourse.\n\n  He likes to point out--and he never lectures, but he likes to point \nout--that he has never negatively referred to any one of his opponents.\n  I remember one of the highest compliments I ever received. We were at \na candidate forum. The chairman and I, Senator Pell, a Democratic \ncandidate, were getting ready for the last election. And one of the \nleading political advertisers for Democrats was up there showing us the \nlatest ad, all the Members of the Senate who were running in the 1990 \nrace, when Senator Pell and I ran together the last time. He was \nsaying, ``This is what works, and this is what the Republicans are \ndoing, and this is what we should do.'' This particular guy has great \nwit and was actually the guy doing my advertising, and may have been \nthe one doing Senator Pell's as well. I can't recall. His name is Bob \nSquire, one of the leading political advertisers in the country, and a \nfine man. Actually he was doing the President's campaign, if I am not \nmistaken. Bob Squire with his dry wit looked down at all of us, and \nsaid, ``There are only two men in America that do not get it''--that \nyou must respond to negative ads and you must be negative.\n  And I do not know whether it is true, if it was only two. It does not \nmatter for purposes of what I am going to say. He literally said, \n``Claiborne Pell and Joe Biden.'' Just for me to be mentioned in the \nsame sentence with Claiborne Pell--just to be mentioned in the same \nsentence--was one of the highest compliments I have received since I \nhave been in the Senate.\n  I am not in Claiborne Pell's class. Few are. If you will forgive me, \nas we say, a point of personal privilege here, when I first came to the \nSenate, I say to the Presiding Officer, I came under circumstances that \nwere not the most ideal. I was not anxious to come. There had been an \naccident involving my family, and I lost my wife and daughter.\n  Almost everybody, when I came, embraced me, Democrat and Republican, \nand they were very generous with their time and their concern. But I \nremember four people, only one of whom I will name today: Claiborne \nPell. Claiborne Pell came to me, and in his inimitable way. He did not \ndo what Hubert Humphrey did. Hubert Humphrey literally came over to my \noffice and sat on my couch and cried with me, I mean literally cried \nwith me. Claiborne Pell did not do that.\n  I give you my word that there was not a week that went by without him \nat least twice a week personally coming to me and inquiring of me how I \nwas doing, inviting me to his home, inviting me to stay with him in his \nhome, offering me a room in his lovely home in Georgetown because he \nknew I commuted and my boys were still in the hospital. And that did \nnot stop when my boys became healthy. That has continued for 24 years. \nAnd his wife, Nuala, is equally as wonderful.\n  In addition to that, Claiborne Pell did something few were able to do \nfor me at the time, and again continuing on this point of personal \nprivilege. He invited me to dinner parties, private parties, private \ndinners at his home, knowing that it was important for me, in \nretrospect, just to get out, just to be somewhere with someone. He \nnever did it in a way that made me feel beholden. He never did it in a \nway as if he were doing me a favor. He never did it in a way other than \nthe way he does everything: in a purely genuine, straightforward, \nembracing way.\n  Mr. President, that has characterized everything about Claiborne \nPell.\n  Let me conclude by saying that everything about Claiborne Pell's \npublic life has in fact emulated his private life. There are not many \npeople who can say there is simply no distinction between their private \nconduct and their public conduct. Claiborne Pell would not say that, \nbut he can say that, and I can say that for him.\n  The last point I wish to make, and I will elaborate on this later \nwhen we finish this treaty or at another time before we leave, is this \nman is a man who is, to use a trite-sounding phrase, a quiet visionary. \nThis is a fellow who wrote about the transportation system in the \nNortheast and predicted what would be needed and used a word I\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nlearned as an undergraduate that no one had ever heard of--\n``megalopolis''--and he talked about Richmond to Boston and what would \nhave to be done to accommodate the needs of this area of the country. \nHe is the guy who came up with the notion of ACDA. He has been the \nsingle most consistent, persistent spearheader of the notion of \nbringing about the diminution of the number of nuclear weapons that \nexist in this world. He is the man who has been devoted to the notions \nand concepts embodied in the United Nations. He is a man who has been \nthe leader in education and learning, a man who comes from considerable \nstanding in terms of his own personal wealth and education but has bent \ndown to make sure that people of competence, regardless of their \neconomic status, would be able to achieve the same intellectual \ncompetence, capability, and background as he has achieved.\n  This is a wonderful man, I say to my friends. You all know it. But \nnot many have passed this way who have his personal characteristics and \ncapabilities, and I doubt whether very many will come this way again. I \nwill truly miss his presence in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware. He was unable to come to a meeting \nof the Foreign Relations Committee this morning at which we spent 1\\1/\n2\\ hours paying tribute to this wonderful man, and I agree with \neverything that Senator Biden has said about Senator Pell.\n  At the meeting this morning, a resolution of commendation for Senator \nPell was adopted by standing ovation, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthis resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nResolution of Commendation for Services Rendered by The Hon. Claiborne \n                               deB. Pell\n\n       Whereas Senator Claiborne deB. Pell has been a member of \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations since January 8, 1965; \n     served as Ranking Minority Member from January 5, 1981 until \n     January 6, 1987; served as Chairman from January 6, 1987 \n     until January 3, 1995; and served again as Ranking Minority \n     Member from January 4, 1995 until the present;\n       Whereas by serving as Chairman of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, Senator Pell became the second Rhode Islander, \n     following The Honorable Theodore F. Green, to serve the State \n     of Rhode Island as Chairman of this distinguished Committee;\n       Whereas as a Member and Chairman of the Committee Senator \n     Pell has always been courteous, extending to all Members true \n     respect for their views, and leaving an indelible mark on the \n     Committee as a true gentleman of diplomacy;\n       Whereas in the discharge of his duties as chairman, Senator \n     Pell has at every opportunity encouraged the development and \n     furtherance of a bipartisan foreign policy;\n       Whereas Senator Pell, having served on the International \n     Secretariat of the San Francisco Conference which drew up the \n     Charter of the United Nations, has always worked to find \n     international solutions to global problems in such areas as \n     the environment, the oceans, climate control, human rights, \n     the plight of refugees, and the rights of oppressed \n     minorities throughout the world;\n       Whereas Senator Pell has steadfastly argued for greater \n     contact and dialogue between all nations so as to reduce \n     tensions, resolve differences, and promote the development of \n     democracy, advocating negotiations and diplomacy as an \n     alternative to armed conflict and military action;\n       Whereas Senator Pell has been instrumental in the \n     initiation of arms control accords such as the Environmental \n     Modification Treaty and the Seabed Arms Control Treaty, in \n     the successful Senate consideration of numerous arms control \n     treaties with such goals as the limitation, reduction and \n     elimination of various classes of nuclear weapons, in the \n     passage of legislation to restrain the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction, and in the inception, fostering \n     and strengthening of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency;\n       Whereas Senator Pell, through his energy and vision, has \n     contributed immeasurably to the development of United States \n     leadership in world affairs and the establishment of better \n     relations among nations;\n       Whereas Senator Pell has announced his intention to retire \n     from the Senate in January 1997; and\n       Whereas Senator Pell's leadership and wisdom will be sorely \n     missed by his colleagues on the Committee and his many \n     friends in the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Committee on Foreign Relations expresses \n     its warm and deep affection for Senator Claiborne Pell, its \n     profound appreciation for his devotion to duty and its \n     sincere gratitude for the outstanding service which he has \n     rendered to the Committee, the Senate, the United States of \n     America, and to the entire world through his great ability, \n     initiative, and statesmanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11246-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11248-S11257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              INTERNATIONAL NATURAL RUBBER AGREEMENT, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

During this Congress the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has reported six bilateral tax treaties providing for reduced \nwithholding tax liabilities and protection against the double taxation \nof American goods and services.\n  During this Congress, the Foreign Relations Committee also reported \nnine bilateral investment treaties, or BIT's, as they are known around \nthe world. BIT's between the United States and other countries can have \nan enormous impact in opening doors for American business in less \ndeveloped markets. To date, the Senate has overwhelmingly approved all \nof the bilateral tax and investment treaties reported from our \ncommittee during the 104th Congress.\n  Today, the Senate is considering yet another treaty that expands \nopportunities for U.S. business and protects American jobs. This \ntreaty, the International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) is designed \nto stabilize product and prices of natural rubber. This agreement has \nbeen in effect for 16 years and has proved a useful tool for \nmaintaining a relatively stable supply of natural rubber at a fairly \nconsistent price. The pending treaty would extend the agreement for an \nadditional 4 years.\n  This commodity agreement essentially reauthorizes a buffer stock that \nstabilizes the price of natural rubber. The buffer stock is designed to \nbuy and sell rubber in order to keep the price within 15 percent of a \nreference price established annually based on the market. The stock is \nfinanced by direct cash contributions from its members, who are both \nproducers and consumers of natural rubber. Absent the development of a \nmature futures market for natural rubber, the agreement ensures \npredictable supplies of natural rubber priced at annual market rates.\n  Virtually all Americans, whether aware of it or not, depend on rubber \nproducts every day of the week. Any American who drives a car, or rides \na\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nbus, or takes a taxi to work relies on rubber products. Many Americans \nmay not be aware that we are completely dependent upon foreign \ncountries for our supply of natural rubber. In fact, synthetic rubber \nproducts still require some natural rubber.\n  Here is the point. Seventy-five percent of all natural rubber is \ngrown in only three countries--Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. About \n80 percent of natural rubber is grown by small farmers, and it requires \nseven years for new rubber trees to reach full production level. Thus, \na drastic reduction in rubber prices could force small farmers to \nconvert their crops to more profitable commodities such as palm oil. \nSince natural rubber takes seven years to mature, valuable time could \nbe lost before the market was once again provided with a reliable \nsupply.\n  In terms of jobs, the president of the Rubber Manufacturing \nAssociation testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nthat the livelihood of more than 100,000 employees, and the thousands \nof suppliers to the rubber industry and its customers, depends on \navailable supplies of natural rubber and the continued production of \nfinished products. By keeping the cost of tires--and other rubber \nproducts that we all depend upon--relatively stable, U.S. consumers \nbenefit directly from the agreement.\n  Ensuring that small farmers will continue to grow rubber is therefore \nessential to ensuring an adequate supply level for the United States. \nOne of the main reasons the United States signed the original \nagreement, it is known in short form as INRA--with broad bipartisan \nsupport--and its renewal in 1987, was to encourage producers to invest \nin planting new trees and to continue to harvest rubber to meet the \nprojected increases in worldwide demands. Since the original INRA, \nproduction of natural rubber has doubled to keep pace with a similar \nrise in consumption of rubber products.\n  Senate ratification of this treaty is essential to ensuring market \nstability as the United States and other consuming countries transition \nto a system that relies on private sector institutions to manage market \nrisk. In a letter to me, dated January 22, 1996, the State Department \nsaid it ``shared industry's and labor's concern that a precipitous end \nto the accord would be disruptive.'' As we know all too well in \nWashington, private institutions do not replace public institutions \novernight--much as we might like to see it be otherwise. INRA III will \nbridge the period of transition and decrease the potential for \ndisruption of the natural rubber supply during the four year period in \nwhich the treaty will be in force.\n\n  Membership in INRA has proved to be profitable to the U.S. Treasury. \nThe original International Natural Rubber Agreement [INRA] was funded \nby the United States in 1980 with a contribution of $53 million. Since \nthat time, the U.S. contribution has increased through profit and \ninterest by $25 million and now stands at $78 million. Given this \nrecord it is evident that the U.S. Treasury will benefit directly from \nits membership in the International Natural Rubber Organization [INRO] \nin more ways than ensuring an adequate supply of natural rubber. When \nthe U.S. contribution to the INRO is returned to the Treasury in four \nyears, we can expect the U.S. share of INRO to have grown beyond its \ncurrent level of $78 million.\n  Commitment to INRA III will be funded without additional \nappropriations from the United States. According to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, in a letter to me dated August 8, 1996, \n``because rolling over U.S. government resources currently in the INRO \nBuffer Stock Account will not require any legislation, ratification of \nINRA 1995 will not be subject to pay-as-you-go budgetary procedures, \nand will simply change the timing of the return of these assets to the \nU.S. Treasury.''\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, the proposed roll-\nover of resources in the Buffer Stock Account from INRA 1987 to INRA \n1995 is based upon the provisions of INRA 1987, and the 1988 precedent \nof the Senate rolling over funds from INRA 1979 to INRA 1987. Some \nannual appropriations are necessary; specifically, the U.S. share of \nthe administrative costs of INRO are estimated to be $300,000 per year.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the administration, U.S. industry, and this \nSenator, agree that it is time to move toward a system which relies on \nprivate sector institutions to manage market risk. I agree with Senator \nBrown on that point. But, consequently, in correspondence with the \nSecretary of State and during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on June 20, 1996, I stated that industry must begin such a \ntransition. So, this will be the last International Natural Rubber \nAgreement. However, industry needs sufficient time to create a \nmechanism and prepare for a smooth transition to such a system. Given \nthe unique production challenges of natural rubber, ratification of \nINRA III will provide an adequate transition period.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that correspondence to me \nemphasizing the importance of this agreement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you are aware, the Administration \n     strongly supports U.S. participation in the International \n     Natural Rubber Agreement (``INRA'') 1995 and has asked the \n     Senate to give this treaty prompt consideration and its \n     advice and consent to ratification. This letter is in \n     response to a request from the staff of your committee for \n     our views on the budgetary implications of U.S. \n     participation. In summary, because rolling over U.S. \n     government resources currently in the International Natural \n     Rubber Organization (INRO) Buffer Stock Account will not \n     require any legislation, ratification of INRA 1995 will not \n     be subject to pay-as-you-go budgetary procedures, and will \n     simply change the timing of the return of these assets to the \n     U.S. Treasury.\n       The Administration proposes to roll over the current U.S. \n     share in the Buffer Stock Account, which totals approximately \n     $78.5 million, from INRA 1987 to INRA 1995 without a new \n     appropriation. (This includes $7.5 million in the Buffer \n     Stock Account and $71 million held in the Surplus Funds \n     Account, which is part of the Buffer Stock Account managed by \n     Rothschild Asset Management Ltd., Singapore.) We believe this \n     amount will be sufficient to cover all likely U.S. government \n     obligations during the life of INRA 1995.\n       The proposed roll-over of resources in the Buffer Stock \n     Account from INRA 1987 to INRA 1995 is based upon the \n     provisions of INRA 1987, and the 1988 precedent of the Senate \n     rolling over funds from INRA 1979 to INRA 1987. Consistent \n     with the 1988 precedent, such a roll-over does not require \n     any authorizing or appropriation legislation, only treaty \n     ratification and U.S. government consent. Thus, a roll-over \n     of resources in the Buffer Stock Account is not subject to \n     pay-as-you-go procedures established by the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       The U.S. share of the administrative costs of running the \n     International Natural Rubber Organization are estimated to be \n     approximately $300,000 per year. These costs will require \n     annual appropriations, and the State Department's proposed \n     budget for FY 1997 includes money for this purpose in the \n     Contributions to International Organizations account.\n       The Administration expects that at the end of the four-year \n     duration of INRA 1995, the objectives of INRA will be \n     achievable through the operation of free market mechanisms. \n     Therefore, INRA 1995 is intended to be the last such \n     agreement in which the United States participates, and the \n     U.S. share of the Buffer Stock Account (including buffer \n     stock trading profits and interest) will return to the U.S. \n     Treasury as miscellaneous offsetting receipts at that point. \n     The transfer of U.S. government assets from INRA 1987 to INRA \n     1995 will not affect the U.S. claim on those assets, but will \n     only change the timing of their return to the Treasury.\n       Again, the Administration strongly supports U.S. \n     participation in INRA 1995 and awaits consideration of the \n     treaty by the full Senate. We appreciate the support that you \n     have given to this proposal and your expeditious action on \n     it.\n       Please let me know if you would like any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n     Acting Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             Rubber Manufacturers Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Withn the next week or so, the third \n     iteration of the International Natural Rubber Agreement will \n     be brought to the floor of the Senate for ratification.\n       Supported by both industry and labor, INRA III is, in \n     essence, a routine extension of an Agreement (INRA I) which \n     has been in\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\n     effect since 1979. INRA II, essentially a continuation of the \n     first, was submitted to the Senate by the Reagan \n     Administration and approved unanimously by a vote of 97-0. To \n     the extent INRA III differs from its predecessors, it does so \n     in a positive way, by making its economic provisions even \n     more market-oriented, and more automatic than discretionary.\n       INRA, unlike other commodity agreements, has worked \n     successfully for more than 16 years.\n       On behalf of the rubber manufacturing industry, I ask for \n     your support of this important Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas E. Cole,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         United Steelworkers of America, Rubber/Plastics Industry \n           Conference,\n                                    Akron, OH, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: On behalf of the 97,000 members of the \n     Rubber/Plastics Industry Conference of the United \n     Steelworkers of America, I urge you to support ratification \n     of the International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA III) when \n     it comes to the Senate floor in the near future.\n       For the last 16 years, INRA has successfully met its \n     primary objective of assuring an adequate supply of natural \n     rubber for the world. In fact, since INRA began, global \n     natural rubber production has increased 50 percent. This is \n     especially important for the U.S. as the world's largest \n     consumer of natural rubber.\n       Assured supplies of natural rubber are particularly \n     critical to the tire and rubber products industry and our \n     union members. To put it simply, you cannot manufacture such \n     products for our varied civilian and military transportation \n     needs--or provide jobs in this vital industry--without \n     natural rubber. Contrary to a common misconception, there is \n     no substitute for this critical industrial input. If future \n     supplies of natural rubber are inadequate, there can be no \n     question that job disruptions and losses among our members \n     would result.\n       Also, consumers would be severely impacted. Every one cent \n     increase in the price of natural rubber costs the U.S. tire \n     industry $22 million on an annualized basis. Thus, consumers \n     could face tremendous price increases for tires and other \n     rubber products, and could very well face shortages.\n       In the final analysis, the United States is one of the only \n     countries among the 28 nations covered by the treaty that has \n     not yet ratified it. We must do so by the end of this year or \n     the agreement that has served the world so well for almost \n     two decades will die. The Senate has previously recognized \n     the importance of INRA as reflected in the 97-0 vote in favor \n     of ratification when INRA was last renewed in 1988. I urge \n     your support on this matter of critical importance to our \n     union, its members and families--and the consumers who \n     purchase the products we produce.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John Sellers,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.,\n\n                                   Wilson, NC, September 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I am writing on behalf of Bridgestone/\n     Firestone, Inc. and the 2,200 employees of the Wilson Plant \n     to reiterate our strong support for the ratification of the \n     Third International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA III), \n     which is scheduled for vote by the Senate this month. This \n     will continue a treaty that has effectively served the needs \n     of the U.S. tire industry.\n       Natural rubber is a strategic commodity for the production \n     of tires as well as for a wide variety of other products. For \n     the past 25 years, the International Natural Rubber \n     Organization (INRO), which operated under the authority of \n     the INRA Charter, has helped ensure a stable price and long-\n     term supply of natural rubber, benefiting both producers and \n     buyers of natural rubber. Without this stabilizing influence, \n     we believe that the international rubber market could easily \n     be disrupted, jeopardizing the availability of natural rubber \n     and long-term damage to the industry.\n       INRA is different from many other commodity agreements. \n     First, it uses a ``buffer stock'' mechanism (rather than \n     export controls or market quotas) to dampen the swings in \n     market prices that can hurt both producers and consumers. \n     Second, the price intervention levels are directly and \n     automatically linked to free market trends. Third, and \n     perhaps the most important, it has worked.\n       During the last several years, much time and effort has \n     been spent to achieve the consensus among producing and \n     consuming countries embodied by this new agreement. We \n     believe that a reasonable compromise among the parties has \n     been reached in the adopted INRA III document, and that its \n     ratification will serve the interests of the U.S. tire and \n     rubber industry.\n       As a major U.S. tire manufacturer and an employer of 2,500 \n     in North Carolina and nearly 35,000 nationwide, we urge you \n     to vote for the ratification of INRA III by the U.S. Senate. \n     We are eager to provide whatever assistance or information \n     may be required to assist you in attaining this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John McQuade,\n     Plant Manager--Wilson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Kelly Springfield Tire Co.,\n\n                               Fayetteville, NC, January 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor, Ambassador,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I have been working very closely \n     with Senator Jesse Helms on the International Natural Rubber \n     Agreement (INRA) since before Thanksgiving. Success in \n     getting the Agreement renewed is crucial to the future health \n     of North Carolina's large tire industry and our plant, in \n     particular, which is the largest in the world.\n       It is my understanding that the Administration will sign \n     INRA III shortly and send it to the United States Senate for \n     its advice and consent. This would not have occurred without \n     your personal support and leadership.\n       Thank you, Ambassador Kantor, for all your efforts in \n     moving INRA III forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    J.R. Konneker.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. In order for the United States to retain its membership in \nINRO, the United States must ratify INRA 1995 prior to the end of 1996. \nI ask that the Senate move expediently to a vote on this treaty.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Who yields time? The \nSenator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I rise today also to speak on behalf of Senate \nratification of the third International Rubber Agreement, INRA III.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, INRA III is a renewal of an existing \ncommodity agreement. This is not new. It has been in existence between \nmore than two dozen nations who are either producers or consumers of \nnatural rubber. The first INRA was ratified in 1979. It was renewed in \n1987. INRA III was negotiated in 1994-95 with the very active \nparticipation of the United States. According to the Department of \nState.\n\n       . . . the objectives pursued by the United States resulted \n     in a well-structured accord which offers a fair balance of \n     benefits and responsibilities for both consumers and \n     producers of natural rubber.\n\n  In the negotiations, the United States sought and achieved a number \nof improvements in the new agreement. After a very lengthy interagency \nreview, INRA III was formally signed by the United States and sent to \nthe Senate for our ratification.\n  United States participation in INRA has been supported by Republican \nand Democratic administrations, including those of Presidents Carter, \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton. So it has enjoyed broad bipartisan support \nin the Senate when INRA I and INRA II were considered.\n  This year, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended \nratification of INRA III by a near unanimous and bipartisan majority. \nThe agreement is strongly supported by the Rubber Manufacturers \nAssociation and by the Rubber/Plastic Industry Conference of the United \nSteelworkers.\n  Mr. President, more than two-thirds of the world's production of \nnatural rubber comes from just three countries: Thailand, Malaysia, and \nIndonesia. The purpose of INRA is very simple. It is to ensure an \nadequate supply of natural rubber at fair and stable prices without \ndistorting long-term market trends and to foster expanded natural \nrubber supplies at reasonable prices.\n  As Secretary of State Christopher points out in his letter of \nsubmittal accompanying the agreement:\n\n       Prior to conclusion of INRA 1979, rubber prices had \n     historically been unstable with strong rises.\n  This was particularly noticeable, Mr. President, in 1951, in 1955, in \n1960 and in 1973, 1974, followed by sharp and sudden declines. ``This \nbehavior not only destabilized producers' incomes, but also contributed \nto inflation in industrial countries.'' That was a statement by \nSecretary of State Christopher.\n  So those ups and downs in 1951, 1955, 1960, 1973 and 1974 are what \nled to INRA being passed in 1979.\n  The Secretary continued:\n\n       In addition, it discouraged needed long-term investments in \n     natural rubber production. This was and is of particular \n     concern to the United States which, as the world's largest \n     consumer of natural rubber, has a substantial interest in \n     assuring adequate future supplies of this commodity.\n\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\n\n  In other words, what that says in simpler terms is, it's good for the \nconsumers of this country that we have this kind of supply arrangement \nthat does not permit price fluctuations.\n  In contrast with other commodity arrangements which have sought to \ncontrol prices, INRA uses a buffer-stock mechanism to avoid severe \nprice fluctuations which can injure both producing and consuming \ncountries. Absent alternative institutions to manage market risk, the \nagreement represents the best way of assuring predictable supplies of \nfairly priced natural rubber. INRA III will provide a transition period \nneeded to allow industry time to prepare for a free market in natural \nrubber and to allow for the further development of these alternative \ninstitutions.\n  That is very important. I already pointed out why to my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, because the fact is this will be the last INRA. \nAfter this, we go to a free market, and this time period for this INRA \nthat we are going to approve today, I trust, will provide for arranging \nfor development of these alternative institutions.\n  INRA has effectively discouraged cartel-like behavior on the part of \nthe producing countries by supporting prices sufficient to ensure \nadequate production, as well as a fair return to the producer, while \ngiving consuming countries an equal voice in how this unique commodity \nagreement is implemented.\n  The best part about it is, Mr. President, it has worked, it has been \nsuccessful. Over the life of INRA I and II, production has increased by \n50 percent to meet rising demand, yet prices have remained relatively \nstable. That is a great testament to the success of INRA I and II since \nthey have been in effect. I repeat that. Over the life of INRA I and \nII, production has increased 50 percent to meet rising demand, yet \nprices have remained relatively stable.\n  Natural rubber is a component of every tire and many rubber products. \nThere is no substitute. The amount of natural rubber used varies \ndepending on the type of tire or rubber product. All aircraft, as an \nexample, however, including military planes, have tires which contain a \nhigh percentage of natural rubber.\n  The economic impact on our whole Nation of ups and downs in the price \nof rubber is very real. A 1-cent-per-pound rise in natural rubber \nprices costs the United States an additional $22 million. Hence, the \nimportance of price and supply stability is readily apparent. Short \nsupplies or unreasonably high prices would be costly to American \nconsumers and could be devastating to the tire and rubber industry in \nthe United States.\n  I will say, we have a very substantial part of this industry \nrepresented in my home State of Ohio.\n  U.S. participation in INRA III should not require any additional \nmoney to cover our share of the buffer stock. It is my understanding \nthe administration and the Senate are agreed that we will roll over \nmoneys already invested in the buffer stock. This arrangement seems the \nsimplest and most sensible means of addressing the financing question \nand is the same procedure which was used successfully for the \ntransition from INRA I to INRA II.\n  In closing, Mr. President, as the world's largest consumer of natural \nrubber, U.S. participation in INRA III is critical to the continued \nviability of the arrangement. I urge my colleagues to approve INRA III \nin the broad, bipartisan fashion which has characterized consideration \nof this issue to date.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time to Senator Pell.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, this is the second extension of a treaty that has \nalready been approved by this body on two separate occasions: in 1980 \non a vote of 90 to 1, and in 1988 on a vote of 97 to 0.\n  The purpose of this treaty is to stabilize the supply and price \nlevels of natural rubber in the world market. Through a buffer-stock \nmechanism, the treaty assures that natural rubber will be available to \nthe United States in sufficient supply and at reasonable prices.\n  Mr. President, securing a reliable supply of natural rubber at fair \nprices is essential for our tire and rubber industry. As a letter from \ntreaty supporters put it, ``you cannot manufacture such products for \nour varied civilian and military transportation needs--or provide jobs \nin this vital industry--without natural rubber. Contrary to a common \nmisconception, there is no substitute for this critical industrial \ninput. If future supplies of natural rubber are inadequate, there can \nbe no question that job disruptions and losses would result.''\n  This treaty is extremely important because 75 percent of the world's \nnatural rubber supply is produced in just three countries--Thailand, \nIndonesia and Malaysia--and the United States is, by far, the world's \nlargest importer of natural rubber. Since natural rubber is a commodity \nwhose production is strictly limited by climate, without this treaty, \nthe United States could be subject to great market volatility.\n  On the one hand, one possible problem could be the formation of \ncartels that could push the price of rubber way up, almost beyond \nreach; on the other hand, at the other extreme is a danger that rubber \nproduction could become unprofitable, and there would be a disruption \nin supply. This treaty charts the way between these two extremes.\n  The INRA addresses these issues not by eliminating market pricing and \nproduction, but by restraining some of the volatility. INRA's buffer-\nstock mechanism goes into action only when prices move beyond 15 \npercent above or below the reference price. That reference price is \nadjusted annually to reflect long-term market trends.\n  Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. Trade Representative \ndistinguished the rubber agreement from other commodity agreements by \nstating the following:\n\n       Experience shows that most arrangements with economic \n     measures have not worked and often result in market \n     disruptions by attempting to support prices at unrealistic \n     levels.\n       In contrast, however, the rubber agreement has been \n     successful in moderating price fluctuations through a market-\n     oriented mechanism that operates consistent with market \n     trends.\n\n  My colleague from Ohio put out a very important figure in terms of \nthe impact of rapid price fluctuations. Every 1-cent increase in the \nprice of natural rubber is estimated to cost the U.S. tire and rubber \nindustry $22 million on an annualized basis.\n  This agreement is strongly supported not only by U.S. tire and rubber \nmanufacturers, but also by organized labor--the people who work in the \ntire and rubber manufacturing industry. It has been supported by four \nsuccessive administrations: Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and \nClinton. We have the benefit of 16 years of experience with this treaty \nto know that it can and does work.\n  Mr. President, it would be a great mistake if we did not take \nadvantage of this opportunity to give our advice and consent to \nratification of the International Natural Rubber Agreement. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the International \nNatural Rubber Agreement [INRA] and urge the Senate to ratify this \nagreement. This is the third INRA. The first two agreements were \nratified by this body by overwhelming margins in 1980 and 1988. The \nthird agreement merits that same level of support.\n  Since entry into force of the first agreement, INRA has effectively \nmet its basic purpose: to encourage cultivation of natural rubber by \nreducing market volatility and thus ensuring adequate supply. Unless \nINRA is ratified, we will return to the unstable price situation that \ncharacterized the period before the first INRA went into effect. Price \nvolatility discourages investment in natural rubber production, which \nin turn affects supply. Rubber trees can only be grown in a few areas \nof the world and production does not begin until at least 5 years after \nthe trees are planted. Therefore, a reduction in planting has a long, \nadverse effect on supply.\n  As the world's largest consumer of natural rubber, the United States \nhas a particularly strong economic interest in assuring stability and \nadequate supply for the future. Natural rubber is an essential product \nfor which there is no\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nsubstitute. Seventy-five percent of the world's rubber production is \nused in the manufacture of tires. Every tire must contain some amount \nof natural rubber in order to meet required performance and quality \nspecifications. If U.S. rubber manufacturing plants cannot obtain \nadequate supplies of natural rubber, jobs will be disrupted and \nconsumers will face increased prices. In South Carolina alone, more \nthan 10,000 workers are employed in the rubber manufacturing industry.\n  The administration has proposed funding INRA by rolling over the \nexisting U.S. share of the buffer stock. I endorse this proposal. A \nrollover is specifically permitted under the terms of INRA. This was \nthe method used when the second INRA was ratified. Based on historic \nexperience, these funds should be adequate to meet our obligations \nunder the third INRA. And these funds will be returned to the taxpayers \nwhen the agreement terminates.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution of \nratification of the third International Natural Rubber Agreement \n[INRA]. The purpose of INRA is to assure adequate supplies of natural \nrubber by stabilizing natural rubber prices without distorting long-\nterm market trends. It accomplishes this through the operation of a \nbuffer stock which buys and sells natural rubber whenever the price \nfalls outside of a market-based price band. The INRA benefits both \nproducers and consumers of natural rubber.\n  Natural rubber is a critical material used in virtually every tire \nand many rubber products made in the United States. There is no \nmaterial that can serve as a complete substitute for natural rubber. \nThe United States is the largest consumer of natural rubber in the \nworld, and adequate supplies are critical to major U.S. manufacturers \nsuch as the automotive industry. For 16 years, the United States has \nbenefited substantially from the market stability which resulted from \nthe operation of the two previous INRA agreements. Failure to ratify \nthe third INRA is likely to result in price volatility and supply \nshortages. This in turn will have serious adverse consequences for \nworkers and consumers across the country and in my own State.\n  Alabama is a major producer of tires and other rubber products. \nCompanies manufacturing these products have invested an estimated $1.5 \nbillion in their Alabama facilities. They employ nearly 6,000 workers. \nThe price volatility and supply shortages that would follow if INRA is \nnot ratified would have an immediate impact on these workers. And the \nprice effect of short supplies would soon be felt by consumers.\n  INRA has the support of the Rubber/Plastic Industry Conference of the \nUnited Steel Workers of America as well as the tire and rubber products \nindustry. Other major consumer and producer nations have already \napproved INRA. Our action today will allow this beneficial agreement to \ngo into effect.\n  Finally, the administration is not requesting an appropriation of \nfunds to carry out this agreement. Rather it proposes rolling over the \nU.S. share of the buffer stock under the second agreement to carry out \nour obligations under the third agreement. This is precisely the course \nof action taken when the second INRA agreement was approved. When the \nagreement ends, these funds will return to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support INRA.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering \nratification of the International Natural Rubber Agreement. This \nagreement will impact large sectors of our economy, primarily those for \nwhich natural rubber is a vital interest.\n  The first International Natural Rubber Agreement was ratified in 1979 \nby all major rubber producing and consuming countries. The second \nagreement was ratified in 1988 and expired in December 1995. The \npurpose of renewing this agreement is to stabilize the price of natural \nrubber and to guarantee adequate supplies. The agreement accomplishes \nthis through the International Natural Rubber Organization which \nmaintains a natural rubber buffer stock from which the organization may \npurchase or sell natural rubber to help control the volatile price.\n  Agricultural growth for natural rubber is limited to a small area \naround the equator, and it takes 5 to 7 years to cultivate this \nproduct. Seventy-five percent of the world's natural rubber is grown in \njust three countries--Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. I generally do \nnot favor Government intervention in the marketplace to stabilize \nprices, but failure to ratify this agreement could lead to a few small \ncountries colluding to fix natural rubber prices. Even small \nfluctuations in the price of natural rubber have a significant impact \non American industry; a one-cent increase in the natural rubber price \ncosts industry $22 million. Sharp fluctuations in the natural rubber \nprice will, in turn, impact American consumers heavily.\n  Moreover, this program is not draining the taxpayers' money; the \noriginal U.S. contribution was $53 million and our share of the \norganization has grown to $78 million. When the INRA terminates, these \nfunds will be returned to the Treasury.\n  The Government should play a minimal role in regulating or \ncontrolling the price of any commodity. There are rare circumstances \nwhere, for the sake of American consumers, it is permissible for the \nGovernment to ensure the stability of certain commodity prices, and \nthis is one of those circumstances. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of ratification of the \nInternational Natural Rubber Agreement [INRA III].\n  For the last 16 years, INRA has provided the consuming nations of the \nworld with a reliable supply of natural rubber at stable prices. The \nUnited States, as the world's largest consumer of natural rubber, has \nmuch to gain from the stabilization provided by the agreement. Many \nbelieve that the tires and other rubber products U.S. consumers use \ndaily do not need natural rubber. But that is simply not the case.\n  Natural rubber is, in fact, a critical material in the manufacture of \nmost rubber products. Aircraft tires used by the U.S. military have a \nparticularly high percentage of natural rubber and it just so happens \nthe world's largest aircraft tire plant is located in Danville, VA. At \nleast a third of the plant's production provides aircraft tires to the \nU.S. military, and this production depends on the availability of \nnatural rubber.\n  U.S. consumers and workers also have much to gain from renewal of \nINRA. Every one-cent rise in the price of natural rubber costs the U.S. \ntire and rubber industry $22 million on an annualized basis. Such cost \nincreases will inevitably lead to higher prices for consumers and \npossible shortages and potential job losses.\n  On behalf of the nearly 4,000 workers in Virginia that are employed \nin the tire and rubber industry and for the broader economic and \ndefense preparedness interests of the United States, I urge the \nfavorable consideration of the International Natural Rubber Agreement.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to National \nSecurity Adviser Anthony Lake be printed in the Record, as well as his \nreturn reply.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1996.\n     Hon. W. Anthony Lake,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The \n         White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tony: I wanted to convey my strong support for the \n     International Natural Rubber Agreement [INRA], and urge that \n     the National Security Council expedite its review of the \n     accord and submit it to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent.\n       The INRA serves an important purpose in ensuring an \n     adequate supply of rubber to U.S. corporations using this \n     product in bulk in their manufacturing operations. The \n     Chairman of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Mr. Stan Gault, \n     visited my office yesterday to emphasize that very point and \n     explain how important extension of the rubber pact is to his \n     corporation. Should the pact not be renewed, our industrial \n     base would face serious production and supply shortages, and \n     the American consumer would ultimately be forced to pay \n     higher prices.\n       The Senate supported renewal of INRA in 1988 by a wide \n     margin, 97-0, and I believe there is a consensus to support \n     extension of the pact once again. I hope the White House can \n     submit the accord to the Senate in short order so that we can \n     move ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles S. Robb.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Charles S. Robb,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: I am writing in response to your letter urging \n     support for renewal of the International Natural Rubber \n     Agreement (INRA). I fully agree with you on the importance of \n     providing adequate natural rubber supplies, at reasonable \n     prices, for U.S. manufacturers to ensure U.S. consumers pay \n     reasonable prices for rubber-related products.\n       I am pleased to report that on June 19, President Clinton \n     transmitted the INRA to the Senate for advice and consent. \n     The new agreement incorporates improvements sought by the \n     United States to help ensure that the INRA fully reflects \n     market trends and is operated in an effective and financially \n     sound manner. We believe that renewal of the agreement will \n     provide the transition period necessary for the industry to \n     prepare for a free, open market in natural rubber.\n       We appreciate your interest in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Anthony Lake,\n         Assistant to the President For National Security Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  Madam President, the advocates of this treaty have come to the floor \nwith the suggestion that this measure has been considered and approved \nby large margins in the past. That assertion is correct. It has been. \nThey have come with the assertion and the implication that the American \ncompanies that buy rubber products support this agreement. Madam \nPresident, I believe that assertion is largely correct as well.\n  They have come to the floor with the assertion that this measure has \nbroad support of rubber producers. And I believe that assertion is \ncorrect as well. They have come to the floor and suggested that, \nimplied that the labor organizations that work for the big rubber \ncompanies may support this agreement. Madam President, I believe that \nassertion as well is correct.\n  This country has had experience with cartels. It is not new. It is as \nold as commerce is itself. It is perhaps a most natural inclination \nthat could come about. One who reads Warren Buffett's books, in terms \nof investing, is quickly impressed with his understanding of the \nmarket. And one of the things he looks for is markets where there is \nnot competition or there is reduced competition, where it is possible \nfor the industry to have a greater margin because of the limited \ncompetition--or the franchise, as he refers to it.\n  The simple fact is, if you have a very competitive commodity market, \nmargins, that is, profits, tend to be less than they are if it is a \nsomewhat protected market. It is natural and understandable that \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs would seek to limit competition, would \nseek to minimize risk. That is human nature. And it is a way to \nmaximize profits.\n  Madam President, I think our responsibilities go further than simply \nresponding to big labor or to big business or to large producers of \nrubber. Our responsibilities go to the consumers of this country and \nthe citizens of this country as well. We have had experience in recent \nyears with cartels. When we have a limited number of producers, and \nthey organize and they work together to control prices, we have seen \nwhat happened.\n  The lessons of the 1970's in dealing with the oil cartel was a \ndramatic reminder to the Americans of what happens when competition is \nreduced. The oil cartel was an association of oil-producing companies \nthat conspired together to dramatically increase oil prices; and they \ndid it. It had a dramatic and shocking impact on the consumers of \nAmerica, and, as a matter of fact, the economy of the entire world.\n  We have a number of other examples where countries have talked about \ndeveloping cartels. Thankfully, they have been resisted. As a matter of \nfact, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is \none who has been a key fighter in the effort to eliminate many of these \ncartels. I think Members and American citizens will be surprised to \nlearn that many of these cartels' efforts to control the market had the \nblessing of the Federal Government.\n  The coffee association. Ironically, this country produces very little \ncoffee, but we have been a member of what was an attempt to develop a \ncoffee cartel. One can understand why the producing country would want \na coffee agreement that would limit competition of their product, but \nwhy in the world would the United States want to be a member of it? We \nimport coffee.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee played a key role in \nhelping us eliminate the coffee cartel. Imagine taking American \ntaxpayers' money to participate in a cartel that had the impact of \nboosting the price Americans have to pay for coffee.\n  When that agreement was proposed by administrations--and it had been \nproposed by administrations in the past--it was not the American \ntaxpayer they were looking out for. They were responding to the special \ninterest groups that had found a way to limit competition. I do not \ncondemn people for looking out for their own economic interest, but I \ndo think it is wrong for American legislators to think that their \nresponsibility goes only to respond to those special interests.\n  This Congress in the last few years has played a key role in \neliminating some of these cartels or efforts to limit competition. \nInternational organizations designed to help control, manipulate the \nprice of coffee or jute or other products that we import have fallen by \nthe wayside, and great progress has been made when we focus on them.\n  Now what comes to the floor is an agreement on rubber. Madam \nPresident, some facts are painfully clear. One, the United States does \nnot produce rubber. We are an importer. We are a consumer of rubber. Is \nrubber important? It has been alleged so. The answer by the advocates \nof this treaty is yes. Madam President, I agree completely. Of course \nnatural rubber is important, important in the world economy and \nimportant in our economy.\n  They have alleged that the rubber agreement will help producing \ncountries. Madam President, I agree. It will help the producing \ncountries because it will help them get a better price for their \nproduct.\n  They have alleged that the rubber agreement will help the tire \ncompanies and the rubber processors in this country. And, yes, I agree, \nit will help them.\n  It will bail out rubber producers by protecting them against lower \nprices, because, you see, the way the agreement is set up is, we put up \nthe money with other countries, and when prices get lower or are \nattempted to be dropped, the association will step in and buy rubber at \na low price. That does help the producers. It will help the tire \ncompanies. They have a huge investment in inventory. That investment in \ninventory is at risk because it can drop. By stabilizing the price, \nkeeping it from getting too low by buying up inventory when there is a \nbig supply, it will help those tire companies from ever suffering a \nloss on that inventory or at least some of the dangerous suffered loss \non that inventory.\n  It will also protect them against competition because when they are \nout there trying to maintain a high price, and the price of rubber \nfalls, someone else can come in and produce the product and undersell \nthem in the market. So I agree, it is in the interest of the big rubber \ncompanies to maintain a restriction on competition, as this agreement \nimplies.\n  But, Madam President, it is also true that America is the biggest \nconsumer. It is in our interest to have low prices, not high prices for \nrubber. How in the world do you justify taking taxpayers' money--in \nthis case $78 million of money--to be used to guarantee that prices do \nnot get too low?\n  Are we standing up for the American taxpayer when you do that? I do \nnot think anyone can seriously suggest we are. Yes, I talked to some \nMembers who tell me with great earnestness that if we do not have this \nagreement, if we do not guarantee the producers against the \npossibilities of low prices, that maybe nobody will produce rubber at \nall. Madam President, if they believe that--and I believe many of them \nwho said that are sincere; I do not count the chairman of the committee \nin that group--but there are Members who do believe that the market \nsystem would not work without Government controls and without \nGovernment assistance and that indeed people might go out of business \nin producing rubber and we would not have any rubber at all if we did \nnot have Government interference. And if they believe that, they will \nwant to support this agreement.\n  But, Madam President, the history of economics is quite clear. When \nthe economic system provides rewards and a good price, people want to \nproduce it because they want to make money. And when it does not, they \ndrop production and cut back. And that responsiveness is what makes the \nmarket system work. And the reality is, that\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\nproduct after product after product that is produced in the American \nmarketplace responds to market incentives, and that far from going out \nof business, this will make it more healthy if we eliminate the \nagreement.\n  Madam President, I hope as Members vote they will ask themselves some \nquestions. Will producers not produce without Government subsidies? The \nadvocates of the treaty will tell you yes. I think the facts are quite \nclear, in the industries across our land, production is not dependent \non Government subsidies. It is a function of the marketplace and \nmarketplace incentives. Will tire producers not process tires without \nGovernment subsidies?\n\n  The advocates of this agreement, some of them, will tell you yes, \nthat there is a danger of people not producing tires in America--or, \nfor that matter, around the world--to meet the market demand unless we \nhave a Government program to subsidize them and stabilize them. Those \nwho believe that will want to support this agreement.\n  Madam President, the facts belie that allegation. The fact is that a \nstrong, healthy, vibrant economy thrives on competition and is stifled \nby Government controls and Government subsidy programs. Will buying up \nrubber supplies lower the price? Here is an interesting question. Will \nbuying up the supplies of rubber, when there is a surplus on the \nmarket, increase price or lower price?\n  The advocates of this treaty have come to the floor and said this \nagreement will help give us lower prices. If you believe that buying a \nproduct in the marketplace will lower its price, then you will want to \nsupport this treaty. Madam President, anybody who believes that ought \nto take Economics 101 or simply use common sense. Buying the product \nprops up the price. That is why the producing countries are interested \nin this agreement. They want higher prices. That is why they fought so \nhard for this.\n  This treaty is simple logic. This treaty is a simple question: If you \nwant to be responsive to the big rubber companies who want to stabilize \ntheir product and avoid risk with their inventory, you will want to \nvote for it; if you want to please big labor who works for those \ncompanies and is concerned about the potential of outside competition \nin their marketplace, you will want to support the treaty; if you want \nto help out the producers of rubber, who are all overseas, you will \nwant to support the treaty.\n  But, Madam President, if you are concerned about competition in our \neconomy, you will be concerned about a treaty that reduces competition; \nif you are concerned about consumers in America, you will want to be \nconcerned about a treaty that guarantees they will not have low prices, \nbecause that is the purpose of this measure. Madam President, if you \nare concerned about the taxpayers of this country, you will have some \nmisgivings about taking $78 million of our taxpayers' money and giving \nit in subsidies or putting it out in subsidies for these big producers.\n  This is a vote that people should have no doubt about because the \nsides are very clear. Big labor, big business, lobbyists for importers, \nall favor the treaty; people who are concerned about the taxpayers of \nthis country and about the consumers of this country will want to vote \nagainst the treaty.\n  I was concerned particularly about the lesson it sends and the \nmessage it sends with regard to our economy. If there is one hallmark \nof the American economy, it has been a concern about the concentration \nof power and a commitment to a competitive economy. Our very existence \nof the antitrust laws comes out of an experience when you had cartels \nand restrictions on competition. The Sherman Antitrust Act and the \nClayton Act and other measures that have come forth in this area have \nfocused on our efforts to ensure we continue to have price competition \nin products just such as rubber.\n  In that effort, I sent an inquiry to the Congressional Research \nService, the American Law Division. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have their entire response to my letter, along with my \nletter, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: Your answers to the questions \n     below concerning the application of United States antitrust \n     law and practice to an organization's business practices \n     would be greatly appreciated.\n       (1) Under United States antitrust law, is it permissible \n     for 26 competing producers and purchasers of a particular \n     commodity to form a single organization for the purpose of \n     regulating their business interests or activities?\n       (a) Would the fact that three of the producers provide 92% \n     of the commodity affect your answer to question 1?\n       (b) Would the fact that three of the purchasers buy 77% of \n     the commodity affect your answer to either question 1 or 1a?\n       (2) Under United States antitrust law, can an organization \n     of producers and purchasers be formed for any of the \n     following expressed purposes:\n       (a) To achieve a balanced growth between the supply and the \n     demand for a commodity in order to alleviate difficulties \n     arising from shortages or surpluses of that commodity?\n       (b) To stabilize a commodity price in order to avoid \n     excessive price fluctuations that might adversely affect the \n     long-term interests of both producers and purchasers?\n       (c) To stabilize the earnings of the producers of a \n     commodity and to increase their earnings based on expanding \n     the commodity supply at fair and remunerative prices?\n       (d) To ensure an adequate supply of a commodity to meet \n     purchasers' needs at a ``reasonable price'' (determined by \n     the organization)?\n       (e) To take feasible steps to mitigate members' economic \n     difficulties in case of a commodity surplus or shortage?\n       (f) To expand international trade in, and market access \n     for, products derived from the commodity?\n       (g) To improve the overall competitiveness of a commodity \n     by supporting research and development of commodity-related \n     products?\n       (h) To facilitate the efficient development of a commodity \n     by improving its processing and distribution?\n       (f) To promote international cooperation and consultations \n     regarding commodity supply and demand and to coordinate \n     commodity research?\n       (3) Under United States antitrust law, can an organization \n     of producers and purchasers of a particular commodity set a \n     reference price which establishes a permissible price range \n     for that commodity?\n       (4) If members of an organization of producers and \n     purchasers of a particular commodity were to contribute \n     substantial funds to establish a large buffer stock of that \n     commodity to enable the organization to intervene in the \n     market to stabilize the supply of that commodity and to \n     defend the organization's reference price, would that violate \n     United States law?\n       (a) Specifically, would it be permissible under United \n     States law for an organization of producers and purchasers of \n     a particular commodity to establish a buffer stock?\n       (b) Specifically, would it be permissible under United \n     States law for an organization of producers and purchasers of \n     a particular commodity to use the buffer stock to intervene \n     and regulate the market?\n       (5) Under United States law, can an organization of \n     producers and purchasers of a particular commodity defend its \n     reference price--support its minimum price--by buying any \n     market surplus of that commodity that causes the commodity \n     price to drop 15% below the organization's reference price?\n       (6) Under United States law, can an organization of \n     producers and purchasers of a particular commodity sell some \n     of its buffer stock to cover a commodity shortage?\n       (7) Under United States law, whenever the commodity price \n     is 15% above the reference price, can an organization of \n     producers and purchasers of a particular commodity sell some \n     of its buffer stock to decrease the market price?\n       (a) If the answer to question 7 is no, please discuss fully \n     what aspects of United States law are violated by the \n     organization's behavior in question 7?\n       (8) Under United States law, is it permissible for an \n     organization of producers and purchasers of a particular \n     commodity to decide what grades of that commodity are \n     eligible to be included in its buffer stock?\n       (9) Under United States law, may an organization of \n     producers and purchasers of a particular commodity penalize \n     members for failing to meet their obligations to contribute \n     to the buffer stock by suspending their voting privileges

As we indicated in a \n     conservation with your office, however, many or most of the \n     questions you have submitted cannot be answered definitively \n     by us; we will attempt, therefore, to set out some of the \n     considerations which would be relevant to decisions by (1) \n     the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to \n     investigate or prosecute an activity, or (2) a court hearing \n     a complaint (Government or private), and which require us to \n     answer most of the questions with either ``it depends'' or \n     ``probably not.'' A small number of your questions can be \n     answered with probable ``Okays.''\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes to appear at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Your first question--``Under United States antitrust law, \n     is it permissible for 26 competing producers and purchasers \n     of a particular commodity to form a single organization for \n     the purpose of regulating their business activities?''--is \n     the basis for all those which follow. Certainly the act of \n     forming an organization comprised of members with like \n     interests is neither unheard of nor automatically (per se) \n     unlawful; that is precisely the rationale for the formation \n     of trade associations or other cooperative activity among \n     competitors that is meant to enhance their business or \n     professional positions. Because the antitrust laws are \n     concerned with competition and not competitors, they are not \n     generally invoked to challenge the existence of \n     organizations, only organizational behavior or activities \n     which may disadvantage consumers (i.e., the ``market''). (For \n     the same reasons, an organization such as the one posited \n     in Question 2 (one formed for the purpose of carrying out \n     the specific purposes set out in Questions 2a-2i), would \n     not likely offend any of United States antitrust laws, \n     although, as we discuss below, and the enclosed article \n     illustrates, the actual carrying out of some of them may \n     constitute violations of those laws.) \\2\\\n       Market share data is most generally used with respect to \n     the likely consequences of a merger or acquisition, i.e., \n     with whether the ``effect of [the transaction] may be \n     substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a \n     monopoly.'' \\3\\ Accordingly, the information contained in \n     Questions 1a and 1b (three producers in the proposed \n     organization supply 92% of the commodity in question; three \n     purchasers in the proposed organization buy 77% of the \n     commodity) would not likely affect the lawfulness of the \n     formation or existence of an organization or association. \n     Those market-share numbers could, however, be determinative \n     of the lawfulness of several of the activities described in \n     your subsequent questions. Because the use of market power \n     has the potential to harm consumers, it has been suggested \n     that the market power of the participants in an organization \n     may be an appropriate starting point in an antitrust analysis \n     of the organization's actions: an examination of an agreement \n     among competitors, for example, should focus on determining \n     whether the agreement's (organization's) provisions ``enrich \n     the participants by harming consumers'' (i.e., ``whether the \n     participants have an incentive to behave in anticompetitive \n     ways'').\\4\\\n       Using such a test, and assuming the market-share numbers \n     you offer in Questions 1a and 1b, agreements or by-laws \n     expressing the purposes you set out in Questions 2a-2i, any \n     concerning the establishment or use of ``buffer stocks,'' as \n     well as any that spell out a participant's obligation to act \n     in accordance with organization-designated rules designed to \n     maintain a stable market price for the commodity at issue, \n     would be ideal candidates for close antitrust scrutiny. In \n     addition, use of ``buffer stocks'' to influence or stabilize \n     prices, as would any agreement or action directly or \n     indirectly affecting price, would constitute price fixing \n     under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). \n     Notwithstanding its decision in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. \n     Columbia Broadcasting System that seems to suggest a \n     tolerate for at least some agreements that technically fix \n     prices,\\5\\ the Supreme Court has stated innumerable times \n     that\n       ``The aim and result of every price-fixing agreements, if \n     effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The \n     power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, \n     involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and \n     unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fixed today may \n     through economic and business changes become the unreasonable \n     price of tomorrow. Once established, it may be maintained \n     unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by \n     the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed.''\\6\\\n       Situations similar to those described in questions 4b (use \n     of ``buffer stock'' to ``intervene and regulate the \n     market''), 5 (use of a ``reference price'' and ``buying any \n     market surplus * * * that causes the commodity price to drop \n     15% below the organization's reference price''), and 7 (sale \n     of some of ``buffer stock'' to cause market prices to \n     decrease when they are 10% above the reference price) have \n     been addressed by the Court in, e.g., United States v. \n     Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.\\7\\ In that case, the Court declared \n     unlawful a program pursuant to which gasoline companies \n     effectively placed a ``floor'' under prices by purchasing \n     surplus gasoline on the spot market. Noting that the program \n     was instituted in order to prevent gasoline gasoline price \n     from dropping sharply, the Court stated that even if the \n     agreeing companies ``were in no position to control the \n     market, to the extent that they raised, lowered, or \n     stabilized prices they would be directly interfering with the \n     free play of market forces'':\n       ``[U]nder the Sherman Act a combination formed for the \n     purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, \n     pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in \n     interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se.''\\8\\\n       As the enclosed article notes, the Court has also taken the \n     position that per se price fixing occurs even when the \n     agreement attempts to decrease a commodity's price (the \n     situation described in Question 7):\n       ``The respondent's [competing physicians who agreed to \n     limit fees charged to certain patients] principal argument is \n     that the per se rule is inapplicable because their agreements \n     are alleged to have procompetitive justifications. The \n     argument indicates a misunderstanding of the per se concept. \n     The anticompetitive potential inherent in all price-fixing \n     agreements justifies their facial invalidation even if \n     procompetitive justifications are offered for some.''\\9\\\n       Question 9 (re whether an organization of producers and \n     purchasers of a particular commodity may ``penalize members \n     for failing to meet their obligations to contribute to the \n     buffer stock by suspending their voting privileges'') is one \n     of the few to which the answer is ``Probably yes'' if the \n     organization rule violated is not one found likely to have an \n     anticompetitive effect.\\10\\ Suspension of organization voting \n     privileges probably does not violate the antitrust laws,\\11\\ \n     and is certainly not likely to considered as a per se \n     violation of them.\\12\\ On the other hand, any organization \n     rule directed at maintenance of a ``buffer stock'' is, as \n     noted above, likely subject to antitrust scrutiny; further, a \n     finding that full access to the organization was necessary in \n     order for the denied member to effectively compete in the \n     market could also affect the antitrust lawfulness of a \n     suspension of voting rights.\n       An annual financial audit of an organization's activities \n     (Question 10) would probably not present an antitrust problem \n     so long as the audit were conducted in a manner that would \n     not permit organization members to achieve any competitive \n     advantage over other members: an audit conducted by a third \n     party, and in which any reported data were aggregated so as \n     not to indicate the source of any particular information \n     would probably pass antitrust muster (Question 10a).\n       We do not know of any antitrust reason that an organization \n     would be required to support an activity/development it \n     considered not to be in its best interests; accordingly, \n     there would not seem to be any antitrust reason that would \n     prevent an organization from ``consider[ing]'' the \n     ``financial implications to all of its producers and \n     purchasers'' of the ``development of a more efficient supply \n     of a particular commodity'' (Question 14).\n       Depending upon what is meant by ``encouraging'' and \n     ``facilitating'' ``reasonable freight rates,'' such an \n     activity could subject an organization of producers and \n     purchasers of the commodity to be shipped to antitrust \n     sanctions. If, for example, ``encouragement''\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\n     and ``facilitation'' translated to an organization-sponsored \n     or -enforced boycott of shippers whose rates the organization \n     did not consider ``reasonable,'' the organization could be \n     considered as a combination in restraint of trade in \n     violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act;\\13\\ endorsement or \n     encouragement or sponsorship of various pricing schemes in \n     which freight costs are included in the price paid by buyers, \n     on the other hand, have received varying treatment by the \n     courts.\\14\\\n                                                  Janice E.

Madam President, the first question--and I will read a \nportion of their answer because I think it is quite relevant to this \nquestion of this treaty's impact on reducing competition. The question \nis, under the U.S. antitrust law, is it permissible for 26 competing \nproducers and purchasers of a particular commodity to form a single \norganization for the purpose of regulating their business activities?\n  That was an effort to sum up in a question what this rubber treaty, \nthis rubber agreement, is designed for. The American Law Division, I \nthought, would have a good handle on what U.S. law is, and if this \nhappened outside of the support of the U.S. Senate in the treaty \narrangement, would this agreement be legal under antitrust laws? Is \nwhat we are about to approve something that is legal under the \nantitrust laws? Or are we, by approving this treaty, making something \nthat is illegal permissible?\n  Their answer will be in depth in the Record, but I want to quote \nbriefly from their response because I think it is direct and to the \npoint. This is from the American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service:\n\n       Because the use of market power has the potential to harm \n     consumers, it has been suggested that the market power of the \n     participants in an organization may be an appropriate \n     starting point in an antitrust analysis of the organization's \n     actions: an examination of an agreement among competitors, \n     for example, should focus on determining whether the \n     agreement's [that is, the organization's] provisions ``enrich \n     the participants by harming consumers'' (i.e., ``whether the \n     participants have an incentive to behave in anticompetitive \n     ways'').\n       Using such a test, and assuming the market-share numbers \n     you offer in Questions 1a and 1b, agreements or by-laws \n     expressing the purpose you set out in Questions 2a-2i, any \n     concerning the establishment or use of ``buffer stocks,'' as \n     well as any that spell out in participant's obligation to act \n     in accordance with organization-designated rules designed to \n     maintain a stable market price for the commodity at issue, \n     would be ideal candidates for close antitrust scrutiny.\n\n  Madam President, in other words, the agreement we are considering \ntoday would be an ideal candidate for close antitrust scrutiny.\n  If Members have a doubt about how to vote, they ought to be concerned \nthat the very kind of agreement we are putting forth here would be a \ncandidate for close antitrust scrutiny. Those are my words which I have \ninterjected.\n  Continuing:\n\n       In addition, use of ``buffer stocks'' to influence or \n     stabilize prices, as would any agreement or action directly \n     or indirectly affecting price, would constitute price fixing \n     under Section 1 the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n  Let me repeat that, Madam President: ``* * * would constitute price \nfixing under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.''\n  Anybody who votes on this treaty who thinks they are stocking up for \nthe American consumers ought to think about that, because there is real \nindication here that what we are about to do would violate the \nantitrust laws if it were considered on its own merit without the \nblessings of the U.S. Senate in the treaty format.\n  They go on to quote from the Broadcast Music versus Columbia \nBroadcasting decision by the Supreme Court. I will quote their passage \nthat they have selected from the Supreme Court decision:\n\n       The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if \n     effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The \n     power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, \n     involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and \n     unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fix today may \n     through economic and business changes become the unreasonable \n     price of tomorrow. Once established, it may be maintained \n     unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by \n     the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed.\n\n  Madam President, I am under no illusions that this treaty will be \nratified today. I am cheered by recent progress, though, of eliminating \nsome of these international cartels, and I am cheered greatly by the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee and a commitment that this will \nbe the last time this kind of measure comes before the U.S. Senate with \nregard to rubber. His plea for a phaseout period is a reasonable and \nthoughtful argument. I appreciate the great support he has given to \nAmerican consumers as he has dealt with this issue in the past.\n  Madam President, as Members consider this issue, I hope very much \nthey will ask themselves if they are comfortable in taking $78 million \nof taxpayers' money to be used to stabilize prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I hope they will ask themselves if they \nare comfortable taking $78 million of taxpayers' money to help out the \nbig tire companies and the other special interests that will benefit by \nthis. I hope they will ask themselves if they are comfortable in \npassing or ratifying something that appears to violate our very \nantitrust laws, if they hadn't put it in the form of a treaty. I hope \nthey will ask themselves whether or not they are comfortable in telling \nconsumers that we are going to protect them against lower prices.\n  Madam President, this agreement is an embodiment of special \ninterests. There isn't anybody lobbying against the treaty. There have \nbeen tire companies lobbying on the hill for it. There have been people \ninterested in higher prices for rubber lobbying for it. There have been \nrepresentatives of corporations and labor on the hill lobbying for it.\n  Madam President, there hasn't been anybody lobbying against it. The \ntaxpayers don't really have a lobby. The\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nconsumers don't really have a lobby. No one pays people to come up here \nand speak for them--except one group. You see, the people who sent us \nhere believed and thought that it was our obligation to stand up for \nthem. I think most of them would be surprised to know that sometimes \nwhen they don't have a lobbyist, that voice goes unheard.\n  Madam President, this agreement is wrong. It is wrong because it is \nanticompetitive. It is wrong because it is a response to the special \ninterests. It is wrong because it is a misallocation of taxpayers' \nmoney. And it is wrong because it sets the bad example for what a \ncompetitive economy is all about. At a point in our world's history \nwhen the rest of the world is waking up to the advantages of free \nenterprise and competition, it is a shame to see the United States \nconsider and enact this kind of anticompetitive agreement.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nthird International Natural Rubber Agreement, which was reported \nfavorably by the Foreign Relations Committee 3 months ago. After \nholding a hearing on this important measure, our committee agreed that \nit would clearly serve the interests of the United States and ordered \nit reported favorably on a voice vote.\n  I believe that the Natural Rubber Agreement is a clear example of the \nway in which both producing and consuming nations of a major natural \nresource can work together to ensure adequate supply and stable prices. \nIts primary purposes are to encourage investment in rubber production \nin order to assure adequacy of supply, and to set up a mechanism to \nprevent excessive volatility in prices. These functions are \nparticularly important because the United States is the largest \nimporter of natural rubber, while just three countries--Thailand, \nIndonesia, and Malaysia--control 75 percent of the world's production. \nWithout a mechanism like the INRA, U.S. tire and rubber manufacturers \nas well as consumers would be more vulnerable to cartel-like behavior \nthat raises prices and creates uncertainty of supply.\n  U.S. participation in INRA has been supported by four successive \nadministrations, Democratic and Republican alike, and has received the \nadvice and consent of the Senate on two previous occasions. The \noriginal agreement was adopted in 1980 by a vote of 90 to 1, and the \nfirst extension in 1988 was approved unanimously, by a vote of 97 to 0. \nThe United Steelworkers of America has called ratification of this \ntreaty ``a matter of critical importance to our union, its members and \nfamilies--and the consumers who purchase the products we produce.'' If \nthe United States fails to ratify this treaty by the end of this year, \nit could mean the end of an agreement which has served to the benefit \nof the United States and the world for the last 16 years.\n  Mr. President, during the course of my service in the Senate I have \nrisen many times in support of treaties that have come under attack. \nThere are currently a number of extremely important treaties pending \nbefore the Senate that I deeply regret have not been taken up during \nthis session. The Chemical Weapons Convention is only the most recent \nexample, but several other agreements such as the U.N. Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen, should also be taken up at the earliest opportunity. I welcome \nthe chance to consider the International Natural Rubber Agreement \ntoday, and I urge that it be followed expeditiously by the other \ntreaties I have mentioned.\n  In closing, let me say that a failure to approve this treaty now \nwould be a great mistake. The objections that have been raised are not \nborne out by our experience with this agreement, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in giving their advice and consent to its \nratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, my distinguished friend from Rhode Island \nhas summarized the case well, and, as is always the case, he is a very \naccurate describer of events and facts. In this case, I find myself \ncoming to an opposite conclusion. But I continue to admire his \ncommitment to a sound presentation.\n  Madam President, I want to indicate that I think he is right that \nboth Democratic and Republican administrations in the past have \nsupported the agreement. I indicate that he is right. I think both the \nlarge corporations and the unions--at least it is my information--\nsupport the agreement. But, Madam President, I want to invite the \nMembers' attention to what happens if this agreement is not ratified, \nthe specter that the distinguished Senator has raised. What happens? If \nthe agreement is not ratified, $78 million goes back in the Treasury \nthat would be used to prop up prices of natural rubber. In other words, \nthe taxpayers of this country get a $78 million break.\n  Second, if this agreement is not ratified, we will have lower prices \nfor rubber than we would if the agreement is ratified.\n  Third, if the agreement is not ratified, we will have greater \ncompetition in the marketplace.\n  Finally, I think if the agreement is not ratified, we will have set \nan example that this country is serious about competition and its \nantitrust laws, and we will have renewed a commitment to our consumers. \nMy sense is that returning money to the Treasury, lower prices for \nconsumers, increased competition in the marketplace are good things, \nand that saying no to the special interests is appropriate as well. So \nat least in this Senator's judgment, we have a responsibility to vote \nagainst the treaty.\n\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PELL. I am happy to yield that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield back all time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution \nof ratification.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I ask for consideration of the resolution \nbefore the Senate by a division vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division is requested. Senators in favor of \nthe resolution of ratification will rise and stand until counted. \n(After a pause.) Those opposed will rise and stand until counted.\n  On a division, two-thirds of the Senators present and voting having \nvoted in the affirmative, the resolution of ratification is agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, is the Senate in executive or legislative \nsession?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in executive session.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the President \nbe notified of the approval of the treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11248-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Madam President, at the end of this session of Congress, \none of the Senate's longest-serving Members will be retiring. Senator \nClaiborne Pell's sterling 35-year record--actually it is 36 years this \nyear--of dedicated service to the people of Rhode Island and the United \nStates began in 1960, when he was elected to the first of his six \nterms. He is the third longest-serving Member of today's Senate, after \nonly Senator Thurmond and myself. Yet Senator Pell's service to the \nUnited States and to his own strong principles began even earlier.\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\n  Senator Pell's life has continued a long and honorable family \ntradition of service. His father, Herbert Claiborne Pell, was a \nCongressman and a Democratic State chairman before serving as U.S. \nMinister to Portugal and Hungary. Other Pell family ancestors include \nfive Members of the Senate or House of Representatives, one of whom, \nGeorge M. Dallas, also served as Vice President of the United States \nfrom 1845 to 1849, during the term of President Polk.\n  Senator Pell began his own lifetime of service when he was just 22 \nyears old. In 1940, after graduating cum laude from Princeton \nUniversity, he went to Europe to try and help concentration camp \ninmates. For his efforts, he was arrested not once but several times by \nthe Nazis. He has never ceased his efforts to assist the suffering. \nThis has been a guiding principle of his service on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, and underlies the truth of his acknowledged creed \nas a Senator: ``Translate ideas into action and help people.'' \nClaiborne Pell has long lived that precept. Four months before Pearl \nHarbor, he enlisted in the Coast Guard. As an enlisted man and then \nofficer, he was posted to duty stations in the North Atlantic and \nSicily. He remained in the Coast Guard Reserve after the war, attaining \nthe rank of captain before retiring in 1978.\n  After the war, Senator Pell turned his intellect and energies from \nthe waging of war to the building of peace, participating in the San \nFrancisco Conference that established the United Nations. He then \nserved 7 years in the State Department, representing the United States \nas a Foreign Service officer in Czechoslovakia and Italy. Just as I \ncarry a much-thumbed copy of the Constitution in my shirt pocket, \nSenator Pell carries in his hip pocket a copy of the United Nations \nCharter. Wherever you see Senator Pell, you can say, ``There goes the \nUnited Nations Charter.''\n  His passion for peace, born from a tradition of diplomacy and \ntempered by the brutality of the Nazis and the anguish of world-\nconsuming war, has honed his character and shaped his subsequent \nlegislative legacy.\n  As elegant in his reasoning as he is in his person, Senator Pell has \nbeen a key player in the passage of many pieces of landmark legislation \nduring his years in the Capitol. As befits his background of education \nand diplomacy, Senator Pell's accomplishments in the fields of \neducation and arms control are most notable, but he also has been \ninstrumental in authoring or ensuring passage of legislation supporting \nrail travel, curtailing drunk driving, and promoting cultural \nactivities. He is the originator of the High Speed Ground \nTransportation Act to improve passenger rail service. He is also a \nfounding father of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, having served as the principal Senate \nsponsor of the legislation that created these entities in 1965.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator \nPell has been influential in securing the passage of major arms control \ntreaties, including the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty that reduced \nthe nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States, a \ntreaty to prohibit the deployment of weapons of mass destruction on the \nsea floor, and a treaty prohibiting the use of environmental \nmodification techniques as weapons of war. I feel certain that he \nregrets that this, his final session of Congress, will end without the \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the passage of which \nhe has labored so mightily and so long to secure.\n  Senator Pell's longstanding commitment to universal human rights \nlends passion to his efforts to stem the spread of chemical weapons as \nwell as to other efforts. He has been a steadfast advocate for \ndiplomacy and multilateral solutions that avoid armed conflict, as well \nas a strong voice for justice when crimes have been committed against \nhumanity. He opposed the Vietnam war, opposed the gulf war, and called \nearly for the establishment of a war crimes tribunal in Bosnia, just as \nhis father had called for the Nuremburg tribunals after World War II.\n  On the home front, Senator Pell's appreciation for the benefits of \neducation resulted in perhaps his best known legacy, the Pell grants \nfor education. In 1972, Senator Pell won passage of legislation \nestablishing basic educational opportunity grants. This grant program, \nwhich provides assistance directly to low- and middle-income college \nstudents, was renamed the Pell Grant Program in 1980, in recognition of \nSenator Pell's leadership in making college more accessible to \ndeserving students.\n  Education is the hope of the future, the basis on which civilized \nsociety rests. Senator Pell has been active in furthering that \nprinciple in his service as chairman and ranking member on the \nEducation, Arts and Humanities Subcommittee of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee. He also authored the National Sea Grant College \nand Program Act of 1966, and he has been instrumental in supporting \nvocational and special education programs. These efforts, again, \nillustrate the credo that he has lived by, translating ideas into \nactions that help people. +\n  I will now refer to John Milton and his great work, Paradise Lost, \nwhich was written after he was totally blind.\n  In his work, ``Of Education,'' John Milton (1608-74) wrote:\n\n       I call therefore a complete and generous education that \n     which fits a man to perform justly, skillfully and \n     magnanimously all the offices both private and public of \n     peace and war.\n\n  By those standards, Senator Claiborne Pell can surely be judged a \nwell-educated man. He has served justly, skillfully, and magnanimously \nas a human rights activist, soldier, diplomat, businessman, and \nlegislator. He has done so all of his life, as a private citizen and as \nan elected official. In doing so, he has educated and informed all of \nus by his example.\n  Senator Pell has never let his passions override his reason or his \ncourtesy. He has never let the passions of the moment override his \nprinciples. And in a time when public service has been belittled and \nderided, he has never stopped striving to the best of his considerable \nability to make the world a safer, more civilized, more educated place.\n  I think of Claiborne Pell as Mr. Integrity. There is not a false word \nthat he has ever knowledgeably spoken. His word is as good as his bond. \nHis handshake is as good as his bond. And to Mr. Integrity I say I wish \nhim well as he leaves us to enjoy a much-deserved retirement with his \nlovely wife Nuala and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11257-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11258-S11259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, as we here in the Senate complete our work \nin the waning days of the 104th Congress, I would like to take just a \nfew minutes now to note the retirement of Senator Paul Simon, one of \nthe finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Although \nSenator Simon is leaving us at the conclusion of only his second term, \nhis accomplishments and his work in the Senate are representative of \nthose who have served far more years.\n  Anyone who knew Paul Simon as a young man must have known that this \nwas someone who was going somewhere, was going to go beyond the norm, \nsomeone who was going to succeed despite his modest beginnings.\n  Consider, for example, that at the tender age of 19, an age when few \nyoung men possess the maturity and the passion necessary for such an \nundertaking, Senator Simon began his career when he bought the Troy \nTribune in Troy, IL, thus becoming the youngest editor-publisher in the \nNation. There he made a name for himself by leading a crusade against \nlocal crime figures and machine politicians. Eventually expanding his \nbusiness to a chain of 14 weeklies, Senator Simon's dedication to the \nprinciples of free speech and political reform were solidified as a \nresult of his firsthand experience.\n  Following his service in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps, \nwhich included an assignment along the Iron Curtain during the height \nof the cold war, the young Senator-to-be returned to the United States \nand entered legislative politics by winning election to the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives in 1954.\n  Madam President, as a clear signal of the political reformer he \nintended to be, Representative Paul Simon was one\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\nof the first legislators to publicly release his personal financial \ndata, a practice that he has observed ever since. After 8 years in the \nHouse, Paul Simon moved to the Illinois Senate where he again served \nwith distinction. In addition to gaining invaluable experience in the \nState legislature, Senator Simon's illustrious career also includes \nservice as his State's Lieutenant Governor, as a teacher at both \nSangamon State University in Springfield and the John F. Kennedy School \nof Politics at Harvard University and as a U.S. Congressman in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I believe that the public life of Paul Simon will best be remembered \nfor the passion and the integrity that he brought to his work in the \nSenate. Let us not forget that it was our colleague from Illinois who \nwas the Senate's lead sponsor of the direct student loan program which \nPresident Clinton has cited as one of the major legislative \nachievements of his Presidency. Let us not forget that it was Paul \nSimon who led the way and won passage of the National Literacy Act, a \nbill that created national and State literacy centers to improve the \neducation of adults. And let us not forget that it was our same soft-\nspoken friend who championed the School-to-Work Opportunities Act so \nthat those young citizens who may not go on to college are not left \nbehind. And let us not forget that it was the former newspaper man, for \nwhom the first amendment has always had special meaning, who was \nwilling to take on the broadcast networks and lead the fight to curb \ntelevision violence.\n\n  Despite these numerous accomplishments, I personally will remember \nwith eternal respect and admiration the degree of passion and \nintellectual intensity that Senator Simon brought to our several \ndebates over the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Since \nentering this body in January of 1985, no one has been more outspoken \non the need for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal \nbudget than has my friend, Paul Simon.\n  Of course, no one has opposed it with more intensity than I have \nopposed it, but that does not gainsay the fact that he was a very \nworthy protagonist and supporter of that amendment.\n  Now, Paul--not Paul Simon, the Apostle Paul--in his epistle to the \nPhilippians said, and I read from chapter 4, verse 8:\n\n       Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever \n     things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever \n     things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever \n     things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if \n     there be any praise, think on these things.\n\n  Madam President, as I look at that bit of Scripture which has been \ngiven to us by the Apostle Paul, I think of its application to the life \nof Paul Simon--Paul Simon. Paul the Apostle said, ``Whatsoever things \nare true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just.'' I \nthink these typify the life and actions of Paul Simon. He is true; he \nis honest. I cannot even imagine Paul Simon ever doing a dishonest \nthing or ever having spoken an untrue word or ever having acted other \nthan in a just and upright manner. So the Apostle Paul may very well \nhave been speaking of Paul Simon and others like him.\n  So throughout it all, Madam President, the hours upon hours that we \nspent in this Chamber debating the balanced budget amendment and \nothers, I never once saw Paul Simon exhibit any rancor, never once did \nhe waver in his commitment to his cause, and I can say truthfully that \nin all of my 44 years in the Congress of the United States I have never \nfaced a more affable, a more sincere opponent than I have faced in the \nlikes of the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Paul Simon has served his country as a journalist, editor, \nbusinessman, soldier, teacher, and legislator. In each of these \nendeavors he has always undertaken his work skillfully, fairly, and \nwith a degree of integrity and honesty that has been an inspiration to \nus all. As he prepares to leave the Senate and return to his beloved \nState of Illinois, I offer this remarkable American my gratitude for \nhis fairness and good fellowship. He is, indeed, the happy warrior, and \nI extend my best wishes to him, and so does Erma, my wife--to him and \nto his lovely wife, our best wishes, by saying thank you and good luck \nto our friend from the State of Illinois.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, first let me compliment my colleague, \nthe Senator from West Virginia, on the eloquent statements he has made \nwith regard to our colleagues here. He speaks with great eloquence and \nfeeling about both Senator Pell and Senator Simon. Obviously, I join \nhim in the accolades that he is heaping upon both of those Senators. \nThey are certainly deserving.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus and Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2123 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this morning we had excellent \ntestimony in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee from a \nnumber of witnesses who represented the families of airplane crashes. I \nbelieve we had five or six unfortunate airplane crashes. We also had \nother representatives of next of kin there at the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee. It was a very moving hearing.\n  I want to commend the witnesses who appeared. I also want to say that \nit is time we act in terms of designating the National Transportation \nSafety Board as the responsible agency in terms of what happens after \nan airplane crash. We hope there are no airplane crashes. That would be \nan ideal situation. Whether it is a small crash or a big crash, \ninevitably in human history there will probably be some.\n  We want the next of kin to be taken care of and notified in a \nsensitive and organized way. This is not entirely the fault of the \nairlines, as was pointed out in the balance of the testimony we \nreceived. In the past, the rules have not been clear as to who is in \ncharge. Some of the manifest problems in the past have arisen because \nof different practices. Sometimes passengers will get off a plane at \nthe very last minute, even after having checked in.\n  In fairness to the airlines, there has been some uncertainty. Now we \nhave an opportunity to set up a system, working with the Gore \nCommission, and I am pleased to be designated to be a liaison to the \nGore Commission, plus the FAA bill that is before the Senate. This \nafternoon at 3:30 I believe the conferees on the FAA bill will be \nmeeting, and part of that will be to be sure the National \nTransportation Safety Board is designated as the agency with the \nresponsibility and the proper equipment, funding and personnel to deal \nwith families and next of kin, and to work with our airports and our \nairlines in times of emergencies.\n\n  Let me commend the National Transportation Safety Board, because \nunder the leadership of Jim Hall, I believe they have been doing an \nexcellent job with their responsibilities. I am glad they are willing \nto assume this additional responsibility of being the lead agency, of \ntaking the lead, in terms of dealing with families and next of kin and \nnotification and counseling and so forth in times of an airplane crash.\n  Let me also say a word about some of our smaller airports and some of \nour smaller airplanes. We want to be sure they are safe for the flying \npublic. Many of our people do not live at a hub airport. A hub airport \nis a central airport such as New York, Minneapolis, or Denver. Over \nhalf of the airline passengers in this country originate at small \nairports, on smaller planes. We certainly want to make them safe and \nreassure the flying public of their safety. However, we cannot get into \na real expensive situation. We have to find some of the new devices, \nsee they are brought in line and manufactured in large numbers, so we \ncan find reasonable ways to achieve air safety.\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\n  This afternoon, as the Federal aviation authorization bill moves \nforward and comes to the Senate floor, I hope we all keep in mind the \nfine testimony we heard this morning from those fine witnesses. I want \nto help them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know that a number of our colleagues \nthis morning and this afternoon called attention to the retirement of \nour colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pell. I \nwant to commend Senator Helms and the others for their comments and \nidentify with the remarks made earlier today by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  There are few people who can claim the record, the respect, or the \nadmiration of all of their colleagues as can Senator Pell. Senator \nPell, as most people know, came to the Senate in 1960. Someone entering \nthe Senate today, in order to have the same record in terms of numbers \nof years served, would retire in the year 2033. Thirty-six years from \nnow, our country--and perhaps this body--will be much different, and I \ndaresay 36 years from now, there will still be those who will recall \nthe contribution and, again, the remarkable record of this very gentle \nman.\n  Senator Pell came during turbulent times. He became a U.S. Senator \nunder then President Kennedy, served under President Johnson, President \nNixon, President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President \nBush, and now President Clinton. He has seen leadership of all kinds, \nDemocratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, good and bad. \nThrough all of this, his gentle nature, his remarkable ability to find \ncommon ground, his willingness to reach out to all sides in an effort \nto govern is something we can all be thankful for. He has a deep-seated \nbelief in good Government, in democracy, and knows what it takes in \nthis democracy to govern well. I don't recall how many times, but I can \nrecall many occasions when Senator Pell would lecture us in our caucus \nabout how ill-advised people are to pursue negative campaigns in Senate \nelections. He would remind us of that time and again. In spite of all \nthe advice he got to be a negative campaigner, he adamantly refused. In \nspite of all that advice, and perhaps because of his determination to \noverride that advice, he won every election by more than 60 percent of \nthe vote. I think, in large measure, that is because the people of \nRhode Island know him the best. We know him, but they know him better. \nThey know his decency, they know his commitment to them and to all of \nus, and they know of his record. They are proud in so many ways for all \nthat he has done for them and for our country in the time that he \nserved.\n  So it is with regret that we note his departure in this Congress. It \nis with a great deal of gratitude that many of us have been able to \ncall him our friend. It is with admiration that we look at his record \nand aspire to the heights and to the accomplishments that it \nrepresents. We thank him for his friendship. We wish him and Nuala well \nin their life ahead.\n  In my view, there are still opportunities for Senator Pell to serve \nhis country. I hope that that might happen. But regardless of what the \nfuture holds, no one can take away the 36 years of accomplishment, the \n36 years of contribution to democracy, to the strength of this country, \nto the breadth and depth of the affection and love he has for it. Madam \nPresident, he will be missed. We don't wish him farewell. We only wish \nhim Godspeed as he continues in his role--whatever it may be.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Madam President, today I am proud to announce that we \nhave an opportunity to pass the most wide ranging national parks and \npublic land legislation in decades; that is, the Presidio omnibus parks \nbill.\n  This report encompasses 2 years, or thereabouts, of various attempts \nby Members on both sides to pass bills that affect this area of our \nnational heritage. We had hearings. We had intense negotiations. I \nthink the bills contained in the package really meet our Nation's \nenvironmental needs. It is good news for the national parks, and good \nnews for land and resource conservation.\n  This package has over 700 pages. At last count there were 126 bills \nincluded. They range from the San Francisco Presidio to the Tallgrass \nPrairie National Preserve, Sterling Forest protection, Snowbasin land \nexchange, Black Patriot Memorial extension, Nicodemus National Historic \nSite, Japanese-American Patriotism Memorial, numerous Civil War sites, \nOak Creek Wilderness Scenic Recreation Area, the New Bedford whaling \nparks, and the Women's Rights National Heritage Park. It is estimated \nthat there are about 37 States that are going to be affected by this \npackage.\n\n  It is quite reasonable, Madam President, to ask the Senator from \nAlaska, well, why do we have to have this in a big package? Why did we \nnot move on this over the last 2 years? I will tell you. As chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we have held hearings on \nthese bills. So has the House. But on our side we have had holds on \nevery single bill at one time or another in this package. The way it \nworks around here, as we all know, is some Members feel if they want to \nget their bill through and they see others moving, they put what we \ncall holds on things. We have had holds, and there is no use pointing \nthe finger at each other because that is not going to get this package \npassed.\n  I do want to explain because some of the media cannot seem to \nunderstand why we have this enormous package. It is simply because of \nthe way this place works. And when a Member wants to proceed with a \nbill out of our committee and we have voted it out and we cannot bring \nit up, it is because there is a hold on that bill. So we are down to \nthe end of the 104th Congress. The name of the game is to try to \naddress this package and recognize that we have withdrawn from the \npackage the contentious portions that were identified potentially as \nveto material. These included some bills that the Senator from Alaska \nsupported and felt very strongly about. One was the Tongass 15-year \nextension which would have prolonged the life of our only manufacturing \nplant, our only pulp mill, our only year-around manufacturing plant \nthat wanted to convert from an old technology to a new technology by \ninvesting some $150 million to $200 million, but in order to do that \nthey had to have an extension of the contract with the Forest Service \nto have an adequate timber supply to amortize that investment.\n  Members say, why is Alaska different? Why do you have to have a \ncontractual commitment? The reasons are simple. We have no other source \nof supply than the U.S. Government through the U.S. Forest Service \nbecause we do not have private timber which is exported out of the \nState. The Forest Service timber, Government timber is prohibited from \nexport, and as a consequence nobody is going to make that kind of \ninvestment without an extension of the contract. And their current \ncontract expires in the year 2004. But the administration found that \nunacceptable and advised us that they would proceed with a veto if it \nwere in the package. So the Senator from Alaska withdrew that.\n  Boundary Waters Canoe Area, which is an issue that some Members feel\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\nvery strongly about in Minnesota, was also noted by the administration \nthat if it were in there, they would initiate a veto. Other issues that \nwere contentious that were threatened for veto included Utah \nWilderness, and that issue is somewhat academic because of the action \ntaken by the President in invoking the antiquities; grazing issue, \nwhich many Members in the West felt very strongly about. So they are \nnot in the package. We have taken them out--grazing, Utah wilderness, \nTongass, Boundary Waters Canoe Area.\n  Now we are left with a situation where it is very late in the \nCongress. This legislation is crucial in California not just to the \nPresidio but to an area that I feel very strongly about, and that is \nthe cleanup of the San Francisco Bay area. I know how strongly the \nCalifornia delegation feels about that. If the administration wants to \nfind an excuse to veto this, obviously they can do it. But they are \ncontemplating, if you will, a veto message per correspondence with the \nWhite House, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nExecutive Office of the President be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski: I am responding to your September \n     16th request for the Administration's view on the proposed \n     conference report on H.R. 1296, the Omnibus Parks \n     legislation. The Administration received this legislation \n     late Tuesday night, September 17th, and is carefully \n     reviewing this massive proposal, which now incorporates over \n     100 free-standing bills and spans over 500 pages of \n     legislative language.\n       We strongly support legislation to improve the management \n     of the Presidio in San Francisco, use Federal funds to help \n     acquire the Sterling Forest in the New York/New Jersey \n     Highlands Region, and establish the Tallgrass Prairie \n     National Preserve in Kansas. These are measures that would \n     protect nationally significant natural resources, have been \n     the subject of thorough public review, and enjoy broad, \n     bipartisan support.\n       Your letter, however, indicates that the conference report \n     will contain a number of wholly unacceptable provisions--ones \n     which erode protection of nationally significant natural \n     resource areas, override existing legal requirements, and \n     prevent responsible management of federal lands. Your letter \n     indicates, for example, that the report includes a mandated \n     extension of the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) contract in the \n     Tongass National Forest (AK) and a requirement to allow \n     motorized use in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness \n     (MN). Department of Agriculture officials have repeatedly \n     indicated that the Secretary would recommend veto of a bill \n     that would mandate an extension of the KPC contract. \n     Similarly, actions such as opening up three portages at the \n     Boundary Waters Wilderness areas to motorized use would be \n     cause for a veto of this bill.\n       On July 26th, the President urged the Congress to refrain \n     from including controversial measures during the conference \n     on H.R. 1296. Unfortunately, it appears that many of these \n     objectionable provisions remain.\n       We are committed to working with the Congress on \n     legislation that protects our Nation's natural resources. As \n     soon as the Administration completes its review, we can work \n     together to eliminate controversial items and discuss other \n     provisions that could move forward in a bipartisan way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They cite specifically what their veto threat covers, \nand we have eliminated those, Madam President. Now I am told some \nMembers on the other side are going to insist that the bill be read. \nThat is fine--700 pages. It is going to take 10 hours. Talk about delay \ntactics. What is the objective of that? I do not know. They say they \nhave not read the bill. We ought to go back to the Members because this \nstuff has been hanging around for 2\\1/2\\ years. We have had hearings on \nit. We have had discussions. The Members who are motivated from the 37 \nStates know what is in the bill. We are talking about further delay \nwhich is not necessary. We should act now. It is late in the game. If \nwe do not act now, we are going to lose.\n  Let me tell you what the parliamentary procedure is. I hope this will \ncome up today. It should come up now. We have the time. But if a Member \nmoves to recommit the package, the whole package is dead. It is over. \nIt will not happen.\n  What we have done in this bill, we have created new parks, \nestablished five new parks: Shenandoah Valley National Battlefield in \nVirginia to protect the Civil War battlefields; Tallgrass Prairie \nNatural Preserve in Kansas to protect one of the last remaining \nunplowed sections of tallgrass prairie in the country; Nicodemus \nNational Historic site to protect the town established as a community \nfor freed black slaves after the Civil War; New Bedford National \nHistorical Park to honor the whaling industry--not just in \nMassachusetts because the whaling industry started in Massachusetts and \nwhere did they whale? They whaled in Alaska, my State. They went around \nPt. Barrow, and that is where they whaled. You go to Pt. Barrow today \nand you can see the remnants of the contribution of the New Bedford \nwhalers. So this is a joint effort; Boston Harbor Islands to protect \nunique islands in the Boston Harbor.\n  There is better protection of existing national parks. It provides \nfor boundary modifications, expansion of 20 parks around the country \nfrom a 1,000 percent increase in size at the Richmond National \nBattlefield in Virginia to minor boundary adjustments in Zion National \nPark in Utah. It protects existing national parks. The legislation \nprovides protection for important historical events and persons by \nexpanding the boundary to further protect the Manzanar National \nHistoric Site in California, adjusting boundaries at Independence Hall, \nimproved management of the route taken by voting rights marchers from \nSelma to Montgomery as a national historic trail, and reauthorizing \nfunding for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.\n  We established new memorials. This legislation provides for the \nconstruction of memorials on The Mall in Washington, DC, the Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Black Revolutionary War Patriots, and the Japanese \nAmerican Patriots. We protect rivers from coast to coast. The bill \nprotects important rivers, from the Columbia in Washington to the St. \nVrain in Colorado and the Lamprey in New Hampshire. And we protect \nhallowed ground, where the blood of American soldiers was shed in \nbattle. The bill protects important battlefields from Yorktown, where \nAmericans won independence, through the Civil War battlefields in \nVirginia, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia, and establishes the \nAmerican Battlefield Protection Program.\n  Madam President, it authorizes funding to begin restoration of the \nSan Francisco Bay. This bill authorizes $450 million over 3 years to \nprovide restoration for that jewel of the west coast.\n  This bill is not just about expanding the role of the Federal \nGovernment. It also contains significant reforms of existing programs \nand policies, and makes unneeded Federal lands available for use by \nother levels of government. We have a reduction of unneeded Federal \nlands. The legislation transfers unreserved BLM land in the State of \nWyoming for schools, removes inappropriate limitations from developed \nlands across the coast of North Dakota, corrects a 90-year-old survey \nof public lands in Idaho, provides lands to the Taos Pueblo tribe in \nNew Mexico.\n  The administrative reforms of the national parks are addressed. The \nbill includes a number of provisions to improve the management of the \nNational Park Service, from encouraging private sector involvement to \nimproving the housing of park rangers, which is sorely needed; Senate \nconfirmation for the park director; the elimination of unnecessary \ncongressional reporting requirements, and numerous other authorities to \nincrease the leverage of Federal funds.\n  Recreation Fee Policy Program: The bill provides for the complete \noverhaul of the current recreation fee policies, which will provide \nimproved funding for the parks and forests by establishing a permanent \nprogram to permit agencies to retain recreation fees without \nappropriations.\n  The environmental agenda: We have tried to address it within my \ncommittee, and the legislation provides two key provisions which \nrepresent the vision of how we intend to better protect the environment \nwithout the heavy hand of the Federal Government.\n  One of those issues is the significant development of the Presidio \ntrust. I\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\nhave been out to the Presidio on several occasions. I know how the \nPennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which brought about the \ntremendous and successful renovation of Pennsylvania Avenue here in \nWashington, DC, has worked for the benefit and the beautification of \nthis city. The Presidio, a former military installation at the foot of \nthe Golden Gate, has been managed by the park service. But, clearly, \nthe park service does not have the expertise or the knowledge to \ndevelop that area in compatibility with its unique recreational \nattractiveness and the traditional association of what that military \nfacility was.\n  As a consequence, we have created a Presidio trust. Instead of the \n$1.2 billion proposal at one time that was advocated by some for the \nFederal Government to manage the Presidio, San Francisco, in \nperpetuity, what we have here is a bipartisan approach. We talked about \nit this morning in a press conference with the two Senators from \nCalifornia. It turns the real estate management aspects of the Presidio \nover to a private volunteer nonprofit trust--again, similar to the \nPennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\n  I have met with the volunteers in San Francisco that have worked to \nput this concept together. I am satisfied that they have the vision and \nthe expertise and the capability to make this work. It will reduce the \nburden of the Federal Government's role. It will still provide a \npresence for the National Park Service, and it will add dramatically to \nthe full utilization, with the right balance, by the people on the \nground who have the best interests of the Presidio and San Francisco at \nheart.\n\n  This is a bill for all Americans, and that is why it is so \nattractive, and that is why it is so necessary we move at this time. \nThe bill authorizes, as well, a land exchange in Utah. The significance \nof this is the Olympics, which are going to take place in Utah in the \nyear 2002. This would provide a very simple exchange that would make \nthe downhill event for the 2002 Olympics a reality, which will permit \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of persons around the world to enjoy \nit.\n  So, what we have here, as a consequence of action taken last night, \nwhere my conferees agreed to sign off on the package and send it over \nto the House of Representatives, and the House stayed in until midnight \nlast night to accommodate their procedure and sign off on the bill, and \nnow it is over here, the package. So, Mr. President, it is fair to say \nthat now is the time to take it up.\n  I have been advised there had been some concern on the other side. I \nhave yet to be privy to what that concern might be. But, again, we have \nbeen waiting 2 years for this material to get this far. If we pass it, \nit will go over to the House, and I am satisfied the House will move it \nbecause we have taken the contentious portions out of it. I do not know \nwhat more we can responsibly do, what more and greater obligation I \nhave as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to try \nto move this, because I know how much it means to each Senator with \nregard to various parts and portions of the 126 parts that are in this \nbill. And I am sorry that we were not able to be responsive, as we \nreported these bills out of committee individually. But, again, I want \nto make reference to the way this place works, when Members put holds \non every bill and we cannot move them on the floor to passage. We are \nleft with this dilemma, which is the 126-bill package.\n  Some people say, why do we have to have it this way? I am sorry we \nhave to have it this way, but it is this way now or nothing, because \nthere is simply no other alternative and there is no more time left.\n  The leadership has indicated we are winding this session up. The end \nof the fiscal year is coming. It is now or never for the Presidio \npackage, because if it is held up, those people who are holding it up \nhave to bear the responsibility for annihilating, killing the largest \nsingle environmental package of parks bills that have come before the \nCongress in this session and, I am told, for the last decade.\n  I am pretty reasonable. I have been around here for a while. I have \ntried to accommodate everybody. I have taken my licks on this one. I \nhave lost, in my State, my only year-round industry because I could not \nget enough support for a 15-year extension of the Ketchikan Pulp Mill, \nso they could put in a $200 million investment. That is my sacrifice. \nThat probably means more to me than any other single thing. But the \nobligation I have to move this package is real as well. So, at the \ndictate of the administration, we have stricken the Tongass out of it.\n  Some might ask, do you have any fallback? Yes, I suspect there is a \nfallback. Perhaps the Record should note what it is, because without \ngetting too technical, what we asked for was a 15-year extension of a \ncontract that was going to expire in the year 2004. The administration \nsaid they would veto the bill if that was in.\n  What we have proposed in this package, I will be very direct with the \nPresident, is not to pursue the 15-year contract which would mandate 15 \nyears beyond the year 2004, but to simply take the remaining years on \nthat contract, which are 8 years, and simply transfer that from pulp \nutilization to our two operating sawmills. That is all we have left in \nAlaska of any significance.\n  In brief, the contract for the remainder of the term through the year \n2004, for the next 8 years, would simply be transferred over from pulp \nutilization to sawmill utilization.\n  The 15-year extension, as a consequence of the Presidential veto \nthreat, has been withdrawn. I understand that that has been \nsatisfactory to those who have objected. Of course, the Utah wilderness \nhas been withdrawn. Grazing has been withdrawn. The boundary waters \ncanoe area, which was also under Presidential veto threat, has been \nwithdrawn.\n  To those who are scrutinizing this, I wish them well, but that is the \npackage, that is what we are left with. It is now or never, and we \nbetter do it now because we simply don't have time, and we will walk \nout of here in the next few days leaving behind us a truly monumental \nbill with monumental implications.\n  I might add, the Senator from New Jersey and I have had differences \nof opinion relative to his role in the bill. I am not going to prolong \nthose differences other than to say Sterling Forest is it. He is a \nwinner. He can leave the U.S. Senate bringing home something that is \nvery meaningful to New Jersey and New York.\n  I could go on into the history of the process over the last 2 years, \nbut I don't know that that would serve any purpose at this time. I \ncould lament the dissatisfaction of my friends from some of the States \nwhose issues we simply had to take out of here in the spirit of \ncompromise relative to trying to get the job done and get a package out \nthat is meaningful, but I hope that those who are listening and \nreflecting now recognize that they, too, have an obligation. That \nobligation is either to come forth and support this package now, this \ncompromise package that is so important, that is so significant, that \nis so meaningful, or accept the responsibility of killing a package \nthat has been over 2\\1/2\\ years--one Senator reminded me that his \nparticular interest in the bill had been in this over 4 years.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to look through the title portion and \nrecognize the items that are of interest to their State, whether it \ncovers rivers and trails, historic areas, civil rights issues, Civil \nand Revolutionary War sites, fee generations for their own parks, \nrecommended administration management provisions, boundary adjustments, \nthe Presidio, certainly the California bay environmental enhancement, \nand recognize that it is now or never. We can get it done now and go \nout of session with the most meaningful bipartisan legislative package \nthat has come before the U.S. Senate, or we can grouse around, object, \nsend it back for reconsideration and leave with nothing done.\n  But I want the Record to note, as chairman of my committee, I have \ndischarged, along with my conferees and our committee, both Democrats \nand Republicans, our obligation. We have held the hearings, we reported \nit out, we moved on it last night through a conference process. The \nHouse signed off on it. It is over here now. I do not want to be \npresumptuous in being critical, but I don't know what we are waiting \nfor, Mr. President. We are ready to go. We can get this done now. The \nSenator from Alaska is ready to bring it to\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\nthe body. I have discussed it with the leadership. I am awaiting word.\n  So the rest is up to you, I say to my distinguished colleagues, \nwhether this package is meaningful enough to recognize, just like every \npackage, that sure, there are some things in there somebody doesn't \nlike. But you try to put together 126 bills and have to put it in a \npackage like this because there is no other way that you are allowed to \nbring them up individually because Members put holds on them.\n  I implore the media that is going to scrutinize this to recognize the \nreality. The poison pills, so to speak, have been taken out. I am not \ngoing to reflect on the fact there are an awful lot of westerners who \nare unhappy because their concerns are not met in this package. That is \ngoing to be for the next session. That is going to be for, perhaps, the \nelection. But we have to do what we have to do, and right now, the \nthing to do is to move this bill out because the poison pills are out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter and Representative Don Young's \nletter to the President asking for a position on those items that he \nwould veto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are about to conclude action on H.R. \n     1296, a bill to provide for the administration of certain \n     Presidio properties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer. \n     As you may know, a number of popular and also controversial \n     measures have become part of the conference discussion; \n     therefore, this bill is now known as the Omnibus Parks \n     legislation containing well over 100 specific legislative \n     provisions.\n       Among the controversial issues discussed for inclusion in \n     this conference report are the Senate-passed grazing reform \n     legislation, S. 1459; reforms to the management of the \n     Boundary Waters Wilderness, S. 1738; Sterling Forest \n     Protection Act, S. 223; S. 884, the Utah Public Lands \n     Management Act; S. 1877, the Ketchikan Pulp Company contract \n     extension; and S. 1371, the Snow Basin Land Exchange, which \n     is necessary for the winter olympics.\n       We are about to file a conference report on this omnibus \n     legislation, and it is important that we have your views. \n     Because of your Administration's long-standing opposition, we \n     are prepared to propose excluding the grazing reform \n     legislation, any Utah Wilderness proposals, and several other \n     controversial measures to which the Administration has \n     expressed opposition. Attached is a list of measures we \n     propose for inclusion in the conference report. Among these \n     measures, we feel the need to include two items which your \n     Administration has expressed opposition to in the past. One \n     is the extension of the Ketchikan Pulp Co. contract, S. 1877; \n     and the other is a proposed compromise on the Boundary Waters \n     Canoe Area which would allow motorization on three portages, \n     but nothing more.\n       It is important that we have your views on this conference \n     report prior to close of business on Wednesday, September 18. \n     We are ready and prepared to discuss any of the measures \n     proposed for inclusion in this conference report at any time, \n     and our staffs are prepared to provide any additional \n     information you may need in your consideration of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Young,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Resources.\n     Frank H. Murkowski,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I encourage those who are responsible for the movement \nof the process around here to reflect on my words.\n  I compliment all those who have worked so hard to bring this package \ntogether, both in the minority and majority: Senator Johnston, Senator \nBumpers, Senator Domenici, Senator Nickles. I also thank the California \ndelegation for their tireless efforts to push this legislation. I thank \nthose who have volunteered their time in San Francisco, as well as \nother areas of California, to push the merits of the creation of the \ntrust in the Presidio package, and I thank the staff on both the \nminority side and majority side: Tom Williams, Gregg Renkes and many \nothers, who worked night and day to put this package together; my \ncolleague in the House, Representative Young, of course; my senior \nSenator, Senator Stevens, because oftentimes we, as Alaskans, are \ntypified as those who want to run through the public domain with \ndevelopment schemes of one kind or another.\n  We will take our lumps as we go along the road in trying to \ncommunicate the particular posture of our State, which is only 38 years \nold, and the realization that we are still trying to create land \npatterns in a State that is 80 percent owned by the Federal Government, \nat a time when the other States accomplished that 150-200 years ago. \nThey developed their land patterns. They had private ownership within \ntheir State. We have public ownership in ours one-fifth the size of the \nUnited States.\n  We are a storehouse of natural resources. What we try to communicate \nis that with science and technology we can do a better job of \ndeveloping our resources. We look at our timber industry. We have the \nlargest of all our national forests at 17 million acres. We set aside \ntwo-thirds of that forest in perpetuity, set aside 5 to 7 million acres \nof prime timberland. We are trying to maintain a timber industry in the \nlargest of all our forests on about 1.7 million acres in perpetuity and \na 100-year regrowth cycle. They cut more firewood in New York than we \ncut commercially in Alaska in the Nation's largest forest. They cut \nover 1 billion board feet for their commercial activities, yet there \nare those who want to close us down, terminate all timbering in our \nforests.\n  The Sierra Club wants to terminate all timbering in the national \nforests. But what we are trying to do is maintain a viability based on \nrenewability, do a better job. Our fisheries are at an all time high. \nWe have had record runs 8 of the last 11 years. We have been doing it \nright. We think others could learn from us. It is a little like rowing \nuphill.\n  You talk about oil and gas exploration. We know we can open up ANWR \nsafely, given the opportunity. But we have become an environmental \ncause. We have over 60 environmental agencies that have established \nthemselves in Anchorage, AK. The young attorneys come up and do their \nmissionary work, because these organizations need a cause. The cause is \nfar away. It is a ``good cause,'' idealistic. When we attempt to say, \nwell, just a minute now, we have an opportunity and a right to come \ninto the Union, develop our resources, manage them correctly; they, \nthrough extreme rhetoric, suggest that we are desecrating the country. \nThe media picks up on it. And it is simply not true.\n  So we feel a little sensitive when we are criticized with any \ndevelopment scenario. We could open up ANWR safely. We know it. We have \nthe technology. We are selling American ingenuity short. The \nenvironmental community has in many cases established a fear mentality \nin the American public that somehow we cannot develop resources safely. \nIt is evidenced in the debate around here on the grazing issue, on the \ntimbering salvage issue, on oil and gas exploration, on mining--drive \nthem offshore; bring them in from other countries; send those jobs \noverseas.\n  The deficit balance of payment; what is it all about? Over a third of \nit is the cost of imported oil. What are we doing today? We are 51.4 \npercent dependent on imported oil. In 1974, we were about 36 percent \ndependent. We took action. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nNow we are selling it off. The Department of Energy says by the year \n2000 we will be two-thirds, 66 percent, dependent on imported oil. What \ndoes that do with our leverage with the Mideast? The Mideast is in a \ncrisis. One of these days, we are going to pay the price because we \nhave increasingly become more dependent on imported oil.\n  Well, I am using my time to vent my frustration, but what I want to \ncommunicate here is we have put aside some of our Alaskan issues \nrelative to the merits of this bill, issues that we feel very strongly \nabout, simply because this is a good bill. It is a compromise bill. And \nit is time, after 2\\1/2\\ years, or 4 years, depending on your point of \nview, or at least the 104th Congress, to move it now. If we do not move \nit now, it is not going to be moved this session.\n  Those who have the responsibility for it not moving are going to have \nto stand up and be counted and explain to me and the other conferees \nspecific reasons as to why, because, again, I would challenge the \nadministration, and my colleagues, if you are looking for an excuse to \nveto it, yeah, you will find an excuse to veto it. But the poison pills \nhave been taken out because\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nRepresentative Young and I and others working together went through a \nlaborious process to identify those contentious issues that were veto \nbait. Again, for the benefit of those who do not recall, grazing is \nout, Utah wilderness is out, Tongass is out, the boundary water canoe \narea is out. And what we have left is a good package, 126 bills, \neverything from the Presidio to the New Bedford National Historic Park \nto honor the whaling industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire titles of \nthose bills, including Sterling Forest and the land transfer for the \nWinter Olympics, the entire group be printed in the Record so each \nMember can recognize what is in the package.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Authorizes funding to Begin Restoration of the San \n     Francisco Bay--the bill authorizes $450 million over three \n     years to provide for restoration of the San Francisco Bay.\n       The Bill is not just about expanding the role of the \n     Federal Government, it also contains significant reforms of \n     existing programs and policies, and makes unneeded Federal \n     lands available for use by other levels of government.\n       Reduction of Unneeded Federal Lands--the legislation \n     transfers unreserved BLM lands to the State of Wyoming for \n     schools; removes inappropriate limitations from developed \n     lands along the coast of Florida; corrects a ninety year old \n     survey of public lands in Idaho; and provides lands to the \n     Taos Pueblo tribe in New Mexico.\n       Administration Reform of the National Park Service--the \n     bill includes a number of provisions to improve the \n     management of the National Park Service from encouraging \n     private sector involvement in improving the housing of park \n     rangers, Senate confirmation for the Park Director, to \n     elimination of unnecessary Congressional reporting \n     requirements and several other authorities to increase the \n     leveraging of federal funds.\n       Recreation Fee Policy Program--the bill provides for \n     complete overhaul of the current recreation fee policies \n     which will provide improved funding for parks and forests by \n     establishing a permanent program to permit agencies to retain \n     recreation fees without appropriations.\n       New Republican Environmental Agenda--the legislation \n     provides two key provisions which represent the vision of how \n     Republicans intend to better protect the environment without \n     the heavy hand of the Federal government.\n       1. Presidio Trust--instead of the $1.2 billion proposal \n     advocated by some for the federal government to manage the \n     Presidio of San Francisco in perpetuity, this bipartisan \n     approach turns the real estate management aspects of the \n     Presidio over to a private, non-profit trust similar to the \n     Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\n       Enhancement of the National Park Foundation--the bill \n     enhances the ability of the existing National Park Foundation \n     to raise private sector funds to support National Parks.\n       A bill for all Americans. This bill authorizes a land \n     exchange in Utah which will make the downhill event for the \n     2002 Olympics a reality and permit billions of persons around \n     the world to enjoy it.\n\n\n                         HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL\n\n       This package is the biggest and most important parks and \n     public land package since 1978 (nearly 20 years).\n       It provides for protection of some of the most important \n     natural and historical events and landscapes in the country \n     as follows:\n       Creation of New Parks--Establishes five (5) new parks: the \n     Shenandoah Valley National Battlefield in Virginia to protect \n     important Civil War battlefields; Tallgrass Prairie National \n     Preserve in Kansas to protect one of the last remaining \n     unplowed stretches of tallgrass prairie in the country; \n     Nicodemus National Historic Site to protect a town \n     established as a community for freed Black slaves after the \n     Civil War; New Bedford National Historic Park to honor the \n     whaling industry in Alaska and Massachusetts; and Boston \n     Harbor Islands to protect a dozen unique islands in Boston \n     Harbor.\n       Better Protection of Existing National Parks--provides for \n     boundary modifications and expansions of 20 parks around the \n     country from a 1,000 percent increase in size at Richmond \n     National Battlefield in Virginia to a minor boundary \n     adjustment at Zion National Park in Utah.\n       Protection of Important Historic Sites--legislation \n     provides protection for very important historical events and \n     persons by expanding the boundary to further protect the \n     Manzanar national Historic Site in California; adjusting the \n     boundary at Independence Hall to improve management; \n     designating the route taken by voting rights marchers from \n     Selma to Montgomery as a National Historic Trail; and \n     reauthorizing funding for the Advisory Council on Historic \n     Preservation.\n       Establishment of New Memorials--legislation provides for \n     the construction of memorials on the mall in Washington, DC \n     to Martin Luther King, Junior, Black Revolutionary War \n     Patriots and Japanese-American patriots.\n       Protection of Rivers from Coast to Coast--the bill protects \n     important rivers from the Columbia River in Washington to the \n     St. Vrain in Colorado and the Lamprey in New Hampshire.\n       Protects Hallowed Ground Where the Blood of American \n     Soldiers was Shed in Battle--the bill protects important \n     battlefields from Yorktown, where America won independence, \n     through the Civil War in Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, \n     and Georgia and establishes the American Battlefield \n     Protection Program.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That may save them from threatening to read 2,700 \npages of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I have just been given a list of the States that are \naffected here, and if my colleagues will just give me a couple more \nminutes, I will conclude my remarks with this, because it is so \nimportant that each Member understand what is in this for his or her \nState.\n  Alabama.

These bills will not pass, \nthey will not pass as part of an appropriations bill. Some Members may \nbe under the impression that you can just cherry pick this thing and \ntheir bills will pass as part of the final appropriations. Do not be \nmisled. This is not going to happen. As chairman, I will not let it \nhappen. I want to put those Members on notice if this conference bill \nfails, all the bills, all of them, are absolutely dead for this \nCongress.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the work of Bill Lane, from San \nFrancisco, a long-time acquaintance of mine, former publisher and still \nassociated with Sunset Magazine, who has done so much groundwork on the \nPresidio effort. I know there are others that deserve recognition, but \nBill Lane has been a stalwart, promoting the objective to get the job \ndone, and get it done now, because if you do not, the Presidio will \ndeteriorate to a point where it may be too late.\n  I have gone on longer than the Senator from Alaska usually does, not \npreaching to my colleagues. I am imploring you to recognize this for \nwhat it is. We have all taken a hit. The poison pills have been taken \nout. If the administration wants to use this as an exchange, OK. Then \nit becomes, perhaps, a campaign issue.\n  I hope we hear from the administration, their recognition that \nperhaps there is not everything they like in this, but there is so much \nin it, and it is so necessary we address these things now, and the \nrecognition of the way this process works--that you cannot move the \nbills through individually because there are holds on them. You have to \nmove them in a package. We can get this done now, for the good of the \nStates affected, for the good of the Nation, and for the good of the \nHouse of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Mr. President, the time \nis now. The day is now. We should get on with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Nebraska understands we are in morning \nbusiness, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed as though we were in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask that we continue morning business for the purpose of \nmaking remarks with regard to several retiring Members of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11260-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THANK YOU TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, while I have had ample opportunity to review \nthe Record of yesterday while I was awaiting my chance to make remarks, \nI want to thank very much my close and dear friend, Senator Byrd, for \nhis kind remarks about this Senator as printed in yesterday's Record, \nS. 11134. Senator Byrd made some very kind remarks about me and our \nassociation and work here in the U.S. Senate. I thank him for that.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity and thank others who have made \nfarewell remarks with regard to this Senator from Nebraska, and with \nparticular reference to Senator Byrd. I think we all recognize what a \nunique experience we have had here in the U.S. Senate, serving with one \nof the greatest U.S. Senators, by any measurement, that this body has \never seen. Bob Byrd of West Virginia has no peer with regard to his \nunderstanding of the rules of the U.S. Senate. He has written books on \nthe history of the U.S. Senate. Certainly, as I think back over my last \n18 years, and I will be thinking about this in the future, I thank the \nLord for the great opportunity, and the people of Nebraska, for giving \nme the opportunity to serve with a truly great American, a true pillar \nof the U.S. Senate, Robert Byrd of West Virginia.\n  In that regard, I also would like to take just a moment, Mr. \nPresident, to thank a number of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle that stopped by a reception held for me last evening. My wife Pat \nand I appreciated that. A good time was had by all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11265-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to proceed in making some brief \nstatements with regard to several of the retiring Members that this \nSenator has had the honor of serving with.\n  Let me start, Mr. President, if I might, with a statement with regard \nto the great Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn. We will be leaving the \nU.S. Senate together. This Nation will likely lose the most important \nSenator of all with regard to national security and foreign policy when \nmy colleague Sam Nunn departs this body.\n  I believe Senator Nunn is one of the greatest leaders of the current \nera. He has been a leader and a close personal friend and confidant of \nmine since the very first day I came here 18 years ago. Sam Nunn has \nbeen my Democratic leader on the Senate Armed Services Committee. We \nhave worked closely together, and always in harmony, on many, many \nissues of vital importance to this Nation's national security. Sam has \nbeen a stalwart in helping to win the cold war. I remind all that Sam \nis, bar none, the Senate's top expert on national security matters. No \none has done more to help recruit and retain the Nation's soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines, who are on duty today and are the best \nthat we have ever had in uniform in our Nation's history.\n  I was proud to be a charter member of the informal ``Sam Nunn for \nPresident'' group in 1988. I believed then, and continue to believe to \nthis day, that Sam Nunn would have been an outstanding President of the \nUnited States. Sam has the unique qualities of being strong in his \nprincipled viewpoints and yet compromising in the means to achieve his \ngoal. In short, Sam Nunn is a true statesman in every respect of the \nword. I will always treasure my association and my friendship with him. \nPat and I want to wish him and his family all of the best and, indeed, \nall of the blessings of the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11265-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11265-S11266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my departing \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator David Pryor. I have treasured our 20 \nyears of friendship.\n  Senator Pryor is one of the true gentlemen of the Senate and it has \nbeen my good fortune to serve as Senators together as it was my \npleasure to serve as governors during the same time period in the \n1970's. David has been a good friend to me here in the Senate and I \nhave appreciated his leadership in a number of areas including \npharmaceuticals, seniors, taxpayer rights issues and many, many more.\n  Senator Pryor has taken his intelligence and sense of fair play and \nworked to see that America's seniors are treated with dignity and \nrespect by serving as the top-ranking Democrat on the Special Committee \non Aging. Government programs do a better job of serving Americans \nbecause of the leadership of David Pryor.\n  A leader in keeping pharmaceutical prices low, Senator Pryor has \nfought long and hard to make sure that Americans do not pay for the low \nprices\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\npharmaceutical companies charge other countries for their products. \nBecause of his leadership, the Medicaid program instituted a \nprescription drug rebate program so that drugs could be purchased at a \nmore favorable rate. I was also pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nSenator Pryor's Taxpayers' Bill of Rights. This was landmark \nlegislation to remind the Internal Revenue Service to treat taxpayers' \nwith dignity and respect.\n  The hallmark of Senator Pryor's tenure here in the Senate is \nleadership. Leadership in legislation, a leader among his fellow \nSenators and leadership for his beloved State of Arkansas. The people \nof Arkansas have always been his priority and he has served them well.\n  Farewell my friend. Pat and I wish you the very best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11265-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words regarding \nthe retirement of the senior Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon.\n  Paul Simon was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and I have been \nhonored to serve with him for the past 12 years. Before entering the \nSenate, Paul Simon represented his constituents as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives for 10 years. He will truly be missed by the \npeople of Illinois and his colleagues in the Senate.\n  Over the years I have worked with Senator Simon on the Budget \nCommittee. Despite his reputation as a compassionate liberal who \nbelieves the Federal Government has an important role to play in the \nlives of Americans, Senator Simon has not shied away from following his \npersonal convictions, even if it meant going against the majority of \nhis party.\n  Senator Simon has been a leading proponent of a constitutional \namendment to require the Federal Government to balance the budget each \nyear. He has been guided by his common sense, midwestern views on \nliving within your means. I, too, have been a long-time proponent of a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. Senator Simon's ability to \nwork with Members on both sides of the aisle is unfortunately a \ndiminishing quality among Members of this body.\n  Paul Simon has been a strong supporter of free speech as a Senator. \nHe is an author and began his career as a newspaper editor and \npublisher. Despite his background, Senator Simon has also been willing \nto criticize the television broadcasters over the excessive amount of \nviolent programming.\n  Paul Simon has a special connection to my State of Nebraska. He was a \nstudent at Dana College in Blair, NE. I know that Dana College \nappreciates his continued interest in the students and the college over \nthe years.\n  I commend Senator Paul Simon for his many years of dedicated service \nto the people of Illinois. Pat and I wish him the very best in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11266-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise to salute the service of Senator \nHowell Heflin and give the Senator and his family best wishes.\n  Senator Heflin and I came to the \nU.S. Senate together and we will be leaving this grand institution \ntogether. Over the years I have not only developed a tremendous working \nrelationship with the senior Senator from Alabama but also a deep and \nlasting friendship. Mike and Howell Heflin have been among the closest \nfriends and associates of the Exons.\n  Over the years, I think that there are few Senators with whom I vote \nwith more frequently than with Senator Howell Heflin. I value his \nopinion and respect his views. He is not only a mainstream Democrat, he \nis a mainstream American.\n  Few Members realize that Howell Heflin is a bona fide war hero. If I \nmay Mr. President, I would like to share a little story about the \nSenator from Alabama. A few years ago I had an opportunity to lead a \ndelegation to the Pacific rim. Howell Heflin was a member of our group. \nWe had scheduled a stop in Guam for refueling en route to Manila. When \nwe arrived, I was informed that there would be a brief unscheduled \nceremony for Howell Heflin.\n  It was anything but a brief ceremony. It was obviously one of the \nmost important ceremonies that the Island of Guam has had, I suppose, \nsince the American forces drove out the Japanese from that island \nduring the war in the Pacific. There was a large entourage of cars. I \ncould not imagine what was going on. Finally, I began to get the feel \nof things. They wanted to take us out to the beach where the American \nMarines landed when the United States of America started taking back \nthat very important and strategic island.\n  We went out to the beach, and we saw where they landed. This \nbeautiful beach was once a bloody battlefield. During the war the \nMarines had great difficulty in landing. The coral reefs reeked havoc \non the landing crafts and on the men.\n  Our delegation went to the museum out on the beach. We were greeted \nby the mayor, the Governor and there was a small Navy band playing. In \naddition, there was a small tent with a number of people from the \nIsland of Guam who were there when the Americans landed.\n\n  This celebration was not in honor of the Senate delegation but in \nhonor of one of our Members, Senator Heflin. It was a moving sight. \nThere was a big sign out there that I shall never forget. It said, \n``Welcome Back Our Liberating Hero, Lt. Howell Heflin.''\n  Because of all his other accomplishments, I suspect few of my \ncolleagues in the Senate even know about Senator Heflin's heroism. He \nwas one of those marines who liberated Guam. Lt. Howell Heflin was part \nof the assault force of the Americans landing to take Guam from the \nJapanese. He was wounded in the initial assault and kept on fighting. \nHe pointed out the hill to me where he took his second hit.\n  He was evacuated to the United States where he spent considerable \ntime in the hospital.\n  This story illustrates that Senator Heflin's love of country has been \na constant throughout his life. As marine, judge, and as Senator, duty, \nhonor, and valor are all words associated with Howell Heflin.\n  This is a side of the proud Howell Heflin that I know. That is a side \nthat I want his colleagues and history to know. He is one of those who \nserves his country in time of need, and we must never forget that.\n  As I bring my Senate career to a close, I point to serving and \nknowing people like Howell Heflin as one of the most wonderful benefits \nof being involved in politics.\n  Having known Howell and Mike Heflin and knowing of their stature, and \ncharacter, having had them as friends, means a great deal to me as I \nlook back on my life in public service and see what really has been \nimportant.\n  I simply say that one of the great treasures of my life has been \nknowing the Heflins. May God bless and keep Howell and Mike Heflin \nforever in his grace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11266-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11266-S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, when the Senate concludes its business this \nyear and adjourns the 104th Congress, we will be bidding farewell to \none of the most respected and accomplished Senators this institution \nhas known. Senator Claiborne Pell's decision to retire following the \ncompletion of his sixth term has brought to a close a legislative \ncareer that is noteworthy for not only its longevity but also its \naccomplishments. Whether in the area of student educational loans, arms \ncontrol or foreign affairs, Senator Pell has distinguished himself as \nan effective force in not simply representing the interests of Rhode \nIsland residents but in authoring a national agenda designed to improve \nthe quality of life for all Americans.\n  Senator Pell's colleagues know him as a quiet, thoughtful man of \nstrong intellect and compassion. In his words and by his actions, \nClaiborne Pell has demonstrated an unyielding commitment to serving the \npublic good for the past 36 years. This remarkable devotion to serving \nthe common good will long be remembered by those of us who worked with \nClaiborne Pell and lament his departure from the Senate. After devoting \nso much of himself to improving the welfare of this Nation,\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nhe can retire with the comfort of knowing that it is well-earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11266-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING SENATOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto salute my departing colleague and dear friend from Louisiana, \nSenator Bennett Johnston.\n  It has been a sheer pleasure to serve for the past 18 years with \nBennett Johnston. Since the time I came to the U.S. Senate in 1979, I \nhave always admired Bennett's determination and rugged individualism. \nBennett Johnston possesses many of the qualities that make this \ninstitution great, not the least of which is his ability to compromise.\n  Some have called him the master of compromise. I, for one, have \nalways admired his ability to work both sides of the aisle. And as we \nall know too well, a willingness to look past partisan differences is \nsomething of precious commodity in the Senate these days.\n  Whether it was oil and gas price deregulation, the Supercollider, the \nTongass National Forest, or nuclear waste disposal, Bennett always \ndelved deep into the heart of the matter regardless of how complex or \ncontroversial.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto pay tribute to the senior Senator from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, who \nwill be retiring at the end of this Congress. Senator Bradley and I \nwere elected to Congress in the same year, 1978, and it has been a \ngreat pleasure and an honor to have served three terms in the Senate \nwith him.\n  Senator Bradley has distinguished himself as a thoughtful and \noutspoken leader on the issues of tax reform, education, community \nrevitalization and crime reduction. He has also been a vocal critic of \nwasteful Government spending. Senator Bradley and I share a keen \ninterest in fiscal responsibility and concerns about the impact of the \ndebt and deficit situation on our Nation's future. I was pleased to \nhave the opportunity to work closely with Senator Bradley on line-item \nveto legislation. A form of this legislation was signed into law this \nyear and I believe it is a crucial step toward eliminating wasteful \nspending and keeping us on the path of deficit reduction.\n  I commend Bill Bradley for his hard work in the Senate and his \ncontribution to our Nation. I expect that he will continue to \nparticipate in the debate over important public policy issues. Pat and \nI wish him success in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11267-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words regarding \nthe retirement of the senior Senator from Wyoming, our own Alan \nSimpson. It all came back to me last evening when my neighboring State \nSenator came by a reception honoring me, adding his usual good humor \nand sincerity.\n  Alan Simpson was first elected to the Senate in the same year as me \nand I have been honored to serve in this body with him for the past 18 \nyears. Senator Simpson has served the people of Wyoming through his \nhard work and dedicated efforts in matters of importance to his \nconstituents and the American people. I am sure he will be missed by \nthe people of Wyoming and his colleagues in the Senate.\n  Through his service on the Judiciary Committee, Alan Simpson has been \nthe Senate's leading force in reforming our immigration laws. His \ncommon sense approach to immigration reform has been vital to cracking \ndown on illegal immigration. The highlight of the 1986 reform bill was \na provision which made it unlawful for an employer to hire an illegal \nimmigrant. For many years, I worked to place into law another common \nsense measure to prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving Federal \nbenefits and I appreciate Senator Simpson's support of my efforts.\n  Despite his moderate and bipartisan approach, Senator Simpson has \nbeen the target of criticism from groups on both sides of the \nimmigration issue. Alan Simpson's willingness to push forward in the \nface of strong opposition from many tells a lot about how seriously he \ntakes his position as a public servant. Without his determination, I \ndoubt we would have been able this year to adopt such a strong, yet \nfair, bill to crack down on illegal immigration with such overwhelming \nbipartisan support. This legislation will serve as yet another \ntestament to Senator Simpson's dedicated efforts to bring illegal \nimmigration under control.\n\n  Alan Simpson, while always fighting for what he felt was right and \nnever being shy about speaking up, will also surely be remembered for \nhis efforts to highlight the looming financial crisis that is facing \nour Federal entitlement programs. I strongly believe that the \ndisintegration of bipartisan cooperation has seriously weakened the \nability of this body to tackle the most difficult issues facing our \nNation and has led to far too many ill feelings. Senator Simpson, while \nundoubtedly a true conservative, has been willing to go against the \nmajority of his party on major issues while remaining true to himself \nand his constituents.\n  Pat and I commend Senator Alan Simpson for his dedicated public \nservice over the years and wish him the very best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11267-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11267-S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, a record number of our colleagues are \nretiring from the Senate this year. I am among those who have \nvoluntarily decided to not return and I do so knowing how much I will \nmiss the nearly day-to-day contact with many of the great statesmen and \nwomen our country has known.\n  I consider Senator Mark Hatfield among this pantheon of accomplished \npublic servants. While some may speak highly of Senator Hatfield for \nhis length of service to Oregon and the Nation as a whole, I have been \nmost impressed by the strength of conviction he has brought to his job \nof U.S. Senator over the past 30 years. The fire of purpose has burned \nbrightly and consistently within Senator Hatfield during this time and, \non so many occasions too numerous to recount here, Senator Hatfield's \nvoice has been the voice of the forgotten, the weak, and the \ndisenfranchised.\n  The steadfast humanity and moral judgment Senator Hatfield has \ndisplayed transcends political affiliation or partisan alignment. From \nwhat I have observed of him during my own 18 years in the Senate, I \nwould sum up Mark Hatfield's credo in a simple and straightforward way: \nSenator Mark Hatfield has committed his energies to the betterment of \nall persons through the fight against the destructive forces of war, \ndisease, ignorance and want. This raising of the human condition, this \ncrusade against needless suffering and the ravages of mankind's self-\ndestructive tendencies, has been Mark Hatfield's rich legacy to the \nNation and the world.\n\n  Above all else, I salute him for his unswerving dedication against \nheavy odds at times to his dedication to end nuclear testing, and \nwithout his steadfast leadership the treaty that was signed yesterday \nat the United Nations in New York would not have come to pass.\n  I was there, and many people came up to me and talked about this \ngreat accomplishment. To each and every one of them I said I wished \nSenate duties would have allowed Mark Hatfield to be there along with \nmyself and Senator Pell. I know he was invited.\n  At year's end, he will leave this institution a lion among his peers. \nBut lest anyone be fooled, beneath the chiseled and proud visage of \nthis lion is the true source of his strength, a compassionate heart \nthat has kept him humble and grounded, his path straight, his words \ntrue, and his conviction undiminished.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n The career of Senator Mark Hatfield should be an inspirational model \nto all those who aspire to public service, for to follow in his \nfootsteps is to embrace all that is admirable in the pursuit of elected \noffice and service to the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11267-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Maine, Bill Cohen, \nis among those Senators who have decided to not seek another term in \nservice to their country. Senator Cohen and I both arrived in the \nSenate in January 1979 and we have served together on the Armed \nServices Committee ever since.\n  Bill Cohen's skills as a United States Senator were evident from the \nbeginning. His mastery of detail along with his understanding of the \nlarger implications of legislative policies has made him a universally \nrespected oracle on a wide range of issues. His views are no more \nrevered, perhaps, than those in the area of national defense and \nforeign policy. I can attest firsthand to how important Senator Cohen \nhas been in furthering our national security interests over the past \ntwo decades. There is no aspect of our collective national security \npolicy over this time that has not benefitted from Senator Cohen's \ncontribution. Whether in the area of arms control or military \nreorganization or shipbuilding, Senator Cohen has displayed an \neffective ability to analyze problems and propose workable solutions \nthat garnered bipartisan support. This is Bill Cohen's legacy to the \nUnited States Senate and the country as a whole.\n  He has been a renaissance man of sorts during these past 18 years: A \nbest-selling novelist and published poet, an articulate speaker, and a \ngifted legislator. His departure will certainly deprive the Senate of \none of its most meaningful and respected voices. I have no doubt he \nwill continue to be as successful in his future endeavors as he has \nbeen as a United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11268-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to salute one of our departing \ncolleagues and Senator from the neighboring State of Kansas, of course \nit is our own Senator Nancy Kassebaum.\n  Nancy and I have served together in the Senate over the last 18 \nyears. I have always admired her willingness to look beyond partisan \npolitics and work to solve the problems at hand. She can be proud of \nthe recently passed Health Insurance Reform Act. I have no doubts that \nthis will be seen for a long time as a very important piece of \nlegislation. Finally, people will be able to move from job to job \nwithout fear of losing their health insurance.\n  Senator Kassebaum can also be proud in the role she played during the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act several years ago. Because \nof her efforts and those of the Labor and Human Services Committee more \nof America's young people can seek the higher education they need to \nfulfill their dreams. Nancy has also been willing to work on a very \nimportant issue to me, Impact Aid. With her help and leadership, \nimprovements to this program were made so that the children of our \nmilitary personnel have better educational opportunities.\n  Senator Kassebaum comes from an honorable Kansas Republican family. \nHer father Alfred Landon served as Governor and Presidential nominee. \nGovernor Landon and the legacy he left, has been significantly enhanced \nby the way that his daughter has continued in his footsteps.\n  Kansas will be losing a great Senator, one who has served her \nconstituents well. Pat and I wish Nancy and her family all the best for \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11268-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Hank \nBrown, the senior Senator from a neighboring State, Colorado, who is \nretiring at the end of this Congress. It seems, out there on the \nplains, we are dropping like flies.\n  Hank Brown's service to the State of Colorado and our Nation has \nranged from the U.S. Navy and a tour in Vietnam, to serving in the \nColorado State Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. \nSenate. More importantly, however, I understand that Senator Brown \nplayed some football while at the University of Colorado. While \nNebraskans are not usually humble about football, I humbly acknowledge \nthat the Nebraska record against Colorado from 1958 to 1961 was 1 win \nand 3 losses.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, I have had \nthe privilege of working with Senator Brown on several budget \ninitiatives. I believe he and I share a commitment to deficit reduction \nand responsible Federal spending second to none. I appreciate Senator \nBrown's hard work in this area and have enjoyed the opportunity to work \nwith him on these most important issues. Hank Brown possesses one of \nthe keenest senses of humor in the Senate. He is a delightful \nindividual.\n  I commend Hank Brown for his hard work in the Senate and his \ncontribution to our Nation and the State of Colorado. I wish him \nsuccess in all his future endeavors.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise today to continue the \ndeliberation here in the Senate of the issue of partial-birth \nabortions. We have had a discussion over the past several days in the \nSenate about this issue. I think it is good that we continue the \ndebate. I have asked for a time agreement for tomorrow, and I hope we \ncan get that, from 9 to 2 tomorrow morning and into tomorrow afternoon, \nand then a vote at 2 o'clock. I know that is being hot-lined right now. \nI do not know if there has been any objection to that. But I think 5 \nhours of debate is a reasonable period of time for both sides to get \nthe opportunity to put forward their views on this issue. I think, \nwhile we have had some debate, and maybe we will even have some more \ndebate today, I think this is such an important issue that that kind of \ntime is necessary to really have the Senate work its will, for it to be \na deliberative process and a deliberative decision based on all the \ninformation.\n  As I said yesterday, there is a tremendous amount of information, \nfrankly even still coming out, about this issue and about the number of \nthese procedures that are performed in this country. I think it is \nimportant for all Senators to realize exactly what we are voting on \nhere and its impact, as I said yesterday, not only on what we will \ntolerate as a country, what lines we will draw as to what is \npermissible in our society, in our civilization, but what it will say \nabout the quality of life in our country.\n  While I was sitting here listening to some of the remarks, I thought \nabout what I read last night in the House debate. Member after Member \ngot up and\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\ntalked about: Well, you know, we are talking about deformed fetuses--I \nwill talk about that later in my remarks--deformed fetuses, as if, \nbecause they are not perfect, they are expendable. I found it sort of \nironic that the very people in the House of Representatives who stood \nup and gave as a rationale for allowing late-term abortions a deformity \nof a fetus, in many cases--in fact, in most of the cases described by \nthe testimony--not fatal deformities but just deformities, those people \nwho say that a mother can abort a baby because of that deformity are \nthe same people who get up with passion--and I admire the passion--who \nfight for the Americans With Disabilities Act because they believe \npeople with disabilities can, in fact, contribute to our society and \nwho argue for IDEA because they believe children with mental \ndifficulties or physical disabilities can, in fact, contribute to the \neducational process of all children.\n\n  Yet, when it comes to the very initial right--not the right to go to \nschool, not the right to have a curb cut so your wheelchair can get \nfrom street to street, but the right to live, the right to be a citizen \nof this country--that is where they draw the line; that that is not an \nissue worth fighting for; that that disability is somehow so great that \nit is not worth fighting to protect that disabled child from being \ndelivered through this procedure feet first, completely delivered up to \nthe head.\n  The only thing remaining in the birth canal is the baby's head. A \npair of scissors is taken and punctures the base of the skull. A \ncatheter is then inserted into the brain and the brains are suctioned \nout. That brutal, gruesome, barbaric procedure administered to a baby \nfrom 20, 21 weeks on; in some cases, third trimester abortions, late \nthird trimester abortions in some cases. That is OK, because the baby \nisn't perfect.\n  Fortunately, in the House of Representatives, many Members who voted \nagainst this piece of legislation to ban this procedure had second \nthoughts, gathered more information, listened to the testimony that was \ngiven, listened to the new findings which I talked about yesterday in \nRichard Cohen's article in the Washington Post where he said when he \nwrote his original article back in June of last year, ``I was under the \nunderstanding that late-term abortions were rare and they were only for \nhealth and life of the mother reasons, or that the child to be born \nwould have no chance of surviving. But I find that is not the case,'' \nhe says. He cited an article written by a colleague of his, a physician \nat the Washington Post, Dr. Brown.\n  We have another article written by a woman with the Bergen County \nRecord who said that in New Jersey alone this late-term abortion \nprocedure done, in many cases, on viable babies at 24 weeks and older \nare not 500 a year, as some of the pro-choice lobbyists would have you \nbelieve, like Planned Parenthood and others who conveniently don't keep \nclose track of these things, but 1,500 a year, just in one particular \narea of New Jersey alone--1,500 a year.\n  That fact was not known when the Senate first deliberated. It was an \nimportant fact that caused the change of opinion of one Member that was \nwritten about by Cal Thomas today in the Washington Times, Marge \nRoukema. I served with Marge during the 4 years I was in the House. \nMarge is a pro-choice moderate Republican from New Jersey. Quoting Mr. \nThomas:\n\n       Representative Marge Roukema, a pro-choice moderate \n     Republican from New Jersey, decided that instead of voting in \n     lock-step with the rest of her pro-choice colleagues, she \n     would go beyond the sloganeering and the sound bites. Though \n     Mrs. Roukema voted against the original bill banning partial-\n     birth abortion--a procedure in which a fully formed baby is \n     delivered feet first--\n\n  Scissors inserted in the head and the brains sucked out--\n\n     she switched sides and voted to override President Clinton's \n     veto of the measure.\n       The reasons Mrs. Roukema gave for her change were as honest \n     as they were profound. She said her concerns about protecting \n     the mother's life had been answered--\n\n  In fact, there is a provision in the bill that was inserted by \nSenator Dole when the bill came through that this procedure would still \nbe permitted if it were necessary to save the life of the mother\n\n       putting the lie to pro-choicers' charges that the bill \n     would jeopardize women's lives. She also said she was \n     satisfied that doctors would not be prosecuted if the \n     procedure were performed in dire circumstances.\n       Mrs. Roukema said, ``Over time, I've been reading about \n     this and informing myself. It's a decision that was very \n     difficult to make, but I decided (partial-birth abortion) \n     comes too close to infanticide.''\n\n  She took the time to weigh the facts. As I said yesterday, I have a \ntremendous amount of faith--a tremendous amount of faith--in the U.S. \nSenate and its deliberative capabilities, and I have faith in every one \nof the Members here who will not be blinded or blocked into a position \nbecause they are pro-choice or pro-life.\n  This is not a pro-life, pro-choice issue. This is an issue about a \nprocedure that is so barbaric and inhumane that if it were performed on \nan animal, we would be hearing the animal rights activists storming the \nCapitol today. If it were performed in another country, the human \nrights people would be saying we should have trade sanctions against \nthem until they stop it. And yet it is performed in this country \nthousands of times and in many, many cases, as I quoted yesterday from \nthe doctors in the Bergen County Record, in most cases on healthy \nbabies, healthy pregnancies, and healthy women who had no problem with \ntheir pregnancy but was purely elective.\n  Other Members who are pro-choice stood up and took a very difficult \nposition in support of the override of the President's veto.\n  I give them a lot of credit for doing so, because it is not easy to \nstand up and draw a line. One such person was a Member from across the \nriver, Mr. Moran, who I was elected with when I first came to the House \nof Representatives back in 1990. I will quote from his statement on the \nfloor of the House just last week:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, I am very hesitant to speak on this issue.\n\n  I share with Mr. Moran that I was very hesitant to speak on this \nissue. I had been a Member of the House for 4 years and have been a \nMember of the Senate for 2 years. Never once, prior to this issue, did \nI ever speak on the issue of abortion. I have talked to several of my \ncolleagues over the past few days, now that I have stood here talking \nabout this and they, too, have told me, ``You know, Rick, I've never \nspoken on the floor of the Senate on this issue, but I feel compelled \nto do it this time.'' So I give credit to Mr. Moran, a Democrat, pro-\nchoice.\n  Continuing his talk:\n\n       For one thing, I have been associated with the pro-choice \n     side throughout my legislative career, and I do believe that \n     when the issue of abortion is considered, it really ought not \n     to be a legislative issue; it ought to be a personal decision \n     by a woman with the advice of her physician, within the \n     context of her religion and family. I do not believe that \n     this issue falls within that rubric, within that context \n     of decisionmaking.\n\n  He then says he agrees with Roe versus Wade and describes the \ndecision of Roe versus Wade. I will continuing quoting:\n\n       What we are talking about now, though, goes beyond that \n     third trimester. We are talking about the delivery of a fetus \n     clearly in the shape and with the functions of a human being. \n     And when that human being is delivered in the birth canal, it \n     cannot be masked as anything but a human being.\n       We should not act in any legislative way that sanctions the \n     termination of that life. And that is why I urge my \n     colleagues to vote to override the President's veto of this \n     legislation.\n\n  I know that is not an easy thing to do. I know it is not easy to get \nup and talk about those issues. What I also know is I know it is not \neasy for people to listen to talk about this issue.\n  One of the things that I think probably led me not to speak so much--\nnot so much--at all on the floor of the U.S. Senate about this issue is \nbecause it is so uncomfortable to talk about. I was assailed yesterday \nby one of my colleagues saying, ``Well, you never delivered a child, \nand so you really don't know what it's like, and you really don't have \nany standing to talk about it.''\n  It is true I never delivered a child, but I have been there for the \nthree deliveries of my children with my wife Karen, and I saw those \nchildren born. I had the privilege of cutting the umbilical cord in all \nthree cases and holding that little, vulnerable baby. Two of our \nchildren were born premature. We are lucky enough to have a fourth \nchild on the way, and we follow the growth and development of that \nchild.\n  No, I have never had a baby, but I am a father who understands what \nlife is\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\nabout. So while I may not have the standing that some in this Chamber \nbelieve I should have, I think I have every right to stand up for those \nchildren as a father, as a citizen, and as a Senator. So I will \ncontinue to do so.\n  This is a difficult issue because it pushes us to the edge and makes \nus so uncomfortable to think about a viable baby, not a blob of tissue \nan inch long, not a little embryo, but a baby. My wife--as I mentioned, \nwe have three children--but my wife has had a lot more experience with \nbabies than just our three children. For many years she was a neonatal \nintensive care nurse in Pittsburgh, PA. She worked in the NICU unit, \nlevel 3, which is the most severe level, with the babies that are \nhaving the toughest time surviving. She worked with 24-week-old babies. \nShe even worked with a 23-week-old baby. She reminded me last night \nthat the eyes were still fused on that baby. That baby is alive today.\n  She said, yes, it is a struggle for those young babies. But they \nfought and they fought and they fought, so many of them, and they did \nsurvive. What this procedure does to those little babies, if we allow \nthat to happen in this country--well, I hope we do not.\n  The Senator from California yesterday said that we could get a bill \nagreed to here in the U.S. Senate just like that if we just had a \nprovision that said, that in addition to protecting the life of the \nmother, that we added a section that said, ``to protect the health of \nthe mother.'' I attempted to respond, but I sort of ran out of time. I \nwould like to respond to that.\n\n  I will assure the Senator from California that we could not get an \nagreement on that issue with Members who voted for this legislation. \nThe reason is very simple. No. 1--and I will read for you physician \nafter physician after physician who say that this procedure does not--\ndoes not--protect the health of the mother. In fact, they would argue \nthat in fact it greatly endangers the life of the mother, more so than \nother procedures, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it also enhances the risk of infertility and the inability to \ncarry a child to term.\n  So even if you accept--I cannot accept the premise that there is a \nneed for this procedure to save the health of the mother. It is in fact \ncontradicted, and it is in fact more threatening to the health of the \nmother to do this procedure. So to say this procedure is necessary to \ndo that puts forth a false assumption, and then you are asking me to \nagree to it. I cannot agree with something that is not true.\n  Second, what we have seen repeatedly in this country is that health \nof the mother is in fact not a limitation at all; that health of the \nmother means, yes, physical health, but also mental health, social \nhealth in the sense that if it is a young girl who wants to have this \nprocedure, that we have to worry about her social standing in order to \nallow this to happen, and financial health. Health has been broadly \ndefined in this country to the point where it is not a limitation to a \nprocedure at all. I think anyone who argues that fact knows fully well \nthat it is not a limitation. So the underlying premise of the health \nexception is a faulty one. Secondly, health is not a limitation.\n  So in either instance, I could not accept an amendment like that \nbecause, No. 1, it is not true, because the health is not endangered by \ndoing some other procedure more than it is by doing this one, and, No. \n2, it is not a limitation.\n  Let me read from some obstetricians who have commented on this health \nissue and life issue.\n\n       ``I can't think of any situation where you would have to \n     carry out a specific, direct attack on the fetus,'' said Dr. \n     James R. Jones in an April 19 interview at St. Vincent's \n     Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan.\n       Dr. Jones is chairman of the department of obstetrics and \n     gynecology at the New York Medical College in Valhallaran. . \n     .and head of obstetrics and gynecology for the hospital.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``Their intent is fetal death,'' Dr. Jones said. ``I can't \n     imagine that being an indicated procedure for the saving of a \n     life or well-being of the mother.'' He said it amounted to \n     ``simply another elective abortion'' and was ``practically \n     infanticide.''\n       In cases of special difficulty, obstetricians can always \n     resort to Caesarean delivery, he said. Even if an \n     obstetrician knows in a particular case that the baby is \n     unlikely to live, he said, its death is not the intent and no \n     direct action is taken to kill the baby.\n\n  Dr. Nancy Roemer, who I know has testified before here, and in fact \nmay have been up on the Hill today--I do not know that. I know there \nwere some physicians up here again to try to educate Members of this \nbody who are going to have to make this critical decision, possibly \ntomorrow afternoon, as to what the medical facts are, not some \ninformation thrown out there by advocacy groups attempting to influence \nthe debate, like Planned Parenthood, who put out, ``Oh, there's only a \nfew hundred of these done,'' when we find out the facts after the bill \nwas passed and vetoed. The fact is, there are thousands of them done. \nIn fact, as Richard Cohen said in his article in the Washington Post \nyesterday, nobody knows. Conveniently, those people who perform a lot \nof the abortions do not want to keep track of these kinds of abortions, \ndo not want to keep track of late second-trimester and third-trimester \nabortions.\n\n  It is inconvenient for their cause of trying to convince the American \npublic that these abortions only occur when they are very early on, and \nwe do not have a baby that looks like a baby. It is not really a baby. \nAt 24 weeks, it is a baby. You can call it what you want, you can try \nto call it a choice, but it is a baby.\n  I asked the Senator from California yesterday three times--and I \nreally do not want to be combative. I really want the Senate to try to \ndeliberate thoughtfully, to try to remove some of the emotion that \nalways gets wrapped up in these debates, obviously, with reason. This \nis a very emotional subject. I asked her three times, and I will ask \nher again, because unfortunately she did not answer me any of the three \ntimes yesterday. I said, let me give you this set of facts: A partial-\nbirth abortion is being performed--whether it is a normal baby, a \nperfect baby, or a baby that has some abnormalities--and you have a 24-\nweek-old baby being delivered feet first, everything is delivered, the \nshoulders are then delivered, and by some mistake of the obstetrician, \nthe head is also delivered. Would it be the choice of the mother and \nthe obstetrician to then kill the baby?\n  Now, I think most people within the sound of my voice would clearly \nsay, ``No.'' But if you say no, if it is so obvious, and is it not \nobvious? Does it not just hit you? Of course not, of course not, \nabsolutely not, not even a question that the doctor at that point, with \na baby in its hand, and maybe just in one hand, moving, that that \ndoctor could not kill that baby.\n  Two or three inches, then, is the difference between what some would \nsay, ``Of course not,'' to ``OK.'' Two inches before, ``OK,'' two \ninches later, ``Of course not.'' That is the line being drawn in this \ncountry now about life--about life. Is that the line that the U.S. \nSenate, this great deliberative body, this body that when I talk to \npeople from other countries look at this place and see this country as \nsomething they aspire to, something they want to emulate, that we \ncannot get two-thirds of the men and women of this body to say that 2 \ninches is too close of a call, that that is too fine a line, that we \nhave gone over the line about what is right in our society?\n  I think we as a body can do that. I think we as a body can stand up \nand do the right thing. I think Members who have voted differently on \nthis issue in the past can change their vote based on new information.\n  Dr. Nancy Roemer said on the claim ``medical necessity'' that the \nPresident has invoked and Members on the other side have invoked, ``I \nam insulted to be told that I am tearing a woman's body apart by not \ndoing this procedure.'' The ``tearing a woman's body apart'' line comes \nfrom a White House ceremony where the President vetoed this bill. ``As \nphysicians, we can no longer stand by while abortion advocates, the \nPresident of the United States, the newspaper and television shows, \ncontinue to repeat false medical claims to Members of Congress and the \npublic. This procedure is currently not an accepted medical \nprocedure.''\n  The American Medical Association legislative counsel said it is not a \nrecognized medical procedure. It is done in abortion clinics, as many \nof the doctors have said here, for the convenience of the person \nperforming the abortion.\n\n       A search of medical literature reveals no mention of this \n     procedure, and there is no critically evaluated or peer \n     review journal that describes this procedure. There is \n     currently also no peer review or accountability\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\n     of this procedure. It is currently being performed by a \n     physician who is not an obstetrician. It is in an \n     outpatient facility behind closed doors and no peer \n     review.\n\n  That is what Dr. Roemer says about the necessity for this procedure \nand the appropriateness of this procedure. Let me quote another \nphysician who happens to also be a Member of Congress, and that is Dr. \nCoburn from Oklahoma, who spoke last week on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n       Mr. Speaker, I have spent the last 18 years of my life, \n     including a great deal of time of the time 2 years while I \n     have been in this Congress, caring for women who deliver \n     babies. I personally have been involved in over 3,000 births \n     that I attended. I have seen every complication and every \n     anomaly that has been mentioned in this debate on partial-\n     birth abortion.\n       I am not standing here as someone who is pro-life. I am not \n     standing here as someone that is a freshman Republican. I \n     stand here today to make known to Members that they can vote \n     against an override for only two reasons on this bill: One is \n     that they are totally misinformed of the true medical facts; \n     or that they are pro-abortion at any stage for any reason.\n       The facts will bear this out. That is not meant to offend \n     anybody. If someone feels that way, they should stand up and \n     speak that truth. But this procedure, this procedure is \n     designed to aid and abet the abortionist. There is no truth \n     to the fact that this procedure protects the lives of women. \n     There is no truth to the fact that this procedure preserves \n     fertility. There is no truth to the fact that this procedure, \n     in fact, is used on complicated anomalous conceptions. This \n     procedure is used to terminate mid and late second-term \n     pregnancies at the elective request of a woman who so \n     desired--in some cases, I might add, third-trimester \n     abortions.\n       This has nothing to do with women's emotional health. This \n     has to do with termination of an oftentimes viable child by a \n     gruesome and heinous procedure.\n       What we should hear from those who are going to vote \n     against overriding this is that they agree, that they agree \n     that this procedure is an adequate and expected procedure \n     that should be used, and that it is all right to terminate \n     the life of a 26-week fetus, that otherwise the physicians \n     would be held liable under the courts of every State to not \n     save its life should it be born spontaneously.\n\n  This debate is not about the health of the women. This debate is \nabout whether or not true facts are going to be discussed in this \nChamber on the basis of knowledge and sound science, rather than a \npolitical end point that sacrifices children in this country.\n  That is an obstetrician. I have a letter here signed by 4 \nobstetricians of an organization called PHACT, which is the Physician \nAd Hoc Coalition for Truth. It lists scores and scores of OB/GYN'S, who \nare against this procedure--and speak in very graphic terms against \nthis procedure--including 123 members of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists. They say the same thing: ``This \nprocedure is not necessary to preserve health, fertility, or the life \nof a mother.''\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma here. I have more things to say, but \nI have been on the floor for a while, and I want to give him an \nopportunity to speak. I will continue talking about this at a later \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his courage in taking on this very sensitive and yet \nvery important issue. It is an issue that we deal with in the Senate, \nmaybe with some reluctance, but it is certainly an issue that deals \nwith life and death. The Senator from Pennsylvania is trying to save \nthe lives of innocent, unborn, almost-born human beings. He is trying \nto see that the overwhelming opinion of a majority of the American \npeople is upheld--in this case, outlawing the most gruesome type of \nabortion possible.\n  I was doing a little homework on this. I compliment the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith, for his leadership on this issue because \nhe made a lot of us aware that this practice was ongoing--a practice \nthat people who are opposed to this ban, who don't want to see any \nrestriction of abortion whatsoever, say rarely ever happens. I don't \nthink that is the case. As a matter of fact, I have a couple comments \nthat show there are thousands of these abortions performed every year. \nBut in learning a little bit about the practice, it is really gruesome. \nThe doctor--I don't want to call it a doctor. The abortionist has to go \nto some trouble to make sure the baby is not totally delivered. It is \nnot an easy process. If the baby's head comes out, then you have a live \nchild. Before that, you have a live fetus, by their definition. So they \nhave to hold the baby's head in, in order to kill the baby, extract the \nbrains from the head of the baby, and then remove the dead baby. This \nis happening thousands of times in our country.\n  We passed a ban. Congress overwhelmingly passed a ban to stop this \ngruesome, painful procedure. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed \nthe ban. I think he was wrong. Dr. Koop mentioned that he thought maybe \nPresident Clinton had bad advice. I think he had bad advice, and I also \nthink he was basically coopted by the groups who call themselves pro-\nchoice. I know a lot of individuals who classify themselves as pro-\nchoice that want to see this procedure stopped. They are offended by \nthis procedure.\n  Let me make this one comment. Dr. Pamela Smith, an obstetrician at \nMt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago, and Director of Medical Education in the \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology at that hospital, testified \nbefore the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution that even \nwhen describing the procedure to groups of pro-choice physicians, she \nfound that ``many of them were horrified to learn that such a procedure \nwas even legal.'' That is in the House report 104-267, page 5.\n  As Dr. Smith further points out, ``partial-birth abortion is a \nsurgical technique devised by abortionists in the unregulated abortion \nindustry to save them the trouble of `counting the body parts' that are \nproduced in dismemberment procedures.''\n  That was in a letter to U.S. Senators on November 4, 1995. She says \nin the same letter, ``Opponents have insinuated that aborting a live \nhuman fetus is sometimes necessary to preserve the reproductive \npotential and/or life of the mother. Such an assertion is deceptively \nand patently untrue.''\n  In a July 9, 1995, letter to Congressman Tony Hall, a registered \nnurse who had observed Dr. Haskell, who has performed over a thousand \npartial-birth abortions himself, perform several partial-birth \nabortions, described one such procedure. Again, this is somebody who \nwas assisting the abortionist. She saw the procedure.\n\n       The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were \n     clasping together. He was kicking his feet. All the while, \n     his little head was stuck inside. Dr. Haskell took a pair of \n     scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head. \n     Then he opened the scissors up. Then he stuck the high-\n     powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's \n     brains out.\n\n  That is this procedure. That is gruesome. That is cruel. That is \nkilling an innocent baby that is only seconds or inches away from \ndelivery.\n  The American Medical Association's Council on Legislation, 12 \nmembers, thoroughly considered H.R. 1833 and voted unanimously to \nendorse the bill. After their action became public, they reconsidered \nthe matter and voted unanimously again to endorse the bill. Although \nthe full AMA Board of Trustees decided to take a neutral stance, the \nSenate does have the benefit of the carefully considered judgment of \nthe AMA Council on Legislation on the bill. The AMA Legislative Council \ndid not call for more time in which to study the bill. They had all the \nfacts they needed to make a judgment. And so does the Senate. This bill \nshould be passed. The President's veto should be overridden.\n  Mr. President, some people say that partial-birth abortions are done \nin order to save the life of the mother, or to protect her health. \nPresident Clinton used that as an excuse in his veto. I will give you a \nquote. According to the Physician's Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a \ncoalition of about 300 medical specialists, including former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop, they emphatically state that even in cases \ninvolving severe fetal disorders partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future \nfertility. Never. These are the professionals. They say that a partial-\nbirth abortion is never necessary to protect the mother's health or \nfuture fertility.\n  Dr. Martin Haskell--who I spoke about early and who performs partial-\nbirth abortions--one of the major proponents and practitioners of this \ntechnique, states that some 80 percent which he has performed were for \npurely elective reasons. That was in an interview with AMA's American \nMedical\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\nNews, July 5, 1993. His late colleague and fellow proponent of the \npartial-birth method claimed in material submitted to the House \nsubcommittee that nonelective reasons to perform the procedure include \npsychiatric indications, such as depression and pediatric indications, \nthat is, the mother is young.\n  Mr. President, one other comment. Some of the people who have \nadvocated that this procedure should not be banned say it is very rare. \nI think they are incorrect. The stark fact is that unless this bill \nbecomes law, more innocent unborn children will have their lives \nbrutally ended by the inhumane partial-birth procedure. During last \nyear's debate, the New York Times quoted the pro-choice National \nAbortion Federation as saying that only about 450 partial-birth \nabortions are performed each year. However, two lengthy investigative \nreports published last week in the Washington Post and the Record of \nHackensack, New Jersey, reporters for both newspapers found that the \nprocedure is far more common than pro-abortion groups have indicated, \nand is typically performed for nonmedical reasons.\n  The Record found, for example, that a single abortion clinic in \nEnglewood, New Jersey, performs at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions \nper year--three times the number that the National Abortion Federation \nhad claimed occur annually in the entire country. Doctors at the \nEnglewood clinic say that only a minuscule amount are for medical \nreasons. One of the abortion doctors at that clinic told the Record\n\n       Most are Medicaid patients, black and white, and most are \n     for elective, not medical reasons: People who didn't realize, \n     or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are teenagers.\n\n  Mr. President, it is unbelievable to me that this unspeakable \nabortion procedure even exists in this country, much less that we have \nto take legislative action to ban such a procedure, as well as attempt \nto override a Presidential veto.\n  It is further unbelievable to me that anyone in good conscience can \neven defend the partial-birth abortion procedure. It is a fiction to \nbelieve that it is all right to end the life of a baby whose body, \nexcept the head, is fully delivered. In order to engage in such a \nfiction one has to take the position that the curling fingers and the \nkicking legs have no life in them. Those who subscribe to such a \nfiction are at best terribly misguided. It is time to end this \ninjustice and the practice of this procedure. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in voting to override the President's veto.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, Congressman Tom Coburn, who \nhas delivered over 3,000 babies. He is still an active obstetrician. He \nis a professional in this area. He said this procedure is never, never \ncalled for. It is never necessary. He knows. The people who are \nsupporting this procedure are saying we should never have any \nrestrictions on abortion; that if you can't have this restriction, then \nyou should not have any restriction, period. That means abortions for \nsex selection. That means abortion on demand for any reason. Abortion \nis a method of birth control; in this case birth control when the \nbaby's head is only a few inches from delivery; maybe just a few \nseconds. Maybe the doctor is keeping the baby's head in so that life \ncan be destroyed inside while the baby's head is still in the mother \ninstead of just a few seconds later when it would be recognized as \nmurder.\n  Mr. President, how can you say when the baby's arms and legs are \nkicking that it is not a live baby? We need to protect the lives of \nthose innocent children. We need to override the President's veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11268-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11272-S11274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE OMNIBUS PARKS BILL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am waiting for one of my colleagues. \nBut in the interim I would like to bring to the attention of the \nMembers the prospects again for addressing the 126 individual bills in \nthe omnibus parks package.\n  This has been the culmination of some 2 years in the committee of \njurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As a \nconsequence of that effort we are on the eve of initiating an action in \nthis body that would result in the passage of this very important \nlegislation which clearly is the most significant environmental package \nwith some 126 bills that has come before this body.\n  As a continuation of my previous remarks, the conference-adopted \namendments in sum serve to ensure that this legislation will rectify \nparticularly the accumulation of inadequate funding which now totals \nsome $4 billion necessary to maintain our parks in a manner which is in \nkeeping with the uniqueness and oftentimes the sanctity of those areas.\n  One of the amendments adopted and totally submitted by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, which addressed concerns of the \nNational Park Foundation Act, is evidence that that amendment would \nserve to ensure that the legislation would not lead to unwarranted \ncommercialization of the parks, or abuse by corporate sponsors. The \ntheory, Mr. President, here is that this legislation would be \nimplemented in such a way that it followed very much that patterned \nafter the national Olympic committees which authorize certain very \nselect stipulations with regard to certification by the Olympic \ncommittees of activities that can occur in association with the \nOlympics.\n  For example, if a movie is made in one of our national parks, is \nthere any contribution given to that national park to that movie? If \nthere is a picture of an automobile, a new model portrayed in front of \nMount Shasta, is there a contribution from Chrysler, Ford or General \nMotors to that park?\n  This is the innovative approach that we are hoping to prevail in the \nNational Park Foundation Act to help fund our parks, not to \ncommercialize the parks. We are not going to have the park sponsored by \n``Joe Blow's Gas Station,'' or something of that nature, I assure you. \nIt is going to be in keeping with the intention of the park.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator, while he retains the \nfloor, yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am pleased to yield to the chairman of the committee \nof jurisdiction on parks.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to say to my dear friend, the \ndistinguished colleague from Alaska, how much I have admired all of the \nwork that he has done as the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, and especially for his dedication to putting \ntogether and crafting a bill with a wide-ranging impact on our national \nparks and on other recreational land, and lands that are appropriate \nfor preservation. I know how much that he wanted also to pass and have \nincluded provisions that are very important to him and to the people he \nrepresents in Alaska, and to other Members of this body.\n  I must confess that I felt that his ambitions were as great as they \nwere worthy and that they were very likely to cause this body to not be \nable to act on many of these matters. As a consequence at the request \nof a number of Members of both the House and Senate, I have seriously \nconsidered whether or not it is appropriate to include in the \nDepartment of the Interior portion of our appropriations bill at least \nsome of the important and not so controversial elements of that bill. I \ndo have a particular interest--not that of a constituent interest--in \none part of that. The Presidio portion of that bill is very important \nbecause the Presidio is by far the most expensive of our national parks \nand takes up a tremendous amount of the appropriations in which I \nsupervise and oversee and chair in this body. To get the kind of \ncommunity participation in San Francisco that we have desired to take \nsome of the burdens of the local aspects of the Presidio off our hands \nso that we can better fund other national parks is important. So that \nwas one element of the bill that we proposed to include.\n\n  I have been as delighted, however, as I was surprised at the ability \nof the Senator from Alaska now to put together a conference committee \nreport which is ready to be reported and debated in the Senate. I \nsimply say to my\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\ncolleagues they are not going to get the half or quarter loaf that was \na possibility in the appropriations bill. This was an alternative if \nthe conference committee could not work a way out. I am as committed \nand as dedicated to the passage of the entire bill that the Senator \nfrom Alaska as the chairman of the committee has submitted, I hope, \nalmost as much as he is. It is, in the vernacular, the only train \nthrough town during the rest of this session, and I hope the Senate \nwill soon be able to take it up and be able to pass it.\n  With that, I yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to my colleague with reference to the \nPresidio in relation to the trust which is authorized in the \nlegislation, it is my understanding the proposal advocated by some for \nthe Government to manage that facility was somewhere in the area of \n$1.2 billion. The intention of the trust will be to use some of the \nextraordinarily talented people in San Francisco who are knowledgeable \non finance, development, and environmental concerns to come together \nand operate this similar to the Pennsylvania Avenue effort here in \nWashington that has been so effective in rejuvenating the downtown \narea. Obviously, the people of San Francisco are closest to that and \nthe justification for that application working, I am satisfied, having \nmet several people that I assume would be appointed by the President \nif, indeed, the Presidio package becomes law.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Alaska is entirely correct. The National \nPark Service is not set up to be the manager of the extensive and \nvaried kinds of buildings that are found on the Presidio, very \nexpensive to keep up, very expensive in requiring a great deal of \nsensitivity to lease or to rent in a way that is consistent with the \nland around and in the Presidio itself. So the trust is clearly the \nright way to go, and that is the leading element of the bill that the \nSenator from Alaska has reported. It is by no means the only one. As I \nunderstand from his notes, as many as 41 States may have projects that \nare helped by that bill. I hope, as the Senator from Alaska does, that \nthe Senate will take it up promptly and will pass it promptly and it \nwill be signed by the President. But in any event, that is the only way \nwe are going to get from here to there.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Washington. I remind him, too, \nthat Washington has some other interests. There is the Vancouver \nReserve establishment and the Hanford Reach protection that are \nassociated with the State of Washington exclusively. There are \ncurrently 126 individual bills in this package, and the significance of \nit, as the Senator well knows, is the result of a great deal of \nindividual Members' and staffs' time, commitment, and hearings that \nhave resulted in the last 2 years of effort.\n  Now, some of my friends tell me they have been at their individual \nbills longer than that. I want to assure my friend from Washington that \nthose items that the administration identified as items, in their \nopinion, warranting a veto--the Tongass was one, Utah wilderness, \ngrazing, the Minnesota boundary waters--all have been removed. I am \nsure if the administration wants to find something to veto, why, they \nwill choose to do that, but they should also bear the responsibility of \naccountability for the very positive aspects of this bill which do \nrepresent some 41 States' interests and 126 individual participations \nin this portion.\n\n  I thank my friend from Washington for his statement relative to the \nfact that this is the train. It has left the station. I encourage my \ncolleagues to recognize that, if we do not do it now, it simply will \nnot get done. I thank my friend from Washington.\n  I will conclude my references with the remainder of my statement, Mr. \nPresident, relative to a little more enlightenment on the issue. I \nagain refer to the National Park Foundation Act and the aspects of \nensuring that we will get the balance necessary to ensure that the \nparks are not victimized by commercialization associated with this \namendment, which would simply relieve some of the appropriation process \nto ensure that the funds can be contributed by appropriate corporate \nsponsors related to legitimate activities that are allowed in the parks \nsimilar to what I have described relative to movie background and the \ntradition there has been no consideration given to the parks for that \nand other types of activities in keeping with the sanctity of the park.\n  I do want to expand on one more item of major importance which I \nthink some would suggest is as important to some extent as the Presidio \nand that is the California bay delta environmental enhancement \nlegislation which is in there. This provision is backed by virtually \neveryone and is equal to or certainly on a par with the Everglades \ninitiative in its significance because those of us who are familiar \nwith the bay area recognize what this bay delta environmental \nenhancement legislation would do to clean up the bay. The authorities \nin this bill will allow for massive restoration, massive cleanup in San \nFrancisco Bay and the delta region.\n  As I have indicated in the colloquy with my friend from Washington, \nthis legislation touches nearly every State in the Nation, and while we \nattempted to address the concerns of all of our colleagues, as I have \nindicated, some of the items fell by the wayside either because we \ncould not agree among our conferees, the House and Senate could not \nagree, or the administration could not agree. Of course, as I have \nindicated earlier, President Clinton made it very clear that if certain \nprovisions were included in the package, he would veto the entire \neffort, no matter how meritorious.\n  As I indicated, we addressed that in the wilderness bill which was \nabandoned, the grazing bill which was abandoned. Unfortunately, \ncommunities in our Western States are not too happy about this. A \nportion of Minnesota will not have the benefit of motorized portages in \nthe Boundary Waters Canoe Area. In my State, the Ketchikan contract \nextension provision was left on the table because the President made it \nclear that he would veto the entire bill. This meant as many as \npotentially 4,000 jobs--1,000 direct, 3,000 indirect--would be the \nresult of not including that contract extension. Those are the only \nyear-round manufacturing jobs we have in the State. As a consequence, I \nfeel very badly about this. These are jobs that this administration \nsacrificed in my State, in my opinion, to appease an environmental \nlobby, which I think is unfortunate because the environmental lobby has \nattempted to instill fear instead of reality and logic. There is a very \npositive reaction which could result from the Ketchikan contract \nextension leading to advanced technology in other mills. But, for \nreasons that are quite obvious, the objective is simply to terminate \nharvesting of all timber in forests. And this administration and the \nenvironmental community seem to be hell-bent to achieve that.\n\n  The administration seems to have continued to oppose any value-added \nuse of the Tongass National Forest. I think it is difficult, and sad, \nwhen the Government turns its back on the men and women who have built \ncommunities and towns and made them livable for those who come after. I \nthink it is a harsh action. It is one without compassion. And the \nexplanation is, well, if there are people suffering, we will simply \nwrite a check; we will provide funds to offset their loss of jobs \nthrough various types of assistance.\n  That is not what built America. That is not what built my State. It \nis not what is going to continue to maintain our area. There are \ncertain limitations on what taxpayers should be expected to do given \nwhat people want to do to help themselves. I think it is disappointing \nthe administration has chosen to turn its back on our workers, again, \neffectively killing our only year-round manufacturing/processing plant \nin the State.\n  So, we have come full circle in the Tongass. Some of my Alaskan \nfriends will reflect on the time when we were a territory, prior to \n1959. They had a couple of sawmills. There was no real available timber \nat that time. There was no demand at that time. The Forest Service was \nnot structured to any extent at that time. The theory was: How can we \ndevelop some jobs, some tax base, an economy in southeastern Alaska?\n  After the war, they began to look north towards the pulp stands. I \nmight add, 50 percent of the standing timber is in the form usable for \npulp. It does not meet sawmill requirements. It has virtually no other \nuse than dissolving pulp. The question is, are we going to allow this \n50 percent of timber in\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\nsoutheastern Alaska to be exported to the pulp mills in the south 48, \nWashington, Oregon, British Columbia?\n  The head of the Forest Service, who later became Governor in the \nState of Alaska, Governor Hickel, initiated a plan to establish four \npulp mills in Alaska. Two of those were built. Two years ago, under \nenvironmental opposition, the Sitka mill was closed. Today, or in the \nnot too distant future, we are about to see the termination of the one \nremaining mill, the Ketchikan pulp mill. So we made full circle to \nwhere we were when we were a territory. We have no utilization of 50 \npercent of the timber, other than to export it to mills in the Pacific \nNorthwest and British Columbia, exporting our jobs, exporting our tax \nbase.\n  There are a lot of unhappy Alaskans as a consequence of the inability \nof this administration to consider the merits of extending the contract \nso the $200 million investment can be made in a new mill.\n  So, the administration eliminated the chances for the pulp mill \ncontract extension because there are certainly not enough votes in a \nPresidential election year to override a Presidential veto. I think it \nis truly regrettable that this administration has seen fit to make \nTongass management an election issue, to pander to some of the extreme \nenvironmental groups who have established themselves in our State. I \nthink we have 62 of them now. If you are not in Alaska, you are not a \nlegitimate environmental group. They send their lawyers up to do \nmissionary work, because everybody has a little different view and \nvision of Alaska. Their vision is that somehow Alaska should not be \nsubject to any responsible resource development. Whether it be timber, \noil and gas, mining, we cannot do it safely, really selling American \ntechnology short. They use their presence, then, for their cause or \ncauses, raising money and increasing membership by advanced rhetoric, \nfear tactics that we cannot do it safely.\n\n  Mr. President, we are currently 51.4 percent dependent on imported \noil. In 1973, we were 36 percent dependent on imported oil. The \nDepartment of Energy says by the year 2000, 4 years away, we will be 66 \npercent dependent on imported oil.\n  We are exporting our jobs, we are exporting our dollars, we are \nexposing the national energy security interests of this country to the \nwhims of the Mideast that we have become so dependent on. We will pay \nthe piper. The public will blame Government. They will blame the \nindustry. We have been producing 25 percent of the total crude oil for \nthe last 18 years. It is in decline. We can replace it. We have the \nknow-how. But America's environmental community says no.\n  They do not say no with an alternative; they simply say no, because \nit generates membership and the American people cannot go up and look \nat it. They cannot go up and look at Endicott, which is now the seventh \nlargest producing field in North America. The footprint is 54 acres. If \nwe could develop, with the technology we have, the ANWR area would be \n12,500 acres or less, about the size of the Dulles International \nAirport if the rest of Virginia were wilderness. Those are the \ndimensions. That is the technology. We will pay the piper and the \nenvironmental groups will not take any of the responsibility.\n  Their cause is fear. They have been very effective. And those of us \nwho have tried to be a little more objective, I guess, have failed. \nThat is where we are, certainly, on this issue, with the loss of our \nonly manufacturing plant.\n  In conclusion, all the controversial items have been removed from \nthis bill. The administration may not like every detail of every \nprovision, but in total it is a very acceptable, very profound, very \nworthwhile package because it is for our parks and for resource \nconservation. It addresses the concerns of our national parks and our \npublic lands. I guess it also represents what is wrong with our system, \nbecause Member after Member will come to me, as does the media, and \nsay: Why did you have to have this huge package of bills? Why did you \nnot pass them out? You are the chairman of the committee.\n  In deference to all of us, we know how this place works. Virtually \nevery bill we reported out, every one of these 126 bills that are in \nthe package, have had holds placed on them after we moved them out of \ncommittee, reported them out of committee. This is a right, under the \nrules of the Senate, but that is what is wrong with the process. So, \nafter our efforts to untangle this and put it together and take away \nthose items that were poison pills that the administration addressed, \nwe presented the package as a consequence of the conference last night \nand our ability to have the House accept and send over the package.\n  We had one senior Senator who placed a hold on committee bills \nbecause of totally unrelated bills which the full Senate eventually \nvoted, 63 to 37, to pass.\n  The abuse of the hold has contributed to the construction of this \npackage. I guess one bill cannot move without another and another and \nanother. The system needs repair so the Senate can proceed to \nmeritorious legislation in a timely fashion on the merits of each \nindividual bill.\n\n  I see other Senators waiting. This Senator has been waiting to bring \nthe Presidio package before this body since 1 o'clock. I understand \nthere is some concern on the other side of the aisle. We have not heard \nan expression of what that concern is. As I have indicated, if they are \nlooking for an excuse to hold it up, veto it, then let's say so. Let's \nsay so. Let's have it out. I am sure they can find one.\n  But if not, as the Senator from Washington said, if you are expecting \nsome of the issues, some of these bills to be taken out of the omnibus \nparks package and put in the reconciliation package as a consequence of \nwork underway by the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, you have \njust heard the Senator from Washington, the chairman of that \nsubcommittee, indicate that this is the only train moving. He is not \ngoing to take bills out of this portion and put them in the Interior \nappropriations bill and put it on the CR.\n  This is the train that is moving. We are ready to move with it. If \nyou are going to hold up the train, you have to bear the responsibility \nfor 41 States that are affected here--37 to 41, depending. Some of them \nare double-counted, like New Jersey and New York, because they affect \nboth States, or the 126 individual bills that are in the package.\n  I encourage my colleagues to either come to the floor and indicate \nwhy they find it unacceptable, or face up to the opportunity we have \nnow and pass it now. Procedurally, the last point I want to make is, if \nthere is a motion that prevails to recommit, the package is dead. It is \nover. That is it once and for all. It is gone. We have lost our \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire what the procedure is at the \ncurrent time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to speak \non the issue that we will be debating at some length tomorrow, partial-\nbirth abortion. My understanding is we have reserved a considerable \namount of time for debate tomorrow.\n  I think it is important we have that debate. Clearly, we are heading \ntoward perhaps one of the most difficult, but most important, votes in \nthe U.S. Senate, difficult because it deals with an issue of such \nimmense consequences that I think it is important that each Senator \nfocus very clearly on the issue at hand.\n  This is not another one of those issues where I think anybody can \njust simply say, ``Well, I'm pro-life.'' ``I'm pro-choice.'' ``What is \nthe pro-life vote?'' ``What is the pro-choice vote?'' ``Tell me what \nthat is and I'll vote and walk off the floor and go on with my \nbusiness.'' In my opinion, whether you are of the pro-life persuasion \nor the pro-choice persuasion, this issue deals with something of even \ngreater consequence than that issue which is of extreme consequence. \nBut this deals with something beyond the normal discussion that has \ntaken place on the issues that would be categorized under the ``pro-\nlife, pro-choice'' issues.\n  The President's veto of legislation passed by the Senate and passed \nby the\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\nHouse of Representatives banning partial-birth abortions, except in the \ncase where the mother's life is jeopardized, forces us, I believe, to \nconfront a fundamental question of whether we will have a society that \nis civilized or one that is uncivilized.\n  It is of such great importance and such consequence that I urge every \nSenator to examine carefully the facts--not the rhetoric--but the facts \nsurrounding this issue. Facts that were--at least information that was \npurported to be fact during the original discussion of this issue have \nnow fallen to new information, information that has indicated to us \nthat we did not have all of the facts at hand when we made that \noriginal vote. Hopefully, that will cause some Senators to reconsider \ntheir vote. It certainly has caused some of those who have examined the \nsubject and written about the subject to reconsider their position.\n  Richard Cohen, who less than a year ago, during the time of debate on \nthe partial-birth question, wrote an article which was published in the \nWashington Post, and probably in other periodicals around the country, \njustifying his conclusion that the partial-birth abortion procedure was \njustified.\n  But after examination of what he called ``new data about this type of \nabortion,'' he wrote a second article in which he admitted to having \nbeen misled by the data supplied by, and I quote his writing, ``the \nusual pro-choice groups.''\n  Ruth Pabawer, writing for the Sunday Record in New Jersey, after \nextensive investigation determined that ``interviews with physicians \nwho use the method''--that is the method of partial-birth abortion--\n``reveal that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth \nabortions are performed each year--three times the supposed national \nrate.''\n  It was stated on this floor a number of times, and has been repeated \non this floor a number of times, that we are talking about a very rare \nprocedure, one that is used primarily, and almost exclusively, in cases \nof extreme health distress or extreme risk to the life of the mother; \nthat it is performed roughly around 600 or so times a year on a \nnational basis.\n  Yet, a respected reporter writing in New Jersey has concluded after \nher investigations that at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are \nperformed each year in that State alone, and that most of those 1,500 \nabortions are not performed in situations or instances when the life of \nthe mother is at stake, not even performed for medical reasons, but \nsimply performed because the mother-to-be of that child has changed her \nmind; that circumstances are different, that there has been some \nindication of a problem but, in most cases, not even that, merely a \nchange of mind as to whether or not that child was a wanted child. And \nso the abortion is performed.\n  If we extrapolate the 1,500 in New Jersey out nationwide, we are \ntalking about several thousand, if not tens of thousands, of these \nprocedures occurring every year. This is data that was not available to \nus when we discussed this issue on the floor previously.\n  Mr. President, it was the Washington Post that reported that it is \npossible, and I am quoting, ``and maybe even likely, that the majority \nof the partial-birth abortions performed are performed on normal \nfetuses, not on fetuses suffering genetic or developmental \nabnormalities. Furthermore, in most cases where the procedure is used, \nphysical health of the woman whose pregnancy is being terminated is not \nin jeopardy. In virtually all cases, there are alternative ways to \nperform the abortion safely.''\n  This is only part of the evidence that has been supplied to us and \nprovided to us that was not available when we debated the issue \nearlier. I suggest this new data is something that every Member of the \nSenate ought to very carefully consider, because if a decision to \nsupport a procedure, a medical procedure, which, as Senator Moynihan \nhas suggested, really borders on infanticide--taking a child, sometimes \nfive, six or even more months of gestation, a child that, if born, \nwould, in most instances, easily survive, easily be nurtured to \ncomplete health--if that happened at that stage, then we clearly would \nhave a situation that would require no medical procedure, no abortion \nprocedure.\n  Yet, that child is, under partial-birth abortion, almost born, is \nwithin 3 inches and 3 seconds of birth and then killed, terminated. \nThat life is terminated. The heart is beating, the brain is \nfunctioning, the body is complete, the child is ready--even though it \nmight be premature--it is ready to become a functioning member of the \nhuman race, of the human society. Yet, that child, and I will talk more \nabout this tomorrow, that child is then subjected to generally a probe \nor scissors punctured into its brain, a suction tube inserted through \nthat hole, its brains sucked out of its skull, the skull then collapses \nto allow the abortion then of the dead child.\n  That is the procedure we are talking about. It may have been \njustified in some minds on the basis that this was a rare procedure. It \nmay have been justified in some minds on the basis that this procedure \nwas necessary to save a mother's life. We now know that that is not the \ncase. We now know that in most instances of partial-birth abortion, \nthat no such situation is reality. Rather, we now know that these are \nsimply done as a feasible, medically feasible means of terminating the \nlife of the child.\n  This Nation has, in its history, always sought to expand the circle \nof those who deserve equal rights under the Constitution, and deserve \nto be a part of this civilization. We have fortunately--and too late--\nbut still fortunately shed the discomfort and disgust we once had, or \nat least some had, for people of different color, and we have brought \nthem into the full civil rights of the Constitution and of people in \nthis Nation.\n  We have extended those rights to people of the other gender, women in \nterms of their rights and ability to vote. Our impulses have extended \nrights to those who are disabled. The Americans With Disabilities Act \nextends those rights. But the history of civil rights in this country \nhas been an ever-widening circle of inclusion.\n  Yet, for the most defenseless in our society, for the smallest, the \nweakest of our society, we refuse to extend that right. And in this \nsituation, in the case where the child is clearly beyond the age of \nviability, under any definition, when birth of the child simply means \nan extended hospital stay until the child is a little stronger and able \nto go home, with his or her mother, we have a situation where, in most \ninstances, for the sake of convenience that child's life is terminated.\n  But, Mr. President, I do not mean to imply that this is a matter of \nnumbers, that even if there were only 660 abortions performed on an \nannual basis that that would justify that procedure. Because even if \none abortion were performed using the medical procedures used in \npartial-birth abortions or performed at the age of the child which \nthese abortions are performed, even if there was only one, we ought to \nhave this debate on the Senate floor. And we ought to have this vote, \nbecause this is a procedure that it is now clear is a procedure that \ntakes the life of a living human being, a human being fully viable, \nfully capable of living on its own.\n  If this procedure were performed in another country, I would guess \nthat we would be down here debating the human rights of that country, \nand there would be amendments offered to deny trade, to deny foreign \nrelations, to reach out and call out these unspeakable procedures that \nare taking place in nations around the world.\n  If this were a procedure that was being performed during conflict, in \na war, we would have people standing on this floor arguing and debating \nand offering amendments calling for war criminal trials against those \nwho were performing the procedure. And yet, here we are standing on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, and calling this a choice, a medical \nprocedure, chosen by a woman in consultation with her doctor. And those \nof us who believe that this procedure should not be performed are being \nlabeled as those who attempt to interfere with that choice.\n  Mr. President, I will have a great deal more to say about this \ntomorrow as we engage in our full debate. But I hope again that each \nMember would avail themselves of the new information that has come to \nlight about this procedure, about the number of times that it is \nperformed, about why it is performed, and would think through very \ncarefully about the consequences of allowing this procedure to \ncontinue,\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nthe consequences to us as a society, as a civilization, and what it \nsays about a society that, under the mantle of law, allows such a \nprocedure to take place.

Mr. President, during my last days in Congress, I wish to \nstate my unequivocal support of the restoration of funds to the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. These fine agencies have sustained disproportionate and \nunreasonable cuts over the past 2 years, and the erosion must stop.\n  As coauthor of the legislation that created the endowments 31 years \nago, I have felt like a proud father as both endowments have served the \nguiding principles upon which they were conceived. Overall, their \nprograms have been remarkably successful. There has been overwhelming \nevidence of the positive impact of the arts and humanities on \neducation, the economy, urban renewal, and cultural pride. It is \nimportant that two endowments are funded sufficiently to be able to \ncontinue their worthwhile and extremely effective endeavors to improve \nthe quality of life for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I am by no means alone today in favor of continued \nFederal funding for the arts and humanities. There is a strong \nbipartisan commitment. Earlier, Senator Jeffords and I circulated a \nletter signed by 31 Members that expressed their support of \nappropriations for the NEA, NEH, and IMS in fiscal year 1997 at current \nor slightly increased levels, and I ask that the letter be included in \nthe Record. Other Members have spoken with us subsequently regarding \ntheir support.\n  The American public remains solidly and strongly behind Federal \nsupport for the arts and humanities. A recent Harris poll found that a \n61 percent majority of Americans--to 37 percent saying ``no''--would be \nwilling to be taxed $5 more in order to pay for Federal financial \nsupport for the arts. These people believe the arts to be important and \nwould sorely miss them if they were not there.\n  In Rhode Island, the restored Humanities funding means quite \nliterally survival for an extremely important project that provides \nfascinating information to all Americans, not just the residents of my \nState. With NEH funding, the Rhode Island Historical Society is \nreassembling the Papers of Nathanael Greene from over 100 libraries and \ncollections scattered around the country, and is currently preparing \nthe 10th of a total of 13 planned volumes. Nathanael Greene, you will \nrecall was a Rhode Islander sent by George Washington to liberate the \nSouth--a task he accomplished with distinction. If work on the Papers \nstops now, it will be the history of Georgia and the Carolinas that \nwould not be published. Interestingly, while Greene was alive, Congress \npromised to publish his daily letters and orders. How poignant that we \nfulfill this promise now.\n  As I enter my last days as a U.S. Senator--36 years among wonderful \ncolleagues--I urge Congress to support the National Endowment for the \nArts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of \nMuseum Services at a level where they can fulfill their potential and \ncontinue to bring American culture to all Americans. I hope to hear \nthat the issues that are preventing the reauthorization of the programs \nof these agencies will be resolved amicably in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Senator Slade Gorton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Slade: As the appropriations process for fiscal year \n     1997 begins in the Senate, we wanted to take a moment to \n     share with you our strong commitment to supporting continued \n     funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Institute \n     for Museum Services (IMS). As you know, this issue of \n     continued federal funding for the arts and humanities is one \n     of great importance to us--one which was successfully \n     resolved last year, in large part due to your leadership in \n     working out the differences between the House and the Senate.\n       As you recall, last July, the Labor and Human Resource \n     Committee passed a bill to reauthorize the National \n     Endowments for the Arts and Humanities and the Institute for \n     Museum and Library Services--by a vote of 12-4. This strong \n     show of bi-partisan support, we believe, demonstrates a \n     continued sentiment on the part of the Senate to fund these \n     agencies. Therefore, we strongly support your efforts to \n     include appropriations for the NEA, NEH and IMS for the \n     upcoming fiscal year and hope that we might see an increase \n     over last fiscal year's appropriations for these agencies--\n     enabling each one to continue the important job of making the \n     arts and humanities more accessible to people all across our \n     nation.\n       We recognize that you will face many difficult decisions in \n     the weeks ahead, and ask only that you continue to keep in \n     mind the positive and valuable effect that arts and \n     humanities projects have in all of our respective States. The \n     Senate's commitment to federal support will ensure that arts \n     and humanities programs, activities and exhibitions will \n     continue to be available in local communities--engaging and \n     educating individuals of all ages--in addition to making an \n     enormous contribution to expanding and enriching our nation's \n     cultural heritage and artistic traditions.\n       We are grateful for your support of the reauthorization of \n     the National Endowments as well as your leadership in \n     managing the Interior Appropriations bill last year, and look \n     forward to working with you again this year.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Jeffords, John Chafee, Al Simpson, Bill Frist, Jay \n           Rockefeller, Barbara A.

ENVIRONMENT \n                               PROGRAMME\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week, the 51st session of the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly convened in New York City. To recognize the occasion, \nI spoke on the floor of the Senate to highlight some of the many \nbenefits that the United Nations brings to the American public. The \nUnited Nation has furthered American national interests by working to \npromote peace and democracy, to protect human rights, to strengthen \ninternational stability, and to foster cooperation between states on a \nwide range of important issues. Today I wish to focus on one of these \nimportant issues--an area where the United Nations has made significant \nadvances by enabling countries to work together and to find common \nsolutions to common problems. Today I wish to discuss the unique role \nof the U.N. Environment Programme.\n  The 1972 U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm was \nthe catalyst for the creation of the U.N. Environment Programme [or \nUNEP]. As a participant in those meetings, I eagerly supported the \neffort to integrate human development and the protection of the \nenvironment as two equally important goals to the international \ncommunity. The establishment of UNEP ensured that all countries would \nhave access to technical information and skills in order to develop and \nimprove national environmental policy. UNEP has also served as a \nvaluable forum for reaching international and regional consensus on \nlaws and operational standards that reinforce cooperative efforts to \nachieve long-term sustainable development.\n  Because of its unique role within the United Nations as the only \nagency with the mandate to make environmental concerns the top \npriority, UNEP has facilitated U.S. policy initiative in the \nenvironmental field. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher noted in \nan address at Stanford University last April:\n\n       The environment has a profound impact on our national \n     interests in two ways: First, environmental forces transcend \n     borders and oceans to threaten directly the health, \n     prosperity and jobs of American citizens. Second, addressing \n     natural resource issues is frequently critical to achieving \n     political and economic stability, and to pursuing our \n     strategic goals around the world.\n\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree with Secretary Christopher that the United \nStates must view environmental problems from a global perspective. The \nactions of one state inevitably affect the well-being of the citizens \nof its neighbors. The United States cannot afford to ignore the \noverpopulation, or the pollution, or the deforestation occurring in \nother countries because the consequences could be devastating right \nhere at home.\n  That is why the United States has participated in and supported U.N. \nagencies like UNEP. It is in our own best interests to work together \nwith other states to protect the international environment. Under the \nleadership of UNEP over the last 20 years, the international community \nhas agreed upon several international conventions which directly \nfurther U.S. environmental objectives. These conventions include the \n1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species [or CITES] \nwhich prohibits or regulates trade in some 35,000 endangered species; \nthe 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and \nthe 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, \nwhich have led to a 77 percent drop in global CFC emissions since \n1988--saving millions of lives through the prevention of skin cancer--\nand the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which commits \nindustrialized countries to reducing their emissions of greenhouse \ngases by the year 2000. These are but a few examples of international \ncooperation led by UNEP which have benefited U.S. citizens.\n  Despite these tangible benefits, however, I am concerned that the \nsurvival of UNEP is in jeopardy today. At a time when our Government's \nfinancial constraints are increasing, the United States should be \nlooking for ways to increase cooperation with other states in order to \navoid bearing the cost of acting alone. While I support the calls for \nmaking U.N. agencies more efficient and effective, it is important that \nthe United States continue to play a leading role in promoting \ninternational environmental cooperation by supporting UNEP. The Clinton \nadministration should persist in its efforts to streamline the programs \nand personnel of UNEP while making some real financial commitments at \nthe upcoming meeting of the governing council in January. Equally \nimportant, the decision on the leadership of UNEP should be given high \npriority for United States attention during the next month.\n  This is a critical moment for UNEP as the agency's financial crisis \nhas reached a point where many of its important programs may no longer \nbe viable. Given the recent decrease in financial and political support \nfor UNEP from its member states, the international community must \ndecide whether or not environmental concerns are still a priority on \nthe international agenda. If the answer is yes, then all member states \nmust commit themselves to both reforming and financially supporting \nUNEP. We have seen 20 years of impressive progress in the environmental \nfield that has often been achieved through the expertise and leadership \nof UNEP. With so much at stake, it would be a tragedy to allow this \norganization to founder today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11276-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11277-S11278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WORLD LEADERS SIGN TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I was fortunate to be in New York at the \nUnited Nations yesterday with President Clinton for the signing of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I can report to you that there is a tremendous sense of gratification \nof achievement in the United Nations with regard to this treaty. It was \nfinally approved last week by an overwhelming majority of the Members \nin a 158-to-3 vote.\n  I will be serving this fall at the United Nations as a Member of the \nUnited States delegation. Fifty-one years ago, I had the honor of \nserving on the International Secretariat of the San Francisco \nConference that drew up the United Nations' Charter. I was one of those \nflushed with youthful enthusiasm with regard to the potential future of \nthe United Nations. In the years since, there have been excellent \nachievements and some disappointments. I must say that I rank the \nunited effort that led to the comprehensive test ban as one of the \nparamount successes.\n  President Clinton has been able to bring to fruition an effort begun \nmore than three decades ago by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. The \nfirst test ban was negotiated under the direct and forceful leadership \nof President Kennedy, who drew upon the workable aspects of the Russian \nposition in order to help bring about the Limited Test Ban Treaty of \n1963, which restricted nuclear testing to underground environs.\n  The next test ban treaty came in 1974 under President Nixon's \nleadership, when the Threshold Test Ban Treaty was negotiated. The \ncompanion Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty was signed in 1976 in the \nFord administration.\n  President Carter attempted to achieve agreement on a comprehensive \ntest ban, but lacked sufficient time to do so. President Clinton played \na leading role in bringing the comprehensive test ban, which represents \nthe culmination of those earlier efforts, to conclusion this summer.\n  Under this treaty, the parties will be obligated not to conduct any \nnuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. This very \nstrong prohibition is a direct result of President Clinton's forward-\nthinking decision on August 11, 1995, not to agree to any exceptions to \nthis ban, but instead to negotiate a true zero yield comprehensive test \nban treaty.\n  Bringing this to fruition was a very high priority of Secretary of \nState Warren Christopher and ACDA Director John Holum. It involved \nyears of painstaking work at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva by \nAmbassador Stephen Ledogar and his delegation and in Washington by the \nbackstopping team led by Dr. Pierce Corden of the Arm Control and \nDisarmament Agency.\n  There is no question in my mind that this treaty from this date \nforward will constrain the qualitative development of nuclear weapons. \nInternational controls and the inspection regime will become active \nupon entry into force. It will serve to ban the development of advanced \nnew types of nuclear weapons and it will serve to demonstrate to the \nworld that the declared nuclear powers--United States, Great Britain, \nFrance, Russia, and China--are truly committed to control their nuclear \narsenals and genuinely desire to contribute to the prevention of \nnuclear proliferation.\n  This treaty truly represents a significant step toward nuclear \ndisarmament.\n  Mr. President, we would be deluding ourselves if we thought that \ngaining Senate advice and consent to a comprehensive test ban treaty is \ngoing to be easy. It will not be. Once the treaty is submitted by the \nPresident, the Committee on Foreign Relations, of which I have been \nchairman or ranking member since 1981, will hold thorough and wide-\nranging hearings. It is a process that I would enjoy very much, but \nwill instead be viewing from a distance as a retired Senator.\n  The degree of contentiousness that is possible can be seen in the \nsimple fact that the treaty was achieved by a Democratic President with \nthe support of his party and is rejected in the Republican Party \nplatform adopted this summer.\n  I hope that the hearings to be held by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations will serve to bring the sides together and will serve to \nassuage the fears and concerns of those who fear the possible \nconsequences to our national security of a comprehensive ban on nuclear \ntesting.\n  I believe that, since nuclear weapons design clearly is a mature \nscience, we do not need further testing to assure that our scientists \nhave done their work well and that we can move into a future without \nnuclear testing secure in the knowledge that we have a fine and \nreliable nuclear arsenal deterrent that will serve us well so long as \nwe rely upon nuclear weapons to protect us.\n  Experts will testify that there are no safety and reliability issues \nthat would necessitate further testing. Experts will also assure us \nthat the restraints that this treaty will place on other nations are \nvery much in our national security interests. Moreover, I would expect \nthere will be expert testimony from the intelligence community that \nwill provide the necessary reassurance to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\n  When all of that happens, I would expect that the Senate will, \nindeed, determine that it can proceed ahead with the comprehensive test \nban without any jeopardy to our national security. That step forward \nwill bring us well- deserved commendation from other nations and it \nwill be a gift beyond value to the generations that will succeed us.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11277-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11278-S11285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, like the Senator from Indiana, this is \nkind of a preview to coming attractions. I plan tomorrow to spend some \ntime on the floor talking about one of the most serious issues we have \nbeen addressing here in the U.S. Senate, that is, the issue of partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  As I was listening to the Senator from Indiana, the statements he \nmade, it occurred to me that if we made one mistake during this entire \ndebate, it has been to refer to this as an abortion, because most \npeople think of abortions as something that is taking place prior to \nthe time that, in their own minds, a fetus becomes a human being. I \nsuggest that everyone has to make that decision as to when human life \nbegins. I made my decision many years ago.\n  But I think when you deal with something as barbaric as a procedure \nsuch as the partial-birth abortion, you have to understand that this is \nsomething that happens at a time and can happen during a normal birth \nprocess.\n  I know the occupant of the Chair recently went through an experience \nwhen his wife delivered a new child. I am happy to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, that on Friday of this week, I will have my fourth \ngrandchild, so I know something about this, too.\n  I remember so well, and I will be referring to this tomorrow, an \nexperience I had about January of this year when we had the birth, at \nthat time, of my third grandchild. My daughter called me up and said, \n``Daddy, would you like to come over and come into the delivery room?'' \nOf course, back when we were having babies they would not let you in \nthe same hospital, let alone the same delivery room. I remember so well \nwhen the baby was born, baby Jason was just a tiny, beautiful thing, \nand it had not been more than a minute since his first breath and she \nhanded this baby to me, and I thought, this is just about the time this \nprocedure has been customarily used; if only people knew what was \nhappening, the fact that an incision would be made into the back of the \nhead in a baby that is three-fourths of the way already born in this \nworld, open up the head, and place a catheter and suck the brains out \nand the skull collapses. It is barbaric. It is a procedure that we have \nto do something about in this country.\n  I had occasion to ride back to Oklahoma with one of my fellow \ndelegates, a Member of Congress, Tom Coburn, a medical doctor. Tom \nCoburn, Member of the House of Representatives, described this, because \nhe saw this procedure take place one time. He said it was nightmarish.\n  Last Monday, I had occasion to be in a number of cities and small \ntowns in Oklahoma, having a series of town meetings, places, Mr. \nPresident, you have never heard of, like Durant, OK, and Idabel, OK, \nand Pontotoc, OK. There was not one place where they did not bring up \nin the course of this meeting: Are you really going to do something \nback there like the House did, do away with this procedure? Well, when \nI told them that the votes were not there and that President Clinton \nhad vetoed our attempt to make this procedure illegal, it became, all \nof a sudden, a character question on him: Why would he do that? I have \nno way of answering that.\n  Tomorrow I will present over 15,000 signatures of people from \nOklahoma and the comments they have made, over 15,000 people who are \nsaying: Whatever you do, override the veto as the House of \nRepresentatives did.\n  As I have served here and I see people who want to retain a medical \nprocedure that allows this method of taking the life of a small baby \nand I think of the people who are behind this, and you know what the \nbaby is going through, because tomorrow I will read a report that will \nlead you to the incontrovertible conclusion that a baby, even in the \nfirst trimester, feels and senses the same pain that you feel, Mr. \nPresident, or anyone else in this Chamber, or any baby that is fully \nborn and out and breathing today.\n  It occurred to me when the distinguished Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Coats, was talking a few minutes ago and he talked about if \nthis were happening in another country we would be invoking sanctions, \nwe would be talking about how this might affect trade, talking about \neconomic aid. I would go a step further than the Senator from Indiana. \nI would say if this had been happening, if this procedure were legal \nand taking place in an animal, a dog or a cat, those same people who \nare trying to keep this medical procedure in our law would be picketing \nback and forth outside our Senate offices.\n  Tomorrow we will have a chance to talk about it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 2129 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am advised by leadership that there will \nbe no further votes today.\n  Mr. President, I rise to address the question of the partial-birth \nabortion ban.\n  Mr. President, I must disclose at the start of this discussion that I \nam pro-choice. I have been pro-choice ever since I entered public life. \nI have been pro-choice in my voting pattern in the Senate and pro-\nchoice in my voting pattern in the House of Representatives. I was pro-\nchoice in my voting pattern in the State legislature of Colorado. I \nhave been pro-choice in the discussions and debates we have had in \nColorado, as well as in Washington, DC. So I come to this question of \npartial-birth abortions with a clear pro-choice record.\n  I must say that I am not for subsidizing abortions. In that regard, \nno one is liable to give you a perfect score--even the pro-choice \ngroups of which I feel part of, because occasionally those votes get \ncounted. But then I have not been very good at subsidizing anything \nwith public funds. So perhaps I can be seen as unforgiving in that \narea.\n  Mr. President, I am pro-choice because I believe in limited \nGovernment. I know many of my friends and colleagues have described \nsomeone who is pro-choice as being liberal. My own sense is that it is \nexactly the opposite. A society that gives citizens maximum choice and \ndiscretion in their lives is conservative, in my way of thinking, not \nliberal. For those who have suggested that this unreasonably or \nunfairly restricts a person's right to choose, I submit that that is a \nmistake. If someone shares my view that part of limited Government \ninvolves maximizing individual freedom and choice, then they rightly \nwish to preserve rights for people, even though they may not agree with \nthem. Such, I think, is the case with many people who seek to preserve \npeople's rights or the freedom to choose with regard to abortions. That \ndoes not mean--in spite of what the critics say--that one has to be in \nfavor of abortions. It does mean that one has to understand that \nsometimes things happen in a free society, that we don't like, and \nwhere we do not think it is the Government's right to dictate the \nanswer.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that it is important for Members, as \nthey cast this very important vote on the veto override, to take a look \nat the specifics of the bill itself. Here are some observations, that I \nsee as I look at it. The expert testimony we had before the committee \nindicated that as many as 1,000 to 1,500 abortions a year, perhaps more \nare done using this procedure. The actual number of partial-birth \nabortions performed in a year is unknown. Second, it is a very rare \nprocedure and very limited in scope, primarily confined to a late-term \npregnancies. If one approaches this issue with concern about preserving \nthe right to choose, and suggests that banning this procedure \neliminates the right to choose, I think they would be mistaken. It is \nquite clear, if one looks at the facts and the number of these \nprocedures that are performed, that restricting them or prohibiting \nthem does not eliminate someone's right to choose. The bill is \nextremely tightly drawn.\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\n  Mr. President, I played a small part in helping to make it a tighter \nbill. As Members are aware, the bill does involve potential liability \nclaims for people who violate the law. That liability was more broad \nthan I thought it ought to be. To limit the scope of the bill on the \nissue of liability, my amendment was adopted to prohibited a \ncomplainant from suing those who assist the doctor in performing the \nprocedure. Prior to that amendment, it was possible to sue the nurses, \nanesthesiologist, and attendants associated with one of these \nprocedures. My amendment eliminated those potential liability claims \nbecause those people primarily respond to the initiatives of the \npatients and physicians and not acting on their own authority. I also \noffered the amendment that prohibited the father from suing under these \ncircumstances, if he was not married to the mother at the time of the \nprocedure and if he had not stepped forward to acknowledge the child \nand provide support for the child. I see no reason for us to provide a \nwindfall to deadbeat dads. We ought to be encouraging people to take \nresponsibility, not think up rewards for those who don't.\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot ignore the medical evidence. Let me be \nspecific in this case.\n  The experts that testified before the committee not only indicated \nquite clearly that this is an extremely rare procedure but they \ndisagreed dramatically with regard to the effectiveness of this \nprocedure.\n  Here I call to mind Dr. Warren Hern. Dr. Warren Hern is a resident of \nColorado. He runs an abortion clinic in Boulder, CO. He runs a clinic \nthat probably does more late-term abortions than any clinic in the \nState of Colorado and perhaps one of the largest number of late-term \nabortions of any clinic in the country. By anyone's description, Dr. \nWarren Hern is pro-choice. We were contacted by Dr. Hern a few days \nago. He is director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic and the assistant \nclinical professor of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at \nthe University of Colorado Health Science Center.\n  Dr. Hern has written three books, is an avowed advocate of abortion \nchoice, and has written over 40 academic papers concerning abortions \nand other aspects of women's health and fertility. He is clearly \nregarded as an expert in this field and an expert in this field who is \nclearly pro-choice. Dr. Hern's message, as it was relayed to me, is \nconsistent with the testimony he submitted to our committee hearings; \nand, that was simply that the partial-birth abortion procedure is not a \nsafe procedure for women and that he himself, who practices in this \nfield and performs late-term abortions, would not use it because of the \ndanger involved.\n  Mr. President, some Members will choose to vote on this issue solely \non the question of whether they are pro-choice or pro-life. Let me \nsuggest that Members ought to give a little more deep thought to what \nthis bill involves. It does not, in this Senator's belief, involve \nwhether or not you are pro-choice or pro-life. It involves taking a \nlook at a procedure that is judged by many experts to be extremely \ndangerous. We ought to be concerned about that.\n  The partial-birth abortion ban does not preclude someone from having \na late term abortion, it precludes the use of this horrific procedure. \nIt protects women and protects those involved from what many experts \nconsider a procedure that is not safe, is not advised and is not \nnecessary.\n  Former Surgeon General Everett Koop said.\n\n       Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \n     partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true. The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and \n     fertility. It is clear that late abortion is a dangerous \n     procedure, and in the instance of partial-birth abortion is \n     not necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that. Dr. C. Everett Koop says it is \nnot necessary.\n  Mr. President, I want to quote from one of our editorials in \nColorado. I must say that in Colorado our newspapers and our population \nare probably some of the most pro-choice newspapers and pro-choice \npopulation of any State in the Nation. We were one of the first States \nin the Nation to eliminate the legal restrictions on abortions.\n  This is an editorial from the Grand Junction Sentinel that has traced \nthe Roe versus Wade decision and has consistently been pro-choice. Here \nare the Grand Junction Sentinel comments.\n       Much will be made about the politics of the House vote \n     Thursday to override President Clinton's veto of a bill to \n     ban partial-birth abortions and whether it is possible to get \n     enough votes in the Senate to override.\n       Lost in the haze if political rhetoric is information about \n     the procedure Congress seeks to ban.\n       This corner historically has been supportive of the right \n     to choose, and in support of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme \n     Court decision that guaranteed that right. But partial-birth \n     abortion, usually performed after the fifth month of \n     pregnancy, is quite simply an unconscionable procedure in \n     which the brain of the infant is sucked out after the baby \n     has been partially delivered.\n       When he vetoed the bill in April, Clinton produced five \n     women whose lives, he said, were endangered by pregnancy \n     complications but saved by partial-birth abortions.\n       This week four nationally recognized doctors who specialize \n     in obstetrics and gynecology, part of a growing national \n     medical group opposed to this, said Clinton's claims were \n     wrong. All of the conditions presented by the president could \n     have been treated by methods safer than partial-birth \n     abortions, they said.\n       Women who have partial-birth abortions risk being cut, \n     having excessive bleeding and lifelong infertility.\n\n  They close with this sentence.\n\n       One doesn't have to be a member of the Christian Coalition \n     or an antiabortion zealot to believe that partial-birth \n     abortions should be outlawed.\n\n  Mr. President, I am pro-choice and I believe partial-birth abortions \nshould be outlawed, and I believe claims that outlawing partial-birth \nabortions interferes with the right to choose are simply not accurate. \nI believe a careful review of the medical evidence that is before us \nand that has been presented in the committee will clearly document \nthis.\n  Mr. President, what we need here is not Members lining up on the side \nof pro-life or pro-choice, although that surely will happen. It happens \nevery time we vote on this issue. But we do need some common sense, and \nwe do need to listen to each other. When we vote on this issue, I \nbelieve it is appropriate to look to the medical authorities that have \ncondemned this practice. There are those who will cast a vote because \nthey believe this procedure is immoral. Moreover, they believe that all \nabortions are immoral and wrong. I am one who has not fallen into that \ncamp. But I do believe we would be remiss if we didn't take the time to \nlook at the facts of the bill and look at the reality of the situation.\n  These operations are disgusting and horrible and not essential for a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  I hope Members will go deeper than just their political party or \ntheir affection for the President. I hope they will go deeper in making \ntheir vote on just whether they are pro-life or pro-choice. I hope they \nwill take the time to look at this procedure, and I believe an \nobjective review of the procedure will lead to the conclusion that this \nis not an appropriate procedure that should be allowed in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate my friend from Colorado.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was talking earlier about some Member who \nhad distinguished himself in his ability to articulate his position \nwell and to take stands on principles, ones he deeply believes in, not \nbe afraid to cross the line sometimes and to take controversial stands \nthat are outside of maybe what would be expected of him.\n  I think the Senator from Colorado has done that in this case, and he \nwill be missed for his thoughtful and thorough analysis of the issue. I \nthink anyone who listened to his presentation had to come away with an \nunderstanding that this is someone who did exactly what I had been \nhoping and what he called for all Members of the Senate to do, which is \nto step back. It is not, Santorum, don't put your pro-life hat on, or, \nHank Brown, don't put your pro-choice hat on, but let us look at the \nbill, let us look at the facts, and let us try to see whether this is \nsomething\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\nthat we want to have to continue in this country. I think what you saw \nin the House of Representatives is just that.\n  No one can stand up on this floor and say that two-thirds of the \nHouse of Representatives are people who are pro-life. They are not. \nThey are not pro-life. Two-thirds of the House is not pro-life. I am \nnot even sure if half of them would consider themselves or call \nthemselves pro-life by the traditional definitions used in this town \nand across the country. But two-thirds of the House said no to this \nprocedure; said it is time to draw the line irrespective of your \nopinion on the issue.\n  So for those who did in the House and already have done so in the \nSenate to come here and say, well, this is just some of these pro-life \nextremists trying to meddle again in the right to an abortion does not \nhold water. It did not happen in the House. That was not a group of \npro-life extremists. It was in fact a bipartisan coalition. It was \npeople of both opinions on the issue of abortion as it was here.\n  You heard from the Senator from Colorado. You will hear, I hope, \ntomorrow the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] and others who are \npro-choice say this goes too far, this crosses the line.\n  I think we have done an injustice by, as the Senator from Oklahoma \nsaid, referring to this procedure as partial-birth abortion, because I \nknow in having discussed this issue many times you mention the word \nabortion and people scurry to their column--pro-life, pro-choice, and \ntend to only listen to those who agree with them on that issue, as to \nwhat their opinion should be on this issue of abortion.\n  That is why I wanted to thank the Senator from Colorado for his \ncourage in not only offering amendments, as he did, to improve the bill \nand tighten the bill as he said, but for his courage to stand up and \ntalk to people who may listen and identify with his position on that \nissue and recognize that it is anything but extremism to say that a \nchild that is delivered all but the head, that in many, many cases is \nfully viable outside of the womb, is then killed by a blunt instrument \nto the back of the head and the suctioning procedure, banning that \nprocedure is not extremism.\n  I have not mentioned but I will--I do not like to talk about these \nthings when I talk about issues of this nature--polls. I hesitate to \ntalk about polls because this should not be an issue that we have to \ntake a poll on. But the polls say that as people understand this and \nonce it is explained to them what the procedure is, over three-quarters \nof the American public find this abhorrent--in some cases much higher \nthan that. I would think if three-quarters of the American public once \ninformed of this procedure find it to be abhorrent, that two-thirds of \nthe Senate could find it to be abhorrent.\n  I discussed in my comments earlier the medical necessity for doing \nthis, and the Senator from Colorado did the same and quoted a different \nphysician who said this is not a medically necessary procedure, this is \nin fact contraindicated as other physicians have said, that this in \nfact is dangerous to the woman's health, and I went through physicians \nand what they said about it. I talked about, as I just did, other \nMembers of the House and now Members of the Senate who feel differently \non the issue of abortion who have looked at all the evidence and \ndecided that now with this new evidence--one thing the Senator from \nColorado did not mention was the new evidence that this is not a rare \nprocedure. I think he still referred to it as a rare procedure, and \nthat is what everyone was led to believe when this bill was first \npassed, that this was a rare procedure. Planned Parenthood provided \ninformation that there was only a few hundred, 300 to 500 of these \nperformed every year. And yet we hear from the report in the Washington \nPost by Dr. Brown, I think David Brown, on September 17 that this \nprocedure is performed in this area more than just a few hundred times, \njust here. In fact, Planned Parenthood said this is only done by a \ndoctor in Ohio and the doctor in California. They are the only two. And \nthe Post found that in fact there are physicians in other areas who do \nit. It was found in the area around Bergen County there are 1,500 such \nabortions performed, partial-birth abortions performed on fetuses 20 to \n24, 26 weeks. I do not refer to a 26-week-old fetus as anything but a \nbaby because it is viable, clearly viable outside of the mother's womb.\n\n  So we have had all of that new information, and again I hope to share \nthat and I hope that people do look at that and realize that with this \ninformation and with the medical--this is a medical procedure and \nshould be judged not based on your opinion on abortion but based on \nmedical evidence and whether this is medically necessary.\n  That is one thing it should be judged on. Obviously, you cannot avoid \nthe effect a decision like this has on our culture; about what we say \nis legal and permissible in our culture. It obviously has an impact on \nwho we are. If the Government says that this is OK, it will have an \nimpact on who we are. And so that is something that you have to think \nabout, too.\n  The other thing that is not talked about much that I think is \nimportant to discuss in light of those who support the procedure, and \nparticularly the President, is the whole issue of fetal abnormality. \nThe President of the United States brought to the White House when he \ndecided to veto this legislation five women, all of whom said that they \nneeded this procedure to be done to protect their health. All of these \nwomen had babies--some of them were late-term abortions--had babies who \nhad some sort of fetal abnormality.\n  In the House and in the previous debate in the Senate many of the \nsupporters of this legislation and the President said that this is a \nvery good reason to have an abortion, that a fetal abnormality, many of \nwhich are fatal, some of which are not always, is a good reason to have \nan abortion, a late-term abortion, and this type of abortion. We have \ndiscussed the health aspects of this, is this type of procedure \nnecessary for the health reason. And clearly the evidence, the facts \nshow physicians, both prolife and prochoice, say, no, it is not \nnecessary.\n  I think there is a bigger issue here. It really goes beyond this \nwhole debate on abortion. And that is the debate on this whole issue of \nfetal abnormality as a good reason to kill a child, a baby. In some \ncases we are talking about very late term, we are talking about in the \nthirties weeks, very late-term abortion, because then we are getting \ninto the fact that, well, it is OK to perform this procedure because \nthe quality of life of the baby will not be what we believe is good, \nwhich is the perfect baby.\n  Now, you have some extreme examples of this in this debate with Dr. \nMcMahon out in California who said that he had nine third-trimester \nabortions--that is 7th, 8th and 9th month--he had nine such abortions \nthat were done electively, which means there was no health risk to the \nmother in delivering the baby--nine such abortions done because the \nchild had a cleft palate--a cleft palate. And we have the President of \nthe United States and people in the Senate who are saying it is a \ndecision between the mother and the doctor, it is not our job to say \nthat that is wrong; that the mother has the determination as to what is \nperfect in her eyes and then the Government, the State has no decision.\n  I said earlier that the very same people who make that argument are \nthe very same people who stood in this Chamber and the House, and I am \nproud they did, and argued for the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. They said that people who are not perfect, who have a disability, \nhave a right to be able to get around to different places, to have \nemployment opportunities, to be treated equally.\n\n  We did not bring up this issue. I do not know whether we will before \nwe leave, but the issue of I-D-E-A, IDEA, which is education for the \nmentally disabled in our school system and the physically disabled--\nagain, the very same people, many of them, not all, but many of whom \nwill stand and say this feature is OK because we have a deformed baby, \nsay that we have an obligation to provide equal education to children \nwith disabilities.\n  If we have an obligation as a State, as a government, to provide \nequal opportunities for education for people who are not perfect, at \nleast in the eyes of some, those who have disabilities should have the \nequal right to education, should have the equal right under the ADA to \ntreatment in the workplace and other places, how can you stop short and \nsay they do not\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\nhave an equal right to life? How can you be for all those things and \nnot be for giving this poor--in some cases, yes, badly deformed--baby a \nright to die with dignity, if that is the case, a right to live?\n  There is an article in the Washington Times today. It quotes a man, a \ncorrespondent. I should not say it is a man because it does not say \nthat. I apologize for that. The article is written by a woman, Maggie \nGallagher. It may, in fact, be a woman. It says:\n\n       I ran across excerpts from a letter to the editor of the \n     London Spectator. The correspondent wrote: ``I have severe \n     spina bifida, and am a full-time wheelchair user . . . Every \n     day I read in the press about 'exciting breakthroughs' which \n     mean yet another way to kill people like me before birth.\n\n  I think that is the point I want to make here. Let us just put aside \nthe whole issue of partial-birth abortion for just one second. Think \nabout what message we are sending out to the people who have \ndisabilities, who have suffered through some of the disabilities \ndescribed by some of the women that the President brought to justify \nhis decision here. Yes, many of the people who had these disabilities--\nin fact, in some cases, all of the people who had these deformities--\ndied. But some lived. Some lived for a short period of time, some for a \nlong period of time. What are we saying to them? What are we saying to \nour culture? What are we saying about these people who came to the \nfloor for month after month on the issue of disabilities, on the issue \nof welfare, and said, ``What about the children? Don't you care? Where \nis your compassion? Where is your concern for the least of us as a \nsociety?''\n  Did these children do anything to end up disabled? Is it their fault \nthat they were abnormal, that we should look upon them and say, ``Well, \nbecause you are abnormal, you are therefore expendable, and it is \njustifiable to treat you that way''?\n  I am going to read an article from a doctor who wrote this just last \nmonth in the Los Angeles Times, the Washington edition. The doctor's \nname is Katherine Dowling. She is a family physician at USC School of \nMedicine. The title of the article is, ``What Constitutes a Quality \nLife?''\n       The nights can be long and frustrating for we doctors whose \n     shifts fall with regularity in the wee hours. A young lady \n     comes in demanding to know if she is pregnant, then fussing \n     for instant termination when she is found to be. An elderly \n     lady wants a cure for her constipation. An addict arrives, \n     angling for a legal fix.\n       But every once in a while, like the astronomer whose long \n     nocturnal vigils are rewarded one clear night with the smudge \n     of a new comet on his photography plate, we sometimes \n     encounter the extraordinary. I did one recent night.\n       I doubt you'd peg the couple as extraordinary if you saw \n     them on the street. She had perhaps once been somewhat of a \n     beauty. Her brown hair was cropped short and hung limply, and \n     she clearly had put on a bit more weight with each of her \n     pregnancies. His tummy flopped over his belt, and he had a \n     kind smile. Their child was a young adult based on his birth \n     date, but his brain hadn't really developed much beyond that \n     of a 4-year-old. As he lay on the gurney, occasionally using \n     words only his mother could understand, she calmly told of \n     the recent worsening of his medical problems. When she left \n     the room, he searched for her with the tenacity of an infant, \n     and like an infant, looked into her eyes with pure joy when \n     she returned. Dad waited outside, ready with a smile and a \n     little joke.\n       They had been caring for their child with love and patience \n     since early infancy, when his problem first began. I suspect \n     that he was a happy young man, in spite of his bad neurologic \n     luck. He'd certainly had good luck in his choice of parents.\n       To me, these parents showed a caliber of heroism that only \n     a few humans are called on to exhibit in a lifetime. They had \n     put aside their own wants, had accepted a child who would \n     never be capable of doing things even the most ordinary of \n     nonhandicapped children could, had given their son enough \n     love and physical help to make his life not just bearable but \n     apparently happy. In the process, they'd raised a bunch of \n     other children now doing well, and they'd stayed together in \n     a strong and supportive marriage.\n       Far too often, we assume that a child born with a medical \n     problem is a child whose life is not worth living. We think \n     that parenting such a child is an impossible task. When \n     President Clinton vetoed the bill that would have banned \n     partial birth abortions, implicit in the stories of the women \n     he gathered around him was that they were doing a noble thing \n     for their children and themselves. Extracting the brain from \n     a living, sensate fetus was felt to be better than allowing \n     that fetus to be born with a body that was less than perfect.\n       In 1995, James McMahon, a leading Los Angeles abortion \n     doctor (recently deceased), sent a submission to the House \n     Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, which was holding \n     hearings on partial birth abortion. This document revealed \n     the reasons partial birth abortions were done in a survey of \n     more than 1,000 babies. More than 10% were done because of \n     fetal death, but by definition, this is not abortion. Twenty-\n     four were done for cystic hydroma (a benign lymphatic mass, \n     usually treatable in a child of normal intelligence). Nine \n     were done for cleft lip-palate syndrome (a friend of mine, \n     mother of five, and a colleague who is a pulmonary specialist \n     both were born with this problem). Other reasons included \n     cystic fibrosis (my daughter went through high school with a \n     classmate with cystic fibrosis) and duodenal atresia \n     (surgically correctable, but many children with this problem \n     are moderately mentally retarded). Guess they can't enjoy \n     life, can they? In fact, most of the partial birth abortions \n     in that survey were done for problems that were either \n     surgically correctable or would result in some degree of \n     neurologic or mental impairment, but would not harm the \n     mother. Or they were done for reasons that were pretty \n     skimpy: depression, chicken pox, diabetes, vomiting.\n       I'd like to commend those parents who have the courage to \n     raise handicapped children. Whenever I see a mother or father \n     holding a sickly baby and looking into its eyes with love, \n     each time there's a Down's syndrome child learning from its \n     sibling how to pile blocks on top of each other, I'm awed by \n     the power of the family to make a ``less than perfect'' life \n     a thing of happiness. And then I know how lucky I am to be in \n     a profession where every once in a while, I get a glimpse of \n     the best in humanity.\n  Is what we are doing here today a sign of the best of humanity? If we \nallow this procedure to continue, is this the best we can be? Is this \nthe seminal point? Is this the moment of pride that we came to the \nSenate to allow to happen on our watch?\n  For those who voted to allow this procedure to continue, when we vote \ntomorrow, look around, look inside and tell me whether you think we are \nexhibiting the best of humanity.\n  Dr. Dowling said that she had so much respect for parents who went \nthrough with difficult pregnancies possibly and maybe with the \nknowledge of an abnormal child being born.\n  I would like to read--and I hope I can read, because they are \nsometimes very difficult to read--letters from mothers who knew that \nthe child within them had fetal abnormalities. I believe all of the \nletters included here represent all of the conditions that the women \nthat President Clinton had at his side when he vetoed this bill, all of \nthe women--I shouldn't say that, I should read them--certainly a lot of \nthe things that the fetuses of the mothers at President Clinton's veto \nceremony --those conditions are represented in these cases.\n  In some of these cases, the child didn't live an hour, and in some, \nmiracles happened. But in every case, there is a case of courage, and \ntheir expressed purpose in writing was not to say that you won't hear \nthis about partial-birth abortion, it was to deliver the point that, \n``Mr. President, and those who are arguing for this bill to be \ndefeated, for the override to be sustained, please understand, that \nthis procedure doesn't need to be done to protect the health of the \nmother, No. 1, and No. 2, that we went through with these pregnancies \nthat you say are necessary to have these abortions, are necessary to \npreserve our health, that we actual actually did the alternative, and \nwere alive and were well, and we had beautiful experiences. Tragic but, \nyes, in many cases beautiful experiences. And, please, Mr. President, \nplease the Members who argue for the sustaining of the President's veto \non this bill, don't use the baby, don't use the children as a shield. \nDon't use them as the reason for allowing this to continue. Don't make \nthem the enemy of the mother. In fact, they are not.''\n  I would like to read a letter first from Jeanne French, from Oak \nPark, IL, dated July 1996, to the President. And I think she conveys \nmuch better than I that point:\n       Dear Mr. President: I write to you today as a fellow \n     Democrat with something to say about a difficult subject, \n     partial-birth abortion.\n       You may know that last November I testified before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on the partial-birth abortion ban \n     legislation. I was on the same panel as those mothers who \n     chose partial-birth abortions. It was ironic to see you veto \n     the ban framed by the women whose stories I got to know as I \n     sat beside them that day. In my naivete, I expected that your \n     administration would be more open to hearing the other side \n     of the partial-birth abortion question.--I was deeply \n     saddened to be excluded from the dialog you sought on this \n     issue.\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n       In recent months, I've had the opportunity to get to know \n     many women who have carried and given birth to children with \n     fatal conditions from anacephaly encephaloceles, Trisom 18, \n     hydrocephaly, and even a rare disease called body stalk \n     anomaly in which internal organs develop outside a baby's \n     body. We gave birth to our children knowing that their \n     serious physical disabilities might not allow them to live \n     long.\n       I do not tell you this because we are, or want to appear \n     heroic. We simply want the truth to be heard regarding the \n     risks of carrying disabled children to term. You say that \n     partial-birth abortion has to be legal for cases like ours, \n     because women's bodies would be ``ripped to shreds'' by \n     carrying the very sick children to term. By your repeated \n     statements, you imply that partial-birth abortion is the only \n     or most desirable response to children suffering severe \n     disabilities like our children.\n       Perhaps inadvertently, you send a message of hopelessness \n     to women and families who anticipate the birth of children \n     with serious or fatal disabilities.\n       This message is so wrong. We feel that it is imperative \n     that you reconsider the way you talk about options available \n     to mothers carrying very sick babies like ours. Will you \n     consider meeting with me and a few of the women I have come \n     to know over this issue? Will you please extend to the \n     Morsmans, Heinemans, Sheridans, and to me the same courtesy \n     extended to those families who had partial-birth abortions? \n     Will you meet with us personally, and hear our stories?\n       Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to \n     your response.\n\n  The response came back 13 days later that ``the President appreciated \nthe letter but will not have the opportunity to speak with you or your \ngroup.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the President's \nresponse after the reading of the letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 30, 1996.\n     Ms. Jeannie W. French,\n     Oak Park, IL.\n       Dear Ms. French: Thank you for interest in speaking with \n     President Clinton on the subject of partial birth abortion. \n     President Clinton appreciates your kind letter.\n       At this time, it seems that the tremendous demands on the \n     President will not give him the opportunity to speak with you \n     and your group. However, we will keep your invitation on file \n     and will be sure to contact you if any changes in his \n     schedule allow him to accept.\n       Once again, thank you for your thoughtful letter. Your \n     continued interest and support are deeply appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephanie S. Streett,\n                                           Director of Scheduling.\n     Anne Hawley,\n                                           Director of Scheduling.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What are those stories? Why are they important in this \ndebate? I think Mrs. French said why they are important. I think they \nare important for the purposes of this whole idea that we need to have \nthese abortions legal because of the health of the mother. That is \nimportant. That is why, the President said, he vetoed the bill.\n  We have all sorts of medical evidence and testimony, and even newer \ntestimony, testimony from both pro-choice and pro-life physicians, who \nsay that there is absolutely no health-of-the-mother or life-of-the-\nmother reason for doing this procedure. In fact, it is contraindicated. \nIt is more dangerous, according to Dr. Hern, who performs abortions and \nlate-term abortions, to do this procedure. So we have lots of medical \ntestimony about the cold medical aspect of it.\n  What Mrs. French is getting to is something that is maybe more \nimportant for us who are nonphysicians, who do not, frankly, feel \ncomfortable about making medical decisions but, hopefully, feel more \ncomfortable about making cultural decisions. That is where we are. The \ncultural decision is, as Dr. Dowling said, what constitutes quality of \nlife? We are making that decision here. If we sustain the President's \nveto, the children who just do not measure up, are not perfect, for \nthat reason alone, that we should allow this procedure to continue \nbecause they are not wanted in the human family here in the United \nStates of America.\n  The Senator from Indiana said just a few minutes ago, if we knew that \na civilization, a country, was deliberately killing disabled children, \nwhat an outcry--what an outcry--there would be from a lot of the very \nsame people who say it is OK to do it if they are only 24 weeks old in \ntheir life.\n  So I think it is necessary to read these stories. I do not know \nwhether I will be able to read them all tonight because I find it very \ndifficult to read them. I have been very lucky as a father of three \nchildren that we did not have any ``fetal abnormalities'' with our \nchildren. My wife Karen had three healthy pregnancies and is having \nanother healthy pregnancy to date.\n  But I cannot help but hear these stories and feel such great empathy, \nas a father, who stood there in the birthing room, in the delivery \nroom, and just waited, with incredible anticipation, for that child to \nbe born, and encouraging my wife, and seeing that little baby, and \nwondering how that little baby is. ``Please cry. Please take that first \nbreath.'' Jeannie and William and Teresa, Whitney and Bruce, Margaret, \nthe people who wrote these letters, knowing that they were delivering a \nbaby, that once it took its first breath, how difficult that breath \nwould be and how many breaths will they be able to take, and how to \ndeal with them.\n  The first story is of William and Teresa Heineman of Rockville, MD. I \nwill read their story as they dictated it.\n\n       We have noted with concern statements made by several \n     couples suggesting, from their very personal and very tragic \n     experiences, that the partial birth abortion is the only \n     procedure available to a women when the child she is carrying \n     is diagnosed with a severe abnormality.\n       We have had experiences that were very similar and yet so \n     very different. We have had three children biologically and \n     have adopted three more. Two of our children were born with a \n     genetic abnormality--5-p Trisomy. One also had hydrocephalus. \n     The medical prognosis for these children was that they would \n     have at best a short life with minimal development. Some \n     medical professionals recommended abortion; others were ready \n     to help support their lives. We chose life. That decision \n     carried some hardships. However, God blessed us immeasurably \n     through their short lives.\n       Our first child, Elizabeth, was diagnosed after her birth. \n     We were deeply saddened but desired to give her the best life \n     we could. Though she never could say a word and could not sit \n     up on her own, she clearly knew us. she learned to smile, \n     laugh, and clap her hands. She was a joy to us for two and \n     one half years. We clearly saw how many lives she had touched \n     with over 200 people attended her Memorial Mass! One child \n     was touched in a very personal way when he received \n     Elizabeth's donated liver. Two others received sight through \n     her eyes.\n       Our third child, Mary Ann, had been diagnosed with \n     hydrocephalus in utero and shortly after birth with the same \n     genetic abnormality that our oldest daughter had. (We could \n     have known this during pregnancy via amniocentesis, but \n     refused the procedure due to the risk to the baby.) Terry's \n     obstetrician said that we were fortunate, though, that Mary \n     Ann would have the chance to go home with us. We learned to \n     feed her through a gavage tube as she was unable to suck to \n     receive nourishment. Our son, Andrew, developed a special \n     bond with his sister. We spent the next five months as a \n     family, learning, growing and caring for our children. When \n     our precious daughter died, we celebrated her life at a \n     memorial Mass with family and friends.\n       Our belief in Jesus Christ and His gift of salvation \n     provided comfort for us as our daughters entered their new \n     home in heaven. They remain a part of our family and are \n     always in our hearts. They enriched our lives and touched the \n     lives of many others. Our Creator sent these children to us \n     and we were privileged to love and care for them. What a \n     tremendous loss to all of us who know them to terminate their \n     lives because they were not physically perfect. We look \n     forward to a joyous reunion with them in heaven.\n       It is so easy to see the half of the glass that is empty \n     when we face difficult problems; will we have the courage to \n     allow our children to have the half of the glass that is \n     full? We pray for other mothers and fathers who are faced \n     with agonizing decisions that they will remain open to the \n     gift being entrusted to them. God's love is ever-present \n     during our times of joy and sadness. He is with us now as \n     well are parents to Andrew, now nine years old, and three \n     children: Maria, Christina, and Joseph; ages 11, 9, and 7, \n     who joined our family through adoption.\n\n  Again, this is a story about children who die as a result of the \nfetal abnormalities that some would suggest are medically necessary to \nsave the life of the mother or health of the mother.\n  I think what Terry Heineman and Bill Heineman said is that not only \nis it not necessary to do this procedure to preserve the health of the \nmother, but I think it says something about how we value life in this \ncountry. It is a very disturbing thing, indeed.\n  Whitney and Bruce Goin from Orlando, FL:\n\n       On March 20, 1995 my husband and I found out that we were \n     expecting a precious baby. The discovery was an incredible \n     surprise. We were not trying to become pregnant, but knowing \n     that the Lord's plan for our lives\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n     was being carried out, we were overjoyed, a little \n     overwhelmed, but completely thrilled. I began my prenatal \n     vitamins immediately and followed all known guidelines to \n     protect my unborn child.\n       Three months later, on June 18, I had an uneasy feeling, \n     nothing that I felt physically, just an anxious, strange \n     feeling. I called my obstetrician and requested a fetal heart \n     check. They dismissed my concern as the first-time-mother \n     jitters but agreed to let me come into the office. unable to \n     find a heart beat, the nurse sent me down the hall for a \n     sonogram to reassure me that there were no problems. This \n     would be my first sonogram where I would actually be able to \n     see the baby. I was five months pregnant.\n       The nurse began pointing out our baby's toes and feet, and \n     when the baby kicked I smiled, believing that everything was \n     alright. Then, the nurse suddenly stopped answering my \n     questions and began taking a series of pictures and placed a \n     videotape into the recorder. Unaware of what a normal \n     sonogram projects, I did not decipher the enormous abdominal \n     wall defect that my child would be born with four months \n     later.\n       My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother \n     arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely \n     deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other \n     defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He \n     went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect \n     are often stillborn, live very shortly or could survive with \n     extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence \n     of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The \n     complications and associated problems that a surgical baby in \n     this condition could suffer include but are not limited to: \n     bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, \n     diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular \n     malformations, etc.\n       I describe my situation in such detail in hopes that you \n     can understand our initial feelings of despair and \n     hopelessness, for it is after this heartbreaking description \n     that the doctor presented us with the choice of a late-term \n     abortion. My fear is that under this emotional strain many \n     parents do and will continue to choose this option that can \n     be so easily taken as a means of sparing themselves and their \n     child from the pain that lies ahead. With our total faith in \n     the Lord, we chose uncertainty, wanting to give us as much \n     life as we could possibly give to our baby.\n       On October 26, 1995, the doctors decided that, although a \n     month early, our baby's chance of survival became greater \n     outside the womb than inside, due to a drop in amniotic \n     fluid. At 7:53 am, by cesarean section, Andrew Hewitt Goin \n     was born. The most wonderful sound that I have ever heard was \n     his faint squeal of joy for being brought into the world. Two \n     hours after being born he underwent his first of three major \n     operations.\n       For two weeks Andrew lay still, incoherent from drugs, with \n     his stomach, liver, spleen and small and large intestines \n     exposed. He was given drugs that kept him paralyzed, still \n     able to feel pain but unable to move. Andrew had IV's in his \n     head, arms and feet. He was kept alive on a respirator for \n     six weeks, unable to breathe on his own. He had tubes in his \n     nose and throat to continually suction his stomach and lungs. \n     Andrew's liver was lacerated and bled. He received eight \n     blood transfusions and suffered a brain hemorrhage. Andrew's \n     heart was pulled to the right side of his body. He contracted \n     a series of blood infections and developed hypothyroidism. \n     Andrew's liver was severely diseased, and he received \n     intrusive biopsies to find the cause. The enormous pressure \n     of the organs being replaced slowly into his body caused \n     chronic lung disease for which he received extensive oxygen \n     and steroid treatments as he overcame a physical addiction to \n     the numerous pain killers he was given.\n       The pain and suffering was unbearable to watch, but the \n     courage and strength of our child was a miraculous sight. We \n     were fortunate. The worst case scenarios that were painted by \n     the doctors did not come to fruition, and we are thankful \n     that our son was allowed the opportunity to fight. His will \n     to live overcame all obstacles, and, now, we are blessed by \n     his presence in our lives each and every minute. Our deepest \n     respect and prayers go out to the courageous parents who knew \n     that their baby would not survive and yet chose to love them \n     on earth as long as God allowed and intended for them to be.\n\n  This is an issue that goes beyond abortion. This is an issue that \ngoes beyond a medical procedure. This is an issue about what we view as \nlife, as good enough life, to be born or to live. To use as a reason \nfor allowing this procedure to continue, fetal abnormality, so badly \nmisses the mark, sends a message to the women of this country, families \nof this country who are listening, who are having to deal with this \nissue today, right now the President of the United States said because \nof fetal abnormality these women should have abortions, it is a good \nreason to have an abortion, this kind of a partial-birth abortion.\n  What these women are saying is that we do not need to do that to \nprotect our health and that there is an alternative out there, and that \nthe message from the President of hopelessness for their situation is, \nas Mrs. French said, wrong. There may be no hope for an encephalitic \nchild to survive long, hours if that, but that does not mean that the \nsituation is as hopeless as you have heard from these letters.\n  We have an obligation here in the U.S. Senate when we vote on an \nissue to look at every aspect of that issue, particularly one of this \nimportance and consequence, to look at every aspect of that issue and \nto weigh all the facts and to weigh the message that we send out when \nwe do something--not only the direct consequences. The direct \nconsequences are clear: Thousands of children, of babies that are 20 \nweeks and later, will be allowed to be partially delivered, feet first, \nthe entire body delivered except for the head, and will be allowed to \nbe killed--that far, inches away from its first breath.\n  We know that. That is a fact. That will happen if this bill is not \npassed here by the Senate over the President's objection. That is what \nwe sort of focused on. We focused on, rightfully, the horror of that \nprocedure being given a legal imprimatur by the U.S. Senate and by the \nPresident of the United States of America. That is a tough one for many \nof us to swallow. It is a tough one for many Americans to swallow. But \nthere is more, and I think the stories of these women and the children \ninvolved is another element to this story. I think I am going to save \nthese last couple of letters for tomorrow to read because I don't want \nto be repetitive tomorrow.\n\n  My colleagues, many of whom are otherwise involved right now with \nmeetings and receptions and other kinds of things here on Capitol Hill, \nI just hope that at some point tomorrow when we are debating this, \ntheir television sets are turned on, or they happen to be on the floor, \nand that they understand this is not just an issue--although it is an \nissue--of a medical procedure being performed. This is a horrific \nprocedure. It is not just an abortion, it is infanticide. It is \ninfanticide. It is killing a baby. If you can accept that, I guess the \nargument that we are also making a decision on regarding the quality of \nlife in America sort of pales in comparison, maybe--I don't know. But \nif you are troubled by that, if it causes you to think again, with all \nthe new information that has been provided over the past several months \nand weeks, if it bothers you enough to rethink, then also think about \nthat message that we are sending to the less-than-perfect children of \nAmerica and the mothers who are, right now, dealing with the \npossibility of delivering an abnormal baby.\n  My wife is due in March. We haven't had a sonogram done. We are \nhopeful that everything is fine. What message would it send to me, in \nlooking at that sonogram in a week or two, if they say that if that \nchild just isn't what you want, if that baby of 20-some weeks is just \nnot what you bargained for, you have our permission to go through this \nprocedure. In fact, it is your right to do so. I don't think we want to \nsend that out. As Dr. Dowling said, I don't think that's a glimpse of \nthe best in humanity. I don't think that is a moment that many of the \nretiring Senators here want to look back and say, ``That was one of my \nlast actions here in the U.S. Senate.'' I don't think we as Americans \nwant our legislative bodies to say those things--that infanticide is \nOK, as long as the mother and the doctor agree that it is OK. And the \nchildren who just are not what we wanted them to be is a justification \nfor terminating a pregnancy of a viable baby.\n  But let's make no mistake about this; that is what we are saying if \nwe do not override the President's veto. That will be the message to \nAmerica, to the world, to children who have been so afflicted, and to \nmothers and fathers who have to make that decision. I think we are \nbetter than that.\n  As Hank Brown, the Senator from Colorado, came down here and talked \nabout his position on abortion, which is pro-choice, he said that this \nis the proper place to draw the line. That is all we are asking. Are \nthere no more lines in this country?\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I remember the original debate on this \nissue when the Senator from California talked about the very few \nnumbers of\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nprocedures and insisted that medical personnel--doctors--were solidly \nin favor of allowing these things to continue. I ask the Senator if he \nhas seen the article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal a few \ndays ago, where a group of doctors said it is time to stop listening to \nthe politicians, stop listening to the special interest groups, and let \nthe doctors speak. And they then said, ``We know the vast majority of \nthese procedures are done for elective purposes only and that the \nhealth of the mother is, in fact, never in danger.''\n\n  I ask the Senator if he is familiar with that presentation and if my \nmemory of it is correct?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator's memory is accurate. I, in fact, discussed \nthat article yesterday on the floor and entered it into the Record for \nanyone who would like to see it, as well as other articles from \nphysicians concerning this. Yesterday, a columnist, Richard Cohen--who \nis pro-choice and liberal, and who wrote an article a year ago \nsupporting partial-birth abortions--wrote an article saying he was \nwrong, that what he was told by the pro-choice establishment here in \nWashington, the special interest establishment, was incorrect. He did \nnot say this, but I will say it for him. They lied to him, or they \ndeliberately misled him, based on an incomplete presentation of the \nfacts. But in either case, he did not have all the information. He \nadmits that he still doesn't have all the information as to how many of \nthese procedures are done and when they are done. But what we do know \nis that that argument by Members who oppose this bill, who want to \ncontinue this procedure to be legal, no longer exists.\n  Those who stood and said, well, this is a very rare procedure that is \nonly used to protect the life of the mother--I can refer you to speaker \nafter speaker in the Congressional Record of last week in the House who \ndefended this procedure, who got up and said, ``But, Mr. Speaker, we \nhave to do this to protect the life of the mother.''\n  Well, we have all sorts of medical testimony that that is not the \ncase, No. 1. No. 2, even if it were the case, the bill provides an \nexception for the life of the mother.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, that was going to be my next question of \nthe Senator. It is my understanding that the bill says that in those \ncircumstances where the life of the mother is in danger, the \nprohibitions of the bill would not apply.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is also my understanding that according to the \nmedical information the health of the mother might in fact be in danger \nby this process.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is testimony that I entered in the Record \nyesterday--and I know Senator Smith has entered into the Record \npreviously, and we will do so again tomorrow--that provides ample \ntestimony of how this procedure is in fact more dangerous than the \nalternatives, including and particularly delivering the baby at term \nthrough either a vaginal delivery or cesarean section. The Senator from \nColorado again reminded everyone--who is pro-choice and talked about a \nphysician in Boulder, CO, who performs late-term abortions--saying that \nthis procedure is more dangerous than other abortion techniques used at \nthat stage.\n  So even if you are for, as I am, the belief that it is important that \nthese mothers have that--we respect all life, even those who are less \nthan perfect, and give them every opportunity to live--even if you do \nnot believe in that, even if you believe that a child that has a fetal \nabnormality at 35 weeks, premature 5 weeks, should be allowed to be \nkilled before it is born, even though you can deliver the baby without \nany additional health risks, if you waited 5 weeks, even if you believe \nthat could happen, according to the Senator from Colorado, that is a \nstill a more dangerous procedure.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will not prolong the conversation. I thank the Senator \nfor yielding for these questions.\n  I make this comment. My personal position on abortion is under the \npro-life banner. I am one who would be willing to consider an abortion \nin a circumstance where the pregnancy came about as a result of a rape \nor incest-- which is really nothing more than another form of rape--or \nwhere the life of the mother is in fact in jeopardy by virtue of the \npregnancy. I was, therefore, somewhat troubled with the initial debate \nby those who kept insisting that the sole justification for this \nprocedure was because the life of the mother was at risk, and I worried \nabout Congress micromanaging medical procedures. But I have come \ncompletely to the conclusion that we did the right thing in passing the \nbill in the first place. I voted for it.\n  I intend to vote for the override, and I am heartened by the comment \nof my friend from New York, who is known for his independence, who is a \npro-choice Senator on this issue but who summarized I think better than \nany of us can in a single sentence when he said, ``For me, this comes \ntoo close to infanticide.'' Infanticide, for whatever purpose, is not \nsomething with which I wish to be associated.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania on his leadership on \nthis issue. I congratulate him for his compassion. I congratulate him \nfor the depth of his commitments to an issue that I think should touch \nthe hearts of all Americans. I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Utah. If I can, I would like \nto deflect the praise, frankly, that in every respect should be \ndeflected to the Senator who is sitting in the chair, the Presiding \nOfficer, who in spite of calls against him of being an extremist, and, \nin spite of--as this issue was just beginning to rise in the political \narena--being cast in an extreme pro-life position because, as the \nSenator from Utah, there is a lot of misinformation out there when this \nprocedure was originally considered and even more misinformation when \nthe Senator from New Hampshire introduced the bill to outlaw \nthis procedure. But Senator Smith, to his credit, got all of the \ninformation, studied it, and presented a bill that was reasonable, \nmainstream--not by definition when you have 70 percent to 80 percent of \nthe people in this country saying this procedure should not be legal--\nit is not extreme to agree with them. You can say a lot of things. But \nwhen you are with 80 percent of the American public you are not an \nextremist by definition. Yet, I guarantee that you will hear Member \nafter Member--I do not know how many Members will actually come up and \nspeak against the override, but those that do will come up and will \ncharge the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe Senator from Utah, and other Senators with extremism for supporting \nthis bill.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I might be allowed, I thank the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for his correction about the leadership of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. I agree that is where the credit goes. \nI say to the people of New Hampshire that Pat Moynihan is not generally \nthought of as a right-wing extremist, and to have him join the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire in this circumstance should provide sufficient cover \nfor anyone who thinks the issue through.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Utah is absolutely correct. I just \nhave to finish my comment on the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire took this issue when no one else would \ntake it. The Senator from New Hampshire stood on the floor of the \nSenate and carried the debate the last time in spite of enormous \ncriticism for doing so. The Senator from Pennsylvania is a Johnny-come-\nlately to this issue, admittedly. I was not aware of this issue until \nthe Senator from New Hampshire was standing on the floor debating one \nday. I became aware of it, and couldn't believe that we were actually \ndebating something like this on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Are you \nserious? This actually happens in this country? I will never forget \nlistening to him and listening to the volleys that were lobbed at him \nand listening to him trying to stand up and present the facts although \nthey were continually obfuscated by the other side. He stood tall, and \nhe can stand tall because he is a tall guy. But he stood tall, and we \nwere able to get this bill through.\n  So now we are back. But I can tell you, as I said earlier, I had \nnever wanted to debate the issue of abortion on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, or in the House when I was there. The Senator from New \nHampshire out of courage of\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nhis conviction stands up and says we believe. I saw him that day going \ntoe to toe with the opponents of this legislation. I said to myself \n``Where were you? Where were you when they needed to count the people \nto stand up for what you believe in?\n  So I came down to the floor for a few minutes. And the Senator was on \nthe floor for hours. I was on the floor, in comparison, for a second, \nbut entered into the debate for the first time. And I want to say to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire that the inspiration that he showed is \nthe reason I am here today, and the reason we are all here today is we \nwon a tough battle. People now are thinking, ``Well, 75 or 80 percent \nof the American public''--in fact then it was 75 to 80 percent. They \nhad no idea. And there was a lot of misinformation out there that has \nnow been clarified by thankfully a lot of obstetricians coming \nforward--hundreds of them coming forward--saying that we need to do \nthis. The only people who are coming forward saying that this procedure \nis an acceptable medical procedure are those performing the procedure. \nNo one else is. Some are saying we should allow this to continue \nbecause doctors should be able to do what they want to do; that we \nshould not limit doctors' choices and women's choices. That is not the \nsame as saying that this procedure is a healthy, good procedure; that \nthey would do it, because they are not doing it and they wouldn't do \nit. And the Senator from New Hampshire stood up here and made the case. \nUnfortunately, by the skin of our teeth, we won here in U.S. Senate. I \nsay ``unfortunately.'' We should have won by more, if people had had \nall of the information that they have today. We found that out over the \nlast several months.\n\n  I am hopeful that Republicans and Democrats alike who voted against \nthis legislation will examine the facts. I am not even going to ask you \nto examine your conscience or examine your morals. Make that decision \noutside of that, although I hope you would not.\n  Examine the facts as we now know them, not as given to us by the \nadvocates of abortion, the National Abortion Federation or Planned \nParenthood, but of doctors who are out there performing these \nprocedures, of reporters, physicians, in some cases, who have done \ninvestigative reporting to find out what is going on out there--not \nwhat they tell us but what actually is going on.\n  Now, you cannot hide behind what people who agree with you on this \nissue would like to have you believe. You have to face facts that this \nis not a rare procedure done to protect the lives and health of women. \nAnyone who stands up in this Chamber and says that this is a rare \nprocedure done to protect the lives and health of women is not stating \nthe facts. The facts counter that, are absolutely opposite to it.\n  So let us have a debate about the facts. Let us not have a debate \nabout the right to choose. This is not about the right to choose. \nWhether I like it or not, and, frankly, admittedly, I do not like it, \nlate-term abortions will continue to be performed if this procedure is \noutlawed. And they have been described. We can enter into the Record \nall the varieties of other abortion procedures that can be done. So do \nnot argue the right to choose. Do not argue it is a decision between \nthe doctor and the patient, because the doctor and the patient have \nplenty of alternatives.\n  This is an issue about what 100 Senators believe is the line in this \ncountry. Where is that line? Or do we not have a line anymore? Have we \ngotten to the point in our culture that any drawing of lines is \noffensive to us, any determination of what is right and what is wrong \nis for every individual to make a choice, that there is no right and \nwrong anymore, it is just whatever you decide to do is OK, no matter \nwho it affects and how it affects them.\n  I do not think that any Member of this Chamber believes there are no \nrights and wrongs and that there are no limits to what any individual \ncan do to themselves or to somebody else. But you cannot hide from the \nfact that that is exactly what we are talking about here. We are \ntalking about right and wrong. We are talking about how far we are \ngoing to let people go to infringe on the rights of others even if \nthose others are less than perfect, are fetally abnormal.\n  I hope we would stand up for those children, the lesser as some would \nsuggest, lesser children. I would suggest--and the women more \nimportantly, the women whose letters I read earlier would suggest--that \nthey are not lesser, not by any stretch of the imagination are they \nlesser. They are important members of the human family and they make a \nsignificant contribution. I bet you could ask some of those mothers and \nthey would tell you that the child who lived 2 months made more \ncontributions to them and to their community than people who lived \nthere for 30 years.\n  I remember we in my generation always like to say when it comes to \nour children it is not the quantity of time, it is the quality of time \nyou spend with your kids. How many times do you hear that? I wish that \nwere true, but it is both. But certainly quality of time is important. \nAre we going to say that because their quantity of time is not going to \nbe such for our standards, that their quality of life is not normal by \nour standards, that they are expendable by the most brutal procedure I \nthink any of us have ever heard?\n  Oh, I have faith in the Senate. I have faith that, as I look at these \nempty chairs--and most of them are empty, all but the Senator from \nIowa--I look at those chairs, and I can see in those chairs every \nSenator sitting there as they will be tomorrow, or standing down in the \nwell, and they will have to be making a decision that they have to come \nto terms with what is right and wrong, about what comes up to the line \nand what crosses the line. I believe that enough Senators will look \ninside and see that this calls for a moment to look at what the best of \nour humanity is about, not the worst, and they will do the right thing. \nI will pray for that tonight. I hope you will, too.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania for all the \ntime he has devoted to this issue and how he causes everyone in this \nbody and throughout America to think of the importance of this issue. I \nalso compliment the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New Hampshire, \nfor his leadership and his work as well.\n  I agree with everything the Senator from Pennsylvania has said. I am \ngoing to speak tomorrow on this issue during final debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11278-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11285-S11286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1237, the Child Pornography Prevention Act, introduced by Senator \nHatch. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this very important \npiece of legislation, which would close loopholes in the current child \npornography statutes created by computer technology. Now, due to the \nmarvels of modern technology, child pornographers can use computers to \ncreate synthetic child pornography which is so realistic and life-like \nthat no expert can distinguish it from traditional kiddie porn. S. 1237 \nwould close that gap.\n  But the bill has not come up for a vote yet, even though the bill was \nput on the calendar over a month ago. Why is that? Why has not the \nSenate moved to pass this legislation quickly and send it to the House \nas the 104th Congress comes to an end?\n  The reason, Mr. President, is that some Senators from the other side \nof the aisle will not let the bill come up for a vote because they \noppose stiff new mandatory penalties for child pornographers.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, I offered an amendment which would create \na three-strikes-and-you're-out penalty structure for the production of \nchild pornography. First time offenders will receive a 10-year minimum \nsentence. For a second offense, there would be a 15-year minimum \nsentence, and for a third offense, there would be a minimum sentence of \n30 years to life. My amendment passed the committee after much debate.\n  But now, some Senators from the other side of the aisle are using \nsenatorial privilege in order to have my amendment stripped out of the \nbill without ever having a vote on the matter. These Senators are \nliterally holding the Senate hostage. In contrast,\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nSenators on my side of the aisle have informally offered to have \nanother vote on this issue. But to no avail.\n  Mr. President, this is outrageous. I believe that the American people \nwant tougher penalties for child molesters and child pornographers. And \nI am proud to have taken a leadership role on the issue. To the \nDemocrat Senators who oppose minimum sentences for child pornographers, \nI say let's have a vote. Secret tricks like holds should not be used to \ndrop the bottom out of the penalties for child pornographers.\n  I think that this is shameful, Mr. President. And I believe that the \nAmerican people have a right to know why the Child Pornography \nPrevention Act is bottled up on the Senate floor. The roadblock to \npassage of this vitally important bill with tougher child pornography \npenalties is not the Republican caucus. It is not my side of the aisle \nwhich is blocking this bill trying to lower the penalties for child \npornographers.\n  If the bill does not pass this year, the fault will rest squarely on \nthe shoulders of the other side of the aisle.\n  I remain ready to vote on this matter. I encourage my friends on the \nother side of the aisle to come out and debate minimum sentences for \nchild pornographers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11285-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11286-S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think the leadership of the Armed \nServices Committee deserves a lot of credit for wrapping up the \nconference on the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill in record \ntime.\n  This measure was ready before the August recess. We just could not \nget to it because of other pending business.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Nunn, have done an outstanding job.\n  They resolved a number of very complicated and difficult issues, and \nthey did it in a very timely and business-like way.\n  I would also like to thank the committee for protecting my \namendments:\n  Section 217 that establishes a 1991 baseline for the independent cost \nestimate for the F-22 fighter; and\n  Section 809 that places a $250,000 per year cap on executive \ncompensation.\n  However, I am very unhappy with one part of the final bill--section \n405.\n  I am very disappointed to see this provision in the final bill.\n  Section 405 authorizes an increase in the number of general officers \non active duty in the Marine Corps.\n  It raises the current ceiling from 68 to 80 generals.\n  That is an increase of 12 generals.\n  I attempted to block this measure but failed. My amendment was \ndefeated by a vote of 79 to 21.\n  The House had rejected it earlier but could not prevail in \nconference.\n  So we lost the fight.\n  The Marine Commandant, General Krulak, visited me in late July and \nhelped to soften some of my objections.\n  For example, he assured me that the 12 new generals will be assigned \nto warfighting billets. That is good.\n  He promised me that the new generals will not fill mushrooming \nheadquarters billets.\n  Those are the billets that Marine General Sheehan is so worried \nabout.\n  But General Krulak's guarantees do not overcome my basic objection to \nthe idea of adding brass at the top when the military is downsizing.\n  From that standpoint, section 405 of the bill defies understanding.\n  With 80 generals on board, the Marine Corps will have more generals \nthan it had at the height of World War II when the Marine Corps was \nthree times as big as it is today.\n  The Marine Corps is critically short of platoon sergeants. That is \nwhere we should add money--not for generals.\n  The Marine Corps is already topheavy with brass.\n  That came through loud and clear during Operation Restore Hope in \nSomalia, according to Col. David Hackworth.\n  Colonel Hackworth's thoughts are presented in his new book entitled:\n  Hazardous Duty: America's Most Decorated Living Soldier Reports From \nthe Front and Tells It the Way It Is.''\n  Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Johnson was in charge of Operation Restore \nHope in late 1992.\n  He had 12 rifle companies under his command or about 1,200 fighters.\n  But as Colonel Hackworth points out, General Johnson's headquarters \nstrength was 1,141.\n  So General Johnson's headquarters staff almost outnumbered the \nfighters.\n  In all, he said, there were 12 American generals in Somalia, one for \nevery rifle company.\n  A rifle company is commanded by a captain, and a captain does not \nneed a bunch of generals giving him orders.\n  All he needs is one good colonel.\n  Colonel Hackworth concludes with this thought: ``Never had so few \nbeen commanded by quite so many.''\n  So why does a shirinking Marine Corps need more generals? The Marine \nCorps already has too many generals commanding troops in the field. \nSomalia proved that point. They aren't needed for combat. They are \nneeded for bureaucratic infighting in the Pentagon budget wars.\n  The Committee makes that point crystal clear in its report. I quote: \n``The increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to have greater \nrepresentation at the general officer level on the Department of the \nNavy-Secretariat staff and in the joint arena.''\n  The Marines think more generals at the table will mean a bigger slice \nof the pie or a better piece of the action somewhere down the road.\n  That's what this is all about: capturing important bureaucratic real \nestate.\n  Mr. President, in my mind, this is bad public policy. It's going to \nbackfire--big time. Giving in to the Marine Corps's request will not \nlay this issue to rest. This is not the end of it. It's just the \nbeginning.\n  It is an ominous sign of interservice rivaalry that could ignite a \nwar over who can get the most stars.\n  The Army, Navy, and Air Force are now going to complain: The Marines \ngot theirs. Now we want ours.\n  The floodgates are about to open.\n  The Army, Navy, and Air Force are already lining up with their \nrequests for more generals.\n  The Navy went on record in March, saying it has ``331 valid flag \nofficer requirements.''\n  The Navy is authorized to have 220 today. Does this mean the Navy \nneeds another 111 admirals?\n  The Navy is already topheavy with brass, having just about one \nadmiral per ship.\n  The Army and the Air Force are even more topheavy--fatter with brass.\n  Yet both the Army and the Air Force are lobbying Secretary Perry to \nget their requests for more generals approved.\n  Now, while Mr. Perry is doing this, he is also telling the military \nto continue downsizing.\n  Does this make sense, Mr. President? Does it make sense to topsize \nwhen you're downsizing?\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, shed \nsome light on this issue back in 1990 when post-cold-war downsizing \nbegan in earnest.\n  General Powell's thinking on this issue was outlined in an article \nthat appeared in the August 1 issue of the Washington Post.\n  The article was written by Mr. Walter Pincus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this report printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 1996]\n\n             Marines Land Generals Despite Some Opposition\n\n                           (By Walter Pincus)\n\n       The Marines have landed their 12 more generals and despite \n     some opposition appear to have the situation well in hand.\n       House conferees yesterday reached an agreement on the \n     fiscal 1997 defense authorization bill that will allow the \n     Corps to appoint a dozen more generals, enlarging its top \n     tier so that the Marines will have a fair share of \n     representatives in joint commands and be able to fill vacant \n     positions.\n       If the conference report passes both houses and is signed \n     by President Clinton, the Marines will be entitled to raise \n     the number of active duty generals from 68 to 80. That would \n     give the 174,000-member Corps, one more general than it had \n     in June 1945 when the force was 475,000 strong, according to \n     Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery (D-Miss.), who opposed the \n     increase.\n       Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who led the opposition \n     in the Senate, said yesterday he was ``very disappointed and \n     frustrated'' by the House conferees' action. He said he had \n     hoped the increase could have been held off pending a study \n     ``based on recent downsizing in the rank and file.''\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\n       But the Marines have insisted that the increase is \n     warranted. ``We don't ask for something unless it is truly \n     needed,'' Marine Commandant Gen. Charles C. Krulak said in a \n     letter to Grassley.\n       The Iowa Republican warned that other services will now be \n     encouraged to request more admirals and generals, despite the \n     military drawdown. ``This is just a small snowball rolling \n     down a hill that is going to expand very rapidly the number \n     of brass in all services,'' he said.\n       Last March, Adm. Frank L. Bowman, chief of naval personnel, \n     told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``I am convinced \n     the Navy needs 25 to 30 more flag officers in order to have a \n     manageable number of people to assign without having to rely \n     on gapped billets or filling flag officer billets with senior \n     captains.''\n       Yesterday, Capt. Jim Kudla, spokesman for Bowman, said the \n     Navy proposal ``is not yet out of the hopper,'' but added \n     that a number is under study in the office of Navy Secretary \n     John H. Dalton.\n       The Navy, which this year has 428,000 officers and enlisted \n     personnel, currently is authorized to have 216 flag officers \n     plus four more allowed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is \n     down from a total force of 535,000 in 1990 when it had 256 \n     admirals.\n       Under current plans, Navy personnel will go down to 395,000 \n     by late 1998 and level off there. Nonetheless, according to \n     Bowman, the Navy's increase in admirals is justified because \n     ``I believe we went too far in flag officer reductions in the \n     Navy. We are feeling the pinch.''\n       In 1990, then-Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney and his \n     chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, \n     agreed that as they reduced overall service levels, they \n     would as a ``matter of good faith'' look at cutting generals \n     and flag officers ``proportional to the reductions in base \n     forces,'' a former senior Powell aide said yesterday.\n       Since the main forces were being reduced by 25 percent, \n     Cheney and Powell looked at cutting the number of generals \n     and admirals by at least 20 percent. Powell argued that the \n     military services were like a pyramid. ``You can't just cut \n     at the bottom,'' the former aide said in describing Powell's \n     position. ``You have to take some off at every level so it \n     still had the proper shape to it.''\n       Powell regularly met with other members of the Joint Chiefs \n     to have them ``pledge their commitment'' to the cuts which, \n     the former aide said, ``were painful.'' Those chiefs have now \n     retired and the services, starting with the Marines, have \n     begun to relieve the pain, the aide added.\n       The issue has led to some tough back-room politicking while \n     House and Senate conferees worked out their differences.\n       Recently, House and Senate aides said they had been told by \n     Pentagon sources that Arnold L. Punaro, minority staff \n     director of the Armed Services panel, aide to Sen. Sam Nunn \n     (D-Ga.) for 23 years and a Marine Corps Reserve brigadier \n     general, had masterminded the move. The sources, from other \n     services, alleged that Punaro was preparing a billet for \n     himself for next year after Nunn retires from the Senate.\n       Punaro, who had heard the rumor, reacted sharply to it.\n       ``The new active-duty Marine Corps general officer \n     positions have nothing whatsoever to do with my future,'' he \n     said. ``I will remain a civilian when I leave my current \n     position with the Senate Armed Services Committee.''\n       Committee sources said Punaro stayed out of the issue other \n     than to sit in on briefings by Krulak in Nunn's office.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will quote from the article:\n\n       As a matter of good faith, General Powell reportedly said, \n     ``you have to look at cutting generals and flag officers \n     proportional to the reductions in base forces.''\n\n  General Powell said the military services were organized like a \npyramid. He said, ``you can't just cut at the bottom. You have to take \nsome off at every level so it still has the proper shape to it.''\n  Mr. President, that is Colin Powell talking, and he should know \nsomething about how the military is supposed to be organized. Colin \nPowell says we should reduce the number of generals when the force \nstructure is shrinking.\n  So why are we adding brass at the top when the force is getting \nsmaller? Someone needs to provide an honest answer to that question. I \nhave not heard one yet.\n  If we keep adding at the top and cutting at the bottom, pretty soon \nthe military pyramid will lose its shape. We will have an upside-down \npyramid.\n  Congress must not allow its decisions to be driven by interservice \nrivalry. There has to be a better way to determine the right number of \ngenerals.\n  On July 19, I wrote to the President, asking him to intervene in this \nmatter. He is our Commander in Chief and needs to take charge and show \nsome leadership.\n  I asked him to delay this decision until an independent review is \nconducted to determine how many general officer positions are needed, \nbased on real military requirements. I have never received a response.\n  I am afraid he's been steamrollered by the generals, just like the \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11286-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11287-S11288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a few steps from this Capitol Building \nis a combat zone. In just a few blocks from here lies the killing \nground that is one of the consequences of the illegal drug trade in \nthis country. On average, over 400 people in Washington are murdered \nevery year. That is roughly 60 lives lost per 100,000 population. The \nnational average is 6 per 100,000. That makes Washington the Nation's \nmurder capital. Those casualties, the lives lost and maimed, occur in \njust a few neighborhoods. They are not spread out over the whole city. \nMuch of this carnage is directly the result of drugs and the harm that \nthey cause, a harm that falls disproportionately on a few \nneighborhoods.\n  Now, virtually every ounce of illegal drug you can buy within a \nstone's throw of here--and that is just about any drug you could want \nin any quantity you care to buy--is produced overseas. It is imported \ninto this country. Washington is not on the border with Mexico. We \ndon't grow poppies in ward 6 or coca in Anacostia. These drugs find \ntheir way here in commercial cargo, in motor homes, in peoples' \nstomachs. They fly, walk, drive, and float into this country every day \nin a thousand ways. That availability is killing us. But the story does \nnot stop here.\n  The criminal thugs that bring drugs into this country are not \nphilanthropists. They are in the business to make money. And lots of \nit. That's why they come to the world's largest emporium. And they do \nwell. But that leaves them with the problem of what to do with all the \nloot: how to turn all that dirty money into nice, clean cash. To do \nthis, they exploit our banks and business. They smuggle cash out in \nbulk. They use our electronic highways.\n  As the Center for Technology Assessment noted last year, our \n``Financial institutions and their wire transfer systems provide the \nbattleground to control money laundering.'' Criminal gangs employ a \nthousand techniques that fertile imaginations--the best that money can \nbuy--can devise. They do all of this in defiance of our laws, in \nvicious contempt for common decency. And when these sorry riches find \ntheir way into secure havens, they are then used to corrupt and \nintimidate individuals, institutions, and whole governments. The \nvicious cycle is complete and begins again.\n  These criminal gangs, to push their drugs and launder their millions, \nmake use of the very same systems that are the sources of our \nprosperity. They smuggle drugs in and they sneak the cash out. They \nexploit our financial processes and our commercial mechanisms to do \nthis. We must not permit this to happen. There in lies our dilemma.\n  On the one hand, we must decide on those policies and practices that \nwill most effectively facilitate our trade and finance. We must do this \nin order to sustain our continued prosperity and competitiveness. On \nthe other hand, we must decide how best to discourage the criminal \nexploitation of our financial systems and our commercial arrangements. \nThis clash of interests is no easy problem to deal with, but deal with \nit we must.\n  Unfortunately, this country has a major drug problem. As it is in \nvirtually every other area of economic activity, the United States is \nthe world's largest market for illegal drugs. Americans have more money \nand more time than do many other people. This means that every \nentrepreneur in the world is out to make it big in the U.S. market. \nSome of the most skilled, intelligent, and ruthless of these \nentrepreneurs are drug traffickers.\n  We are not dealing here with mom-and-pop operations. We are dealing \nwith well-financed, international business enterprises with a global \nreach. They are sophisticated and dangerous. Let there be no mistake, \nthe criminal organizations that traffic in drugs or other illegal goods \nare among the most significant threats to our well-being that we \ncurrently face.\n  The major international criminal organizations--based in Asia, \nEurope, Africa, and Latin America--now dispose\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nof economic resources that enable them to defy local and international \nlaw. They are richer than many countries. They are ruthless, and they \nare remorseless. Either through a process of threat and intimidation or \nby bribery and financial manipulation, they are able to challenge the \nauthority of governments. They are able to undermine the integrity of \npublic and private institutions. Where they cannot suborn they subvert. \nWhere they cannot corrupt they kill.\n  The rollcall of countries currently facing direct and serious \nchallenges from these groups is disturbing. Today criminal gangs in \nRussia, China, Italy, Nigeria, Mexico, and Colombia openly operate or \nhave been able to penetrate into the depths of the political, social, \nand economic systems in those countries. Many smaller countries, \nwithout the range of resources available elsewhere, are simply \novermatched and outmaneuvered in trying to enforce their own \nsovereignty. In some cases, criminal penetration has become so serious \nthat it raises questions about the future stability of the country in \nquestion. There is growing concern about the ability of many \ngovernments, often deeply penetrated by criminal corruption, to respond \nmeaningfully--if at all--to these criminal gangs.\n  In addition, banks and businesses pay out billions of dollars every \nyear, directly or indirectly, to these same criminal gangs. Whether in \nprotection money or in losses suffered from sophisticated scams. \nWhether in extortion or swindles, individual businesses and national \neconomies are routinely ripped off, to the tune of billions of dollars \nannually, by ruthless criminal thugs.\n  The cost of their activities are not paid out just in the crimes that \nthey commit. They also exact a cost in terms of trust. They undermine \ngood faith. When left unchecked, they pervert the very ideas of a free \nmarket. The bleed public establishments of public support. They \nthreaten democratic institutions and the social, political, and \neconomic circumstances that must sustain those institutions. We can see \nthat process at work in Colombia, and Russia, and next door in Mexico. \nBut the problem does not stop here.\n  In this country, these criminal gangs daily kill and maim more \nAmericans than have suffered at the hands of terrorist bombs. They have \ndone more damage to our social fabric and well-being than has any rogue \npolitical leader in Libya or Iran. They have caused more real harm in a \nday than all the illegal videotapes produced in China. Through the \ndrugs that these scoundrels make and sell, they sow havoc in our homes \nand neighborhoods, on our streets, and in our clinics.\n  We must take the steps necessary to ensure that our citizens are \nsecure from harm and that the very processes of our well-being are \nprotected from abuse. We must ensure that the free-trade highway does \nnot become an expressway for drug smuggling. We have to ensure that \nbanking without borders does not become an opportunity for banking \nwithout conscience. But how to do that without smothering legitimate \nactivity? We must devise the means to disrupt criminal enterprise \nwithout destroying free markets. We must ensure effective international \ncooperation and yet work with countries often incapable of taking \neffective action. We must lead, but we cannot succeed without \ncooperation.\n  That is what this hearing is about. We must look at what we are doing \nand what we can do better. We need to consider what works and what does \nnot. We need to cast a critical eye on our actions and those of our \nallies and friends to determine what more we can do. I am concerned \nthat our policies are not up to the task. I am concerned that we have \nput our priorities in the wrong places. Frankly, we have a long way to \ngo and a lot of work ahead of us. More kids are starting to use drugs. \nWe are seeing more calls for legalization. We have dropped the ball on \nfighting back.\n  In the meantime, the criminals are getting richer and more \nsophisticated. As we face 21st century thugs, we need 21st century G-\nmen. We need to be smarter and faster. We need to be focused and \nconsistent. As one Treasury official put it, money laundering is a \n``crime hidden in the details of legitimate commerce.'' The same is \ntrue for smuggling. The devil is in the details. It is the details that \nwe want to get at. It is how to respond effectively to the details of \nthese criminal activities that we must address in our policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11287-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11288-S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE NET EFFECT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Congress is now engaged in the \nbusiness of passing a budget to fund this Government for another year. \nThis process is one of the most important pieces of business that this \nbody engages in. In discussing where and how and for what we spend the \npublic's money on public business in the public interest is one of the \nmost compelling stories of government. I wish that more of our fellow \ncitizens watched the debates on this floor as we argue among ourselves \non their behalf how best to spend their hard earned dollars. It is an \nimportant lesson in civics. It is a course in practical politics, on \nhow real differences on important matters of substance are resolved. It \nis sometimes not an elegant process but it is one of the critical \nfeatures of democratic government.\n  One of the most inelegant parts of the process, is the fact that \nlegislating budgets is not coherent in the sum of its parts. We divide \nour budget consideration into many pieces. It's the only practical way \nto deal with the problem of how to spend money. This means, however, \nthat money and the politics that it is spent on is similarly considered \nin its many parts, not as a whole.\n  Rarely, legislatively, does a program receive strategic or \ncomprehensive consideration that combines all the elements. Doing that \nis typically one of the responsibilities of the executive branch. We \nlook to the administration to present the comprehensive plan, to \nintegrate all the pieces into meaningful policy. It is Congress' role \nto ensure that the net results are what is intended. That the money is \nbuying what it is meant for.\n  We may not always agree with how things are put together, but a \ndialog on our disagreements is how a democracy makes up its mind. This \nprocess, however, does not lend itself to central direction. Congress \nmay, through the oversight process, seek to encourage cohesiveness. It \nmay, through legislation, require strategic thinking. But, while you \ncan lead an administration to water, you cannot necessarily make it \ntake the plunge. You cannot give it coherence. You cannot supply a \nvision that is wanting, a conviction that is simply not there. You \ncannot enforce wisdom. When these are lacking, Congress is not always \nthe best body to provide uniform direction. It is, however, bound to \ntry.\n  That is the situation we face now is so many areas of our \ninternational policy. Things are drifting. There is no coherence, no \nvision. And, sometimes, I wonder about the wisdom behind what passes \nfor policy. This is painfully clear in looking at our drug policy.\n  I have spoken a number of times about the incoherence in our present \nefforts. I have documented, recently, the consequences of these failed \npolicies for drug use in this country. Unless we simply do not expect \nour policies to make any difference. Unless we are committed to the \nidea that we spend the public's money for the heck of it. Unless we \nbelieve that words are meant to substitute for results. Then, we cannot \nlook at our current efforts and the trend in youthful drug use and \nconclude that what we are doing is working.\n  Simply put, the present strategy from this administration on drugs is \na failure. It has been a failure from the beginning. The most recent \neffort at a written strategy, while an admirable attempt by the new \ndrug czar, is thin. It lacks substance. It has no measurable standards \nof performance. It contains little new. It has few measures of success. \nEven more disappointing, the administration has been noticeably \ninvisible on the Hill in defending its own programs. This, also, is not \nnew. Even in the Democratic-controlled Congress, the administration \nlargely left the drug program to fend for itself.\n  This under-supported policy was also the program that the \nadministration took to the public. Its most remembered hallmarks are \n``I didn't inhale'', and the Surgeon General's call for serious \nconsideration of legalization. Hardly substitutes for ``Just Say No.'' \nThe consequences were vanishing interest\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nin serious counter-drug efforts and renewed calls for legalization--\ngiven encouragement by this administration's Surgeon General. The \nresults of that indifference and incoherence are clear for anyone who \nwants to take a look at the recent reporting on youthful drug use in \nthis country over the past 3\\1/2\\ years. The picture is sobering. The \nresults are dramatic increases of drug use among kids. All the recent \nsurveys confirm this. In addition, the forthcoming annual PRIDE survey \nwill add further weight to the body of evidence.\n  In response to this fact, the congressional leadership, led by Bob \nDole, commissioned a joint House-Senate task force last year to do what \nthe administration has not done: develop a coherent view of what needs \nto be done. The task force report, which came out earlier this year, \nprovides us with guidance on where we need to be going with our drug \npolicy. In particular, as Congress now considers the international drug \nbudget in its many parts, the report indicates the direction that we \nneed to be taking to give us more coherence and sense of purpose in our \nefforts.\n  In the absence of meaningful policies from the administration, we \nhave a responsibility to the public to make up for the deficit. As we \nconstruct our separate drug budgets, we must take this need into our \ndeliberations.\n  In essence, our overall drug programs are an effort to build a \nfisherman's net--a web of programs, efforts, and policies that will \ncatch and hold the school of drug problems. We must construct a \nbalanced weave. One without gaping holes. One that is suited to the \ncircumstances of our needs and our capabilities. The budget process is \nour net. It is here that we must ensure that we bring more consistency \nto our deliberations over the various parts of our drug budget to \nensure that the result is more than the sum of its parts.\n  We need to ensure, as we balance the many conflicting needs \nrepresented in our budgets, that our drug program is adequately funded \nin its constituent elements. We must ensure that DOD bears \nresponsibility for doing something more than it has recently in \nsupporting drug operations. We must see that Customs programs along the \nSouthwest border, in Puerto Rico, and in support of interdiction \noperations are adequately supported, after years of neglect. We need to \nrefurbish DEA's international effort. We need to support Coast Guard's \ndrug enforcement mission. We need to provide support to the efforts to \ndevelop a Midwest high intensity drug trafficking area to stem the flow \nof methamphetamine.\n  These things we can do more immediately. In the longer term, we in \nCongress need to exercise more vigorous oversight over present programs \nto ensure that the public is getting a proper return on its investment. \nWe need more accountability. In the next days and weeks, as we work to \ndo the people's business, we must keep in mind our responsibility to \nprovide adequate, consistent support to drug programs. In doing so, we \nhelp to put our drug policy back on track. We engaged a problem that we \ncannot afford to ignore or wish away. In responding, we must consider \nthe net effect. I urge my colleagues to support funding for the \nprograms I have mentioned above as we work on the appropriations bills \nbefore us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported House Joint Resolution 158, a joint resolution \ncommending the Peace Corps and its volunteers for their 35 years of \nservice to America and the world. I was especially pleased that my \ncolleagues on the committee agreed to an amendment to this resolution \noffered by Senator Dodd and myself which honors the memory of Loret \nRuppe, the longest serving director of the Peace Corps. When I became \ndirector of the Peace Corps in 1989, I had the privilege of inheriting \na corps that had been revitalized by Loret Ruppe's great leadership, \nvision, and dedication. Under her direction the Peace Corps began or \nrevived programs in Sri Lanka, Haiti, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, \nEquatorial Guinea, and the Cape Verde Islands and she energized a new \ngeneration to take up the challenge of serving in the corps. Her great \naccomplishments and belief in the Peace Corps won the respect of \nvolunteers and built bipartisan support for the Peace Corps' mission of \npeace through development. I feel that it is especially appropriate \nthat the Members of this great legislative body, so many of whom on \nboth sides of the aisle count themselves as admirers of this great \nwoman, pass this resolution to stand as a testament to her great \nservice to America and to the millions of the world's citizens touched \nby her efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11289-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11289-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11289-S11290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives, delivered by Ms. Goetz, \none of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1791.

A bill to enhance the administrative authority of the \npresident of Haskell Indian Nations University, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  THE HASKELL INDIAN NATIONS UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Haskell \nIndian Nations University Administrative Systems Act of 1996. I am \npleased to have the vice-chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, \nSenator Inouye, as a cosponsor. The purpose of this bill is to give \nHaskell Indian Nations University the authority and flexibility it \nneeds to make a successful transition\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nfrom a junior college to a 4-year university.\n  Founded in 1884 as the U.S. Indian Industrial Training School, \nHaskell provided agricultural education in grades one through five. Ten \nyears later, the school had changed its name to Haskell Institute and \nexpanded its academic training beyond the eighth grade. By 1927 the \nsecondary curriculum had been accredited, and in 1970 the school became \nHaskell Indian Junior College. In October 1993, after receiving \naccreditation to offer a bachelor of science degree in elementary \nteacher education, the school changed its name to Haskell Indian \nNations University.\n  Haskell is a Kansas treasure and an institution cherished by native \nAmericans and Alaska Natives. At any one time, as many as 175 tribes \nare represented in the student body. Integrating the perspectives of \nvarious native American cultures have assured Haskell's growth and \nsuccess. As the first baccalaureate class graduates in May 1997, \nHaskell Indian Nations University is developing 4-year programs in \nother fields and continues to accept the challenge of enriching the \nlives of young native Americans and Alaska Natives.\n  As the school has changed, so should the system by which it is \nadministered. Haskell's ability to make a successful transition from a \njunior college to a 4-year university is being compromised by the \npresent system under which the Bureau of Indian Affairs must approve \nits appointments and the Office of Personnel Management establishes \nrankings for its professors.\n  This legislation allows the school to remain within the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and its employees to continue to participate in Federal \nretirement and health benefit programs. However, the Haskell president \nand Board of Regents will have authority over organizational structure, \nthe classification of positions, recruitment, procurement, and \ndetermination of all human resource policies and procedures. This \nlegislation will give Haskell the autonomy enjoyed by the tribally \ncontrolled community colleges and BIA elementary and secondary schools. \nThis bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Jan Meyers.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that we are near adjournment and it is \nunlikely that we can get this bill passed in the time remaining. \nHowever, I wanted to introduce it now because I am convinced that such \nlegislation is essential to the success of Haskell Indian Nations \nUniversity and that it should be a priority in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haskell Indian Nations \n     University Administrative Systems Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the provision of culturally sensitive curricula for \n     higher education programs at Haskell Indian Nations \n     University is consistent with the commitment of the Federal \n     Government to the fulfillment of treaty obligations to Indian \n     tribes through the principle of self-determination and the \n     use of Federal resources; and\n       (2) giving a greater degree of autonomy to Haskell Indian \n     Nations University, while maintaining the university as an \n     integral part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will \n     facilitate the transition of the university to a 4-year \n     university.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) University.--The term ``Haskell Indian Nations \n     University'' or ``university'' means the Haskell Indian \n     Nations University, located in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\n     SEC. 4.

otherwise be currently payable under the wage schedule \n     covering such employee;\n       (2) the limitation under section 5307 of title 5, United \n     States Code (relating to limitation on

accordance with regulations \n     which shall be prescribed by the Office of Personnel \n     Management.\n       (4) Work-study.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     considered to apply with

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncasualty loss deduction for disaster losses without regard to the 10-\npercent adjusted gross income floor; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      Disaster Losses Legislation\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, joined by my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Mr. Helms, I introduce a bill that addresses a real \nconcern for millions of middle-class people in disaster-prone areas.\n  The Tax Code permits the deduction of uninsured casualty losses. The \nTax Code, however, requires these losses to total more than 10 percent \nof the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Consequently, although a large \nnumber of middle-class taxpayers are faced with large repair and \ncleanup bills, these bills often fall short of the 10 percent of \nadjusted gross income threshold.\n  Mr. President, 43 North Carolina counties--home to more than half of \nthe State population--were declared Federal disaster areas as a result \nof Hurricane Fran. Thousands of houses were destroyed and tens of \nthousands of houses suffered serious damage. These losses are clearly \nsubstantial enough to fall within the scope of the deduction.\n  However, there are hundreds of thousands of North Carolina families \nthat suffered uninsured damage that, although substantial, falls short \nof the 10 percent limitation.\n  In fact, Mr. President, homeowners' insurance policies cover removal \nof trees that strike the house, but these policies do not otherwise \ncover downed or damaged trees. Further, insurance payments for tree \nremoval are often capped far below the real cost of these efforts, \nwhich leaves insured homeowners, too, with a large bill.\n  It is estimated that Hurricane Fran caused $500 million in tree \ndamage in North Carolina. The foresters estimate that the hurricane \ndowned between 1 and 25 percent of the trees in affected areas.\n  I drove back to Sampson County, NC, during the hurricane, and the \nroads were littered with trees and branches. It was a sight of pure \ndevastation.\n  Unfortunately, standard insurance policies do not cover much of this \ndamage, so homeowners face some large and unexpected bills for cleanup \ncosts.\n  For example, in the city of Raleigh, which is more than 100 miles \ninland, thousands of homeowners lost trees. Families across North \nCarolina face tree removal bills that range from $1,000 to $3,000 and \nupward. In fact, Mr. President, many families were required to hire \ncrane crews to remove downed trees. The tree loss was remarkable in \nmuch of North Carolina.\n  These are middle-class families that earn under $50,000 per year. \nThese tree removal bills are a real hit. However, because these bills \noften do not quite reach the 10 percent threshold, the deduction is \nunavailable.\n  As you know, Mr. President, an unanticipated $3,000 bill is a \ntremendous blow for most middle-class families. Consequently, many \nfamilies are forced to dip into their savings, and others are required \nto borrow thousands of dollars.\n  It is a shame to see these people forced to raid their savings due to \nthe 10 percent floor on the uninsured loss deduction. The Tax Code \nacknowledges that uninsured casualty losses are appropriate deductions. \nThis bill, however, further acknowledges the burdens of catastrophic \nstorms on the families that live in these areas.\n  This legislation thus eliminates the 10-percent requirement in \nFederal disaster areas. It permits working Americans to hold on to a \nbit more of their own earnings in the wake of a catastrophic storm.\n  Many families enjoy incomes sufficient enough to disqualify them for \nFederal grant assistance. These middle-class families do not want \nhandouts. This bill, however, represents an acknowledgment of the \nspecial burdens on hard-working families in Federal disaster areas.\n  I think that this is reasonable legislation, Mr. President, and I \nhope that my colleagues will join me and Senator Helms in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n\n  S. 2119. A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Federal \nStatistical System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n   THE COMMISSION TO STUDY THE FEDERAL STATISTICAL SYSTEM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska, legislation that would establish a \nCommission To Study the Federal Statistical System.\n  The United States has the oldest and by and large finest data \ngathering system in the world. Statistics are part of our \nconstitutional arrangement, which provides for a decennial census that, \namong other purposes, is the basis for apportionment of membership in \nthe House of Representatives. I quote from article I, section I:\n\n       . . . enumeration shall be made within three Years after \n     the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and \n     within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as \n     they shall by Law direct.\n\n  But, while the Constitution directed that there be a census, there \nwas, initially, no Census Bureau. The earliest censuses were conducted \nby U.S. marshals. Later on, statistical bureaus in State governments \ncollected the data, with a Superintendent of the Census overseeing from \nWashington. It was not until 1902 that a permanent Bureau of the Census \nwas created by the Congress, housed initially in the Interior \nDepartment. In 1903 the Bureau was transferred to the newly established \nDepartment of Commerce and Labor.\n  The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, \nwhich was originally an independent body, began collecting data in \n1866. It too was transferred to the new Department of Commerce and \nLabor in 1903, but\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\nthen was put in the Treasury Department in 1913 following ratification \nof the 16th amendment, which gave Congress the power to impose an \nincome tax.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics, created in 1884, was also initially \nin the Interior Department. The first Commissioner of the BLS, \nappointed in 1885, was Col. Carroll D. Wright, a distinguished Civil \nWar veteran of the New Hampshire Volunteers. A self-trained social \nscientist, Colonel Wright pioneered techniques for collecting and \nanalyzing survey data on income, prices, and wages. He had previously \nserved as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics, a post he \nheld for 15 years, and in that capacity had supervised the 1880 Federal \nCensus in Massachusetts.\n  In 1888, the Bureau of Labor Statistics became an independent agency. \nIn 1903 it was once again made a Bureau, joining other statistical \nagencies in the Department of Commerce and Labor. When a new Department \nof Labor was formed in 1913--giving labor an independent voice, as \nlabor was removed from the Department of Commerce and Labor--the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics was transferred to it.\n  And so it went. Statistical agencies sprung up as needed. And \nthey moved back and forth as new executive departments were formed. \nToday, some 89 different organizations in the Federal Government \ncomprise parts of our national statistical infrastructure. Eleven of \nthese organizations have as their primary function the generation of \ndata. These 11 organizations are:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Date   \n               Agency                      Department        Established\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNational Agricultural Statistical    Agriculture...........        1863 \n Service.                                                               \nStatistics of Income Division, IRS.

It requires \n     the highest qualities of self-discipline, restraint, a \n     willingness to make commitments and sacrifices for the \n     general interest, and also it requires knowledge.\n\n  That knowledge often comes from accurate statistics. You cannot begin \nto solve a problem until you can measure it.\n\n  This legislation would require the new Commission to conduct a \ncomprehensive examination of our current statistical system and focus \nparticularly on the agencies that produce data as their primary \nproduct--agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA] and the \nBureau of Labor Statistics [BLS].\n  This week I received a letter from nine former chairmen of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers [CEA] endorsing this legislation. \nExcluding the two most recent chairs, who are still serving in the \nClinton administration, the signatories include virtually every living \nchair of the CEA. While acknowledging that the United States \n``possesses a first-class statistical system,'' these former chairmen \nremind us that ``problems periodically arise under the current system \nof widely scattered responsibilities.'' They conclude as follows:\n\n       Without at all prejudging the appropriate measures to deal \n     with these difficult problems, we believe that a \n     thoroughgoing review by a highly qualified and bipartisan \n     Commission as provided in your Bill has great promise of \n     showing the way to major improvements.\n\n  The letter is signed by: Michael J. Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Alan \nGreenspan, Paul W. McCracken, Raymond J. Saulnier, Charles L. Schultze, \nBeryl W. Sprinkel, Herbert Stein, and Murray Weidenbaum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record following my statement.\n  It happens that this Senator's association with the statistical \nsystem in the executive branch began over three decades ago. I was \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Policy and Planning in the \nadministration of President John F. Kennedy. This was a new position in \nwhich I was nominally responsible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I \nsay nominally out of respect for the independence of that venerable \ninstitution, which as I noted earlier long predated the Department of \nLabor itself. The then-Commissioner of the BLS, Ewan Clague, could not \nhave been more friendly and supportive. And so were the statisticians, \nwho undertook to teach me to the extent I was teachable. They even \nshared professional confidences. And so it was that I came to have some \nfamiliarity with the field.\n  For example, at that time the monthly report of the unemployment rate \nwas closely watched by capital and labor, as we would have said, and \nwas frequently challenged. Committees regularly assembled to examine \nand debate the data. Published unemployment rates, based on current \nmonthly survey methodology appeared, if memory serves, in 1948, and so \nthe series was at most 14 years in place at this time.\n  There is, of course, a long history of attempts to reform our \nNation's statistical infrastructure. From the period 1903 to 1990, 16 \ndifferent committees, commissions, and study groups have convened to \nassess our statistical infrastructure, but in most cases little or no \naction has been taken on their recommendations. The result of this \ninaction has been an ever expanding statistical system. It continues to \ngrow in order to meet new data needs, but with little or no regard for \nthe overall objectives of the system. Janet L. Norwood, former \nCommissioner of the BLS, writes in her book ``Organizing to Count'':\n\n       The U.S. system has neither the advantages that come from \n     centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong \n     coordination in decentralization. As presently organized, \n     therefore, the country's statistical system will be hard \n     pressed to meet the demands of a technologically advanced, \n     increasingly internationalized world in which the demand for \n     objective data of high quality is steadily rising.\n\n  In this era of government downsizing and budget cutting it is \nunlikely that Congress will appropriate more funds for statistical \nagencies. It is clear that to preserve and improve the statistical \nsystem we must consider reforming it, yet we must not attempt to reform \nthe system until we have heard from experts in the field.\n  The Commission established in the legislation will also examine the \naccuracy of our statistics. In the past few years there has been a \ngrowing concern that the methodology used to generate U.S. statistics \nmay be outdated and can be improved.\n\n  It is clear there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Federal \nstatistical infrastructure. For if the public loses confidence in our \nstatistics, they are likely to lose confidence in our policies as well.\n\n\n                       DESCRIPTION OF LEGISLATION\n\n  The legislation establishes the Commission to Study the Federal \nStatistical System. The Commission would consist of 13 members: 5 \nappointed by the President with no more than 3 from the same political \nparty, 4 appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate with no \nmore than 2 from the same political party, and 4 appointed by the \nSpeaker of the House with no more than 2 from the same political party. \nA chairman would be selected by the President from the appointed \nmembers. The members must have expertise in statistical policy with a \nbackground in disciplines such as actuarial science, demography, \neconomics, and finance.\n  The Commission will conduct a comprehensive study of all matters \nrelating to the Federal statistical infrastructure, including:\n  An examination of multipurpose statistical agencies such as the \nBureau of Labor Statistics [BLS];\n  A review and evaluation of the mission and organizational structure \nof statistical agencies, including activities that should be expanded \nor deleted and the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized \nstatistical agency;\n  An examination of the methodology involved in producing data and the \naccuracy of the data itself;\n  A review of interagency coordination and standardization of \ncollection procedures;\n  A review of information technology and an assessment of how data is \ndisseminated to the public;\n  An examination of individual privacy in the context of statistical \ndata;\n  A comparison of our system with the systems of other nations; and\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\n  Recommendations for a strategy to maintain a modern and efficient \nstatistical infrastructure.\n  All of these objectives will be addressed in an interim report due no \nlater than June 1, 1998, with a final report due January 15, 1999.\n  The Commission is expected to spend $10 million: $2.5 million in FY \n1997, $5 million in FY 1998, and $2.5 million in FY 1999. The \nCommission will cease to exist 90 days after the final report is \nsubmitted.\n  This legislation is only a first step, but an essential one. The \nCommission will provide Congress with the blueprint for reform. It will \nbe up to us to finally take action after nearly a century of \ninattention to this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission to Study the \n     Federal Statistical System Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress, recognizing the importance of statistical \n     information in the development and administration of policies \n     for the private and public sector, finds that--\n       (1) accurate Federal statistics are required to develop, \n     implement, and evaluate government policies and laws;\n       (2) Federal spending consistent with legislative intent \n     requires accurate and appropriate statistical information;\n       (3) business and individual economic decisions are \n     influenced by Federal statistics and contracts are often \n     based on such statistics;\n       (4) statistical information on the manufacturing and \n     agricultural sectors is more complete than statistical \n     information regarding the service sector which employs more \n     than half the Nation's workforce;\n       (5) experts in the private and public sector have long-\n     standing concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of numerous \n     Federal statistics, including the Consumer Price Index, gross \n     domestic product, trade data, wage data, and the poverty \n     rate;\n       (6) Federal statistical data should be accurate, \n     consistent, and continuous;\n       (7) the Federal statistical infrastructure should be \n     modernized to accommodate the increasingly complex and ever \n     changing American economy;\n       (8) Federal statistical agencies should utilize all \n     practical technologies to disseminate statistics to the \n     public; and\n       (9) the Federal statistical infrastructure should maintain \n     the privacy of individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Daniel P. Moynihan,\n     Hon. J. Robert Kerrey,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Moynihan and Kerrey: All of us are former \n     Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers. We write to \n     support the basic objectives and approach of your Bill to \n     establish the Commission to Study the Federal Statistical \n     System.\n       The United States possesses a first-class statistical \n     system. All of us have in the past relied heavily upon the \n     availability of reasonably accurate and timely federal \n     statistics on the national economy. Similarly, our \n     professional training leads us to recognize how important a \n     good system of statistical information is for the efficient \n     operations of our complex private economy. But we are also \n     painfully aware that important problems of bureaucratic \n     organization and methodology need to be examined and dealt \n     with if the federal statistical system is to continue to meet \n     essential public and private needs.\n       All of us have particular reason to remember the problems \n     which periodically arise under the current system of widely \n     scattered responsibilities. Instead of reflecting a balance \n     among the relative priorities of one statistical collection \n     effort against others, statistical priorities are set in a \n     system within which individual Cabinet Secretaries recommend \n     budgetary tradeoffs between their own substantive programs \n     and the statistical operations which their departments, \n     sometimes by historical accident, are responsible for \n     collecting. Moreover, long range planning of improvements in \n     the federal statistical system to meet the changing nature \n     and needs of the economy is hard to organize in the present \n     framework. The Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Council of Economic Advisers put a lot of effort into trying \n     to coordinate the system, often with success, but often \n     swimming upstream against the system.\n       We are also aware, as of course are you, of a number of \n     longstanding substantive and methodological difficulties with \n     which the current system is grappling. These include the \n     increasing importance in the national economy of the service \n     sector, whose output and productivity are especially hard to \n     measure, and the pervasive effect both on measures of \n     national output and income and on the federal budget of the \n     accuracy (or inaccuracy) with which our measures of prices \n     capture changes in the quality of the goods and services we \n     buy.\n       Without at all prejudging the appropriate measures to deal \n     with these difficult problems, we believe that a \n     thoroughgoing review by a highly qualified and bipartisan \n     Commission as provided in your Bill has great promise of \n     showing the way to major improvements.\n           Sincerely,\n     Prof. Michael J. Boskin,\n       The Hoover Institution.\n     Dr. Martin Feldstein,\n       National Bureau of Economic Research.\n     Alan Greenspan.\n     Prof. Paul W. McCracken,\n       University of Michigan.\n     Raymond J. Saulnier.\n     Charles L. Schultze,\n       The Brookings Institution.\n     Beryl W.

A bill to ensure medicare beneficiaries participating in \nmanaged care have access to emergency and urgent care; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n           THE MEDICARE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I will introduce legislation \nentitled Medicare Access to Emergency Medical Care Act, joined by \nSenators Grassley, Moseley-Braun, Chafee, Baucus, Jeffords, Simon, \nHollings, and Wellstone.\n  This legislation would require Medicare health maintenance \norganizations to pay for emergency care services provided to prudent \nbeneficiaries seeking emergency care and would preclude health \nmaintenance organizations from requiring prior authorizations in such \nsituations. This language, Mr. President, was previously approved by \nunanimous consent in the Senate during consideration of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995.\n  Why is this bill necessary? Mr. President, lack of a ``prudent lay \nperson'' definition places Medicare beneficiaries in the unreasonable \nposition of having emergency room visits for experiences, such as chest \npain, denied for reimbursement by managed care organizations, in some \ncases significantly subsequent to the visit to the emergency room. Why \ndenied? Denied because the beneficiary did not seek prior \nauthorization, or denied because the beneficiary was diagnosed not to \nhave an emergency condition, even if a reasonable person believed that \nthey had an emergency condition.\n  According to the congressionally established Physician Payment Review \nCommission's 1996 annual report to Congress:\n\n       Medicare requires health plans to provide or pay for care \n     needed in an emergency, but what constitutes an emergency may \n     be misunderstood or disputed by plans and beneficiaries. The \n     definition of ``emergency'' is central to resolve such \n     disputes and guide beneficiaries before they seek emergency \n     care.\n\n  Mr. President, currently, 60 percent of the claims that are disputed \nbetween Medicare beneficiaries and managed care plans involve emergency \nroom services. Let me repeat that. Sixty percent of the claims that are \ndisputed between Medicare beneficiaries and managed care plans involve \nemergency room services. As a result, the Physician's Payment Review \nCommission recommends, ``A prudent lay person's perspective should be \nconsidered as one of the factors in determining when a health plan that \nparticipates in Medicare should pay for initial screening and \nstabilization, if necessary, in an emergency.\n\n  That is the standard which this legislation adopts. This legislation \nwould protect Medicare beneficiaries who appear to act prudently from \nthe perspective of a lay person--such as thinking that chest pain may \nbe an indication of a heart attack and seeking emergency care. It would \nprotect those Medicare beneficiaries from facing substantial,\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nor in some cases even catastrophic, financial liabilities. The irony of \nthis situation is that the Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and \nLabor Act requires that all persons who come to a Medicare-\nparticipating hospital for emergency care be given a screening \nexamination to determine if they are experiencing a medical emergency \nand, if so, that they receive stabilizing treatment before being \ndischarged or moved to another facility. And that facility, that \nMedicare-participating hospital emergency room is required to provide \nthose services without regard to the financial ability of the \nindividual to pay.\n  As a result, emergency room doctors and hospitals face a Catch-22. \nThey are required by Medicare law and their own professional ethics to \nperform diagnostic tests and examinations to rule out emergency \nconditions. But those same health care providers may be denied \nreimbursement due to prior authorization requirements or a finding that \nthe condition was not of an emergent nature, even though symptoms, such \nas extreme pain, shortness of breath, chest pains, loss of blood, or \nothers, would prompt most lay persons to conclude that they need to \nseek medical care immediately.\n\n  Dr. Paul Lindeman wrote in an article in the Miami Herald on July 30, \n1995, about an 85-year-old woman with a hip fracture who was denied \nadmission to his hospital's emergency department by her health \nmaintenance organization so that she could be transferred to an \nemergency department across town. The patient had to wait 3 hours for \nthe HMO ambulance service. According to Dr. Lindeman, ``No matter how \nwell-trained or talented the emergency physician, there are also times \nwhen he or she requires the urgent services of a consultant to provide \ndefinitive care for a patient (for instance, vascular and orthopedic \nsurgeons to repair a severely traumatized limb). In these cases, delays \nin care due to managed care bureaucracy can become a legitimate hazard \nto the patient.''\n  Now, Mr. President, some might be concerned that this legislation \nwould preclude health maintenance organizations from limiting \nreimbursement for frivolous emergency room use and abuse by some \nbeneficiaries. Such concern is unwarranted because this legislation \ndoes not prevent managed care plans from retrospectively reviewing \nservices delivered in the hospital emergency department to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. All it does is require the plans to base their review on \nwhether the patient acted prudently given the patient's symptoms. \nFrivolous or abusive emergency room use by a patient would not be \nprudent and, therefore, could still be denied by the HMO.\n  Mr. President, in 1993, the Network Design Group, a group which is \nbest known for their work as a national mediator and arbiter of \ndisputes between Medicare beneficiaries and their health maintenance \norganizations, wrote a report for the Federal Government. In that it \nstated, ``Definitions of `emergency' in regulation should be modified \nso that a reasonable and prudent lay person can anticipate claims that \nwould be covered versus denied.''\n  Michael Stocker, the president and chief executive officer of Empire \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield in New York, argued a similar point in an \neditorial entitled ``The Ticket To Better Managed Care,'' which was \npublished in the New York Times on October 28, 1995. Mr. Stocker wrote, \n``At times, managed care is a euphemism for cost-cutting that puts the \npatient second. Because of the industry's financial success, too few \norganizations are paying attention to people's rising worries about how \nthey will fare in HMO's that restrict access to specific doctors and \nhospitals.''\n  Mr. Stocker further argues that plans must ``provide high-quality \nservice in ways that can be proved and readily understood.''\n  As part of providing quality of care to patients that is readily \nunderstood, Mr. Stocker concludes that, ``Health plans should pay for \nemergency room coverage for consumers who believe they have a \nlegitimate emergency, even if it turns out that they do not.'' That is \na perfect description of this bill's ``prudent lay person'' standard.\n  Finally, since the Federal Government and beneficiaries are paying \nthrough Medicare for emergency room services--that is, emergency room \nservices are on the list of medical services that a Medicare \nbeneficiary contracts to receive when they join a health maintenance \norganization--it makes sense to require that those services be provided \nand paid for on a reasonable basis.\n  Without it, Medicare becomes like a horribly ineffective Government \nprogram where money goes in but results and the delivery of services \nare lacking to the beneficiary. We in this Congress have a financial \nresponsibility to demand that the services which we pay for are being \ndelivered.\n  Mr. President, as we know managed care is becoming an increasing part \nof our health care system as it relates to Medicare beneficiaries. In \n1990, there were only 3.5 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries \nenrolled in a managed care plan. Today that number exceeds 9 percent. \nThe importance and need for this legislation will only increase as more \nand more Medicare beneficiaries are encouraged to elect managed care \nover fee-for-service as the form of receiving their Medicare services.\n  As a result, with the cosponsors, a broad bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues, I am introducing this important legislation today. And I \nurge its adoption in the remaining days of this session, or in the next \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that copies of newspaper \narticles which I have cited from the Miami Herald and the New York \nTimes regarding this issue be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send to the desk this legislation, and \nrequest its immediate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be referred to the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, July 30, 1995]\n\n               HMO's in the ER: A View From the Trenches\n\n                         (By Paul R. Lindeman)\n\n       I arrived for my 12-hour shift in the Emergency Department \n     at 7 p.m. As the departing physician and I went over the \n     cases of the current patients, I was told the woman in Room 2 \n     was being transferred to a psychiatric facility. The patient \n     was pregnant, addicted to crack cocaine and had been assessed \n     as suicidal by a psychiatrist.\n       An obstetrician was required to care for the patient during \n     her stay at the mental health facility. The only two groups \n     of practicing obstetricians who were on this woman's HMO \n     ``panel'' and on staff at this facility both refused to \n     accept this high-risk case. That left this unfortunate woman, \n     and our staff, caught in the ``never-never land'' of managed \n     care.\n       When I left the Emergency Department at 7:30 the following \n     morning, she was still in Room 2. It took hospital \n     administrators and attorneys all day to arrange disposition, \n     and the patient was eventually transferred--at 6:30 that \n     evening.\n       Managed-care health plans typically limit choice of doctors \n     and hospitals and attempt to closely monitor services \n     provided. Their goal is to curb unnecessary tests and \n     hospitalizations to keep costs down. In the case of for-\n     profit managed-care companies, the additional purpose is \n     obvious. But what happens when managed care meets the \n     emergency room?\n       Federal law requires a screening exam at emergency \n     facilities, but HMOs are not required to pay. By exploiting \n     this fact, managed care is able to shift costs onto \n     hospitals, doctors and policyholders, thereby ``saving'' \n     money.\n       Consider the case of a 50-year-old male who awakes at 4 \n     a.m. with chest pain and goes to the hospital 10 blocks \n     away--instead of his HMO hospital an extra 30 minutes away. \n     After examination and testing, it's determined that the \n     patient is not having a heart attack and that it's safe for \n     him to go home.\n       His diagnosis is submitted on a claim form with a code for \n     ``gastritis.''\n       His insurance company denies payment, stating that \n     ``gastritis'' is not an emergency. As a result, the hospital \n     and the company who employs the emergency department \n     physician both bill the patient.\n       While this ``retrospectoscope'' is widely employed and \n     industry standard for denying payment, there are many other \n     ``savings'' techniques. For instance, many HMOs require \n     ``pre-authorization'' to treat a patient in the ER.\n       Consider now a 60-year-old female who arrives at the \n     emergency room complaining also of chest pain. The triage \n     nurse examines the patient, obtaining a brief history and \n     vital signs. A call is placed to the insurance company and a \n     recorded message is obtained without specific instruction \n     regarding emergencies. The patient is treated but the \n     payment is denied. Reason: Authorization was never \n     obtained.\n       Here's an alternate scenario, same patient, again waiting \n     for pre-authorization. (Noncritical patients often wait for \n     more than an hour.) This time ``the insurance company'' \n     answers the phone. Reading from a list, a series of questions \n     is asked, limited almost exclusively to obtaining recorded \n     numbers.\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\n     Based on these numbers, the individual speaking for the \n     company determines that it is safe for the patient to be \n     transferred to its hospital. The emergency physician \n     disagrees. The patient stays and is admitted to the hospital.\n       The HMO denies payment for the ER visit and the 24-hour \n     hospitalization, stating that the patient should have been \n     transferred. Again, the patient/policyholder, who pays a \n     monthly premium for his or her insurance, is billed for all \n     hospital and physician services.\n       The representative for the insurance company who decides on \n     preauthorization can range from someone with no medical \n     background at all to another physician (albeit with a vested \n     economic incentive). Generally the level of expertise is \n     somewhere between this. Thus, the near-Orwellian scenario \n     frequently plays out whereby a doctor who has seen and \n     examined a patient is trying to convince a nurse, over the \n     telephone, that a patient is sick.\n       Rudy Braccili Jr., business operations director for the \n     North Broward Hospital District, was quoted in The Herald as \n     saying. ``It's just a game they play to avoid paying, and \n     it's one of the ways they save money. They do not see the \n     realities of people who in the middle of the night come into \n     emergency rooms.'' He estimates that North District hospitals \n     have lost millions of dollars a year because of HMOs' \n     reluctance to pay bills.\n       Part of the problem is that what managed-care organizations \n     are trying to do is often quite difficult: determine \n     prospectively which patients are truly deserving of \n     emergency-room care. Indeed, this may in fact be a Catch-22. \n     I know of no way to accurately discern acute appendicitis \n     from a ``tummy ache'' without a history and physical \n     examination. Furthermore, medicine does not always lend \n     itself to black and white. For instance, is a woman who \n     screams and gyrates hysterically as a result of a squirming \n     cockroach in her ear an emergency?\n       Unfortunately, problems with HMOs in the ER go beyond cost \n     shifting and denial of payment. They often turn an otherwise \n     brief encounter into a harrowing ordeal. Another example from \n     ``the trenches'' is illustrative.\n       Our patient this time is an 85-year-old woman with a hip \n     fracture. But instead of being admitted, her HMO mandates \n     that she be transferred across town to the emergency \n     department at another facility where they contract their \n     surgical hip repairs. The patient waits three hours for the \n     HMO ambulance service, which is ``backed up.''\n       Consumers note: Had the patient not sold her Medicare \n     privileges to this HMO, she would have been admitted to our \n     hospital uneventually in a fraction of the time required to \n     complete her managed-care sojourn.\n       No matter how well trained or talented the emergency \n     physician, there are also times when she or he requires the \n     urgent services of a consultant to provide definitive care \n     for a patient (for instance, vascular and orthopedic surgeons \n     to repair a severely traumatized limb). In these cases, \n     delays in care due to managed-care bureaucracy can become a \n     legitimate hazard to the patient.\n       Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh, chief of emergency medicine at the \n     New England Medical Center, has said, ``In some ways, it's \n     less frustrating for us to take care of homeless people than \n     HMO members. At least we can do what we think is right for \n     them, as opposed to trying to convince an HMO over the phone \n     of what's the right thing to do.''\n       In my experience that is not an exaggeration. In the \n     emergency department, the homeless--while certainly deserving \n     of medical care--often receive better and more prompt care \n     than the HMO policyholder.\n       Conventional political wisdom holds that health-care reform \n     is dead, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. \n     Reform has been taking place at breakneck speed entirely \n     independent of Washington. In the last five to 10 years, \n     managed-care companies and the private sector have changed \n     profoundly the manner in which many Americans now receive \n     their health care.\n       As for-profit managed care has usurped decision-making \n     authority from physicians, so have they also diverted funds \n     from hospitals, physicians and policyholders to their own \n     CEOs and stockholders. Last year, HMO profits grew by more \n     than 15 percent, with the four largest HMOs each reporting \n     more than $1 billion in profits. What Democrats and \n     Republicans alike fail to appreciate is that the allegiance \n     of managed care is to neither the patient nor the reduction \n     of the federal deficit, but to its CEOs and stockholders.\n       So next time you see one of those warm and fuzzy television \n     commercials for an HMO that promises the world, remember \n     this: ``choose your own doctor'' really means choose your own \n     doctor from our list. And as for the claim ``no premiums, no \n     deductibles, no copayment'' (health insurance for free?), you \n     may as well pencil in: ``no doctor.'' At least, not one \n     likely to get up in the middle of the night.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 28, 1995]\n\n                   The Ticket to Better Managed Care\n\n                        (By Michael A. Stocker)\n\n       The central question about the future of health care goes \n     beyond the outcome of the debate over Medicare and Medicaid: \n     Can health maintenance organizations and other managed care \n     plans truly provide low-cost and high-quality health care?\n       Like many people, I am dismayed at the way some managed \n     care organization work. At times, managed care is a euphemism \n     for cost-cutting that puts the patient second. Because of the \n     industry's financial success, too few organizations are \n     paying attention to people's rising worries about how they \n     will fare in H.M.O.'s that restrict access to specific \n     doctors and hospitals.\n       H.M.O.'s can no longer expect to prosper simply because \n     they are less expensive than traditional fee-for-service \n     medical care. They must keep proving that their goal, first \n     and foremost, is to provide high-quality service in ways that \n     can be proved and readily understood. Not every health plan \n     will succeed, but there are some avenues that every health \n     plan executive should follow.\n       Learning about a good health plan by word of mouth is \n     insufficient. The industry needs to provide information that \n     enables people to compare plans and chose intelligently among \n     them when they are not sick.\n       In my view, in New York State that means establishing a \n     public-private system that compares the performances of \n     competing plans and requires all plans to participate. The \n     criteria might include the time it takes to get problems \n     solved properly and to see an appropriate doctor when one \n     needs to do so.\n       Like the rest of the medical profession, H.M.O.'s need to \n     improve the way they measure the outcome of their treatments. \n     While the art of diagnosis is well-developed, often treatment \n     involves more uncertainty. In New York, the Department of \n     Health has been releasing risk-adjusted mortality data about \n     common types of heart surgery. However uneasy doctors are \n     about such findings, the data have pointed out real \n     differences in the quality of care among doctors and \n     hospitals. We need more information like this. Most \n     companies are not investing enough money in developing and \n     operating patient-information banks. Keeping inferior \n     records is self-defeating.\n       Most people thing a high-quality health plan is one that \n     lets them choose their doctors. While such a choice is \n     important, it is not the whole story. Some plans that limit \n     access to physicians and hospitals can be very high in \n     quality. But they really have to prove it.\n       H.M.O's must go out of their way to involve patients in \n     their own care. Studies show that when patients know more \n     about their alternatives, and participate with their doctors \n     in decision-making, the result is not only happier but also \n     healthier patients, and even cost savings.\n       Legislation should be introduced in Albany that lays down a \n     number of requirements: First, intelligible full-disclosure \n     literature is imperative. Health plans must make clear the \n     guidelines they want their doctors to follow when treating \n     patients. The plans should disclose the treatments not \n     covered. Second, the plans should full disclose their payment \n     to physicians, including bonuses related to cost containment \n     and quality of care.\n       Third, health plans should pay for emergency room coverage \n     for consumers who believe they have a legitimate emergency, \n     even if it turns out they do not. Fourth, patients should be \n     aware of the drugs that managed care plans allow doctors to \n     prescribe. They should also know how to appeal decisions \n     about drugs.\n       In short, health plans have to stop ignoring the public's \n     fears and acting so much like cold insurance companies. They \n     have to start listening more like doctors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 9, 1995]\n\n          H.M.O.'s Refusing Emergency Claims, Hospitals Assert\n\n\n                        two missions in conflict\n\n   ``Managed Care'' Groups Insist They Must Limit Costs--Doctors Are \n                               Frustrated\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, July 8.--As enrollment in health maintenance \n     organizations soars, hospitals across the country report that \n     H.M.O.'s are increasingly denying claims for care provided in \n     hospital emergency rooms.\n       Such denials create obstacles to emergency care for H.M.O. \n     patients and can leave them responsible for thousands of \n     dollars in medical bills. The denials also frustrate \n     emergency room doctors, who say the H.M.O. practices \n     discourage patients from seeking urgently needed care. But \n     for their part, H.M.O.'s say their costs would run out of \n     control if they allowed patients unlimited access to hospital \n     emergency rooms.\n       How H.M.O.'s handle medical emergencies is an issue of \n     immense importance, given recent trends. Enrollment in \n     H.M.O.'s doubled in the last eight years, to 41 million in \n     1994, partly because employers encouraged their use as a way \n     to help control costs.\n       In addition, Republicans and many Democrats in Congress say \n     they want to increase the use of H.M.O.'s because they \n     believe that such prepaid health plans will slow the growth \n     of Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and \n     the poor, which serve 73 million people at a Federal cost of \n     $267 billion this year.\n       Under Federal law, a hospital must provide ``an appropriate \n     medical screening examination'' to any patient who requests \n     care in its emergency room. The hospital must also provide \n     any treatment needed to stabilize the patient's condition.\n       Dr. Toni A. Mitchell, director of emergency care at Tampa \n     General Hospital in Florida, said: ``I am obligated to \n     provide the care, but the H.M.O. is not obligated to pay for \n     it. This is a new type of cost-shifting, a way for H.M.O.'s \n     to shift costs to patients, physicians and hospitals.''\n       Most H.M.O.'s promise to cover emergency medical services, \n     but there is no standard\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n     definition of the term. H.M.O.'s can define it narrowly and \n     typically reserve the right to deny payment if they conclude, \n     in retrospect, that the conditions treated were not \n     emergencies. Hospitals say H.M.O.'s often refuse to pay for \n     their members in such cases, even if H.M.O. doctors sent the \n     patients to the hospital emergency rooms. Hospitals then \n     often seek payment from the patient.\n       Dr. Stephan G. Lynn, director of emergency medicine at St. \n     Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, said: ``We are \n     getting more and more refusals by H.M.O.'s to pay for care in \n     the emergency room. The problem is increasing as managed care \n     becomes a more important source of reimbursement. Managed \n     care is relatively new in New York City, but it's growing \n     rapidly.''\n       H.M.O.'s emphasize regular preventive care, supervised by a \n     doctor who coordinates all the medical services that a \n     patient may need. The organizations try to reduce costs by \n     redirecting patients from hospitals to less expensive sites \n     like clinics and doctors' offices.\n       The disputes over specific cases reflect a larger clash of \n     missions and cultures. An H.M.O. is the ultimate form of \n     ``managed care,'' but emergencies are, by their very nature, \n     unexpected and therefore difficult to manage. Doctors in \n     H.M.O.'s carefully weigh the need for expensive tests or \n     treatments, but in an emergency room, doctors tend to do \n     whatever they can to meet the patient's immediate needs.\n       Each H.M.O. seems to have its own way of handling \n     emergencies. Large plans like Kaiser Permanente provide a \n     full range of emergency services around the clock at their \n     own clinics and hospitals. Some H.M.O.'s have nurses to \n     advise patients over the telephone. Some H.M.O. doctors take \n     phone calls from patients at night. Some leave messages on \n     phone answering machines, telling patients to go to hospital \n     emergency rooms if they cannot wait for the doctors' office \n     to reopen.\n       At the United Healthcare Corporation, which runs 21 \n     H.M.O.'s serving 3.9 million people, ``It's up to the \n     physician to decide how to provide 24-hour coverage,'' says \n     Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, chief medical officer of the \n     Minneapolis-based company.\n       George C. Halvorson, chairman of the Group Health \n     Association of America, a trade group for H.M.O.'s, said he \n     was not aware of any problems with emergency care. ``This is \n     totally alien to me,'' said Mr. Halvorson, who is also \n     president of Health-Partners, an H.M.O. in Minneapolis. \n     Donald B. White, a spokesman for the association said, ``We \n     just don't have data on emergency services and how they're \n     handled by different H.M.O.'s.''\n       About 3.4 million of the nation's 37 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries are in H.M.O.'s. Dr. Rodney C. Armstead, \n     director of managed care at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, said the Government had received many \n     complaints about access to emergency services in such plans. \n     He recently sent letters to the 164 H.M.O.'s with Medicare \n     contracts, reminding them of their obligations to provide \n     emergency care.\n       Alan G. Raymond, vice president of the Harvard Community \n     Health Plan, based in Brookline, Mass., said, ``Employers are \n     putting pressure on H.M.O.'s to reduce inappropriate use of \n     emergency services because such care is costly and episodic \n     and does not fit well with the coordinated care that H.M.O.'s \n     try to provide.''\n       Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh, chief of emergency medicine at the \n     New England Medical Center, a teaching hospital in Boston, \n     said: ``H.M.O.'s are excellent at preventive care, regular \n     routine care. But they have not been able to cope with the \n     very unpredictable, unscheduled nature of emergency care. \n     They often insist that their members get approval before \n     going to a hospital emergency department. Getting prior \n     authorization may delay care.\n       ``In some ways, it's less frustrating for us to take care \n     of homeless people than H.M.O. members. At least, we can do \n     what we think is right for them, as opposed to trying to \n     convince an H.M.O. over the phone of what's the right thing \n     to do.''\n       Dr. Gary P. Young, chairman of the emergency department of \n     Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., said H.M.O.'s often \n     directed emergency room doctors to release patients or \n     transfer them to other hospitals before it was safe to do so. \n     ``This is happening every day,'' he said.\n       The PruCare H.M.O. in the Dallas-Forth area, run by the \n     Prudential Insurance Company of America, promises ``rock \n     solid health overage,'' but the fine print of its members' \n     handbook says, ``Failure to contact the primary care \n     physician prior to emergency treatment may result in denial \n     of payment.''\n       Typically, in an H.M.O., a family doctor or an internist \n     managing a patient's care serves as ``gatekeeper,'' \n     authorizing the use of specialists like cardiologists and \n     orthopedic surgeons. The H.M.O.'s send large numbers of \n     patients to selected doctors and hospitals; in return, they \n     receive discounts on fees. But emergencies are not limited to \n     times and places convenient to an H.M.O.'s list of doctors \n     and hospitals.\n       H.M.O.'s say they charge lower premiums than traditional \n     insurance companies because they are more efficient. But \n     emergency room doctors say that many H.M.O.'s skimp on \n     specialty care and rely on hospital emergency rooms to \n     provide such services, especially at night and on weekends.\n       Dr. David S. Davis, who works in the emergency department \n     at North Arundel Hospital in Glen Burnie, Md., said: \n     ``H.M.O.'s don't have to sign up enough doctors as long as \n     they have the emergency room as a safety net. The emergency \n     room is a backup for the H.M.O. in all its operations.'' \n     Under Maryland law, he noted, an H.M.O. must have a system to \n     provide members with access to doctors at all hours, but \n     it can meet this obligation by sending patients to \n     hospital emergency rooms.\n       To illustrate the problem, doctors offer this example: A \n     57-year-old man wakes up in the middle of the night with \n     chest pains. A hospital affiliated with his H.M.O. is 50 \n     minutes away, so he goes instead to a hospital just 10 blocks \n     from his home. An emergency room doctor orders several common \n     but expensive tests to determine if a heart attack has \n     occurred.\n       The essence of the emergency physician's art is the ability \n     to identify the cause of such symptoms in a patient whom the \n     doctor has never seen. The cause could be a heart attack. But \n     it could also be indigestion, heartburn, stomach ulcers, \n     anxiety, a panic attack, a pulled muscle or any of a number \n     of other conditions.\n       If the diagnostic examination and tests had not been \n     performed, the hospital and the emergency room doctors could \n     have been cited for violating Federal law.\n       But in such situations, H.M.O.'s often refuse to pay the \n     hospital, on the ground that the hospital had no contract \n     with the H.M.O., the chest pain did not threaten the \n     patient's life or the patient did not get authorization to \n     use a hospital outside the H.M.O. network.\n       Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, \n     said he would soon introduce a bill to help solve these \n     problems. The bill would require H.M.O.'s to pay for \n     emergency medical services and would establish a uniform \n     definition of emergency based on the judgment of ``a prudent \n     lay person.'' The bill would prohibit H.M.O.'s from requiring \n     prior authorization for emergency services. A health plan \n     could be fined $10,000 for each violation and $1 million for \n     a pattern of repeated violations.\n       The American College of Emergency Physicians, which \n     represents more than 15,000 doctors, has been urging Congress \n     to adopt such changes and supports the legislation.\n       When H.M.O.'s deny claims filed on behalf of Medicare \n     beneficiaries, the patients have a right to appeal. The \n     appeals are heard by a private consulting concern, the \n     Network Design Group of Pittsford, N.Y., which acts as agent \n     for the Government. The appeals total 300 to 400 a month, and \n     David A. Richardson, president of the company, said that a \n     surprisingly large proportion--about half of all Medicare \n     appeals--involved disagreements over emergencies or other \n     urgent medical problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n\n  S. 2122. A bill to establish the Fallen Timbers Battlefield, Fort \nMeigs, and Fort Miamis National Historical Site in the State of Ohio; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                         THE FALLEN TIMBERS ACT\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \ndesignate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield, Fort Meigs, and Fort Miamis \nas national historic sites.\n  Mr. President, the people of northwest Ohio are committed to \npreserving the historic heritage of the United States and the State of \nOhio, as well as that of their own community.\n  The truly national significance of the Battle of Fallen Timbers and \nFort Meigs have been acknowledged already. In 1960, Fallen Timbers was \ndesignated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1969, Fort Meigs \nreceived this designation.\n  The Battle of Fallen Timbers is acknowledged by the National Park \nService as a culminating event in the history of the struggle for \ndominance in the old Northwest Territory.\n  Fort Meigs is recognized by the National Park Service as the zenith \nof the British advance in the west as well as the maximum effort by \nNative forces under the Shawnee, Tecumseh, during the War of 1812.\n  Fort Miamis, which was attacked twice without success by British \ntroops, led by Gen. Henry Proctor, in the spring of 1813, is listed on \nthe National Register of Historic Places.\n  Recently, the National Park Service completed a special resource \nstudy examining the proposed national historic site designation and the \nsuitability of these sites for inclusion in the National Park System.\n  The Park Service concluded that these sites were suitable for \ninclusion in the National Park System--with non-Federal management and \nNational Park Service assistance. The bill I am introducing today would \nact on that recommendation.\n\n  My legislation will accomplish the following:\n  Recognize and preserve the 185-acre Fallen Timbers Battlefield site;\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\n  Formalize the linkage between the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and \nMonument to Fort Meigs and Fort Miamis;\n  Preserve and interpret U.S. military history and native American \nculture during the period from 1794 through 1813; and,\n  Provide technical assistance to the State of Ohio as well as \ninterested community and historical groups in the development and \nimplementation of programming and interpretation of the three sites.\n  However, my legislation will not require the Federal Government to \nprovide direct funding to these three sites. That responsibility \nremains with--and is welcomed by--the many individuals, community \ngroups, elected officials, and others who deserve recognition for their \nmany hours of hard work dedicated to this issue.\n  Mr. President, we have entered an era where the responsibility and \nthe drive behind the management, programming, and--in many cases--the \nfunding for historic preservation is the responsibility of local \ncommunity groups, local elected officials, and local business \ncommunities.\n  This legislation to designate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield, Fort \nMeigs, and Fort Miamis as national historic sites represents just such \nan effort. In my opinion, it is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, it's time to grant these truly historic areas the \nmeasure of respect and recognition they deserve. I agree with the \nNational Park Service--and the people of Ohio--on this issue. That is \nwhy I am proposing this important legislation today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Cohen, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Frahm, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Thomas, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2123. A bill to require the calculation of Federal-aid highway \napportionments and allocations for fiscal year 1997 to be determined so \nthat States experience no net effect from a credit to the highway trust \nfund made in correction of an accounting error made in fiscal year \n1994, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                the highway funding fairness act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the cosponsors of our legislation \ninclude the following Senators, in addition to myself and Senator \nBingaman: Senator Akaka from Hawaii, Senator Cohen, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Domenici, Senator Frahm, Senator Gregg, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Harkin, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kassebaum, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Kerry, Senator Leahy, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Pressler, and Senator Thomas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all those Senators be listed as original \ncosponsors of our legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, essentially, this is a bipartisan bill \nto correct a bureaucratic, administrative error that has penalized 28 \nStates under the highway program. It is that simple. This bill is \nidentical to the amendment I offered to the Transportation \nappropriations bill on July 31. It is the same bill. Although that \namendment received the support of 57 Senators--57 Senators voted in \nfavor of it--the conference committee dropped the issue from the \nconference report. That is why Senator Bingaman, myself, and my \ncolleagues are back here today. Let me briefly explain this bill.\n  In 1994, the Treasury delayed crediting the highway trust fund with \napproximately $1.6 billion in revenues collected from the Federal \ngasoline tax. It was an error. They made a mistake. While the money was \nlater eventually deposited into the highway trust fund, this delay has \nhad very serious ramifications on all of our States.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the formulas for distributing Federal \nhighway funds to the States were set in place in 1991 in the highway \nbill, otherwise known as ISTEA. Those formulas govern the distribution \nof funds for 6 years through September 30 of next year. That is the \nformula. It is in place. It is in the law for distributing allocations \nof highway funds among our States.\n  Of our many categories of highway funding, there is a direct \ncorrelation between the amount of money a State pays into the highway \ntrust fund and the amount of money a State subsequently receives. If \nthe revenue the States paid to the highway trust fund are not correctly \ncredited to the appropriate accounts, the wrong amount of funds is \nsubsequently distributed to the individual States. That is what \nhappened.\n  When the Treasury made this mistake and delayed crediting $1.6 \nbillion to the highway trust fund, the amount of money distributed to \nthe States under one category, called 90 percent of payments category, \nwas skewed, simply because of a bureaucratic delay. Pure and simple \nbureaucratic delay, mistake.\n  As a consequence, some States were initially shortchanged in 1996 of \ntheir distributions, and on this coming Tuesday, October 1, the error \nwill be compounded. Some States will receive much more than the \noriginal highway bill formula called for; others will receive much \nless. A lot of money is at stake.\n  In the fiscal year 1997 Transportation appropriations conference \nreport, highway spending was set at $18 billion. That is $450 million \nmore than last year, a record amount for the highway program. One would \nthink that such an increase would mean that each State will receive an \nincrease in available funds. Not so. Just the opposite has happened. \nEven with that large increase in total funds allocated, 28 States will \nsee a decrease in their highway apportionments.\n  Some States will lose up to 17 percent. Others will see an increase \nof up to 30 percent. A good part of these fluctuations is due to the \nTreasury Department error, obviously unfair.\n  Our bill fixes this, puts us right back to the status quo, to the \nformula prescribed allocations. It requires the Department of \nTransportation use the correct numbers in fiscal year 1997 when \ncalculating the distribution of funds to States under ISTEA, the \nhighway bill.\n  It also requires the Department of Transportation to correct the \nerror in fiscal year 1996. So the distributions errors made in 1996, as \nwell as the errors that will be made, unless corrected, in 1997, will \nboth be corrected. In other words, I want to completely correct the \nsituation. No State should gain or lose Federal highway funds based \nonly on a bureaucratic error at the Department of Treasury.\n  Now that we understand the tremendous financial impact of this error, \nnow that it is discovered, I don't think it should be compounded and \ncontinued in the future.\n  Let me stress to my colleagues that this is not--I repeat, is not--an \nISTEA formula change. This is not a legislative change to change the \nformula that Congress set back in 1991. This has nothing to do with the \nallocation that was set by legislation back in 1991. In fact, this bill \nwill ensure that all States receive the amount of money originally \nauthorized under ISTEA, no more, no less.\n  Furthermore, this is not a donor State versus donee State funding \nissue, as some would say. It is not that at all. I am disappointed that \nsome continue to characterize the situation in those terms. Some have \neven said that States interested in fixing the error are being greedy, \na few believe. How can a State who seeks to correct an acknowledged \nerror be called greedy? We are trying put the situation back to where \nit was as we legislated and intended it to be. This is truly a case of \ncorrecting an honest bureaucratic mistake. Both the Departments of \nTreasury and Transportation admit that the error was made.\n  If some States are not happy with the ISTEA formulas adopted in 1991, \nI say so be it. There is ample opportunity to have that debate next \nyear when Congress takes up the highway bill and deals with formula \nallocations. It is going to be a big fight, but that is where the fight \nshould be, Madam President. We all know that. It should be in the \ncontext of the highway bill. But to use a bureaucratic error as a \nbackdoor way to change the formulas,\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nI think, is underhanded and is not the way the Senate--the whole \nCongress, for that matter--ought to do business.\n  We are introducing this legislation before the end of the 104th \nCongress. I want to alert my colleagues that many of us feel that this \nTreasury error is of such magnitude and of such importance that it must \nbe addressed in the future.\n  I thank my good friend, Senator Bingaman, from New Mexico, for his \nhard work and the welcome support of other Senators. We are helping get \nthis error corrected.\n  I thank you, Madam President, for your hopeful help, too, as I see \nyour colleague is a cosponsor. It is my hope that the other Senator \nfrom Maine will see the wisdom of his efforts as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I send the bill to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record and referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                S. 2123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, let me speak briefly about a bill \nentitled the ``Highway Funding Fairness Act'' that Senator Baucus is \nintroducing today, and which several of us are cosponsoring, to correct \na serious problem in the calculation of fiscal year 1997 Federal-aid \nhighway fund apportionments and allocations. It is our intention to use \nwhatever vehicles are available, including the omnibus appropriations \nbill, to try to correct an error that exists in the transportation \nappropriations bill that was earlier passed in this body and sent to \nthe President.\n  Senator Baucus will describe in more detail the technical mistake \nthat was made by the Department of Treasury in 1994, which resulted in \nfaulty projections for this fiscal year. It is my understanding that \nthe Department of Transportation has previously been instructed and \nempowered by the Office of Management and Budget to apportion highway \nfunds on the basis of this error being corrected. And, in fact, \nbaseline budget projections for the Department of Transportation \nreflect this agreement.\n  Somewhere between then and now, signals have changed and States are \nabout to get either unfairly rewarded or unfairly punished because of a \nflawed apportionment formula.\n  Many of us in this Chamber thought that the problem had been fixed \nwhen we passed Senator Baucus' amendment as part of the fiscal year \n1997 Transportation appropriations bill. This amendment, like the bill \nwe are introducing today, would have corrected the accounting error.\n  When the conference report emerged, however, the amendment that would \nhave fixed the problem had been dropped. Unfortunately, when we voted \non this issue last Wednesday night, very few Senators were adequately \ninformed that the correcting amendment which Senator Baucus had \npreviously offered was no longer included and that many of their States \nwould be taking serious, unexpected cuts in spending authority for \nhighway projects.\n  I have asked the President, as have many other Senators, to try to \nfix this by working with the Department of Transportation to apportion \nfunds based on their original baseline projections, as understood by \nthe Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget \nOffice, or if the President determines that is not possible, to then \nveto the legislation and return it to the Congress so we can fix the \nproblem. I believe our States are not well-served by this legislation. \nWe must use all opportunities available to call attention to this error \nand correct it before the Congress adjourns.\n  What is even more disturbing in assessing the impact of the error is \nthat overall highway spending will increase in fiscal year 1997 to $18 \nbillion, $455 million over current levels, the highest amount in \nhistory. It is not reasonable for States like my own, New Mexico, to be \ntaking a $20 million reduction in highway funds when the overall \naccounts are being increased to their highest levels.\n  It is not acceptable to me or to the residents of my State of New \nMexico to accept outcomes that are the result of accounting errors.\n  Let me list the funding reductions that 28 States are about to \nreceive in fiscal year 1997 highway fund distributions unless we are \nable to correct this problem before we leave town.\n  The States that are losers under the bill as it now stands would be: \nAlaska, $22 million less than the current year; Colorado, $1.2 million \nless; Connecticut, $37 million less; Delaware, $8 million less; Hawaii, \n$13 million less; Idaho, $7 million less; Illinois, $71 million less; \nIowa, $21 million less; Kansas, $22 million less; Maine, $7 million \nless; Maryland, $3 million less; Massachusetts, $73 million less; \nMinnesota, $32 million less; Montana, $21 million less; Nebraska, $15 \nmillion less; New Hampshire, $9 million; New Jersey, $44 million; my \nown State, as I have indicated, $20 million less; New York, \n$111 million less than current year funding; North Dakota, $11 million \nless; Ohio, $19 million less; Rhode Island, $14 million less; South \nDakota, $12 million less; Utah, $4 million less; Vermont, $8 million \nless; Washington State, $33 million less; West Virginia, $17 million \nless; and Wyoming, $12 million less.\n\n  Madam President, in contrast, there are some very large winners \nbecause of this accounting error. Texas, for example, is receiving a \n$183 million increase in next year's funding, which is about a 19 \npercent increase over the current year. Arizona, which borders my home \nState of New Mexico, will receive a 24 percent increase. California \nwill receive an additional $122 million over current year funding.\n  My home State's total highway funds will be cut by 12 percent unless \nwe can correct the error that the amendment of Senator Baucus seeks to \ncorrect. In our State, we have six highway department districts that \nwill have to shoulder the burden of these cuts, resulting in each of \nthose districts receiving something around $3 or $4 million less than \nin the current year.\n  Albuquerque, and that portion of my State, will be hit harder than \nother regions because it generally receives more Federal highway funds \nthan other regions. Our State and Federal funding contributions now \nhardly extend far enough to manage maintenance and upgrade of existing \nhighways, not to mention initiate new projects. This impact will most \nlikely mean that few, if any, such new projects will be initiated.\n  My real concern, Madam President--and I will conclude with this--my \nreal concern is that the impact of this accounting error is that my \nState of New Mexico will proceed, as will all the\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\nother States I have mentioned, into the debates on the reauthorization \nof the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) \nlegislation in a disadvantaged position. There are going to be lots of \ndiscussions, debate, and back and forth negotiations about highway \nfunding formulas. This is going to severely harm the 28 States that are \ngoing to have to enter those discussions with a lower baseline of \nfunding, a baseline of funding that should not have ever occurred.\n  The bottom line in all of this is that we are allowing an accounting \nerror to drive our legislative outcome, rather than the collective \nintent of the Senate. This is unacceptable. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to work with us in correcting this problem and to support \nSenator Baucus' lead on this. We have time before we leave town to \nlegislatively address the issue, particularly when we have the \nopportunity to amend the omnibus appropriations bill, which will be \ncoming to the floor in the next few days.\n  Madam President, we were not sent here to legislate based on \naccounting errors. I hope we can correct this one.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my good friend, Senator \nBingaman, from New Mexico, for his statement. The words he spoke are \ntrue. He very well characterized the nature of this problem. I \nappreciate his assistance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from Montana and \nNew Mexico in introducing a bill that will correct an accounting error \nmade by the Treasury Department in calculating highway allocations. The \nHighway Funding Fairness Act of 1996 does not change any formulas \nestablished in ISTEA, it does not affect any existing donor-donee \nrelationship.\n  Simply put, the bill merely corrects the fact that the Department of \nthe Treasury misinterpreted revenue reports because these reports were \nput in a new format. This error is acknowledged by the Treasury \nDepartment and the Federal Highway Administration. The unfortunate \nresult is that the Treasury Department grossly overstated the amount of \ngas tax receipts to the highway trust fund during 1994. With the \npassage of this bill, States will receive the funding that they are \nentitled to --no more, no less.\n  This amendment will not deny any state the full 90 percent of \npayments that they are due through the Federal Aid Highway Formula \nProgram. What this amendment will do is set these payments at 90 \npercent of what the States actually paid, rather than 90 percent of the \nTreasury's erroneous estimates.\n  Mr. President, this body is familiar with the problem this bill seeks \nto address. During consideration of the Transportation appropriations \nbill, the Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, offered an amendment to \ncorrect the mistake. This bill is identical to that amendment. After \nsignificant discussion, the Senate adopted the provision directing \nfirst that the Treasury and Transportation Departments ensure that \nthere was indeed an accounting error, a mistake, and second, that \nTreasury would be directed to correct the error.\n  Again, Mr. President, the Senate adopted that amendment. \nUnfortunately, it was dropped in conference. And here we are again, \nfaced with the prospect that, without a correction, States would \nreceive the wrong highway funding levels to which they are entitled.\n  The logic behind the Highway Funding Fairness Act of 1996 is simple, \nit is fair. Congress, in 1991, passed the landmark ISTEA law, \ncontaining the highway funding formulas. Congress should ensure that \nthose formulas are adhered to when the administration calculates \nStates' highway funds. This bill will correct the bureaucratic error \nand ensure that States receive the accurate amounts calculated under \nthe highway funding formula.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the bill, and I look \nforward to its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE:\n  S. 2124.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to transfer 31 \nacres to the Arlington National Cemetery once he determines this \nproperty is no longer needed by the Department of Defense. This land is \ncritical to the future tribute of our national heroes.\n  I believe all members of this body would agree that it is important \nto honor the men and women who have bravely fought to protect our \nliberty. Arlington National Cemetery has served the people proudly as \none of the ways our Nation pays respect to our national heroes. \nUnfortunately, the space reserved for Arlington National Cemetery is \nlimited. The additional property provided by this legislation would \nallow our Nation to honor our future champions of freedom for years to \ncome.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation which I encourage the U.S. \nSenate to overwhelmingly support. This legislation is not only a \ntribute to our fallen heroes but to the families and friends who have \nlost these valiant men and women.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for legal accountability for sweatshop conditions in the \ngarment industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                      the stop the sweatshops act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today I am introducing the Stop the \nSweatshops Act. This needed legislation attacks the exploitation of \ngarment industry workers by unscrupulous clothing manufacturers. By \nmaking clothing manufacturers liable for sweatshop practices by \ncontractors, the bill will require manufacturers to exert their \nconsiderable economic power to ensure fair treatment of garment \nworkers.\n  Sweatshops continue to plague the garment industry. Of the 22,000 \nmanufacturers of clothing and accessories in the United States, more \nthan half are paying wages substantially below the minimum wage, and a \nthird are exposing their workers to serious safety and health risks.\n  Sweatshops run by unscrupulous contractors have a long and sordid \nhistory in this country. In 1911, a tragic fire at the Triangle \nShirtwaist Co. on Manhattan's Lower East Side killed 146 young \nimmigrant women, who suffocated or burned to death because the exits \nhad been locked or blocked.\n  Eighty-five years later, conditions too often have not improved. In \nAugust 1996, four Brooklyn garment factories were closed and their \nowners arrested for operating sweatshops. Among the fire code \nviolations were locked exit doors, obstructed aisles, and violations of \nsprinkler system requirements. In addition, the contractors maintained \ntwo sets of accounting records, one showing that workers were being \npaid as little as $2.67 per hour--far less than the minimum wage. The \nworkers, all Asian immigrants, were making clothes for K-Mart. A \nsimilar sweatshop scandal came to light last spring with respect to \nclothing made for Wal-Mart stores.\n  In August 1995, Federal investigators raided a sewing factory outside \nLos Angeles. In a compound surrounded by barbed wire, agents found \ndozens of Thai and Mexican immigrant women working 20-hour days for as \nlittle as $1 per hour. The women were held captive at their sewing \ntables by guards who threatened them if they tried to escape.\n  As these examples make clear, current law is not adequate to prevent \nsuch abuses. The 800 investigators of the Department of Labor who \nmonitor compliance with wage and hour laws cannot do the job alone. \nManufacturers have the economic muscle and market power to end these \nabuses. Instead, under the current system, the market power works in \nthe wrong direction--it encourages contractors to inflict sweatshop \nconditions on employees, rather than pay fair wages and maintain proper \nworking conditions.\n  Many law-abiding manufacturers already recognize the need to stamp \nout sweatshops in the United States. But voluntary codes of conduct and \nmonitoring programs cannot eradicate the problem. K-Mart requires its \ngarment contractors to identify all subcontractors they employ and make \nregular and surprise inspections of manufacturing operations. But this \nrequirement did not prevent the fire code violations, wage violations, \nand other illegal practices of the contractors arrested in Brooklyn \nthis summer.\n  The most effective way to enlist manufacturers in the battle against \nsweatshops is to make them liable along with their contractors for \nviolations of the law. Manufacturers who know they will face liability \nwill take the steps necessary to ensure that their contractors comply \nwith applicable laws.\n  Our Stop the Sweatshops Act does just that. It amends the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to make manufacturers in the garment industry liable with \ncontractors for violations of these laws.\n  Manufacturers will be liable for injunctive relief and civil \npenalties assessed against a contractor found to have broken the law. \nThey will also be liable for back pay owed to employees for such \nviolations. Manufacturers will be liable only for violations committed \non work done for that manufacturer.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil \npenalty of up to $1,000 for each employee in cases where contractors \nfail to keep required payroll records. If the records are fraudulent, \nthe Secretary can assess penalties up to $10,000 for the first offense \nand $15,000 for further offenses. These penalties will give employers \nan incentive to keep proper records, and will punish contractors who \nattempt to conceal their abuses by maintaining two sets of records.\n  The bill sends a clear message to garment industry employers. \nExploitation of workers will not be tolerated. Sweatshops are \nunacceptable. We intend to do all we can to stamp them out, and this \nlegislation will help us achieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2128. A bill to consolidate and revise the authority of the \nSecretary of Agriculture relating to plant protection and quarantine, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                        THE PLANT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Plant \nProtection Act, a comprehensive consolidation of Federal laws governing \nplant pests, noxious weeds, and the plant products that harbor pests \nand weeds.\n\n  Over the past century, numerous Federal laws have been enacted to \naddress problems caused by plant pests and noxious weeds. While some of \nthese laws are effective tools for protecting agriculture and the \nenvironment from these threats, others are in conflict or create \nenforcement ambiguities. The Nation's agricultural community, as well \nas private, State and Federal land managers, cannot afford the \ncontinuing uncertainty caused by Federal plant pest laws, some of which \nwere enacted prior to World War I. Legislation to revise and \nconsolidate Federal plant pest laws is urgently needed and long \noverdue.\n  Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently characterized the \nproblems created by hodgepodge of Federal plant protection laws when he \nStated that ``in some instances, it is unclear which statutes should be \nrelied upon for authority. It is difficult to explain to the public why \nsome apparently similar situations have to be treated differently \nbecause different authorities are involved.''\n  A 1993 report issued by the Office of Technology Assessment reached \nthe same conclusion. The OTA found that Federal and State statutes, \nregulations, and programs are not keeping pace with new and spreading \nalien pests.\n  The Plant Protection Act will correct many, but not all, of these \nproblems. The bill I have introduced today will enhance the Federal \nGovernment's ability to combat plant pests and noxious weeds, and \nprotect our farms, environment, and economy from the harm they cause.\n  Plant pests are a problem of monumental proportions. Some of the most \ndamaging insects include the Mediterranean fruit fly, fire ant, and the \ngipsy moth. Disease pathogens include chestnut blight, which wiped out \nthe most common tree of our Appalachian forests, the elm blight, which \ndestroyed many splendid trees lining our city streets, and the white \npine blister rust, which eliminated western white pine as a source of \ntimber for several decades.\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n  Alien weeds also cause havoc, and nowhere is this problem more \napparent than in Hawaii. Because our climate is so accommodating, \nHawaii is heaven-on-earth for weeds. Alien plants such as gorse, ivy \ngourd, miconia, and banana poka are ravaging our tropical and \nsubtropical forests. Earlier this year, Hawaii's environment passed an \nunfortunate milestone: for the first time, foreign introduced plants \noutnumber Hawaii's diverse native species.\n  Hawaii is not alone in facing this problem. In fact, no State or \nregion is immune to this threat.\n  Invasive foreign weeds do more than just compete with domestic \nspecies. They transform the landscape, change the rules by which native \nplants and animals live, and undermine the economic and environmental \nhealth of the areas they infest.\n  Alien weeds fuel grass and forest fires, promote soil erosion, and \ndestroy critical water resources. They significantly increase the cost \nof farming and ranching. Noxious weeds destroy or alter natural \nhabitat, damage waterways and power lines, and depress property values. \nSome are toxic to humans, livestock, and wildlife.\n  Alien weeds are biological pollution, pure and simple. The worldwide \ngrowth in trade and travel has caused an explosion in the number of \nforeign weeds that plague our Nation.\n  Just how big is this problem? Let me offer an example. Last year, on \nFederal lands alone, we lost 4,500 acres each day to noxious weeds. \nThat's a million-and-a-half acres a year, or an area the size of \nDelaware. By comparison, forest fires--one of the most fearsome natural \ndisasters--claimed only half as many Federal acres as weeds.\n\n  Noxious foreign weeds have been called a biological wildfire, and for \ngood reason. Forests, national parks, recreation areas, urban \nlandscapes, wilderness, grasslands, waterways, farm and range land \nacross the Nation are overrun by noxious weeds.\n  The greatest economic impact of this problem is felt by farmers. The \nOffice of Technology Assessment estimates that exotic weeds cost U.S. \nfarmers $3.6 to $5.4 billion annually due to reduced yields, crops of \npoor quality, increased herbicide use, and other weed control costs. \nNoxious weeds are a significant drain on farm productivity.\n  Despite the magnitude of this problem, few people get alarmed about \nweeds. The issue certainly doesn't appear on the cover of Time or \nNewsweek. Perhaps if kudzu, a weed known as the ``vine that ate the \nSouth,'' attacked the Capitol dome, weeds would finally get the \nattention they deserve.\n  Several of these foreign weeds are truly the ``King Kong of plants.'' \nSome are 50 feet tall. Others have 4 inch thorns. Some have roots 25 \nfeet deep, and others produce 20 million seeds each year.\n  My least-favorite weed is the tropical soda apple, a thorny plant \nwith a sweet-sounding name. This import from Brazil has inch long \nspikes covering its stems and leaves. The only attractive thing about \nthis plant is its small yellow and green fruit.\n  Tropical soda apple presents a particularly difficult control problem \nbecause the fruit is a favorite among cattle. They consume the apples \nand then pass the seeds in their manure where new weed infestations \nquickly sprout. As cattle are shipped from State to State with soda \napple seeds in their stomachs you can easily see how the problem \nrapidly spreads. It's a weed control nightmare.\n  The saga of tropical soda apple prompted me to introduce S. 690, the \nFederal Noxious Weed Improvement Act in April 1995. S. 690 would grant \nthe Secretary of Agriculture emergency powers to restrict the entry of \na foreign weed until formal action can be taken to place it on the \nnoxious weed list. This legislation would prevent future tropical soda \napples from taking root.\n  I have incorporated the text of S. 690 into section 4 of the Plant \nProtection Act. Other provisions of the legislation I have introduced \ntoday are drawn from USDA recommendations for consolidating weed and \nplant pest authorities.\n  Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture's authority over plant \npests and noxious weeds is dispersed throughout numerous statutes, \nFederal efforts to protect agriculture, forestry, and our environment \nare seriously hindered. To enable the Department to respond more \nefficiently to this challenge, I have introduced legislation to \nconsolidate these authorities into a single statute. The text of this \nmeasure is drawn from draft recommendations prepared by USDA, although \nI have made some significant changes, particularly in the provisions \nrelating to weeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Plant Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the detection, control, eradication, suppression, \n     prevention, and retardation of the spread of plant pests and \n     noxious weeds is necessary for the protection of the \n     agriculture, environment, and economy of the United States;\n       (2) biological control--\n       (A) is often a desirable, low-risk means of ridding crops \n     and other plants of plant pests and noxious weeds; and\n       (B) should be facilitated by the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     Federal agencies, and States, whenever feasible;\n       (3) markets could be severely impacted by the introduction \n     or spread of pests or noxious weeds into or within the United \n     States;\n       (4) the unregulated movement of plant pests, noxious weeds, \n     plants, biological control organisms, plant products, and \n     articles capable of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds \n     would present an unacceptable risk of introducing or \n     spreading plant pests or noxious weeds;\n       (5) the existence on any premises in the United States of a \n     plant pest or noxious weed new to or not known to be widely \n     prevalent in or distributed within and throughout the United \n     States could threaten crops, other plants, plant products, \n     and the natural resources and environment of the United \n     States and burden interstate commerce or foreign commerce; \n     and\n       (6) all plant pests, noxious weeds, plants, plant products, \n     or articles capable of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds \n     regulated under this Act are in or affect interstate commerce \n     or foreign commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the immediate application of certain \norders relating to the amendment, modification, suspension, or \nrevocation of certificates under chapter 447 of title 49, United States \nCode; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    FAA EMERGENCY REVOCATION POWERS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. For several months now, I have been working with \nrepresentatives of the aviation community, with which I have been a \npart for just under 40 years, on legislation which will address the \nproblem with the Federal Aviation Administration's use of their \nemergency revocation powers. In a revocation action, brought on an \nemergency basis, the airman or other certificate holder loses the use \nof the certificate immediately without any intermediary review or by \nany kind of an impartial party. The result is that the airman is \ngrounded. In most cases, that is an airman who worked for some airline, \nand that is his or her only method of making a living.\n  Simply put, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this emergency power to \nprematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support \nsuch drastic action. A more reasonable approach where safety is not an \nissue would be to adjudicate the revocation on a nonemergency basis, \nallowing the certificate holder continued use of his certificate.\n  Do not misunderstand: In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA \nshould not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical \nto safety that the FAA have the ability to ground unsafe airmen. \nHowever, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of \nthe extraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly \ndemonstrates a pattern whereby the FAA uses their emergency powers as \nstandard procedure rather than extraordinary measures. Perhaps the most \nvisible case has been that of Bob Hoover.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have flown in a lot of air shows over the last \n40 years, and I can tell you right now the one person that you ask \nanyone who has a background like mine, ``Who is the hero within the \nindustry,'' it has been Hoover. He is getting up in years but is\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\nas sharp as he ever was. Something happened to him. He is probably the \nmost highly regarded and accomplished aerobatic pilot today. In 1992, \nhis medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions \nregarding his physical condition. After getting a clean bill of health \nfrom four separate sets of doctors over the continuing objections of \nthe Federal air surgeon, who never examined Bob personally, his medical \ncertificate was reinstated only after the Administrator, David Hinson, \nintervened.\n\n  I say at this point, I have been a strong supporter of Administrator \nDavid Hinson. I have often said that he is probably the very best \nappointment that President Clinton has made since he has been \nPresident. I also say there is not a lot of competition for that title.\n  He already has more serious problems coming. His current medical \ncertificate expires this coming Monday, September 30, 1996. Unlike most \nairmen, like myself, when mine expires I go down, take a physical that \nlasts approximately 30 minutes, and it is reinstated at that time, \nsomething that happens every 12 months.\n  Bob Hoover's experience is one of many. I have several other examples \nof pilots who had licenses revoked on an emergency basis, such as Ted \nStewart, who has been an American Airlines pilot--who I know \npersonally--has been an American Airlines pilot for 12 years and is \npresently a Boeing 767 captain. Until January 1995, Mr. Stewart had no \ncomplaints registered against him or his flying. In January 1995, the \nFAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining authority as part of a larger FAA \neffort to respond to a problem of falsifying records.\n  Now, there was never any indication that Mr. Stewart was involved in \nthat, but, nonetheless, that was part of the investigation. He was \nexonerated by the full NTSB, National Transportation Safety Board, in \nJuly 1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the \ncharges in the second revocation involved falsification of records for \na flight instructor certificate with a multiengined rating and his air \ntransport pilot, ATP, certificate dating back to 1979.\n  Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17\\1/2\\-year-old \nviolation could constitute an emergency, especially since he has not \nbeen cited for any cause in the intervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA \nvigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its \ndecision in this second revocation and found in favor of Mr. Stewart.\n  A couple of comments in Mr. Stewart's decision bear closer \nexamination. First, the board notes that ``the Administrator's loss in \nthe earlier case appears to have prompted further investigation of the \nrespondent * * *'' I found this rather troubling, that an impartial \nthird party appears to be suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta \nagainst Ted Stewart, which is further emphasized with the footnote in \nwhich the board notes:\n\n       [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the \n     Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency \n     certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in \n     this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no \n     legitimate reason is cited or appears for not \n     consolidating all alleged violations into one proceeding, \n     subjecting an airman in the space of a year to two \n     emergency revocations, and thus to the financial and other \n     burdens associated with an additional 60-day grounding, \n     without prior notice and hearing, constitutes an abuse and \n     unprincipled discharge of an extraordinary power.\n\n  Mr. President, I obviously cannot read the minds of the NTSB, but I \nbelieve a reasonable person would conclude from these comments that the \nboard believes, as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency revocation \npowers by the FAA.\n  This is borne out further by the fact that, since 1989, emergency \ncases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB have more \nthan doubled. In 1989, the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of \nthose, 66 were emergency revocation cases, or 5.96 percent. In 1995, \nthe NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases, and of those 160 were \nemergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that \nthe FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice.\n  In response, I am proposing legislation which would establish a \nprocedure whereby the FAA must show just cause for bringing an \nemergency revocation action against an airman.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. President, the FAA opposes this language. But \nthey also oppose the changes to the civil penalties program where they \nserved as judge, jury, and executioner in civil penalty actions against \nairmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that just a couple of years \nago so that airmen can now appeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. \nThis has worked very well because the NTSB has a clear understanding of \nthe issues.\n  My proposal allows an airman, within 48 hours of receiving an \nemergency revocation order, to request a hearing before the NTSB on the \nemergency nature of the revocation--not whether or not the revocation \nwas justified, but the emergency nature of the revocation. The NTSB \nthen has 48 hours to hear the arguments and decide if a true emergency \nexists. During this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect. \nIn other words, the airman loses use of his certificate for 4 days. \nHowever, should the NTSB decide an emergency does not exist, then the \ncertificate would be returned to the airman and he could continue to \nuse it while the FAA pursued their revocation case against him in a \nnormal manner. If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then \nthe emergency revocation remains in effect and the airman cannot use \nhis certificate until the case is adjudicated.\n  This bill is supported by virtually all of the major aviation groups, \nsuch as the Air Transport Association, the Allied Pilots Association, \nthe Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Experimental Aircraft \nAssociation, the NTSB Bar Association, and many others.\n  My intention in introducing this bill today is to get it out so that \ninterested groups can look at it and work with me to make changes, if \nthat is necessary. I am pleased that Senator McCain, who is the \nchairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of Commerce, has agreed to hold a \nhearing on this in the 105th Congress. In the intervening time, I will \nbe working to make sure this issue is fully vetted, and it is my hope \nthat we will be able to address this issue very early in the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n\n  S. 2131. A bill to establish a bipartisan national commission on the \nyear 2000 computer problem; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\nTHE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM NATIONS COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my last in a \nseries of warnings to the 104th Congress. I warn of a problem which may \nhave extreme negative economic and national security consequences in \nthe year 2000 and beyond. It is the problem of the Year 2000 Time Bomb, \nwhich has to do with the transition of computer programs from the 20th \nto the 21st century. Throughout history, much forewarning of the \nmillennium has been foolishly apocalyptic, but this problem is not \ntrifling.\n  Simply put, many computer programs will read January 1, 2000 as \nJanuary 1, 1900. Outwardly innocuous, the need to reprogram computers' \ninternal clocks will not only cost billions, but if left undone--or not \ndone in time--all levels of government, the business community, the \nmedical community, and the defense establishment could face a maelstrom \nof adverse effects. Widespread miscalculation of taxes by the Internal \nRevenue Service; the possible failure of some Defense Department \nweapons systems; the possibility of misdiagnosis or improper medical \ntreatment due to errors in medical records; and the possibility of \nwidespread disruption of business operations due to errors in business \nrecords.\n  Mr. Lanny J. Davis, in his thoughtful analysis of the dilemma \npresented in an article in the Washington Post of September, 15, 1996, \ncited one industry expert who called the Y2K defect--as the computer \nliterate call it--``the most devastating virus to ever infect the \nworld's business and information technology systems.'' Mr. Davis also \ntabulated the cost: ``Current estimates for business and government \nrange from $50 billion to $75 billion--and will only increase as 2000 \ndraws closer.''\n\n  Moreover, it seems the problem is not limited to main frame computers\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nas once was thought. In an article entitled ``Even Some New Software \nWon't Work in 2000,'' the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, \nSeptember 18, 1996, that owners of personal computers will be affected \nas well. Mr. Lee Gomes wrote: ``In fact, tens of millions of PC owners \nwill be affected. Current or very recent versions of such best sellers \nas Quicken, FileMaker Pro and at least one brand-new program from \nMicrosoft will stumble at the approach of Jan. 1, 2000. There will be \nhardware hiccups, too. Many PC owners will have to take extra steps to \nteach their systems about the new millennium.''\n  Early in 1996, John Westergaard first informed me of this impending \nproblem. I asked the Congressional Research Service to assess its \nextent. In July, CRS reported back and substantiated the doomsayers' \nworst fears. I immediately wrote to the President, alerted him to the \nproblem and suggested that a presidential aide--a general perhaps--be \nappointed to take responsibility for assuring that all Federal agencies \nand Government contractors be Y2K date-compliant by January 1, 1999. No \nword back yet.\n\n  Over the past few weeks I have periodically updated my colleagues in \nthe Senate as to the nature of this problem, the possible costs of the \nproblem, and advances in thinking about the problem. The business \ncommunity has begun to stir, but it seems all is quiet here in the \nNation's capital, or nearly quiet.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to establish a nonpartisan commission \non the year 2000 computer problem. It will be composed of 15 members--\nfive selected by the President; 5, the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, and 5, the Speaker of the House of Representatives--in \nconsultation with the minority leaders respectively. The commission \nwill study the problem, analyze its costs, and provide immediate \nrecommendations and requirements for the Secretary of Defense, the \nPresident, and Congress. Because of the urgency of this problem, the \ncommission will complete its study and make its report to the President \nby December 31, 1997. The onus is now on us to see this bill passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize this problem, and help establish \nthis Commission. As Mr. Davis warned, we have begun a ``Countdown to a \nMeltdown.'' The longer we delay, the more costly the solution and the \nmore dire the consequences. The computer has been a blessing; if we do \nnot act in a timely fashion, however, it could become the curse of the \nage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article of \nWednesday, September 18, 1996, entitled ``Even Some New Software Won't \nWork in 2000,'' by Lee Gomes, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 18, 1996]\n\n               Even Some New Software Won't Work in 2000\n\n                             (By Lee Gomes)\n\n       In his syndicated newspaper column this past July, \n     Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates answered an anxious \n     reader's question about whether PC owners have to worry about \n     the ``Year 2000 problem,'' which is now roiling the world of \n     corporate mainframes.\n       ``Most PC users won't be affected,'' wrote Mr. Gates. \n     ``There shouldn't be much of an issue with up-to-date \n     software. Microsoft software, for instance, won't cause \n     problems.''\n       The reply may have been reassuring, but it was also wrong. \n     In fact, tens of millions of PC owners will be affected. \n     Current or very recent versions of such best-sellers as \n     Quicken, File Maker Pro and at least one brand-new program \n     from Microsoft will stumble at the approach of Jan. 1, 2000. \n     There will be hardware hiccups, too. Many PC owners will have \n     to take extra steps to teach their systems about the new \n     millennium.\n       The date rollover will trip up computers because \n     programmers have tended to use only two-digit numbers to \n     represent years--``96'' instead of ``1996''--assuming that \n     all dates would be in the 20th century.\n       As a result, 40 months from now, unfixed computers will \n     calculate, for example, that ``00'' is ``1900,'' and thus an \n     earlier date than ``99,'' and decline to perform certain \n     functions.\n       The good news is that fixing any Year 2000 problems on PCs \n     will seem like a picnic compared with the data-processing \n     nightmare now occurring in the corporate world. For PC \n     owners, a few simple steps will usually take care of things--\n     assuming users can identify the problem.\n       But, as Mr. Gates's two-month-old column suggests, the fact \n     that the Year 2000 is a PC issue at all will come as a \n     surprise to many, including some in the industry. \n     At Microsoft, the company has realized only in the past \n     few weeks that some of its own software is not ``Year 2000 \n     compliant.'' Many other software companies, when first \n     asked, said they had no Year 2000 difficulties, only to \n     call back a few days later to report that they had found \n     some after all.\n       Unlike mainframe makers, though, PC companies don't have \n     much excuse for having problems. Mainframe programmers took \n     short cuts during the '60s and '70s because computer memory \n     was then a precious commodity. But some PC programmers \n     followed that lead, even after memory was no longer in short \n     supply and the new millennium was much closer. The moral: \n     Even in an industry whose leaders often portray themselves as \n     social and technical visionaries, companies can suffer from \n     old-fashioned short-sightedness.\n       So what exactly is the problem? Many PC software programs \n     allow users to enter years using either a four-digit or two-\n     digit format that can lead some PC programs astray. Intuit \n     Inc.'s Quicken financial program, for example, lets people \n     schedule future electronic payments up to a year in advance. \n     Come late 1999, a user trying to set up a payment for ``01/\n     10/00'' will get a message saying, in effect, that it's too \n     late to make a payment for 1900. To schedule the payment, \n     users will have to know enough to type ``01/10/2000'' or use \n     a special Quicken shortcut.\n       The fall release of Quicken will fix the problem, says Roy \n     Rosin, the Quicken for Windows product manager at Intuit. The \n     company didn't fix it before because ``it just wasn't on the \n     radar screen.'' The new Quicken, he adds, will assume that \n     any two-digit date occurs between 1950 and 2027; a four-digit \n     year date can still specify a date outside that period. The \n     approach is a common one for Year 2000 compliant software.\n       Microsfot's problem arises with Access 95, the database \n     program that was shipped last August with Windows 95. Like \n     Quicken, Access 95 doesn't properly handle two-digit dates \n     after ``99,'' says Douglas S. Dedo, who is handling most Year \n     2000 questions for Microsoft.\n       Doesn't that show a lack of foresight by Microsoft \n     programmers? ``I couldn't agree with you more,'' replies Mr. \n     Dedo. He says the omission will be corrected in the next \n     version of the product, to be released next year. As with \n     Quicken, Access 95 users can work around the problem by using \n     a four-digit date.\n       Microsfot's operating systems, by themselves, don't have a \n     Year 2000 problem, says Mr. Dedo, and neither do such major \n     company products as the Excel spreadsheet program.\n       There is, though, an annoying problem with the basic date-\n     keeping portion of a PC's hardware, called the CMOS, says Tom \n     Becker of Air System Technologies Inc. in Miami. In this \n     case, the blame belongs to International Business Machines \n     Corp. and the basic PC design it set down in the mid-1980s. \n     It turns out, Mr. Becker says, that the CMOS is something of \n     a dolt in keeping track of centuries. As a result, many PC \n     owners will need to manually reset the date to the Year 2000 \n     the first time they use their machines in the 21st century.\n       Mr. Dedo says that Microsoft's newer operating systems, \n     Windows 95 and Windows NT, will fix hardware date glitches \n     automatically. He adds that the company is also working on \n     fixer programs that will do the same for older DOS and \n     Windows 3.1-based machines.\n       Year 2000 difficulties will probably occur mainly on the \n     IBM compatible side of the house. Apple Computer Inc.'s \n     Macintosh computer has no such problems, says an Apple \n     spokesman.\n       But some recent Apple programs do, including both the Mac \n     and Windows versions of FileMaker Pro, a popular database \n     project that the Apple-owned Claris Corp. shipped until last \n     December. For forthcoming versions, says Claris's Christopher \n     Crim, the company took pains to make sure all dates were \n     converted from two to four digits before being stored. \n     ``We've learned our lesson,'' Mr. Crim says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11294-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11313-S11314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1044, a bill to \namend title III of the Public Health Service Act to consolidate and \nreauthorize provisions relating to health centers, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1505, a bill to reduce risk to \npublic safety and the environment associated with pipeline \ntransportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Abraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1965, a bill to prevent \nthe illegal manufacturing and use of methamphetamine.\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\n                                S. 2030\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2030, a bill to \nestablish nationally uniform requirements regarding the titling and \nregistration of salvage, nonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Baucus] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2034, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to make certain changes to hospice \ncare under the Medicare Program.\n\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2047, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the application of the pension \nnondiscrimination rules to governmental plans.\n\n\n                                S. 2057\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the names of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] and the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 2057, a bill to amend title 38, United States \nCode, to make permanent the authority of the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs guarantee loans with adjustable rate mortgages.\n\n\n                                S. 2101\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kerry, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2101, a bill to provide educational assistance to the dependents of \nFederal law enforcement officials who are killed or disabled in the \nperformance of their duties.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 285\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the name of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 285, a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of State should \nmake improvements in Cambodia's record on human rights, the \nenvironment, narcotics trafficking and the Royal Government of \nCambodia's conduct among the primary objectives in our bilateral \nrelations with Cambodia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11313-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               FAIRCLOTH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 5402\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mr. Simon, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. \nAbraham) proposed an amendment to the joint resolution (S.J.

CHANG\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words \nabout Taiwan's new Foreign Minister, John H. Chang.\n  Mr. Chang's selection as Foreign Minister at this crucial moment in \nrelations between mainland China and Taiwan is particularly \nappropriate, because his background represents the complexity of the \ncross-straits relationship writ small. Born on the mainland in the \nmidst of the Second World War, Chang came with his family to Taiwan in \n1949.\n  Although a mainlander by background, Minister Chang grew up among \nlocal Taiwanese and became equally comfortable speaking Mandarin, \nTaiwanese, and Hakka. He has been able to bridge the tensions between \nTaiwanese and mainlanders that have marked much of the island's postwar \npolitics. Among the first KMT leaders to open a dialog with opposition \nmembers, Minister Chang served as a key player in the talks between the \ngoverning party and the Taiwanese opposition in the years leading up to \nthe democratizing reforms of the late 1980's. Earlier this year, Chang \nwon the highest percentage of votes of any candidate in Taiwan's \nassembly elections.\n  Minister Chang is a skilled diplomat and a seasoned negotiator. His \npresence in President Lee Teng-hui's cabinet should be a force for good \nin cross-straits relations.\n  Mr. President, I request that an article on Minister Chang from the \nAsian Wall Street Journal be placed in the Record at this point to \nfurther acquaint my colleagues with Minister Chang and his background.\n\n          [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, June 21, 1996]\n\n           Chang Aims To Expand Taiwan's Role on World Stage\n\n                           (By Leslie Chang)\n\n       Taipei.--By his second day in office, Taiwan's foreign \n     minister was hearing the first attacks from China: He is \n     ``untrustworthy'' and ``betraying (his) family.''\n       Mention of the criticisms, attributed to Beijing sources \n     and reported in a Hong Kong newspaper, elicits only a \n     diplomatic ``no comment'' from John Chang, in his first \n     interview since joining the new cabinet of Taiwan President \n     Lee Teng-hui last week. But in an hour long conservation in \n     the ministry's lushly appointed reception room, lined with \n     framed photographs of the career diplomat with everyone from \n     Mikhail Gorbachev to Bob Hope, the 55-year-old Mr. Chang \n     isn't always so circumspect.\n       ``It is mainland China which has complicated the issue, \n     which has confused all the world,'' asserts Mr. Chang, \n     speaking of a year of heightened tensions between Beijing and \n     Taipei.\n       As Mr. Chang takes on the touchiest of ministerial \n     portfolios amid that standoff, such broadsides and rebuttals \n     seem a fitting start. After all, the very existence of his \n     job is irritating to Chinese leaders, who regard Taiwan as a \n     Chinese province, which shouldn't pursue its own foreign \n     policy. And Mr. Chang likely will work aggressively to beef \n     up the island's ties with other countries, analysts say, \n     while his good relations with the president ensure a more \n     seamless foreign policy than ever before.\n       ``His profile will be higher'' than that of his \n     predecessor, Fredrick Chien, predicts Chou Yu-kou, who has \n     written a biography of Mr. Chang's mother as well as three \n     biographies of Taiwan's current president. Mr. Chang's \n     ``voice can be louder; he can push hard for `pragmatic \n     diplomacy,' '' Ms. Chou says, referring to Mr. Lee's policy \n     of establishing formal ties with as many nations as possible.\n       One reason Mr. Chang can step up these efforts lies in his \n     unusual background: He is a grandson of Chiang Kai-shek, who \n     ruled China for two decades before fleeing with his \n     Nationalist troops to Taiwan in 1949, defeated by the Chinese \n     Communists in a civil war. Mr. Chang and a twin brother who \n     died earlier this year were the illegitimate offspring of a \n     wartime affair between Chiang Ching-kuo, the general's son \n     and later Taiwan's president, and a woman he met in the \n     southern Chinese province of Jiangxi, who died shortly after \n     the twins were born.\n       But Mr. Chang and his twin brother, who came to Taiwan in \n     1949 and were raised by their maternal grandmother, were \n     unaware of their illustrious parentage until they went to \n     college, according to Ms. Chou's book. While most main \n     landers settled in Taipei, speaking the official Chinese \n     Mandarin dialect among themselves and dominating all top \n     government and military posts, the boys grew up in the \n     smaller northern city of Hsinchu and spoke the local \n     Taiwanese and Hakka dialects.\n       ``I was brought up . . . with native children,'' says Mr. \n     Chang. ``I see no differences between mainlanders and \n     Taiwanese.'' Mr. Chang's viewpoint is unusual on an island \n     where ethnic differences often lie just beneath the surface. \n     Such close associations with local Taiwanese people, he \n     believes, helped him garner the highest percentage of votes \n     island-wide in March elections to Taiwan's National Assembly.\n       The combination of an elite mainland background and \n     Taiwanese sympathies also gives Mr. Chang the clout to do \n     things his way. As a rising star in Taiwan's diplomatic corps \n     in the late 1970s, Mr. Chang was one of the first government \n     officials to initiate contact with antigovernnment \n     politicians, many of whom had fled abroad and faced treason \n     charges if they returned. Mr. Chang helped some of those \n     politicians to get off the government's blacklist and return \n     to Taiwan.\n       ``He was pretty open, willing to take (such) risks,'' \n     recalls C.J. Chen, a vice minister of foreign affairs who has \n     known Mr. Chang for more than two decades. At the same time, \n     he adds, ``because of his background, people would have \n     little doubt about his loyalty.''\n       Acquaintances describe Mr. Chang as liberal-minded and full \n     of energy. In his previous post as Overseas Chinese Affairs \n     Commissioner, for example, Mr. Chang shook up the sleepy \n     cabinet-level position by expanding contacts with overseas \n     Chinese communities around the world. In January, he hosted a \n     high-profile breakfast meeting in Washington between Taiwan \n     politicians and some of their U.S. counterparts, including \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n       At a news conference last week, while other new cabinet \n     members shuffled papers and rattled off statistics, Mr. Chang \n     addressed each reporter by name and gave colorful responses. \n     Asked which was more\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\n     important, Taiwan's foreign policy or its policy toward the \n     mainland, he responded, ``If you are going fishing, is it the \n     hook or the line that is important?''\n       Already, Mr. Chang is signaling a shift in tone from that \n     of his predecessor, Mr. Chien, who held the more conciliatory \n     stance that policy toward the mainland took precedence over \n     foreign policy. It is Mr. Chang's stepped up efforts to raise \n     Taiwan's international profile that has led some in Beijing \n     to accuse him of betraying the ideals of his father and \n     grandfather, who had hoped that the island would one day \n     reunify with the mainland.\n       On some points, Mr. Chang strikes softer notes. Taiwan's \n     continuing efforts to join international organizations, he \n     says, will focus more on ``functional agencies'' such as the \n     World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World \n     Trade Organization.\n       And while Taiwan will continue its efforts to take a more \n     active role in the United Nations--the move on the \n     international stage that most angers Beijing--Mr. Chang notes \n     that Taiwan isn't formally seeking U.N. membership, but \n     rather, it asks only that the U.N. study the issue of the \n     representation of Taiwan, which hasn't been a member of the \n     world body since 1971.\n       But in the next breath, Mr. Chang says he is planning \n     overseas trips for later this year, and hopes to sign on new \n     countries ``who want to have formal relationships with us,'' \n     adding to the 31 nations that currently recognize Taiwan.\n       Which new countries might those be? The diplomatic veil \n     drops again. ``You will hear about it,'' he promises, \n     smiling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11315-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A NEW MARSHALL PLAN FOR THE EAST\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Chicago Tribune had an editorial \ncalling for a Marshall plan for Eastern Europe.\n  That really makes sense. I know that between now and election day \nwe're not going to hear calls from our leaders for this, but after \nelection day, I hope that will happen.\n  It would take courage, just as the original Marshall plan took \ncourage. After President Truman and General Marshall announced the \nplan, the first Gallup Poll showed only 14 percent of the American \npublic supporting it.\n  But what a great thing that was for the United States and the world; \nand let me add we need a Marshall plan for our domestic scene, \nparticularly urban America.\n  President Clinton was not correct when he said that this is the end \nof the era of big Government.\n  The question is not whether the Government is big or small but \nwhether it is good, whether it is doing the things that need to be \ndone.\n  There are needs today in Eastern Europe and in the cities of our \ncountry. My hope is that the next President of the United States--and \nmy hope is that it will be Bill Clinton--and the next Congress will \nshow greater leadership than we have shown in foreign affairs and \ndomestic affairs these last 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this editorial from the Chicago Tribune be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                    A New Marshall Plan for the East\n\n       Sometimes the martial mind can discern more accurately than \n     others how this nation should pursue its interests short of \n     war. Think of Gen. George C. Marshall, who traded in his \n     olive-drab for pinstripes after World War II and, as \n     secretary of state, drafted the inspired plan (that now bears \n     his name) to inject billions of dollars into the charred \n     economies of Western Europe to create stable conditions in \n     which democracy thrived and communism was held at bay.\n       Now that the Western democracies have won the Cold War, \n     along comes another general with a compelling vision for \n     America's role in Europe.\n       U.S. Gen. George Joulwan, the NATO supreme commander, \n     argues that the Cold War's conclusion is not a time for \n     America to disengage from Europe but to ``consolidate the \n     gains of democracy.'' In military terms, he says, ``When you \n     take an objective, the first thing you think about is not \n     pulling back from the objective but of securing it.'' And the \n     Western democracies, he says, have not yet consolidated their \n     gains among the fragile, emerging democracies to the east.\n       True enough. But it is the method by which Joulwan proposes \n     to achieve that consolidation--expansion of NATO--that gives \n     us pause.\n       Pentagon troop strength in Europe, which forms the backbone \n     of the Western alliance, has dropped to 100,000 from a Cold \n     War high of 350,000.\n       Joulwan argues for expanding NATO eastward. That is the \n     determination of both the North Atlantic Council that governs \n     NATO and of his own commander in chief, President Clinton. \n     (Republican challenger Bob Dole also favors allowing former \n     Warsaw Pact states into NATO.)\n       But no military threat requires expanding NATO, \n     particularly at a time when the wounded Russian bear would \n     feel caged, provoked.\n       True, partnership training exercises between NATO and the \n     armies of the East can teach discipline, order and the \n     powerful concept of control over the military by a \n     democratically elected civilian government. But even Joulwan \n     avers that America ``stands for much more than ships, tanks \n     and planes. It stands for shared values that are sought in \n     the rest of Europe.''\n       Military alliances are no substitute for political and \n     economic integration, and that is the best way to share \n     western values with Central and Eastern Europe. Proof of that \n     rests in the dusty archives of American diplomacy, in a \n     proposal mostly forgotten as a casualty of the Moscow-\n     Washington competition.\n       It's not widely remembered, but the Marshall Plan \n     envisioned America's investing billions of dollars in Eastern \n     Europe--yes, even in Russia--as well as in the West. Moscow \n     vetoed that aid, so Marshall's visionary proposal benefited \n     Western Europe alone.\n       Time to dust that plan off. The successor administration of \n     the Marshall Plan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation \n     and Development, is alive and healthy today. Along with \n     European Union membership and American guidance, it \n     represents the best strategy for integrating the new \n     Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11316-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MERRILL MOORE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Merrill \nMoore, an experienced and devoted journalist who has become a living \nlegend in upper east Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Merrill Moore is \nrecognized by many in his community as the steadfast anchorman on WCYB-\nTV in Bristol. For 30 years, he has been one of the most trusted and \nmost watched journalists in the five State area.\n  Moore began his career in radio broadcasting as a student at East \nTennessee State University [ETSU]. He was a familiar radio personality \non WETB, the college radio station, and remained active in broadcasting \nthroughout his college career. After 2 years of military service, Moore \nreturned home to the tri-cities area and to the radio booth.\n  Mr. President, at the urging of his colleagues Moore moved to WCYB-TV \nin Bristol where he worked his way through the ranks. In 1962, Moore \nanchored his first newscast at 11 p.m. and by 1964, he was anchoring \nthe 6 p.m. newscast. Thirty-four years later, Merrill Moore has reached \nthe pinnacle of his broadcasting career. In those years, he has covered \ncountless national and local events and has had the opportunity to \ninterview Presidents Ford, Carter, Bush, and Clinton.\n  Most importantly, Moore has had the opportunity to witness the growth \nof the tri-cities area. Many of his reports have spanned the beginning \nand completion of area projects, such as the construction of the East \nTennessee State University Medical School and the highway connecting \nthe tri-cities to Asheville, NC. He has been a main source of \ninformation to the community from the drawing board to the dedication \nof many area improvements. And he never fails to provide an up-to-date \nand informative newscast.\n  Recently, Merrill Moore was awarded the prestigious George Bowles \nBroadcast Journalism Award for his many years of dedication to WCYB-TV \nand the tri-cities area. The award, presented by the Virginia \nAssociation of Broadcasters, is an annual honor given to successful \nbroadcast journalists that are respected by their peers and the \ncommunity. It also honors journalists for their devotion to their work \nand the amount of insight they bring to the stories they cover. Merrill \nMoore most certainly qualifies for this award and has maintained these \nhigh standards for many years.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask you to join me in applauding the \nefforts and continued service that Merrill Moore has provided upper \neast Tennessee and south west Virginia. His commitment to the tri-\ncities is to be admired by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11316-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11316-S11317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OBJECTION TO CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 1296\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the \nprograms sponsored by the National Endowment for Democracy and the four \ncore groups that are part of the endowment family. For a very modest \ninvestment from the U.S. Government, this nongovernment organization \nhas accomplished remarkable achievements in promoting democratic \ninstitutions, advancing the norms of a civil society, and furthering \nthe principle and practice of market economics abroad. NED has \ncontributed significantly to the foreign policy goals of the United \nStates.\n  It is exciting to chronicle the rich and positive role the NED has \nplayed in the promotion of American political values since its \ninception in 1983. It has been helpful in winding down the cold war in \nEastern and Central Europe, in facilitating democratic transition, \ngrowth and consolidation in Asia and Latin America, and in supporting \nproponents of human rights and freedom in all geographic regions of the \nglobe and in more than 90 countries.\n  Rather than listing the additional successes of NED, I ask that a \nstatement entitled ``The United States Needs The National Endowment for \nDemocracy'' be inserted in the Record for all Members to read. The \nstatement was drafted by the Forum for International Policy whose \npresident is Brent Scowcroft and whose chairman is Larry Eagleburger. \nThey, along with virtually every individual who served in the positions \nof National Security Advisor and Secretary of State in every \nadministration since 1983 have endorsed the NED's work and support its \nfull funding. I ask all Members to read this statement carefully.\n  The material follows:\n\n      The United States Needs the National Endowment for Democracy\n\n       The United States' only international political foundation, \n     the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), is under threat. \n     Establishment in 1983, the Endowment operates openly and \n     independently to support individuals, groups and institutions \n     who are working to promote and consolidate democracy in their \n     own countries. Although it is federally funded and subject to \n     Congressional oversight, NED is not a government agency. An \n     independent, non-partisan board of directors sets its \n     policies and strategies. The Endowment channels its support \n     directly to grantees or through four core institutes: the \n     Center for International Private Enterprise, the \n     International Republican Institute, the Free Trade Union \n     Institute, and the National Democratic Institute for \n     International Affairs. They, too, are independent of any \n     government direction. The House of Representatives has \n     approved an appropriation for fiscal 1997 of $30 million, \n     reflecting no increase over the current level. The Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, however, has recommended that \n     funding be eliminated entirely on the grounds that the \n     Endowment is a Cold War institution which has outlived its \n     usefulness. That is a short-sighted judgment and should be \n     reversed.\n       In 1983, President Ronald Reagan called for a non-\n     governmental institution along the lines of political \n     foundations in other Western democracies. The National \n     Endowment for Democracy was created to assist the transition \n     to modern, pluralistic, particularly systems in other \n     countries within the context of their own individual \n     histories, cultures and traditions. The United States has \n     fundamental and enduring interests in the promotion of \n     American political values and ensuring the spread of \n     pluralism, freedom and democracy throughout the world. \n     Pursuit of those interests is no less important today than it \n     was at the height of the Cold War. Our own national security \n     and economic prosperity are no less at stake. NED and its \n     core institutes are uniquely able to accomplish this task by \n     the employment of non-governmental structures untainted by \n     direct association with the U.S. Government.\n       At the official level, our choice of instruments to pursue \n     democracy support strategies is limited. The Agency for \n     International Development's (AID) focussed programs have been \n     effective, but they reflect the immediate priorities of any \n     administration in office (or of actively interested members \n     of Congress). Because of the way they are funded and \n     operated, the emphasis of AID programs is too often on short \n     to medium-term results. They are managed by federal employees \n     in accord with bureaucratic rules and regulations. AID's \n     ``official'' programs require us to work with host \n     governments or at least with their tacit acceptance. The \n     State Department, the United States Information Agency, and \n     other federal agencies as well, promote democracy, but they, \n     too, must operate within limits and norms set for official \n     government representatives in foreign lands. NED and its \n     institutes, however, are able to use their resources to \n     nurture the development of grass roots democratic movements \n     and long-term processes which must grow from within. NED \n     operates where there is no official U.S. presence and it is \n     not obligated to work through official channels. NED is not \n     driven by the short-term imperatives which often, quite \n     legitimately, drive government decisions and actions.\n       The Endowment's non-governmental approach has worked. \n     Through its low-cost programs NED does openly and aboveboard \n     what our government is not able to do: it supports monitoring \n     of elections, conferences and exchanges in Russia on party \n     organization, polling methods, publicity and the nuts and \n     bolts of open elections which have been credited with \n     contributing to the success of democratic forces in the \n     recent elections. In the Central Asian Republics it has \n     funded civic education centers. In Slovakia it supports \n     teacher-training workshops to introduce citizenship education \n     into primary and secondary schools. In Bosnia it has kept an \n     important source of news alive. It helps sustain Burma's \n     hard-pressed democratic movement. It supported grass roots \n     education for Palestinian voters. In Mexico it aids a \n     coalition that focuses on electoral reform, political \n     participation and accountability of public officials. NED \n     even funds initiatives to strengthen democracy and human \n     rights movements in Cuba. In many instances, however, despite \n     free elections and outward signs of change, the transition to \n     more deeply-rooted, stable democracy is incomplete or even at \n     risk. It is in our interest to sustain NED's efforts because \n     today's initiatives are no less important than those of the \n     past.\n       Signs that America is prepared to disengage from the \n     important work of fostering democracy are unsettling to our \n     allies and do not serve our national interests. The National \n     Endowment for Democracy has proven itself to be a cost \n     effective, long-term investment in America's security. It \n     would be a mistake to eliminate it. The Senate should restore \n     funding for the National Endowment for Democracy as approved \n     by the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11317-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE FORGOTTEN INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE LATIN AMERICANS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most shameful episodes in \nour Nation's history was the internment of Japanese-Americans during \nWorld War II. In response, although belatedly, Congress enacted in 1988 \nthe law providing reparations to those who were uprooted and sent to \ninternment camps.\n  There is another group of people who suffered the same injustice, but \nare ineligible for redress under the law. As detailed in a recent \narticle in the Los Angeles Times, more than 2,200 Japanese Latin \nAmericans were taken from their homes in 13 countries, mostly from \nPeru, and brought to the United States to be detained. Most spent the \nwar in a camp in rural Texas, and some were even held until 1948. The \nU.S. Government never officially acknowledged a reason for this policy. \nSince the Japanese Latin Americans were not legal residents of the \nUnited States at the time of their internment, they are not eligible \nfor an apology or reparations. Clearly, this injustice demands a \nremedy.\n  Of those who were forcibly brought to the United States, only 200 \nwere allowed to return to Latin America. Others returned to Japan, \nwhile many stayed in the United States and eventually became citizens. \nSome 300 applications by Latin American Japanese for redress under the \n1988 law have been denied because they were not legal residents before \nthe law's June 1946 cutoff date.\n  The article gives an account of a journey of a detention ship that in \n1944 was steaming from South America to the United States escorted by \ndestroyers and submarines. In the year of the invasion of Normandy, not \nto mention the war in the Pacific, it is astounding that our Nation saw \nfit to devote military resources to this shameful and questionably \nlegal undertaking.\n  I have written Senator Inouye, who authored the 1988 reparations \nbill, to see if something can be done. While I will not be in the \nSenate next year, I hope that my colleagues will consider legislation \nin the next Congress to provide payments to family members of the \nJapanese Latin American who were detained. After so many years, that \nwould be the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11317-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VIC HELLARD, JR.\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman who dedicated most of his career to making Kentucky government run \nmore smoothly. For over 20 years, Vic Hellard, Jr., who passed away \nSeptember 18, worked behind the scenes as the glue that held the \nKentucky General Assembly together.\n  Vic Hellard was born and raised in Versailles, KY, the son of a Ford \ndealer. He received his undergraduate degree from Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity and earned a law degree from the University of Kentucky. In \nfact, Vic and I attended law school together. He later practiced law in \nVersailles and was twice elected to the State House of Representatives.\n  After a year as chief counsel to House Speaker Bill Kenton, Mr. \nHellard was hired as director of the Legislative Research Commission--\nthe administrative and research arm of the General Assembly. He held \nthis position from 1977 until his retirement in 1995. This career \nspanned a period of sweeping change in Kentucky government.\n  Former House Speaker Bobby Richardson told the Courier-Journal, \n``Vic's legacy is that he turned the LRC into a professional, informed \nsupport staff for the legislature, which allowed the legislature to \nbecome an equal partner with the governor.''\n  Attorney General Ben Chandler said of Mr. Hellard, ``He was the \nshepherd of legislative independence, but he never accepted the credit \nhe deserved for anything he did. That was part of his charm.''\n  Mr. Hellard was also known for remaining above the fray. He was \nalways courteous to lawmakers regardless of their party affiliation or \nseniority. He always avoided partisan and factional rivalries.\n  Vic Hellard, Jr. is survived by his wife, Ellen Carpenter Hellard, \nhis mother, Leona Tilghman Hellard, and two brothers, George D. and \nRonald W. Hellard. I ask that my colleagues join me in paying tribute \nto this outstanding Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11318-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11318-S11319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AD HOC HEARING ON TOBACCO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 11, I cochaired \nwith Senator Kennedy an ad hoc hearing on the problem of teen smoking. \nWe were joined by Senators Harkin, Wellstone, Bingaman, and Simon. \nRegrettably, we were forced to hold an ad hoc hearing on this pressing \npublic health issue because the Republican leadership refused to hold a \nregular hearing, despite our many pleas.\n  Yesterday I entered into the Record the statements of the Senators \nwho attended the hearing. Today I am entering the testimony of the \nwitnesses from the first panel which included Justin Hoover, a 12-year-\nold addicted to tobacco, and his DARE officer, Jody Hayes.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony from the first panel of this \nad hoc hearing be printed in the Record.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n             Testimony of Justin Hoover, September 11, 1996\n\n       Hello, my name is Justin Hoover. I am twelve years old and \n     a sixth grader at Clegg Park Elementary School in West Des \n     Moines, Iowa.\n       I would like to tell you how I became addicted to \n     cigarettes. I tried my first cigarette when I was six years \n     old. My mother smokes and always kept a carton of cigarettes \n     in her bedroom. I would see her go into her drawer and take a \n     pack of smokes out every now and then. I had an older brother \n     that was fifteen then and saw him and my mother smoking all \n     the time. I wanted to be older than I was and thought smoking \n     was cool and would show everyone that I wasn't a little kid. \n     One day I stole a pack of cigarettes from my mother's drawer, \n     went outside and smoked four or five. My little sister told \n     my mother I was smoking. She found me smoking them. My mother \n     told me that I was never to smoke again or I would be in big \n     trouble. She said that even though my brother and her smoked, \n     it wasn't a good thing to do.\n       I didn't smoke again until I was nine. I started again \n     because I thought it was the cool thing to do. I saw people \n     smoking on T.V. shows, when we went out to eat, driving down \n     the street on billboards and in stores I would always see \n     tobacco advertisements especially Joe Cool for Camel \n     cigarettes and I always thought it looked kind of cool. I \n     started sneaking cigarettes from my mother again I did that \n     for awhile until I needed more than just one or two a day. I \n     started to steal cigarettes and sometimes chewing tobacco \n     from stores. Sometimes I would sneak out of the house to \n     steal them from convenience stores late at night because that \n     was when the clerk was in the back room a lot making it \n     easier to get away with. I tried to stop three times, but \n     never made it longer than five days before I started again. I \n     would smoke butts that I found in the ashtray at the store \n     across the street. Sometimes I would pick up a bunch of used \n     butts, take several of them and pour the unused tobacco on a \n     piece of paper and try to roll my own. Sometimes I would drop \n     the cigarettes in the house burning the carpet and furniture. \n     One night I fell asleep and dropped a cigarette on the bed. \n     It caught fire and we had to put it out. No one was hurt.\n       I am now smoking seven cigarettes a day. One in the \n     morning, and six after school and before bedtime. Officer \n     Hayes and my mother have tried to help me stop, I have come \n     close, but can't completely stop.\n       When I was told that I was going to come to Washington, DC, \n     I was embarrassed to tell people what I have done. But I know \n     that smoking is bad for me and can affect my health. I don't \n     want my little brother and sisters to start smoking. My \n     brother who is three acts like his crayons are cigarettes \n     because he sees all of us smoking. If things don't change, I \n     am sure he will follow in my footsteps. That would make me \n     feel bad.\n       I believe the only way I will be able to stop smoking is if \n     I can't get them. If stores make them harder to steal, and \n     there are no more vending machines that sell them, I think I \n     could stop. As for my brother and sister, if I don't smoke, \n     and they don't see cigarettes on T.V. or billboards I think \n     they have a better chance of not using them and becoming \n     addicted to cigarettes like me.\n       Everyone else in my life has tried to help me stop smoking \n     cigarettes. My mother, my brother, Officer Hayes, teachers, \n     my principal and my counselor at school. I came here today \n     for myself and my brother and sister. I hope you can help us.\n\n              Testimony of Jody Hayes, September 11, 1996\n\n       My name is Jody Hayes. I am a Police Officer with the West \n     Des Moines Police Department located in Iowa. I have been an \n     officer for seven years. I have served as a patrol officer on \n     the street for three of those years. For the past four years \n     I have been a community relations officer. I teach a wide \n     variety of safety education programs to the public, with my \n     primary responsibility focused on teaching drug awareness to \n     the youth of West Des Moines. I do this through the D.A.R.E. \n     program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education). I am here today to \n     share with you my concern over tobacco use among youth.\n       As a police officer, I have had the unfortunate experience \n     of seeing how bad the drug problem in society really is. I \n     see kids as young as twelve years old walking home from \n     school with cigarettes in their hand. The police department \n     has hundreds of cases on file where youth have been caught \n     trying to steal cigarettes from stores because they're not \n     old enough to purchase them. Our high school kids cross the \n     street at lunchtime to smoke their cigarettes so they don't \n     get in trouble by the school for smoking on the grounds. It \n     is not uncommon to see twenty or thirty teenagers smoking \n     across from the school during and after it lets out. There \n     are countless teenagers in our community that have worn a \n     hole in their jeans from carrying a chewing tobacco can in \n     the back pocket. Tobacco use among teenagers is the worst I \n     have ever seen.\n       Some parents that I talk with say ``Well, if all they do is \n     smoke or chew tobacco, then that's not so bad. It's not like \n     they're doing drugs.'' The D.A.R.E. curriculum, which is \n     currently taught to children in every state within America, \n     defines the word drug as this: Any substance other than food \n     that can affect the way your mind and body work. Some people \n     would lead you to believe tobacco doesn't affect both your \n     mind and body.\n       First, let us consider if it affects the body. What about \n     the high school athlete that used to be the best in his/her \n     class that has now taken up smoking? They can't make it \n     around the track during practice, or run down field to catch \n     a pass during the big game, or even swim an entire lap in the \n     pool because the cigarettes have limited their oxygen intake? \n     What about the band or chorus member who can't seem to manage \n     enough air to play their instrument or to reach the next note \n     they have to sing? What about the deadly diseases that seem \n     to follow tobacco use, like cancer or emphysema? What about \n     gum disease and yellow teeth? What about the tar left behind \n     in their lungs causing them to wake every morning to the \n     sound of coughing and hacking and their body trying to flush \n     the poison out of it's system? Yes, tobacco does affect the \n     way the body works.\n       Does tobacco affect the mind? An addiction is defined in \n     the dictionary as this: ``To become psychologically or \n     physiologically dependent upon something.'' Since the word \n     psychological refers to the mind and behavior, I think it \n     would be safe to say yes, tobacco does affect the way your \n     mind works. It is called addiction. Thus, tobacco is indeed a \n     drug that is both affecting our children's minds and bodies \n     during the most vulnerable time in their life.\n       Cigarettes are a gateway drug, meaning they are opening the \n     door for our youth to experiment with a world of even more \n     deadly drugs. After tobacco comes marijuana. ``Why not,'' the \n     child asks. Why not try marijuana, I'm already getting smoke \n     in my lungs from\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\n     the cigarettes. After that comes all of the other drugs that \n     society continues to lose children to, cocaine, heroin, \n     methamphetamines, and LSD. The list goes on and on. We have \n     to stop where drug use starts and that is with tobacco.\n       We can not allow the tobacco industry to brainwash our \n     children, through colorful cartoon billboards and \n     advertisements, into believing tobacco use as a hobby that is \n     fun to do. We can not allow them to advertise tobacco \n     products as a glamorous habit to be involved with to feel \n     grown-up. Children are too vulnerable to expect them to \n     resist these types of pressure. As a D.A.R.E. officer, I know \n     how hard it is to convince youth to stand up to peer \n     pressure, to face challenges in their life; not escape them, \n     and to ignore the curiosity surrounding drugs. The last thing \n     our children need is another type of pressure in their life. \n     Tricky advertising techniques by the tobacco industry attempt \n     and often succeed in luring kids to try their product. They \n     place cartoon billboards where children play and go to \n     school. They give away thousands of promotion products such \n     as T-shirts, ball caps and jackets that we see children \n     wearing around the community. They get T.V. role models and \n     athletes the kids look up to to advertise their products. \n     Lastly, they portray tobacco use as the grown-up thing to do, \n     which again influences children that want to feel older, only \n     need to smoke to do so. It is a known fact that most children \n     will always want to be older than they are. This type of \n     advertising plays on that wish. I was surprised to learn the \n     tobacco industry can deduct the cost of advertising from \n     their taxes. This alone is an incentive for them to advertise \n     more often. I was personally glad to see Senator Harkin \n     introduce a bill that would put an end to such a ridiculous \n     tax deduction.\n       The fact is we can not change a child's wish to feel older. \n     Although, we can change what they do to feel older. We can \n     take away the billboards advertising tobacco where our \n     children play and go to school, and put up positive messages \n     against drug use for them to see. We can make stricter \n     consequences for tobacco vending that sell to under age \n     buyers without checking their identification prior to the \n     sell. We can get rid of the vending machines that offer \n     tobacco products to any one with enough change in their \n     pocket to buy them no matter the age. We need to put a stop \n     to free tobacco samples and promotional items such as caps, \n     shirts and jackets. We need to use our role models in society \n     to promote drug awareness instead of drug use. Lastly but \n     most importantly, we need to educate our children \n     continuously as to the harmful effects of tobacco use.\n       Yes, tobacco is a drug that will extinguish a child's \n     dreams and goals.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nfamilies of Harvey Hill and Paul St. Pierre and all the residents of \nNorth Charlestown, NH, who renovated a 105-year-old two-room building \nto provide additional space for the Farwell School. The philanthropy of \nthe Hill and St. Pierre families and their community is truly \ncommendable. Last month, the residents of North Charlestown gathered \nfor a ribbon-cutting ceremony, a family-style barbeque, and soccer \ngames to celebrate the recent opening of the new Farwell School.\n  Harvey Hill and his wife, Christina, who are North Charlestown \nresidents, donated $450,000 for the construction of the old Farwell \nElementary School. He is the Editor of the Claremont Eagle Times and a \nsuccessful businessman in North Charlestown. Hill is a graduate of the \noriginal Farwell School and has a daughter who now attends the new \nelementary school. Before the addition was built, Hill's daughter was \nbused to the North Walpole School, which took a total of 2 hours every \nday. The Hill and the St. Pierre families have tried several times to \nget a bond passed, but were unsuccessful. Harvey and his wife are \npleased to have helped with the education of the children in the Fall \nMountain School District.\n  The St. Pierre Family also contributed an enormous sum for the \nconstruction of the new school. Paul and Rolande St. Pierre are parents \nof thirteen children and operators of a successful construction \nbusiness in North Charlestown. The family donated part of the land for \nthe addition of the Farwell School. Additionally, the St. Pierres \nperformed much of the construction and site work for the building, and \ndonated $125,000. The St. Pierre family, like the Hill family, did not \nwant North Charlestown children to have to ride the bus for two hours \nevery day.\n  The extra space in the Farwell School provides several advantages for \nthe community of North Charlestown. For the last 16 years, 45 of the 80 \nstudents now attending the new Farwell School were bused to the North \nWalpole School 16 miles away. Not only do these North Charlestown \nchildren now attend school closer to home, but the transfer of the \nstudents frees up more space in the North Walpole School. The expansion \nof the Farwell School has helped decrease the problem of overpopulation \nin the Walpole School.\n  The Farwell Trust, the group that previously owned the building and \nland, donated the existing building, valued at $150,000, and the 5-acre \nproperty, valued at $100,000, to the Fall Mountain Regional School \nDistrict. This gift freed the Farwell School from having to pay rent. \nThese savings combined with savings from the elimination of two bus \nroutes to neighboring North Walpole will save the school district \nmoney.\n  Before the Hill and St. Pierre families offered their donations, Fall \nMountain voters rejected a new school for several years. In response \nresidents and volunteers worked hard to raise $58,000 in donations, \nwhich arrived in the forms of money, supplies, and other essential \ngifts. Even with these donations, the new elementary school still would \nnot have been possible without financial assistance from the Hill and \nSt. Pierre families.\n  The students who now attend the Farwell School appreciate the \ncommunity's hard work and dedication in making their school truly the \nschool that volunteers built. They are also grateful for the tremendous \ngift the Hill and St. Pierre families have given them. Indeed, the \nyoung children of North Charlestown are enthusiastic about their new \nschool. How wonderful to know that the children of America, who are the \nfuture of our country, are eager to receive an education.\n  The expansion of the Farwell School would not have been possible \nwithout the generous donations from the residents of North Charlestown. \nI commend the Hill and St. Pierre families for their generous \noutpouring of support, and all the volunteers who made the Farwell \nSchool expansion possible. The North Charlestown residents should be \nvery proud of their new school. They have given such a wonderful gift \nto the children in their community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11319-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11319-S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S 250-MILLIONTH VEHICLE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate \nOctober 8, 1996 as a day on which the citizens of my State, and indeed \nthe entire country, can take great pride in the milestone of a true \nMichigan institution: Ford Motor Co. For on this day, the 250-millionth \nFord vehicle will roll off the assembly line.\n  In 1903, the first Ford Model A was built by 10 employees in a small \nconverted wagon factory in Detroit. More than nine decades later, Ford \nstill \ncalls Michigan home, maintaining its world headquarters in Dearborn. It \nis from these Michigan roots that Ford has grown into its present \nstatus as a\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nglobal corporation. Ford cars, trucks and components are made in 185 \nplants in 36 countries on 5 continents and sold in over 200 markets. \nLast year, worldwide sales revenues surpassed $137 billion, factory \nproduction exceeded 6.6 million vehicles, and the company employed more \nthan 346,000 workers.\n  No car company has contributed more to America's love affair with the \nautomobile than Ford From the Model T to the F-Series pickup to the \nEscort, Ford has built and sold some of the bestselling nameplates in \nautomotive history. Other Ford classics, such as the Mustang and the \nThunderbird, remain American cultural icons.\n  Evidence of the positive impact of Ford Motor Co. isn't limited to \nour roads and highways. The results of founder Henry Ford innovative \nadaption of the moving assembly line to automotive production, higher \nvolumes at lower costs, revolutionized industrial manufacturing \npractices around the globe. And Henry Ford 1914 announcement that he \nwould pay $5 for an eight hour work day, twice the going rate, spawned \nthe creation of high-skilled, high-wage jobs for American automotive \nworkers.\n  It is often said that Ford Motor Company ``put the world on wheels,'' \nand I like to believe Michigan played an integral role in this \naccomplishment. Our State has always offered an exceptional standard of \nliving for its residents, in no small measure due to the presence of \nFord, its suppliers and customers. On behalf of my colleagues, I \ncongratulate Ford and its employees on this special occasion, and look \nforward to celebrating future milestones with Ford Motor Co. and its \nhome State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11319-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MONGOLIA\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to add to the words of \npraise for Mongolia expressed yesterday by Senator Thomas, chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, when he introduced \nlegislation to extend nondiscriminatory trade status to that country.\n  Mongolia has made striking advances toward the development of a \ndemocratic political system and a free market economy. This past July, \nMongolians went to the polls and resoundingly voted into Government the \nDemocratic Opposition Party, ending 75 years of control by Communists \nand their heirs. The new Government's peaceful assumption of power \nunderscores Mongolia's rise to the front ranks of Asian democracies. \nThe new Government in Ulaanbataatar, moreover, has outlined an \nambitious plan for faster and continued economic liberalization and \npolitical reform.\n  Given these and other developments, I look forward to considering \nlegislation granting to Mongolia nondiscriminatory trade status early \nin the next Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11320-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA TROOP NO. 55 ON THE \n                   OCCASION OF THEIR 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nNew Hampshire Boy Scouts of America Troop No. 55 as they celebrate \ntheir 75th anniversary. Troop 55 has diligently served the New \nHampshire town of Meredith and the New England region for 75 years. The \ntroops members and their family and friends will celebrate this \nimpressive milestone on September 28th in Hesky Park, Meredith, with a \nspecial presentation and a cookout. I am proud to congratulate Troop 55 \nfor 75 years of dedication to New Hampshire and New England.\n  Boy Scout Troop 55 was founded in January 1921 by the Whittier Men of \nthe First Congregational Church of Meredith. Today, Troop 55 is \nsponsored by the Meredith Kiwanis Club. For 75 years, Troop 55 has \naccomplished a long history of achievement and service to their \ncommunity. While the Troop has a number of accomplishments, their area \nof specialty is the preservation of elm trees throughout New England. \nTo preserve the elm trees, Troop 55 uses Dutch Elm trees, which are \nespecially resistant to disease. The members of Boy Scout Troop 55 \nparticipate in the planting of these special Dutch Elm trees throughout \nNew England. To further the use of Dutch Elm trees, Boy Scout Troop 55 \nhas their own nursery of trees.\n  Troop 55 of Meredith is also very proud of 10 of their members who \nhave attained the Eagle Scout status. To become an Eagle Scout, a young \nman must earn badges for citizenship in the community, citizenship in \nthe Nation, and citizenship in the world. The Eagle Scout designation \nis the highest attainable rank for a young man. Those who achieve it \nhave every reason to be proud.\n  The Boy Scouts of America promote citizenship, character-building, \nand community service among the boys of our country. This organization \nalso provides respectable, solid role models for the youth of our \nNation and teaches them about commitment, dedication, and hard work. \nMembers of the Boy Scout Troops of America learn valuable skills that \nserve them for a lifetime. I am proud to honor such an outstanding Boy \nScout troop in New Hampshire. Congratulations to all the members of \nTroop 55 on reaching this remarkable milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11320-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11320-S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                       U.S.C. 1754(b), FOR TRAVEL AUTHORIZED BY DEMOCRATIC LEADER FROM APR. 3 TO 12, 1996                                                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Tom Daschle:                                                                                                                                                                            \n    Croatia................................

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on (H.R. 3259) and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3259) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1997 for \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States Government, the Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System, and for other purposes, having met, after full and \n     free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 24, 1996.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to submit for my \ncolleagues' consideration the conference report on H.R. 3259, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. As you know, the \nSenate passed its authorization bill only last week and this may be an \nunprecedented turnaround time from passage of our bill to consideration \nof the conference report. For this, I want to thank House Chairman \nLarry Combest for his outstanding management of what could have been a \ndifficult effort at reconciling our two bills. Ranking Member Norman \nDicks and Vice Chairman Robert Kerrey played equally valuable roles in \nfinding the right balance between ardently advocating their positions \nand ensuring eventual passage of this important legislation.\n  The rapid progress of this conference report is all the more \nnoteworthy in that, in addition to the usual annual authorization of \nexpenditures for intelligence and intelligence-related activities, this \nyear's authorization bill adds important new provisions to the National \nSecurity Act of 1947 designed to help the Director of Central \nIntelligence [DCI] exert stronger direction and control over the \nintelligence community.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that under the National Security Act the \nDCI wears three hats: principal intelligence adviser to the President \nand the National Security Council; Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency; and head of the intelligence community, which is composed of 13 \ndifferent intelligence agencies.\n  For a variety of reasons, a long succession of DCI's have devoted \nalmost all of their time and energy to their first two jobs--advising \nthe President and running the CIA--and have given short shrift to the \nthird--managing the intelligence community. The result has been an \nunfortunate lack of coordination and focused effort by our various \nintelligence agencies. This is not to say that our intelligence \nagencies have not been successful. The opposite is true: the United \nStates has the premier intelligence apparatus in the world. But because \nthey are scattered among so many different departments and agencies \nthey have not been able to operate as efficiently and effectively as \nthey could.\n  Title VIII of the conference report--the Intelligence Renewal and \nReform Act of 1996--contains provisions intended to strengthen the \noverall management of the intelligence community.\n  In particular, to help the DCI perform his community \nresponsibilities, title VIII establishes a new Senate-confirmed Deputy \nDirector of Central Intelligence for Community Management and three new \nSenate-confirmed Assistant Directors of Central Intelligence. Since the \nNational Security Act was enacted in 1947, there have been only two \nstatutory positions to manage the intelligence community: a Director of \nCentral Intelligence and a Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. The \ntime has come to give the DCI a better community management structure. \nThe conference report provides that the DDCI for Community Management \nwill manage an intelligence community staff and will direct \ncommunitywide functions, including personnel, resources, requirements, \ncollection, research and development, and analysis and production. Each \nof the three Assistant DCI's will oversee communitywide efforts in a \nparticular functional area: collection, analysis and production, and \nadministration.\n  I should mention that the DCI has expressed some concern about \nwhether the three Assistant DCI's should all be\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nPresidential appointments subject to Senate confirmation. While noting \nthe DCI's concerns, a majority of the conferees concluded that the \nadvantages of Senate-confirmation outweigh any potential disadvantages. \nIn light of the fact that the three Assistant DCI's will be responsible \nfor coordinating functions that cut across a number of different \ndepartments and agencies, the conferees determined that Senate \nconfirmation is necessary to ensure that each of these individuals has \nsufficient stature and focus to impose a more cohesive and coherent \nprocess for allocating resources in each of these key functional areas.\n  The DCI has also questioned whether Senate confirmation of the \nAssistant Directors is warranted given the limited authority vested in \nthese positions. In fact, the statutory authority vested in these \npositions is the full authority of the DCI for each respective area. \nThus, the actual authority exercised by the Assistant Directors will \ndepend in large measure on the authority the DCI chooses to delegate \nand support.\n  In addition to creating a better intelligence community management \nteam, the bill gives the DCI significant new management authorities. \nFor example, the Secretary of Defense will be required to obtain the \nDCI's concurrence--or note the DCI's lack of concurrence--before \nrecommending an individual to the President to be Director of the \nNational Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the \nnew National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The DCI will also have to be \nconsulted regarding the appointments of the heads of the smaller \nintelligence community elements, including the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and \nthe FBI's National Security Division. In addition, separate provisions \nadded to this year's DOD authorization bill require the DCI to submit \nan annual performance evaluation of the heads of the major defense \nintelligence agencies to the Secretary of Defense. These provisions are \nvery significant. Previously, the DCI had little or no say in the \nappointments or evaluation of the heads of the major operating elements \nof the intelligence community.\n  I should note that the Director of the FBI objected strenuously to \nrequiring the DCI to be consulted before the Attorney General appoints \nthe head of the FBI's National Security Division. Director Freeh \nappeared to be concerned that requiring consultation might somehow make \nthe FBI Director appear to be subservient to the DCI. In response to \nthese concerns, the conferees agreed to modify the original Senate \nprovision to require the FBI Director to give the DCI timely notice of \nhis recommendation of an individual to fill the position, and to give \nthe DCI an opportunity to consult. While agreeing to these changes, the \nconferees noted that the Director of the National Security Division \nmanages a significant portion of the national intelligence budget and \nconcluded that it is wholly appropriate to give the DCI some voice in \nhis or her appointment.\n  In addition to having a stronger voice in appointments, the DCI is \ngiven new statutory authority to participate in the preparation of \ndefense intelligence budgets and to be consulted with respect to \nreprogrammings of funds among defensewide intelligence activities. For \nthe first time, the DCI is also given the statutory right to establish \nintelligence collection requirements and priorities, and to resolve \nconflicts in collection priorities.\n  I also want to take a moment to address the press reports that \nopposition from the Department of Defense killed intelligence reform \nthis year. It is true that bureaucratic resistance to change threatened \nreform efforts and that both the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees agreed to scale back some of their proposals in the interest \nof ensuring passage of the bill. However, many very significant \nprovisions remain. The conference report gives the DCI important new \nauthorities to manage the intelligence community and, for the first \ntime in 50 years, establishes a new intelligence community management \nstructure. We expect these provisions will go far to make the \nintelligence community operate more effectively and more efficiently. \nIn short, to paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of the death of \nintelligence reform are greatly exaggerated.\n  With the end of the 104th Congress, we mark a significant milestone \nin the history of this Senate, the executive branch, and most of all, \nthe intelligence community. Twenty years ago, on May 19, 1976, the \nSenate adopted Senate Resolution 400, establishing the Select Committee \non Intelligence. The following day, May 20, 15 Senators were appointed \nto this committee, with Senator Inouye as its Chairman and Senator \nHoward Baker its Vice Chairman. Thus, from the very beginning, the \nnonpartisan nature of the committee was reinforced with the seating of \na Vice Chairman rather than a ranking member. This nonpartisan attitude \nhas continued for 20 years, with the Chairmen and Vice Chairmen working \ntogether overseeing U.S. intelligence, and at the same time ensuring \nthat this important instrument of national security is maintained.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief statement \noutlining the impressive history of this committee be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. Speaker, the conclusion of the 104th Congress also marks the end \nof my term as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \nThanks in large measure to the commitment of the Vice Chairman, Senator \nBob Kerrey, and a dedicated staff, it has been a productive tenure. \nBeginning in early 1995 with the confirmation of a new Director of \nCentral Intelligence and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and \nculminating with the passage today of significant legislation to \nstrengthen the ability of the intelligence community to meet the needs \nof the post-cold-war world, the past 2 years have seen this committee \naddress virtually all of the important national security issues \nconfronting the country. Through hearings, intensive inquiries, \ncommittee reports, and legislation, the SSCI has examined the growing \ntransnational threats of terrorism, narcotics, proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, organized crime, and economic espionage. We have \ncontinued the committee's focus on counterintelligence and the fallout \nfrom the treachery of Aldrich Ames, reopened longstanding inquiries \ninto the role of the intelligence community in Central America, \nexplored the risks and benefits of economic intelligence collection, \noverseen intelligence support to military operations in Bosnia, the \nPersian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, and elsewhere, and provided insights to \nthe Senate on intelligence-related aspects of arms control.\n  The role that the Vice Chairman has played in these committee \nendeavors cannot be overstated. Senator Kerrey brings a keen mind and \ndeep personal commitment to the committee's task of ensuring that this \ncountry has the best possible intelligence capability--one that is \neffective, efficient, and operates in a manner fully consistent with \nAmerican laws and values. The Vice Chairman and I have not always \nagreed on every aspect of every issue, although the areas of \ndisagreement have been remarkably rare. Senator Kerrey has always \napproached these issues with characteristic grace and good humor. A \ndetermined advocate, he nevertheless finds ways to work through \nproblems in a principled manner totally devoid of partisanship. As \nthose of you who have had the privilege to serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee know, the issues do not all have the glamour of James Bond \nadventures or the sensationalism of front page scandals. Senator Kerrey \nhas shown a willingness and an acumen for tackling even the most \ntechnical and obscure aspects of the committee's work where the \neffectiveness of our intelligence capability is at stake.\n  Senator Kerrey's outstanding attributes are echoed in his staff \ndirector for the committee, Chris Straub. Mr. Straub has brought the \nsame kind of nonpartisan professionalism to his work for the committee \nover the past 8 years. I have always found Chris fair, tough, and \nknowledgeable.\n  I also want to recognize Art Grant, the minority deputy staff \ndirector, whose command of the complex and at times arcane world of \nintelligence satellites has contributed greatly to the committee's \noversight responsibilities in this area.\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\n  Which brings me to the committee's staff director, Charles Battaglia. \nWhen I first joined the committee in 1984, I was determined to hire a \nstaff person with extensive intelligence experience and an excellent \nreputation within his field. I was lucky enough to find someone who not \nonly had these qualities but also possessed the patience, perspective, \nand perseverance that are essential to a successful working \nrelationship in this hectic institution. It was Charles Battaglia who \nurged that the committee move from the designee system, where each \nMember could bring on their own staff person--often resulting in \nstaffers with little or no intelligence background who's focus was more \non individual Member issues than on the core work of the committee--to \na fully professional, nonpartisan staff. This was not an easy \ntransition, but Charles Battaglia has managed to ensure Members' needs \nare met without sacrificing the essential work of the committee staff. \nThe result is a stronger, more cohesive staff and committee. Mr. \nBattaglia has been an excellent manager, valued adviser, and good \nfriend.\n\n  In addition, I would like to thank the other members of the committee \nstaff, particularly Suzanne Spaulding, the committee's general counsel, \nand her legal staff, Mark Heilbrun and John Bellinger, for their hard \nwork on this legislation and on the many legal issues which have \nconfronted the committee over the last 2 years; senior staff member Ed \nLevine, who has led the committee's inquires into issues such as the \nflow of Iranian arms into Bosnia and human rights abuses in Guatemala, \nmanaging to draft committee reports on these potentially divisive \nissues in a manner that is fair, accurate, and thorough; the \ncommittee's budget director, Mary Sturtevant, whose mastery of every \nnook and cranny of the dispersed and complex intelligence community \napparatus has been essential to our oversight function; and Pat \nHanback, whose audit team has provided professional, detailed reviews \nof areas of oversight concern and has made many important \nrecommendations for improvements.\n  I would like to express my gratitude as well to the committee's \nsupport staff for its professionalism in the face of continuing \ndemands. Jim Wolfe, the committee's security director, and his staff \ndid yeoman work in successfully maintaining the security of a vast \narray of classified material. Kathleen McGhee, the committee's chief \nclerk, and the rest of the staff literally made the engine run. I will \nthank each of them personally at a later time.\n  Mr. President, the outstanding efforts of the entire committee staff \nand membership is reflected in this Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1997 and I urge its passage.\n\n     The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Twenty Years of \n                         Intelligent Oversight\n\n       The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was established \n     in 1976 directly as a result of the Senate Select Committee \n     to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence \n     Activities, or the Church Committee, which was set up to \n     examine allegations of intelligence abuses by various \n     intelligence agencies. The findings of this Committee were \n     ample evidence that existing Congressional mechanisms were \n     inadequate to meet the need for continual, focused, \n     institutionalized oversight of the Intelligence Community.\n       The Intelligence Committee responded promptly to the need \n     for changes highlighted by the Church Committee. Working with \n     the Judiciary Committees of each house, the intelligence \n     committees developed legislation known as the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 which, for the first \n     time, required that a court order be obtained from a special \n     court established under the Act as a condition for \n     undertaking electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes \n     within the United States. Prior to that time, such \n     surveillance had been carried out without a search warrant or \n     court order, pursuant to the asserted constitutional \n     authority of the President. The Committee, in the 95th \n     Congress, also was the first to begin work on legislation to \n     address the problem of ``Graymail'', i.e., the threat by \n     defendants to disclose highly classified information if they \n     were prosecuted. The committees were instrumental in the \n     enactment of the Classified Information Procedures Act of \n     1980, which established statutory procedures for handling \n     classified information involved in a Federal criminal \n     proceeding.\n       Perhaps the most striking fact that we encounter when we \n     look back 20 years, however, is how many of the issues then \n     confronting the Committee are still relevant. Hearings were \n     held in 1977 on the question of whether or not to declose the \n     bottom line amount of the intelligence budget, a question \n     with which we are still wrestling. The Committee looked into \n     the involvement of the National Security Agency in developing \n     the Data Encryption Standard. Today, we are looking into the \n     development of new encryption standards in an effort headed \n     by NSA. Again, in the 95th Congress the Committee published a \n     case study on ``Activities of `Friendly' Foreign Intelligence \n     Services in the United States.'' Presently, in Congress we \n     are looking into activities within the continental United \n     States of the intelligence services of allies and adversaries \n     in the field of economic espionage. The Committee also \n     published its first report on terrorism in the 1970's.\n       One of the most important activities of the Senate Select \n     Committee in the 1970's was its involvement in S. 2525, The \n     National Intelligence Reorganization and Reform Act of 1978, \n     for out of this effort was born the duty of the Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that both the House and Senate \n     Intelligence Committees were ``fully and currently informed \n     of all the national intelligence activities,'' to include, \n     ``any significant anticipated intelligence activity.'' This \n     has proven to be central to the Committee's ability to carry \n     out its oversight responsibilities.\n       As we moved into the 1980's, a new Administration brought a \n     new Director of Central Intelligence. The legislative \n     underpinnings in place were to be sorely tested in the coming \n     years, but in the end, they held up under great pressure. In \n     the early 1980's the Committee looked into and reported on \n     such disparate matters as the U.S. capability to monitor the \n     SALT II treaty; Soviet succession; political violence in El \n     Salvador; the Soviet presence in the United Nations; unrest \n     in the Philippines; and renewed counterintelligence and \n     security concerns in the United States. In 1983 the Committee \n     hired, as a full time staff employee, a Court Reported \n     because of the sensitivity of hearing information. The Select \n     Committee on Intelligence remains the only Committee of \n     either House to have a Reporter as a staffer.\n       In late November 1986, the Select Committee on Intelligence \n     was the first Committee to begin an investigation into the \n     Iran-Contra matter. Between the initiation of its \n     investigation on December 1, 1986, and the publication of its \n     public report on January 29, 1987, the Select Committee held \n     over 50 hearings and interviews into the Iran-Contra matter. \n     Following these events, S. 1721, the Intelligence Oversight \n     Act of 1987, and S. 1818, the National Security Act of 1987, \n     were introduced and brought clearly into focus the need \n     for agreement between the Administration and the Congress \n     on reporting requirements and covert action finding \n     notification.\n       The Committee reported on many other matters of concern \n     during 1987 and 1988. An extensive investigation resulted in \n     a report on the security at the United States mission in \n     Moscow and other areas of high risk. An exhaustive Committee \n     and staff inquiry resulted in the publication of a report on \n     the monitoring and verification of the Treaty on the \n     Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range Missiles, \n     the INF Treaty. The Committee further investigated and \n     reported on the FBI's mishandling of a domestic case \n     involving the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El \n     Salvador, or CISPES. While the Committee determined that \n     there were improprieties in the FBI investigation, it also \n     determined that this was an aberration, and that the Bureau \n     continually held to the high standards that were demanded of \n     it.\n       The 1980's were also the ``Decade of the Spy.'' By the end \n     of 1987, over 20 Americans had been implicated in espionage \n     or were investigated on counterintelligence grounds. In \n     hindsight, we now know that beginning with the Walker-\n     Whitworth, Pollard and Pelton cases in 1985, was Aldrich \n     Ames, who began his traitorous career in 1985 and lasted \n     until 1994.\n       Following hearings in 1987 and 1988, the Committee \n     established an independent Inspection General for the CIA. \n     This legislation was included in the Intelligence \n     Authorization Act of 1990, and the first statutory Inspection \n     General at the Central Intelligence Agency was confirmed in \n     the fall of that year.\n       In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair, legislation was \n     introduced with the objective of clarifying the roles of the \n     President and the Congress in approving and overseeing \n     intelligence activities, particularly covert actions. The \n     legislation also provided that Presidential finding must be \n     written, and defined what a covert action is and is not. \n     After much negotiation, the FY 1991 bills was signed into law \n     in August 1991.\n       Convinced of the growing threat posed to international \n     stability by the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, the Committee, through the FY91 Intelligence \n     Authorization Bill, instructed the DCI to establish a \n     mechanism to deal with these growing threats. This led to the \n     development of the DCI's Nonproliferation Center to look into \n     the spread of chemical biological and nuclear weapons.\n       Robert M. Gates, who had been Deputy Director of Central \n     Intelligence under Director Casey, had been nominated for the \n     position of DCI after Director Casey's death in 1987. He \n     pulled his nomination when Members raised questions about his \n     role in Iran-Contra. In mid-1991 he was again nominated to \n     the Director of Central Intelligence. The confirmation \n     hearings for Mr. Gates to be\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\n     DCI in September and October 1991 were unprecedented in terms \n     of their scope and substance. Eight days of hearings were \n     held, including seven in public session. The nominee's role \n     in the so-called Iran-Contra affair was explored at length, \n     as were allegations that during the tenure of the nominee as \n     Deputy Director for Intelligence the nominee undertook \n     actions resulting in the ``politicization'' of intelligence, \n     or the shaping of intelligence for political purposes. At the \n     conclusion of the Committee's inquiry, the Committee issued a \n     225 page report of its findings. In the end, the nomination \n     was approved by the Committee and subsequently approved by \n     the full Senate.\n       In October 1992, the Committee began an inquiry into the \n     Intelligence Community's role in the Banca Nazionale del \n     Lavoro, or BNL, affair. This initial inquiry by the Committee \n     resulted in a full staff investigation of the matter. After \n     an intensive investigation, the staff prepared a 163 page \n     report released on February 4, 1993, which focused on the \n     Intelligence Community's involvement in the affair, and found \n     numerous institutional weaknesses in the relationship between \n     intelligence and law enforcement, as well as serious errors \n     in judgment by officials of the CIA, the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency, and the Department of Justice.\n       Other efforts by the Committee in 1992 included the \n     Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992, which \n     fostered the release of materials concerning the \n     assassination of President John Kennedy; a report on the \n     Treaty on the Reduction of Limitation of Strategic Offensive \n     Arms, or START; and many other activities surrounding \n     chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, Iraqi disarmament, \n     covert action, and so forth.\n       Counterintelligence rose to the fore with the February 1994 \n     arrest of CIA employee Aldrich Ames. After extensive hearings \n     the Committee issued an analysis of the Ames case in November \n     1994. In addition to criticizing the leniency of the internal \n     disciplinary actions promulgated by the DCI, the Committee \n     found ``numerous and egregious'' shortcomings in the handling \n     of the Ames case. In its report, the Committee proposed 23 \n     separate recommendations for change at the agency.\n       Counterterrorism jumped to the front with the January 1993 \n     murder of two CIA employees at the main gate to CIA \n     headquarters, and a month later the bombing of the World \n     Trade Center in New York City.\n       Economic intelligence also emerged in the 1990's to lay \n     claim to the time and assets of the Intelligence Committee \n     and the Intelligence Community. Unfortunately, one of the \n     more noteworthy events which combined the new direction of \n     intelligence gathering with the continued and even enhanced \n     need for counterintelligence occurred when the French \n     government accused the CIA in France of targeting French \n     government officials and high ranking officials in key French \n     commercial firms. Six people were requested to leave the \n     country, and several CIA personnel in other European cities \n     were identified.\n       The Intelligence Committee requested the CIA Inspector \n     General to ``analyze the events of this case in detail and \n     report to the Committee on the mistakes that occurred and any \n     necessary corrective measures.'' In the end, it was poor \n     counterintelligence and poor tradecraft which led to the \n     events in France.\n       The Committee, in addition, addressed such disparate issues \n     as the Clipper Chip digital telephony, the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Russian and East European \n     organized crime, environmental intelligence, NSA support to \n     law enforcement, as well as the traditional budget and \n     program oversight.\n       Controversy, however, seems to have found a home in the \n     Intelligence Community. Charges arose in the mid-1990's that \n     the Central Intelligence Agency had been involved with and \n     had knowledge of several events in Guatemala. The Committee, \n     again through hearings, staff interviews and record reviews, \n     investigated the events surrounding the abduction and murder \n     of an American who ran a small hotel in Guatemala, Michael \n     DeVine; the kidnapping, rape and torture of Sister Diana \n     Ortiz; and the disappearing of Efraim Bamaca, a Guatemalan \n     guerrilla married to an American, Jennifer Harbury. In each \n     of these cases, claims have been made that the CIA had \n     knowledge of or that agents of the CIA were involved in the \n     events themselves.\n       Following up on information learned as a result of the Ames \n     inquiry, the Committee investigated a series of events in the \n     CIA's Intelligence Directorate where material prepared for \n     the highest policymakers in the nation was inappropriately \n     identified as to its source. For a period of time, \n     intelligence that the CIA knew was from controlled or co-\n     opted sources was delivered to policymakers without proper \n     warnings that the reports did come from controlled sources.\n       The Committee is presently involved in investigating the \n     role of U.S. officials in the flow of arms from Iran to \n     Bosnia at a time when there were U.S. and UN sanctions active \n     against such shipments.\n       Throughout this 20 year period, two things have stood true. \n     The dedication of the Members of the Senate to this \n     Committee--a Committee assignment which garners more \n     headaches than headlines--and the dedication of a truly \n     professional staff which handles the most sensitive material \n     our nation produces. Since 1976, 61 Senators have served on \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and there have \n     been a total of 221 staff members.\n       As the Senate begins its third decade of oversight of the \n     Intelligence Community, it can look back with some pride on \n     the successes of the institutional framework it established. \n     Oversight of intelligence has indeed been conducted in the \n     nonpartisan, focused manner intended. This pride must be \n     tempered, however, with a serious examination of how this \n     oversight can be improved. The Committee advocated one such \n     improvement this year, with the effort to remove the eight-\n     year term limit for membership. This restriction, initially \n     put in place out of concern that members might become \n     captives of the intelligence community over time, has proven \n     unnecessary and counterproductive. The concern of cooptation \n     has been belied by the unerring vigilance of long-time \n     members such as Senators William Cohen and John Glenn, whose \n     unswerving principles have led them to be both ardent \n     advocates for and among the harshest critics of the \n     intelligence community. Instead, the term limit has hampered \n     the ability of the Committee to develop the kind of \n     expertise, institutional memory, and dedication the complex \n     field of intelligence requires. While the Committee failed in \n     its effort to remove this limit this year, it will no doubt \n     try again and eventually succeed.\n       Additional issues involving the Committee's ability to \n     ensure that it is fully and currently informed of all \n     intelligence activities, the Committee's relationship with \n     other Senate committees, and measures which undermine the \n     authorizing authority of the Committee may require further \n     legislative efforts. Intelligence is a uniquely challenging \n     area of Congressional oversight. Its activities must often be \n     shrouded in secrecy, sheltered from the scrutiny of \n     investigative journalists who so often uncover problems in \n     other areas of government. It is essential, therefore, that \n     Congress have sufficiently strong and effective institutional \n     mechanisms to perform that crucial oversight.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the conference report accompanying the \nfiscal year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act highlights the results \nof significant efforts by many people. This bill creates important \nchanges which will help to improve the Director of Central \nIntelligence's ability to manage the intelligence community and also \nimproves oversight of the Nation's intelligence activities. It is an \nimportant step in reforming and renewing the intelligence community.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Specter for his bipartisan approach to \nthe intelligence community's problems. Intelligence can become the \ntopic of partisan debate if we are not careful to preserve its goal of \nproviding the unvarnished truth to policy-makers--congressional as well \nas executive branch. Because of the important issues at stake, there \nhave been many opportunities throughout this year for partisan politics \nto enter the intelligence community's analysis of what threatens our \nvital interests. But Chairman Specter has steadfastly resisted any \neffort in that direction. As his term as chairman comes to a close, I \nsalute him for his wise and farsighted leadership during a period of \ngreat challenge for the Intelligence Committee. He turned those \nchallenges into accomplishments, including the significant reforms \ncontained in this conference report. Chairman Specter has also acted on \nbehalf of the entire Senate to provide thorough and attentive oversight \nof this Nation's intelligence activities. In the process he has taken \nthe bold, and I believe correct, course of convening frequent open \noversight hearings to acquaint the public with these important issues, \nall the while protecting the secrecy of intelligence sources and \nmethods. So I am proud to have served with Chairman Specter during this \nmomentous two years, and to have been part of the process which \nproduced the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  Chairman Specter and I have been supported by a superb staff effort \nled by a real intelligence professional, Charles Battaglia, the staff \ndirector of the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Battaglia followed a \ndistinguished naval career with service at CIA, he knows this complex \nbusiness from every angle, creates the conditions and prepares the \ntools Senators can use to get results. He also has every right to be \nproud of this bill.\n  I would also like to add my sincere thanks to the members of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As some of my \ncolleagues may recall, there was considerable disagreement between the \nHouse and Senate in last year's lengthy authorization conference. Not \nso this year. Although there were important differences between the two \nHouses at the beginning of the year, we resolved our differences\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\nquickly because we realized the significance of our combined efforts. \nChairman Larry Combest, Ranking Member Norm Dicks, and the other \nmembers of the House Committee worked with us in a spirit of comity and \nthe Senate can be proud of the product. We are returning to the Senate \nwith an important piece of legislation.\n\n  Naturally, most of the programmatic work is classified. Nevertheless, \nas I mentioned when I helped introduce the Senate version of the bill, \nsome of the most significant provisions are unclassified. The Office of \nthe Director of Central Intelligence has been strengthened to allow him \nto manage the intelligence community much better. Among the most \nprominent of these are improved financial management procedures, \nstrengthened delineation of authorities for collecting, analyzing, and \ndisseminating intelligence, and better internal oversight of \nintelligence activities. In this bill, we have successfully preserved \nthe equities of the Secretary of Defense so that intelligence support \nof military operations will be stronger than ever. We have also \nincluded important provisions to improve intelligence support of law \nenforcement. And, finally, there are also major improvements in support \nof our war against terrorism.\n  I cannot over-emphasize the importance of the bill's provisions to \nstrengthen the Director of Central Intelligence's management of the \nintelligence community. I am aware of some senior intelligence \nofficials to the Oversight Committees efforts to strengthen community \nmanagement, specifically the creation of three new Presidentially-\nappointed, Senatorially confirmed Assistant Directors of Central \nIntelligence. I am reminded of the intense effort by some elements of \nthe Department of Defense some years ago to undermine the Goldwater-\nNichols reform of defense. As was the case then, we are told that \nstrengthened management is, on the one hand, unnecessary and, on the \nother hand, unwieldy. I assure my colleagues that neither criticism is \nwarranted.\n  Mr. President, the management of intelligence suffers from poor \nsenior level management. The culprit is not a person. It is not a \ncomment on the superb abilities of the current Director of Central \nIntelligence or his Deputy. Rather, it is a comment on the structure \nthey inherited. As the Aspin-Brown Commission noted when it evaluated \nthe intelligence community's readiness for the 21st century, the DCI \nfaces a dilemma on managing the community which the current structure \ndoes not solve. He is relatively weak in his ability to manage the \ncommunity and therefore spends most of his time as the principal \nintelligence adviser to the President and as the head of the CIA. The \nbill solves his dilemma by creating a new Deputy Director for Community \nManagement. This new senior level official will be assisted by three \nAssistant Directors who will be functional managers of the intelligence \ncommunity. One will handle administration, one will oversee analysis \nand production, and one will supervise intelligence collection.\n  In deciding which information to collect about our vital interests, \nfour different and independent organizations every day set their own \ngoals, priorities, and allocate resources. Except on a by-exception \nbasis--and also during an annual budget review--neither the Director of \nCentral Intelligence nor his staff have any idea of the duplication \nwhich exists, the relative effectiveness of one method of collection \nover another to break a tough intelligence target, or the marginal \nutility of procuring new systems to solve new problems. With all of the \nresponsibilities pressing upon their daily lives, neither the Director \nnor his Deputy have the time to understand or direct daily the \ncommunity's intelligence collection efforts. In response, the bill \ngives the DCI help in the form of an assistant whose sole purpose is to \nhelp him do what he already is responsible for doing--manage the \ncollection of intelligence.\n\n  Similar problems exist in the areas of intelligence analysis and \nproduction. Today, CIA's analysts analyze military problems. The \nDefense Intelligence Agency analyzes political problems. The Department \nof State evaluates political and military problems. On a daily, weekly, \nor monthly basis, no one reviews--with any hope of changing the \ncommunity's direction toward new problems--who is analyzing what \nthroughout the community. Certainly, as part of the annual budget \nprocess, the DCI makes a quick review of the intelligence analysis \nstructure supporting policy makers. But the DCI's annual review \naddresses analysis and production in only a cursory manner. He needs \nhelp. The bill gives him help in the form an assistant whose sole \npurpose is to help the DCI do what he already is responsible for \ndoing--analyze and produce intelligence.\n  Perhaps most fragmented of all are the administrative programs of the \nvarious intelligence agencies. Each agency maintains separate \nadministrative, personnel, security, and training programs. In 1992, \nCongress gave the DCI specific authority to consolidate and reduce \nduplication in these programs, but successive DCI's have done little to \nmake use of this authority. Again, the DCI needs help. The bill gives \nhim help in the form of an assistant DCI for administration.\n  Mr. President, in its confirmation of these new officials, the Senate \nmust be vigilant in protecting intelligence from politicization. I \nexpect the candidates for these positions to be life-long intelligence \nprofessionals approaching the pinnacle of their careers. I don't expect \nthem to have political leanings that would affect their professional \njudgments, any more than I would expect such leanings in the career \ndiplomats the Senate confirms to be Assistant Secretaries of State or \nin the career military officers the Senate confirms to be flag \nofficers. I have also heard it argued that senatorial confirmation \nmight make these intelligence officials less loyal or less responsive \nto their superiors. Looking again at the Assistant Secretaries of State \nand at the military, I see no empirical data to support this concern. I \nhave high hopes that these officials will make our intelligence more \ntimely and useful to all its customers, and I will use my role in the \nconfirmation process to that end.\n  Mr. President, let me note two other provisions in the conference \nreport of special interest to me. One provision modifies the House \nbill's prohibition on the CIA use of U.S. journalists as intelligence \nassets unless the President waived the prohibition and made a written \ncertification. This procedure seemed to the Senate conferees to be too \nonerous and time consuming. We accepted Director Deutch's assurance \nthat any CIA approach to a U.S. journalist would be extremely rare. But \nit seemed to us that such a rare occasion might also require speed, and \nthe process to obtain a Presidential waiver and certification would \ntake too long. Consequently the conferees agreed to give waiver \nauthority to the President or the DCI. In either case, use of the \nwaiver would be reported to the oversight committees.\n  Second, the conferees agreed to modify a Senate provision denying \nsenior CIA personnel the possibility of accepting employment with a \nforeign country within 5 years of retirement. It seemed to us that \nsecurity and the reputation of the service are best protected by a \nclear prohibition on such employment. Our compromise with the House \nreduced the period of prohibition from 5 years to 3 and provided \nauthority for the DCI to waive the provision when foreign employment of \na former senior official is in the U.S. interest. Nonetheless, I think \nwe are sending a strong message with this provision and I support it.\n  The effort to bring the bill forward for final passage has not been \neasy. Significant change never is, and there is no object more \nresistant to change than the baroque bureaucratic structure that our \nintelligence community has evolved into since 1945. But the effort to \nbring the bill to this point has been worth it. It has been \nstrengthened by the intense discussions it generated with the Director \nof Central Intelligence, the Department of Defense, and the other \nSenate committees. Quite correctly, each had strong concerns, and we \nhave answered those concerns with an excellent bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support final passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President; I rise to express my concern regarding \nthe fiscal year 1997 intelligence authorization conference report. I \nmake these observations, not in my capacity as the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, but as an individual Senator\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\nconcerned about growth in Government bureaucracy.\n  I am particularly concerned by the fact that the intelligence \nconferees have decided to establish four new senior positions under the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, all requiring Senate confirmation. In \naddition to a new Deputy Director, which the administration requested, \nthe Intelligence Conferees have agreed to create three new Assistant \nDirectors of Central Intelligence. The administration has clearly \nindicated its opposition to the establishment of these Assistant \nDirector positions.\n  In my view, this is an unnecessary expansion of bureaucracy at a time \nwhen virtually every other area of Government is shrinking. There is no \nevidence that I am aware of to justify this growth. The Presidential \ncommission that just completed its study of these matters, the Brown \nCommission, did not make such a recommendation, nor has the Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  Since the organization of the Office of the Director of Central \nIntelligence does not come under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Nunn and I have not sought to oppose the \nestablishment of these new positions on behalf of the Armed Services \nCommittee, even though we agree that the case for their creation is not \ncompelling. In the areas where the Armed Services Committee does have \njurisdiction, the intelligence conference report has been adjusted to \naddress concerns that Senator Nunn and I raised on behalf of the Armed \nServices Committee and the Department of Defense. Since the \nIntelligence Conferees addressed these concerns in a satisfactory \nmanner, Senator Nunn and I have agreed not to oppose the intelligence \nconference report.\n  Notwithstanding our general satisfaction with the intelligence \nauthorization conference report, Senator Nunn joins me in registering \nopposition to what we view as an unwarranted expansion of intelligence \nbureaucracy. It is my intent to follow this matter closely in the \nfuture. The executive branch may choose not to fill these positions. \nNevertheless, I plan to reexamine the legislation establishing these \nnew positions during the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report \nmandated by Public Law 101-423, entitled ``Final Report to Congress on \nthe Joint Resolution to Establish a National Policy on Permanent \nPapers,'' be printed as a Senate document, and I ask further that 300 \nadditional copies be made available for use of the Joint Committee on \nthe Library.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues--especially those who co-sponsored my legislation \nestablishing a national policy on permanent paper --the final mandated \nreport to the Congress on progress in reaching the objectives of that \npolicy. That legislation, which became Public Law 101-423 on October \n12, 1990, stated that:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that Federal records, \n     books, and publications of enduring value be produced on acid \n     free permanent papers.\n\n  The Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and \nthe Public Printer were required to make three progress reports to the \nCongress over a 5 year period, and the last of these has now been made, \nreporting developments through 1995. This latest report is a record of \nremarkable progress and I am pleased that it will be printed as a \nSenate document.\n  When I first introduced a permanent paper bill in October 1988, \nalmost all documents and publications produced by the Federal \nGovernment or by Federal funds were on acidic papers with a useful life \nof less than 100 years. These papers had been in general use since the \nmid-19th century. The Federal Government was not unique. State and \nlocal governments and private publishers all used such papers.\n  Librarians and archivists had for some time expressed their concerns \nabout the loss of irreplaceable historical, cultural and scientific \nbooks, publications and other records. Many millions of dollars were \nalready being spent by research libraries, foundations, and State and \nFederal governments either to save these materials by deacidification \nor to preserve their contents by microfilming--both costly processes.\n  I might note that when the present Librarian of Congress, James H. \nBillington, appeared before the Senate\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\nCommittee on Rules and Administration for his confirmation hearing on \nJuly 14, 1987, he described at considerable length the deterioration of \nthe holdings of our national library. In response to our questions, he \ntold us that he regarded the problem of ``brittle books'' as a major \none, both retrospectively, in terms of salvaging the records of the \nlast century and a half, and prospectively, in terms of preventing \ncontinuation of the problem. He spoke of the need for ``mobilizing \ninformed opinion to assure that we get a better response from those who \npublish, so that this problem is not with us in the future.''\n  It was by no coincidence that an active campaign to ``mobilize \ninformed opinion'' ensued thereafter. Many people throughout the \nlibrary community were actively involved, but I would particularly like \nto cite the efforts of Robert Frase, former vice president and \neconomist of the Association of American Publishers. Mr. Frase was \ninstrumental in conceiving and helping to bring to fruition the \nresolution to establish a National Policy on Permanent Paper, which as \nI indicated, was first introduced in 1988.\n  Looking back at the short span of eight years since that time, one is \nstruck by the relatively low level of activity in permanent paper \nproduction that then prevailed. Research had demonstrated that the \ndeterioration of papers produced from mid-19th century onward was \ncaused by chemicals in a process using wood pulp rather than rags as \nraw material. The resulting acidic papers began to yellow and crumble \n(hence the term ``brittle books'') within a few decades, while the \nearlier rag papers continued to last for centuries. Research financed \nby the Council on Library resources and others, however, had \ndemonstrated that wood pulp based papers could be produced by \nan alkaline process, resulting in estimated useful lives comparable \nwith the old rag papers. A small amount of such papers was actually \nbeing produced.\n\n  What was required at that point was an increased awareness of the \nproblem and a dramatic demonstration that something was going to be \ndone about it. This would then lead to an increased demand for new \npapers, and in turn induce paper mills to convert to an alkaline \nprocess. Increased production would result in lower costs and prices \ncompetitive with acidic papers. The American Library Association \nstarted the ball rolling by passing its first resolution on this \nsubject in January 1988. After my first bill was introduced in October \nof that year it was promptly endorsed by another ALA resolution in \nearly 1989. This led to similar resolutions by other U.S. organizations \nand then by the International Federation of Library Associations and \nInstitutions [IFLA] and the International Publishers Association later \nin 1989.\n  A big and prominent institution was needed to provide the impact of \ntaking the first step into an action program, and the U.S. Government \nwas an obvious choice. Its responsible agencies--the Library of \nCongress and National Archives--were well aware of the issues and the \nenormous problems and costs which were building up for the future \nunless alkaline paper came into general use; it was the world's largest \nproducer of publications and documents; and its example would have a \nprofound influence both at home and abroad. These were the \nconsiderations that led to the introduction of the bills that became \nPublic Law 101-423 --my Senate Joint Resolution 57 and Representative \nPat Williams' House Joint Resolution 226, both in early 1989.\n  Public Law 101-423 did not mandate the use of alkaline papers by \nFederal agencies. To have done so would have been impractical because \nthe supply of such papers was limited and the price uncompetitive. But \nby establishing a policy and a goal, it set a process in motion which \nin a period of a few years would achieve the same results.\n  An important technical prerequisite to realizing the goal was the \nestablishment of a clear definition of the term ``acid free permanent \npaper.'' Since the most important factor in paper deterioration is \nacidity any long-lived paper must be acid free, or alkaline. To be \npermanent, however, a paper must conform to additional technical \nspecifications, the most widely recognized of which is designated as \nthe American National Standard and often referred to by the acronym \nANSI/NISO. The technical designation is ``American National Standard \nfor Permanence of Paper for Publications and Documents in Libraries and \nArchives, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992.'' As a practical matter, companies \ndeciding to produce alkaline paper can easily take the small further \nsteps required to produce permanent paper meeting the ANSI/NISO \nstandard.\n  An important feature of Public Law 101-423 was a monitoring device to \nhelp ensure that the national policy was actually being carried out, \nand that device is the requirement that three progress reports be made \nto the Congress on December 31, 1991, 1993, and 1995, by the Librarian \nof Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and the Public \nPrinter. Although the 1995 report is the last to be required by law, \nthese three officials have stated their intention to continue to \nmonitor progress in achieving the goals of the legislation on an ad hoc \nbasis. I welcome their decision, a sentiment I am sure is shared by the \nmany members of Congress who have taken an interest in this matter, as \nwell as those in the library, archival, scholarly and historical \nprofessions throughout the world. I urge that these progress reports \ncontinue to be issued every 2 years through the rest of this century.\n\n\n                   Progress in the Federal Government\n\n  Since Public Law 101-423 focused on the production of Federal \nrecords, books and publications of enduring value on acid-free \npermanent paper, I am very pleased to note that the third report \ndocuments a number of very encouraging developments in this regard. \nHere are some of the most notable:\n  The National Archives and Records administration has circulated \nwidely bulletin No. 95-7, Procurement of Writing, Copying, and Printing \nPapers for Federal Records, which provides guidance to Federal agencies \nin the use of alkaline and permanent papers. Permanent or alkaline \npapers are recommended for all Federal records; at least alkaline for \nroutine use; and permanent in offices that create and file a high \nproportion of long-term and permanent records.\n  There has been a notable increase in the availability of permanent \nand alkaline paper for Government use. When Public Law was enacted in \n1990, the Joint Committee on Printing listed only one grade of \npermanent paper. In 1995 it had four; plus 16 grades of alkaline paper.\n  The General Services Administration provides papers for purchase by \nFederal agencies that match the standards set by the Joint Committee on \nPrinting.\n  The executive branch has ruled that the requirements of Executive \nOrder 12873 mandating the use of recycled paper by Federal agencies are \nnot to conflict in any way with the concurrent requirement for \npermanent paper use.\n  The National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical \nRecords Commission mandate the use of permanent and alkaline papers in \nprojects they fund.\n  The National Library of Medicine has carried on a remarkably \nsuccessful, and little recognized, campaign to ensure that the world's \nbiomedical journals are printed on alkaline or permanent paper. This \neffort was started in 1988. Then only 4 percent of the 3,000 journals \nthroughout the world that were indexed in the Library's Index Medicus \nwere being printed on alkaline paper. Due in large part to the \nLibrary's campaign, this figure had risen by April 1995 to 91 percent.\n\n\n                     Progress in the Private Sector\n\n  The ultimate success of the permanent paper campaign depends on \ninducing changes in the nongovernmental sector. Governments--Federal, \nState, and local--primarily produce documents, many of which, of \ncourse, need to be preserved. But publications, the carriers of our \nliterature, culture, history and science, are overwhelmingly produced \nby private publishers, profit and nonprofit. These publishers had to be \npersuaded to use permanent paper and the paper mills had to be \npersuaded to produce it. Publishers would not use permanent paper, even \nif they thought they should, because it was not easily available at \ncompetitive prices. Paper manufacturing companies saw no reason to \nshift to an alkaline process lacking a strong demand from publishers.\n  It was here that the development of standards for permanent paper \nplayed\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\nan important role. These were developed primarily in the private sector \nby a collaborative effort of profit and non-profit organizations, but \nwith participation also of Government agencies. Such standards enable \npublishers to state their permanent paper requirements without having \nto develop, by themselves, the specifications included in their paper \npurchasing contracts. We have already taken note of the 1992 American \nNational Standard ANSI/NISO, which was first developed by the library \nand publishing committee of the American National Standards Institute \nin 1984 and subsequently revised and expanded in 1992. Standards had \nalso been developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials \nand the Council on Library Resources. Since publishing, paper \nmanufacturing, and libraries are not confined to national boundaries, \nit was appropriate that an international standard for permanent paper \ncompatible with the American standard should be published in 1994.\n\n  In the spring of 1988, the New York Public Library began a campaign, \njointly with well-known authors, to get book publishers to use alkaline \nor permanent paper. Public pledges to this effect were secured from \nprominent publishing houses. The industry trade group, the Association \nof American Publishers, gave its endorsement to the campaign. \nUniversity presses--publishers of scholarly, scientific, and historical \nworks, had earlier recognized the problem of paper deterioration and \nhad begun to use alkaline paper for their relatively small editions. \nThey have not only been the most faithful in doing so, but also in \nnoting this fact in the books themselves and in the bibliographic \ninformation provided to the Library of Congress under the Cataloging in \nPublication program.\n  But the most gratifying development in the private sector in the past \nseveral years has been the great increase in the production of \npermanent papers in the United States and Canada. A 1988 report of the \nCongressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated that only \n15 to 25 percent of the books produced in the United States were on \nacid-free paper and predicted that this percentage was unlikely to \nchange. It now appears that this prediction has proven to be unduly \ncautious.\n  Two indications of this production increase may be noted. The first \nis the fact that 99.9 percent of book papers procured through bulk \npurchase by the Government Printing Office in 1995 were alkaline. The \nsecond is the information provided in North American Permanent Papers \n1995, published as a public service by Abbey Publications of Austin, \nTexas. This catalog of papers produced by 34 United States and Canadian \ncompanies lists by brand name 423 different papers that are reported to \nmeet the specifications of the 1994 ANSI/NISO permanent paper standard.\n  The great increase in permanent paper production has come about \nprimarily through the conversion of existing paper mills from acid to \nalkaline processes, a shift encouraged by regulations issued under the \nClean Water Act, requiring the reduction of pollution of streams by the \neffluent of paper mills. Conversion to an alkaline process reduces this \npollution, but also results in the production of paper at the same or \nlesser cost. The happy result was that environmental preservation \nhelped to promote the availability of acid-free paper.\n\n\n                         Progress in the States\n\n  Connecticut led the way to conversion to permanent paper at the State \nlevel. As a result of a campaign led by the State Librarian, the first \nstatute was enacted in 1988. Subsequently additional legislation \nextended the use long-lived paper to most State and local documents. In \nlater years many other States took action, either by legislation or \nadministrative rulings, to require alkaline or permanent paper use to \nsome degree. But few went as far as Connecticut. The progress of State \nlegislation was stimulated by three letters to State Governors from the \nU.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Services calling \nattention to developments under the Federal law and requesting \ninformation on State activity. The last such survey, jointly with the \nLibrary of Congress, was conducted in July 1995. In the third report \nthe following 21 States were listed as having taken some kind of \naction: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, \nKansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New \nMexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, \nVirginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Utah has now been \nadded to that list.\n\n\n                             International\n\n  The international library community had long been aware of the \nproblem of brittle books. The subject was discussed as early as the \n1920's at a conference in Europe. It was not until 1989, however, that \nthe first resolution urging action was adopted by the International \nFederation of Library Associations and Institutions [IFLA]. A similar \nresolution was adopted that same year by the International Association \nof Publishers. Note has already been taken of the impact of the program \nof the U.S. National Library of Medicine on biomedical journals \nthroughout the world.\n  Nevertheless, until recently European publishers and governments \nlagged behind this country. A 1993 survey of 142 publishers in 17 \nEuropean countries reported that: 31 did not know that most currently \nused book paper becomes brittle after 50 years; and 90 were unaware of \nthe ANSI/NISO permanent paper standards. Governments, with some notable \nexceptions, have been slow to require the use permanent paper by \nlegislation or administrative regulations, even with respect to their \nown publications and documents. The same has been true of the agencies \nof the United Nations. But in the last couple of years the pace has \npicked up. A number of European organizations, both official and \nprivate, are now actively promoting permanent paper. European paper \nmanufactures contributed to a 1994 catalog listing about 100 different \npermanent papers being sold by 26 paper mills or their agents--papers \nmeeting the specifications of the 1992 American National Standard.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n  It is now 9 years since I first raised the question with Librarian of \nCongress Billington as to whether something could not be done to bring \nto an end the indefinite production of brittle books. Enormous progress \nbeen made--at least in the United States, in Canada, in much of Europe, \nand in Japan--in the production of books, other publications, and \ndocuments on paper which should endure for several centuries, instead \nof self-destructing in less than 100 years. Many individuals and \norganizations, public and private, have contributed to this result--\nsome known to me and others not. I note once again the efforts of \nRobert Frase in this connection. We owe them all a debt of gratitude. I \ncelebrate the fact that the Congress and Federal agencies have made \nmajor contributions to this progress in a variety of ways, not the \nleast of which has been through the passage and the implementation of \nPublic Law 101-423 to establish a National Policy on Permanent Papers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11326-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11328-S11329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXTRADITION OF MARTIN PANG FROM BRAZIL TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 132, which \nwas received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 132) relating to the \n     extradition of Martin Pang from Brazil to the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on January 5, 1995, four firefighters were \nkilled in a blaze in Seattle's International District. After intensive \ninvestigations by the Seattle police and fire departments, the King \nCounty Prosecutor's Office, the U.S. Attorney General's Office, and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Martin S. Pang was charged \nwith deliberately setting his parents' seafood warehouse on fire to \ncollect insurance money. In January of 1995, Mr. Pang fled to Brazil \nwhere he stayed until March 1, 1996. He was extradited on the condition \nthat murder charges not be brought against him.\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\n  The focus of this resolution is on that extradition, and why those \nconditions should be waived by the Brazilian Government to see that \njustice is fully served. You see, Mr. President, under the extradition \ntreaty we have with Brazil, criminal suspects may only be extradited to \nface charges for crimes that exist in both countries. In Brazil, murder \nas a result of arson is not a crime. It is in the United States.\n  Martin Pang's pretrial hearing is scheduled for October 8, 1996. \nUnder the conditions of our extradition treaty, the Brazilian Supreme \nCourt ruled that Pang could be returned to the States to face arson \ncharges only. Murder, a crime of which he has been accused and which he \nshould stand trial for, is not an option. There is recourse, however. \nThe United States Government believes that under our extradition \ntreaty, the executive branch of Brazil has the authority to consent to \nthe prosecution of Martin Pang on felony murder charges, despite the \nBrazilian Supreme Court's ruling. By doing so in this case, Brazil \nwould give its consent for the United States to try Pang on all of the \ncharges which have been brought against him.\n  This resolution sends a strong message to the Brazilian Government. \nFour firefighters died doing their job honorably. It is no less our \nresponsibility to see that the accused be tried for the full scope of \nhis crime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be deemed agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate S. \n1311, the National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation Establishment \nAct. S. 1311, would create a charitable, not-for-profit foundation to \nactively raise private funds to support the activities of the \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness, President's Council.\n  In the past, the President's Council has relied on Federal \nappropriations to support its activities. Future appropriations for the \nPresident's Council are unlikely as we strive to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  The Foundation created by this bill would raise private funds to \nsustain the President's Council on Physical Fitness. To facilitate \nfund-raising, the Foundation is permitted to offer the use of the seal \nof the President's Council for promotional purposes in exchange for \nsponsorship funds. The bill does not authorize the expenditure of \nFederal funds.\n  The goals of the President's Council are identified in Executive \nOrder 12345. The primary goal is to foster programs that encourage \npeople of all ages to participate regularly in sports and physical \nactivities. Perhaps the Council's most well known activity is the \nPresident's Challenge Physical Fitness Awards Program which is \nadministered by teachers and youth programs in every State. We should \nact to preserve the President's Council. Its activities are \nparticularly important because our Nation's children are becoming \nincreasingly less physically fit even as we learn that physical fitness \nin one's youth is important to living a healthy life during adulthood.\n  Senators Campbell and Bradley introduced this bill in October 1995. \nThe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation unanimously \nordered the bill reported on June 6, 1996. I have an amendment that \nmakes certain technical modifications to the bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support this worthy legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, the \nbill be deemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5403) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1311), as amended, was deemed read for a third time and \npassed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Physical Fitness \n     and Sports Foundation Establishment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE OF FOUNDATION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the National \n     Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation (hereinafter in this \n     Act referred to as the ``Foundation'').

Mr. President, today I want to recognize James A. \nMcDevitt, who has just been promoted to brigadier general in the \nWashington Air National Guard. I take special pleasure in offering my \ncongratulations because Jim is a friend and former colleague; for 5 \nyears, he worked for me in the State attorney general's office as \nassistant attorney general. He is also my frequent host when I go to \nSpokane to run in the wonderful Bloomsday race.\n  Jim has served this country for three decades. He was trained as a \nnavigator and bombardier, and went on to serve as a weapons systems \nofficer and flight examiner in the late 1960's and early 1970's. His \nassignments took him to Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Spain, Germany, and \nEngland.\n  In January 1971, Jim joined the 116th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, \nWashington Air National Guard, as a radar intercept officer in the F-\n101. When the unit converted to KC-135 Air Refueling aircraft, he \nbecame a navigator and has maintained that qualification since.\n  At the time of the gulf war, Jim was the squadron commander of the \n116th Air Refueling Squadron. When hostilities broke out in August \n1990, Jim and a group of Washington flyers volunteered for 30-day \nactive duty tours. As the Nation faced a new crisis in the Middle East, \nthe Guard stepped up. At first, most of their duties involved ferrying \nmaterial from one air base to another, within the United States. Our \nvictory in the gulf was due in no small part to the magnificent logical \nprowess of the U.S. Armed Services, and Jim contributed to America's \nsuccess.\n  Throughout the months leading to actual combat, Jim continued \nvolunteering for active duty work, making 2-week rotations all through \nSeptember, October, and November. Jim's active duty call up came on \nDecember 20, 1990. Along with 325 brave men and women from the Spokane \narea, Jim deployed to the gulf region to be absorbed in the active duty \nAir Force. Half of Jim's squadron went to Cairo, Egypt. The other half, \nincluding Jim, flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to join with active duty \ncomponents. It is important to note here the adaptability of our Guard \nforces. With superior training and total dedication, the Washington \nState Air National Guard linked with the regular Air Force to form an \nactive duty squadron--the 1709th Air Refueling Squadron provisional. \nJim not surprisingly, was second in command.\n  With bankers, teachers, lawyers, housewives, contractors, judges, and \nactive duty personnel, this squadron represented 50 airplanes, 80 \ncrews, and 320 crew members for 8 different States. Home based in \nJeddah, from the December 31 to January 15, 1991, Jim and his team \nplanned now they were going to wage a war. They planned well.\n  As he tells it, the morning of January 16, 1991--the start of the \nwar--was the most difficult day in Jim's life. Commanding officers were \nprohibited from flying in sorties during the first missions. So Jim had \nto wait and pray that his comrades, men and women he had flown with for \n25 years, would come back safely. Of course they all performed \nbrilliantly, as did Jim, and this Nation is better off for their hard \nwork and patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/25/senate-section/article/S11332-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
