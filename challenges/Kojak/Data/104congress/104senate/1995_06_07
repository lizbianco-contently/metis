Mr. President, as the new Republican Congress attempts \nto put government back into the hands of the people and bring back a \nsense of independence rather than dependence for so many citizens, it \nis important to recognize those individuals who have done their part at \nthe community level, the very core of our society, to promote \nresponsibility in others. I am proud to recognize a Missourian from \nKansas City, Mr. Virgil Bower, known to most as ``Skip,'' who has \ndevoted his life to influencing others and serving as a community \nactivist, volunteer, and role model in Missouri for over 60 years.\n  Mr. Bower began his volunteer service in 1934 as Scoutmaster to Boy \nScout Troop 122, and continues to serve to this day. He has been in the \nbanking business in North Kansas City since 1948, serving as a public \nrelations representative. Throughout his career he has remained active \nin civic organizations. He has been publicly recognized as an \noutstanding citizen and community leader, having even been called a \nlegend in the North Kansas City area.\n  Mr. Bower is a man of dignity and humility who has worked hard. \nShortly after he graduated from high school, Mr. Bower got a job \nwashing dishes in a cafeteria in downtown Kansas City. He saved enough \nmoney to attend college and graduated from William Jewell in 1933. He \nbegan his career as a school teacher and found gratification in \ninfluencing and motivating young people to strive for excellence. He \nlater became the principal of McElroy Dagg Elementary School, only to \nhave his tenure cut short by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Like so many \nyoung men, Mr. Bower answered the call of his country and served in \nWorld War II as an officer in the Navy.\n  Skip Bower has influenced many young people throughout the years, and \nmany have followed in his footsteps, becoming community volunteers and \nserving in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.\n  Recently, I received a letter from a man from Kansas City whose \nfather died when he was very young. He was fortunate enough to join Boy \nScout Troop 122 under Mr. Bower, who proved to be a source of guidance \nand influence. The young man grew up to be a successful citizen who \nattributes his sense of civic duty and leadership to Skip Bower. But \nthat is just one example of how Skip Bower influenced a life and saw a \nyoung person grow into a responsible, productive citizen. There have \nbeen many more.\n  For over 60 years Mr. Bower has quietly continued to touch the lives \nof students, Scouts, and North Kansas City citizens who know him from \nhis banking job, the Kiwanis Club, or various other community \nactivities. His accomplishments have not gone unrecognized. He was \nrecently selected by Newschannel 4 as one of Kansas City's Symbols of \nCaregiving, an award reserved for 11 outstanding citizens who provide \nan example of hope and service for everyone. The Kansas City Northland \nRegional Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Virgil Bower Award for \nCommunity Service, named in his honor.\n  Now in retirement at the age of 87, Mr. Bower continues to work half \ndays greeting customers at Boatman's Bank in Kansas City. He takes \npride in his work, and knows most of the customers who come through the \ndoor, as well as most people in North Kansas City. His wife of 50 years \ndied over 10 years ago, but her portrait sits in his living room as a \nreminder of the life they shared. The words ``loyal, committed, and \ndedicated'' are commonly used to describe Skip Bower. He deserves our \npraise and recognition for the outstanding contributions he has made to \nKansas City and America. Mr. Bower will leave a legacy of morality, \nresponsibility, service, and leadership.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7802-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JERRY JORY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the mid-1960's, when I first decided to \nseek political office, I ran for a seat on the hospital board of \ntrustees for Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. This was not considered \na political plum, nor did the race engender much public attention. For \nme, however, it was incredibly significant, as most firsts are.\n  I mention this because during that campaign, I met a man who, without \nmotive or want, came to me offering support and assistance in my \ncampaign. He owned a pawn shop in downtown Las Vegas, heard I needed \nhelp, and offered it. Since then, I have been the lucky beneficiary of \nJerry Jory's support as a friend, as an advisor, and as an ally. And he \nhas never asked for anything in return--because that's the kind of guy \nhe is.\n  On Friday, June 16, Jerry will be honored by the many friends he has \nmade at a special tribute sponsored by the Las Vegas Police Protective \nAssociation. I can say, without hesitation, that there is no one more \ndeserving of this attention than my friend, Jerry Jory.\n  Jerry is perhaps most well known for his service to his country as a \nmember of the U.S. Navy and as a captain in the Naval Reserve. During \nthe Korean war, he served on the U.S.S. Bremerton as a cryptographer \nbreaking Korean and Russian codes. As an active reservist in the \nVietnam war, Jerry served in the Pentagon in the sensitive and highly \nclassified position in charge of the staffing of troops and officers. \nSince then, Jerry has continued to serve our country in the reserves, \nand he is held in high esteem by his peers and his subordinates because \nof his thoughtful and even-tempered approach to whatever task is \nassigned.\n  Since my election to the Congress in 1982 and the Senate in 1986, \nJerry has been my military adviser, and I have relied on his opinion \nand counsel. He has also served as the chairman of my Academy selection \ncommittee. As a result of his efforts, that committee has developed the \nstrongest selection outreach program in the country and Nevada has sent \nstellar candidates to our military academies.\n  Jerry is the finest example of a patriot that I know--a man who \nserves with an unassuming yet passionate and dignified love for his \ncountry.\n  Jerry Jory earned a degree in education and was prepared to enter the \nteaching profession. However, after returning from Korea, he received \nan offer to become partners in a pawn shop in Las Vegas. For 40 years, \nJerry has operated the Hock Shop, and for those 40 years, he has been a \ncompassionate, determined, and persistent leader in our business \ncommunity. He has earned a reputation for his sincere concern for his \nfellow human beings, and there is no one who, needing his help, is ever \nrefused.\n  In addition to all of his work for his community and his country, \nJerry has also been a devoted family man. Together with his wife June, \nthey have raised ten wonderful children--Teri, Toni, Jerry, Jason, \nShannon, April, Kit, Sean, Kelly, and Gary. I personally don't know how \nJerry has found the time for all that he does; but he must be doing \nsomething right--everyone who knows him can tell by the smile on his \nface.\n  Jerry has faced many battles in his life, but today he may be facing \nhis toughest. He has recently been diagnosed with cancer, and he will \nconfront this illness with the same determination that he has shown his \nentire life. And I know there will be hundreds of friends standing \nbeside him to help.\n  I am proud to be Jerry's friend, and I wish him the very best as he \nis honored by the community that is his home.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7802-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7802-S7803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BILLIONAIRES' TAX LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Joint Committee on Taxation has now \ncompleted its long awaited study on the billionaires' tax loophole, and \ntheir [[Page S7803]] report is a blatant attempt to save the loophole, \nrather than close it.\n  On April 6, the Senate voted 96 to 4 to close this unjustified tax \nloophole for billionaires who renounce their American citizenship in \norder to avoid taxes on the wealth they have accumulated as Americans.\n  As we all know, the Senate Finance Committee had tried to close the \nloophole as part of its action to restore the health care deduction for \nsmall businesses.\n  The Finance Committee bill closed the billionaires' loophole, despite \nthe fact that the revenue gained was not needed to pay for the health \ncare deduction in the bill. In fact, the Finance Committee recommended \nthat the revenues be used for deficit reduction.\n  This is exactly the type of action necessary if we are serious about \nachieving a balanced budget.\n  According to the revenue estimates at the time, closing the loophole \nwould raise $3.6 billion over the next 10 years. Clearly, substantial \nrevenues are at stake.\n  Too often, we close tax loopholes only when we need to raise revenues \nto offset tax cuts. In this case, the Finance Committee closed this \nflagrant loophole as soon as it was brought to the Committee's \nattention and rightly so, because this loophole should be closed as \nsoon as possible.\n  The Senate bill did so, and all of us thought the issue was settled.\n  Yet, when the legislation came back to us from the Senate-House \nconference, the loophole had reappeared, and this important tax reform \nhad disappeared. This outrageous tax break for a few dozen or so of the \nwealthiest individuals in the country would remain open.\n  The provision was dropped in conference because it was felt that \ntechnical issues needed to be addressed before Congress took action on \nthe issue.\n  But in the April 6 vote, the Senate went solidly on record to close \nthe loophole as quickly as possible, and to make the effective date of \nsuch legislation February 6, 1995.\n  This all happened, of course, at the same time our Republican \ncolleagues in Congress have been proposing deep cuts in Medicare and \neducation in order to pay for their new tax breaks for the rich.\n  Now, the report of the Joint Tax Committee suggests that the real \npurpose of the delay was to try to find a way to save as much of the \nloophole as possible.\n  I have several major concerns about the report\n  First, the report now indicates that the revenue gain from closing \nthe loophole may be only about half the amount estimated earlier--$1.9 \nbillion, instead of $3.6 billion. The amount is still significant, but \nfar less than was expected.\n  Second, the report suggests that it may be preferable simply to \ntinker with the existing law and improve IRS enforcement procedures, \ninstead of enacting a new reform to close the loophole, as President \nClinton has proposed.\n  But the IRS has attempted to enforce the current law, and it has been \nfound to be fatally flawed. To tinker with the current law is a thin-\nveiled pretext to save the current loophole.\n  The IRS has been able to identify only a handful of cases in which \nany tax was collected under the defective current law. And the total \ntax collected is less than $500,000.\n  At the same time, we have tax lawyers quoted as saying: ``I talk to a \nnew client interested in expatriating every week.''\n  Third, the report allows an unacceptable window of opportunity to \navoid the tax. Under this proposal, wealthy tax-evaders can still \nqualify for the loophole by simply having begun, not completed, the \nprocess of renouncing their citizenship by the February 6 date.\n  When we debated this issue 2 months ago, there were suggestions that \nthe effective date should be postponed to accommodate certain \nindividuals in their tax avoidance schemes.\n  In my view, we should close the loophole tight, not gerrymander the \neffective date to let some well-connected billionaires squeeze through.\n  At a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting Medicare, \neducation, and other essential programs in order to pay for tax cuts \nfor the rich, they are also maneuvering to salvage this unjustified \nloophole for the super wealthy.\n  I say, this loophole should be closed now, and it should be closed \ntight--no ifs, and, or buts. I intend to do all I can to see that it \nis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7802-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7803-S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 9:45 \nhaving arrived and passed, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nS. 735, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 735) to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Hatch-Dole amendment No. 1199, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the time has arrived for consideration of \nthe pending bill on terrorism. The issues which are going to be taken \nup this morning involve habeas corpus reform. In the absence of any \nother Senator on the floor who desires to speak or offer an amendment, \nI will address the subject in a general way.\n  Mr. President, the Specter-Hatch habeas corpus reform bill, S. 623, \nis a very important piece of legislation. The provisions of that bill \nwill be taken up now as part of the pending antiterrorism bill. This \nbill is an appropriate place to take up habeas corpus reform, because \nthe acts of terrorism in the atrocious bombing of the Federal building \nin Oklahoma City would carry with it the death penalty, and habeas \ncorpus reform is very important in order to make the death penalty an \neffective deterrent.\n  In order to have an effective deterrent, the penalty has to be \ncertain and the penalty has to be swift. We have seen in the course of \nthe appeals taken on cases from death row that they last sometimes as \nlong as 20 years. Habeas corpus proceedings arising from Federal \nconvictions are handled slightly differently than those arising out of \nState convictions, because in State proceedings, after the highest \nState court affirms the death penalty on direct review, there may then \nbe additional State-court review called collateral review on State \nhabeas corpus before review on Federal habeas corpus. Despite this \nslight difference, this is the time to move ahead with legislation to \nreform habeas corpus in all cases.\n  This is a subject that I have been working on for many years, since \nmy days as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and later as \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia. Since coming to the Senate in 1981, \nI have introduced many bills directed at improving the administration \nof criminal justice, like the armed career criminal bill, which was \nenacted in 1984, and other legislation which has dealt with expanding \nthe prison system, improving the chances of realistic rehabilitation, \nand strengthening deterrent value of the criminal law. The subject of \nhabeas corpus reform falls into the latter category.\n  I have addressed habeas corpus reform on many occasions over the \nyears and succeeded in 1990 in having the Senate pass an amendment to \nthe 1990 crime bill on habeas corpus reform to try to reduce the long \nappellate time. Notwithstanding its passage by the Senate in 1990, the \nprovision was not passed by the House of Representatives and was \ndropped from the conference report. I continued to introduce \nlegislation on habeas corpus reform in 1991, 1993, and again in 1995. \nThis year, after very extended negotiations with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we came to \nan agreement on legislation which captioned the Specter-Hatch habeas \ncorpus reform bill, S. 623, the provisions of which are now pending as \npart of this antiterrorism bill.\n  Preliminarily, Mr. President, I think it important to note the \ncontroversy over whether the death penalty is, in fact, a deterrent \nagainst violent crime.\n  It is my view that it is a deterrent, and I base that judgment on my \nown experience in prosecuting criminal cases, prosecuting personally \nmurder cases, and running the district attorney's office in \nPhiladelphia which had some 500 homicides a year at the time. \n[[Page S7804]] Based on this experience, I am personally convinced that \nmany professional robbers and burglars are deterred from taking weapons \nin the course of their robberies and burglaries because of the fear \nthat a killing will result, and that would be murder in the first \ndegree.\n  One of the cases which I handled many years ago as an assistant \ndistrict attorney on appeal has convinced me that it is, in fact, a \ndeterrent, and it is an illustrative case where there are many, many \nothers which have been cited in treatises and the appellate reports.\n  The case I refer to involved three young hoodlums named Williams, age \n19, Cater, 18, and Rivers, age 17. The three of them decided to rob a \ngrocery store in north Philadelphia. They talked it over, and the \noldest of the group, Williams, had a revolver which he brandished in \nfront of his two younger coconspirators.\n  When Cater, age 18, and Rivers, age 17, saw the gun they said to \nWilliams that they would not go along on the robbery if he took the gun \nbecause of their fear that a death might result and they might face \ncapital punishment--the electric chair.\n  Williams put the gun in the drawer, slammed it shut, and they all \nleft the room to go to the grocery store in north Philadelphia for the \nrobbery, to get some money.\n  Unbeknown to Cater or Rivers, Williams had reached back into the \ndrawer, pulled out the gun, took it with him, and in the course of the \nrobbery in the north Philadelphia grocery store, the proprietor, Jacob \nViner, resisted. Williams pulled out his gun and shot and killed Mr. \nViner, and all three were caught and charged with murder in the first \ndegree. All were tried. All were given the death penalty.\n  We know the facts of the case from the confessions and from the \nclearly established evidence as to what happened, as I have just \nrecited it.\n  Ultimately, Williams was executed in 1962, the second to the last \nindividual to be executed in Pennsylvania until within the past few \nmonths there was an execution after a 33-year lapse in carrying out the \ndeath penalty in the State of Pennsylvania.\n  When the matter came up on hearings before the pardon board, and I \nwas district attorney, I agreed that the death penalty ought not to be \ncarried out as to both Cater and Rivers because of the difference in \ntheir approach to the offense, that although technically they were \nguilty of the acts of their coconspirator, there was a significant \nqualitative difference, because they had refused to go along when the \ngun was to be taken and it was counter to the agreement and \nconspiratorial plan and scheme which the three carried out.\n   It was not an easy distinction to make because many would say that \nCater and Rivers were equally responsible with Williams and that they \nhad participated in the murder plot and should be held to the death \npenalty as well. But their sentences were commuted.\n  I think that case is a good illustration of the deterrent effect of \ncapital punishment. Here you had two young men, 18 and 17, with very \nmarginal IQ's, but they knew enough not to go along on a robbery if a \ngun was present because they might face the death penalty if a killing \noccurred.\n  Mr. President, in the current context in which habeas corpus appeals \nnow run for as long as a couple of decades, the deterrent effect of \ncapital punishment has been virtually eliminated.\n  There are many, many cases which illustrate this point. Many cases of \nbrutal murders in which the case has dragged on and on for as long as \n17 years or more.\n  One of them is the case of a man named Willie Turner. On the morning \nof July 12, 1978, he walked into the Smith Jewelers in Franklin, VA, \ncarrying a sawed-off shotgun, wrapped in a towel. Without saying a \nword, Turner showed his shotgun to the proprietor, a man named Mr. Jack \nSmith.\n  Mr. Smith triggered the silent alarm, and a police officer, Alan \nBain, arrived at the scene. During the course of the events, the \ndefendant, Turner, pointed his shotgun at officer Bain's head and \nordered him to remove his revolver from his holster and to put it on \nthe floor. Turner then eventually shot the proprietor, Jack Smith, in \nthe head. The shot was not fatal.\n  Then officer Bain began talking to Turner and he offered to take \nTurner out of the store if he would agree not to shoot anyone else. The \ndefendant Turner then said, ``I'm going to kill this squealer,'' \nreferring to the proprietor, Smith, who lay severely wounded. Turner \nreached over the counter with his revolver and fired two close-range \nshots into the left side of Mr. Smith's chest.\n  The shots caused Smith's body to jump. Medical testimony established \nthat either of these two shots to the chest would have been fatal. \nTurner was tried for murder in the first degree, was convicted, and was \nsentenced to death. The appeals lasted 17 years, with the victim's \nfamily attending some 19 separate court proceedings.\n  It is not an easy matter, Mr. President, when we talk about capital \npunishment. It is my judgment, however, that society needs this \nultimate weapon in order to try to deal with violent crime in America. \nThat has been the judgment of some 38 States in the United States. That \nis a judgment of the Congress of the United States in enacting \nlegislation on the death penalty on the crime bill which was passed \nlast year--a very controversial bill with many aspects going in a \nnumber of directions, some with gun control, others with providing more \npolice, others with building more prisons.\n  I supported that bill, in large part because of the death penalty and \nthe strong stands taken in that bill against violent crime.\n  Mr. President, there are many, many cases which illustrate the \nenormous delays in the criminal justice system and one which I have \ncited on the floor before. The Congressional Record is replete with \ncitations of cases which show the deterrent effect of the death penalty \nand show the enormous delays under habeas corpus, but the Robert Alton \nHarris case is one which shows it vividly.\n  Defendant Harris was arraigned for a double murder back in July of \n1978. His case wound through the courts running for some 14 years until \n1992. In the course of this case, Mr. Harris filed 10 State habeas \ncorpus petitions under the laws of California, 6 Federal habeas corpus \npetitions, 4 Federal stays of executions, there were 5 petitions for \ncertiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the case went \non virtually interminably. Finally, in a very unusual order, the \nSupreme Court of the United States directed the lower Federal courts \nnot to issue any more stays of execution for Harris.\n  There is another aspect to these very long delays, Mr. President. It \ninvolves the question as to whether the protracted, lengthy period of \ntime defendants wait to have their death sentences carried out is \nitself, in fact, cruel and unusual punishment.\n  In a case before the Supreme Court of the United States as reported \nin the Washington Post on March 28 of this year, Justice Stevens, \njoined by Justice Breyer, called upon the lower courts to begin to \nexamine whether executing a prisoner who has spent many years on death \nrow violates the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  There was a case in 1989 where the British Government declined to \nextradite a defendant, Jens Soering, to Virginia on murder charges \nuntil the prosecutor agreed not to seek the death penalty because the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights had ruled that confinement in a Virginia \nprison for 6 to 8 years awaiting execution violated the European \nConvention on Human Rights.\n  So we have a situation where these long delays involve continuing \ntravail and pain to the family of the victims awaiting closure and \nawaiting disposition of the case. We also have an adjudication under \nthe European Convention on Human Rights that concluded that the \npractice in the State of Virginia where cases were delayed for 6 to 8 \nyears constitutes cruel and unusual punishment--all of these factors \ncome together. Delays now average over 9 years across the United \nStates. It seems to me the Congress of the United States, which has the \nauthority to establish timetables and procedures for the Federal \ncourts, ought to act to make the death penalty an effective deterrent. \nThis legislation will move precisely in that direction.\n  Under the Specter-Hatch bill there will be a time limit of 6 months \nfor the defendant to file his petition for a writ [[Page S7805]] of \nhabeas corpus in the Federal courts in a capital case. At the present \ntime, without any statute of limitations, some of those on death row \nwait until the death penalty is imminent before filing the petition. \nThis will put into effect a 6-month time limit in capital cases, where \nthe State has provided adequate counsel in its post-conviction \nproceedings. So there is motivation under the pending legislation for \nadequate counsel to be appointed by the States. Not only will the \nappointment of counsel expedite the process, but it will ensure that \nthe defendant will be accorded his or her rights.\n  After that period of time, a U.S. district court will have a period \nof 180 days to decide a habeas corpus petition in a capital case. That \nreally is a sufficient period of time. That I can personally attest to \nfrom my own experience as an assistant district attorney and district \nattorney handling habeas corpus cases in both the State and Federal \ncourts. If that time is insufficient, a judge can extend the time by \nwriting an opinion stating his or her reasons. Right now, there are \ncases that have been pending before some Federal district judges for \nyears. We must act to impose some limit on the length of time such \ncases are allowed to linger.\n  This deadline is not unduly burdensome to a Federal judge, to take up \na case and decide it in 6 months. Even in the States which have the \nhighest incidence of capital punishment, with the most defendants on \ndeath row--Florida, California, Texas--each Federal judge would not \nhave a case sooner than once every 18 months or so. On appeal, the \nFederal court of appeals would have the obligation to decide the case \nwithin 120 days of briefing.\n  If a defendant sought to file any subsequent petition for habeas \ncorpus, he would not be allowed to do so unless there was newly \ndiscovered evidence going to his guilt which could not have been \navailable at an earlier time. This is a reasonably strict standard \nagainst filing repetitious petitions. And a second petition would be \nallowed only if the court of appeals agrees to permit the filing of the \npetition in the district court. Because the courts of appeals act in \npanels of three judges, two judges will have to agree that a subsequent \npetition satisfies the rigorous standards of this bill before it is \nfiled in the district court.\n  So I think we have set forth here a timetable which is realistic and \nreasonable, and a structure which will make the death penalty a \nmeaningful deterrent, cutting back the time from some 20 years, in \nextreme cases, to a reasonable timeframe which can be done with \nfairness to all parties in the course of some 2 years.\n  This legislation is not crafted in a way which is totally acceptable \nto me but it has been hammered out over the course of a great many \nnegotiations and discussions with the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nthe chairman. While he is on the floor I would like to praise him for \nhis work in this field and for his work on the committee generally. \nThis has been a very, very difficult matter to come to closure on. I \nthink in the posture of the terrorism problem, that we are on the \nverge, now, of really moving forward and enacting this very important \nlegislation.\n  I think it will pass the Senate. I believe it will pass the House. I \nthink once presented to the President, it will be enacted into law and \nwill very significantly improve the administration of criminal justice \nin the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kindness. I \nhave to say we would not be as far along here on habeas corpus and \nhaving it in this bill if it was not for his leadership in this area. \nHe is one of the few people in the whole Congress who really \nunderstands this issue very fully and thoroughly, and I have to give \nhim an awful lot of credit on it.\n  We have worked together with the States attorneys general to have the \nlanguage we have in this bill. I hope everybody on this floor will vote \ndown these amendments that are being brought up here today because I \nthink it is the only way we can make the change and get rid of these \nfrivolous appeals, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and get the \nsystem so it works in a just and fair way, the way it should.\n  The amendment we have will protect civil liberties and constitutional \nrights while at the same time protecting the citizens and the victims \nand their families from the incessant appeals that really have been the \nnorm in our society.\n  So I thank my colleague for his leadership on this and I just \npersonally respect him and appreciate him and consider him a great \nfriend.\n  We are prepared to go. We are supposed to have a vote at 10:15. I \nhope we can move ahead on the bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleague for being late.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n(Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to deleting habeas corpus for \n                            State prisoners)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1217.\n\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Delete title 6, subtitle A, and insert the following:\n\n        Subtitle A--Collateral Review in Federal Criminal Cases\n\n     SEC. 601.

Mr. President, this is the first of a series of several \namendments relating to habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is probably the \nmost time honored phrase in our English jurisprudential criminal \njustice system, referred to as the Great Writ. But it is not very well \nunderstood by a vast majority of people including many lawyers.\n   I say at the outset here that one of the things we are going to hear \ntoday--we are going to hear a great deal about how the system is \nabused. We are going to be told that time and again. We will see \ncharts. We have been seeing these charts for years that show that a man \nor woman, in almost every case it has been a man, who has been \nsentenced to death, because of a series of frivolous appeals and \nsuccessive habeas corpus petitions has remained in a prison cell and \nalive for--some of the examples of 10, 12, 14, 18 years after having \ncommitted the crime and having been convicted by a jury of their peers \nand having exhausted their appeals--after having committed a heinous \ncrime. And we are left with the impression that the choice here is a \nstark choice between a continuation of a system where everybody \nconvicted of a heinous crime and sentenced to death languishes in a \nprison for a decade or more, costing the system money and avoiding \ntheir ultimate fate that the choice is between that system and a system \nthat essentially eliminates the right of a Federal court to review the \nactions taken by a State court to determine whether or not someone had \nbeen granted a fair trial. That is what habeas corpus is all about. \nHabeas corpus is all about saying when so and so is convicted, they \nwere deprived of certain rights and opportunities and that they were \nnot given a fair shake in the system.\n  Habeas corpus came about and really came in the forefront of the \nAmerican political and legal system around 1917 when the State of \nGeorgia put to death someone who by everyone's account should not have \nbeen put to death, and there was no ability of the Federal court to \nreview the actions taken by the Georgia State court. The reason I give \nthis background--and in light of the fact that I got here a few minutes \nlate and there are Senators who have commitments early in the morning \non this, I am going to shorten this particular amendment. But what we \nare told is that--and you will hear time and again this morning--the \nsystem is terrible, everyone abuses the system, and essentially State \ncourts do a good job. Why have the Federal courts in this thing at all? \nI realize I am putting colloquial terms to this, but that is the \nessence of it.\n  The amendments that I am going to offer today and others will offer \ntoday are not designed to maintain the system as it is. We will show in \nfuture amendments that, if we amend the habeas corpus law the way we \nwould like to as opposed to the way it is in the Republican bill, you \nstill would have a situation where someone would have to have their \nfate executed and carried out after a trial by their peers and a \nfinding of guilt within a very short amount of time. You would not have \nthese 12-, 14-, 16-, or 18-year delays in implementing a court's \ndecision.\n  As my former associate--I was his associate--a very fine trial lawyer \nin Wilmington, DE, always would say to the jury, ``I hope we keep our \neye on the ball here.'' I want us to try to focus, if we can, this \nmorning. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have \nrepeatedly said in this bill that we must do something to ensure swift \npunishment of those who committed the Oklahoma City bombing. That is \nsupposedly why, you might wonder, in a terrorism bill there is habeas \ncorpus.\n  Well, the constant argument put forward is, look, we have to do this \nbecause once we find the person who did this awful thing in Oklahoma \nand they are convicted and sentenced to death, the death penalty must \nbe carried out swiftly. I might add, a bill that the Presiding Officer \nand I voted for, the Biden crime bill, is the only reason there is a \ndeath penalty. Had we not voted for that bill, had that not passed last \nyear, this finding of a person who committed the bombing, that person \nunder Federal law would not be eligible to be put to death. There is no \nquestion that because of the action you and I and others took last year \nthere is a death penalty now.\n  So unlike the World Trade Tower, no death penalty would be there \nunder Federal law had we not passed the Biden crime bill then. Now \nthere is. But they say now, once we find this person, we are going to \ngo put them to death, what we have to do--this will be a Federal prison \nbecause under Federal law they will be prosecuted, not under the \nOklahoma law but Federal law. They are eligible for the death penalty, \nand they will be convicted--I assume, and it is our fervent hope they \nwill be convicted--and now they get sentenced to death. And the \nPresident and the Attorney General say they want the death penalty for \nwhomever is convicted. My friends say, well, what we have to do now is \nhave habeas corpus changed so no one will languish in prison. I do not \nthink there is anybody in the Federal system right now--and I am \nlooking to my staff for confirmation--who sits on death row filing \nhabeas corpus petitions. There is one habeas corpus petition that has \nbeen filed in the Federal system.\n  So what I want to say to my friends--and I will put the rest of this \nin the Record--is this has nothing to do with terrorism. Not one of the \nhorror stories Senator Hatch has given or has given us on the Senate \nfloor relates to a terrorist who was prosecuted in the Federal court. \nThey all relate to someone who is prosecuted in State court and has \nspent too long sitting on death row. There are useful and practical \nsteps we can take to prevent future terrorist activities. We can reform \nhabeas corpus petitions for State court prisoners. But in reforming \nhabeas corpus petitions for State court prisoners, not one of them will \naffect terrorism because--I want to make it real clear--if we have a \nterrorist convicted under Federal law in a Federal court, then Federal \nhabeas applies.\n  So my amendment is very simple. It says if you want to deal with \nterrorism, that is the purpose of putting habeas corpus in this bill \nand then limit it to Federal cases; limit it to Federal prisoners. That \nis the stated purpose. Do not go back and change the whole State court \nsystem. Do not go back and change the whole State habeas system on this \nbill. Debate it on a bill which should be the crime bill that is coming \nup in the next couple of weeks we are told.\n  There was a lot of discussion yesterday about nongermane amendments. \nThis amendment strikes the 95 percent of the habeas bill that is not \ngermane and keeps the 5 percent that is germane. Ninety-five percent of \nwhat my friends have in this bill relates to State prisoners, State \ncourts, and has nothing to do with terrorism, nothing to do with \nOklahoma City, but 5 percent arguably does.\n  My amendment says let us pass the 5 percent that has to do with \nFederal prisoners held in Federal prisons convicted in Federal courts \nand change the habeas the way they want for those prisoners. That will \ndeal with Oklahoma City the way they say they want it and it will not \nmess up the 95 percent of the cases that deal with the State prisoners \nin State prisons in State courts and deny essentially Federal review of \nthose State decisions.\n  So I will reserve the remainder of my time by saying that it is \nsimple. My amendment simply says, all right, if this is about Oklahoma \nCity, let us have it about Oklahoma City. The provisions in the bill \nrelate to Federal prisoners and Federal habeas corpus.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 5 minutes 2 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered to limit habeas reform exclusively to Federal cases.\n  Some have argued that habeas reform as applied to the States is not \ngermane to this debate. Those individuals, including my distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware, contend that a [[Page S7807]] reform of the \nFederal overview of State convictions is meaningless in the context of \nthe debate we are having. They are perhaps willing to admit that some \nrevision of the collateral review of cases tried in Federal court may \nbe in order, but they contend that reform of Federal collateral review \nof cases tried in State court is unnecessary.\n  This position is simply incorrect. I would like to read from a letter \nwritten by Robert H. Macy, district attorney of Oklahoma City, and a \nDemocrat:\n\n       [I]mmediately following the trial or trials in federal \n     court, I shall, working in cooperation with the United States \n     Department of Justice and the Federal law enforcement \n     agencies investigating the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \n     Building, prosecute in Oklahoma State court the cowards \n     responsible for murdering innocent people in the area \n     surrounding the federal building. And I shall seek the death \n     penalty. We must never forget that this bombing took several \n     lives and injured dozens of persons in the neighborhood and \n     businesses near the building. The State of Oklahoma has an \n     overwhelming, compelling interest to seek, and obtain the \n     maximum penalty allowable by law for the senseless and \n     cowardly killings.\n\n  In our reaction to the destruction of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City, we may overlook the fact that the bombing also caused \nthe death of people who were not inside the building itself, or even on \nFederal property. The State of Oklahoma, not the Federal Government, \nwill thus prosecute those responsible for the bombing that killed \npeople outside of the Federal building. In those instances, Federal \njurisdiction may not obtain and it will thus be necessary to prosecute \nthe killers in State, as well as\n Federal, court.\n\n  A failure to enact a complete, meaningful, reform of habeas corpus \nproceedings may enable the individuals in this case, provided they are \napprehended and duly convicted, to frustrate the demands of justice. \nThe blood of the innocent men and women are on the hands of the evil \ncowards who committed this terrible tragedy. Justice must be, as \nPresident Clinton declared, ``swift, certain, and severe.''\n  Moreover, failure to enact meaningful, comprehensive, habeas reform \nwill permit other killers who have terrorized their communities to \ncontinue to frustrate the judicial system. If we adopt the proposed \namendment, we will create a schism between State and Federal capital \nlaw. In other words, murders tried in Federal court will face \nimposition of their final penalty more swiftly than persons tried for \ncapital crimes in State cases. Why should we adopt such a piecemeal \napproach to reform, one that will leave such a gap between State and \nFederal cases? It simply makes no sense to reform habeas proceedings \nfor cases tried in Federal court but leave the current disastrous \nsystem in place for cases tried in State court.\n  As of January 1, 1995, there were some 2,976 inmates on death row. \nYet, only 38 prisoners were executed last year, and the States have \nexecuted only 263 criminals since 1973. Abuse of the habeas process \nfeatures strongly in the extraordinary delay between sentence and the \ncarrying out of that sentence.\n  In my home State of Utah, for example, convicted murderer William \nAndrews delayed the imposition of a constitutionally imposed death \nsentence for over 18 years. The State had to put up millions of dollars \nin precious criminal justice resources to litigate his meritless \nclaims. His guilt was never in question. He was not an innocent person \nseeking freedom from an illegal punishment. Rather, he simply wanted to \nfrustrate the imposition of punishment his heinous crimes warranted.\n  This abuse of habeas corpus litigation, particularly in those cases \ninvolving lawfully imposed death sentences, has taken a dreadful toll \non victims' families, seriously eroded the public's confidence in our \ncriminal justice system, and drained State criminal justice resources. \nThis is simply not a just system.\n  Justice demands that lawfully imposed sentences be carried out. \nJustice demands that we now adopt meaningful habeas corpus reform. \nJustice demands that we not permit those who would perpetuate the \ncurrent system to steer us from our course. We must do as the victims, \nfamilies, and friends of those who have asked us to do: enact \nmeaningful, comprehensive habeas reform now.\n  Mr. President, I know a number of our colleagues are ready to vote on \nthis. Let me just make three or four points that I think are important \nwith regard to the amendment of my friend and colleague.\n  I contend that the Biden amendment--and I think anybody who reads it \nwould gut the habeas corpus title of this bill by applying habeas \ncorpus reform solely to Federal capital convictions thus making reform \ninapplicable to the majority of capital cases including the Oklahoma \nState prosecution for murders of some of the people killed in Oklahoma. \nI am referring to those victims who were not Federal employees but were \nkilled by the blast while outside of the building. If this amendment \npasses, there would be no habeas reform that would apply to them.\n  So I would like to make three additional points about why we should \nnot vote for the Biden amendment before I move to table the amendment.\n  First, I have made this point that where people who were not Federal \nemployees were outside the building, the terrorist will be prosecuted \nin State court for those people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Robert H. Macy, a Democrat \ndistrict attorney of Oklahoma City, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                                            District Attorney,\n\n                                  Oklahoma City, OK, May 24, 1995.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The purpose of this letter is to \n     express my support for the inclusion of the provisions for \n     reform of Federal Habeas Corpus authored by Senator Spector \n     and you in the Anti-terrorism Bill, S735. Apparently some \n     persons have raised questions about the appropriateness of \n     this measure. Specifically, I have been told that there are \n     some who do not see the importance of these reform measures \n     in cases, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, which will \n     initially be prosecuted by Federal Court.\n       There are two points I would like to make in response to \n     those questions. First, immediately following the trial or \n     trials in Federal Court, I shall, working in cooperation with \n     the United States Department of Justice and the Federal law \n     enforcement agencies investigating the bombing of the Alfred \n     P. Murrah Building, prosecute in Oklahoma State Court the \n     cowards responsible for murdering innocent people in the area \n     surrounding the federal building. And I shall seek the death \n     penalty. We must never forget that this bombing took several \n     lives and injured dozens of persons in the neighborhood and \n     businesses near the building. The State of Oklahoma has an \n     overwhelming, compelling interest to seek and obtain the \n     maximum penalty allowable by law for the senseless and \n     cowardly killings. Not only is it in the interest of the \n     State, it is my sworn duty to seek those sanctions, and I \n     intend to fully carry out my responsibilities.\n       The reform measures contained in the Spector, Hatch, Dole \n     Habeas Corpus Reform measures contained in S735 will in my \n     judgment significantly curb the abuse and delays inherent in \n     current habeas practice. Every day of delay represents a \n     victory for these cowardly cold blooded killers and another \n     day of defeat and suffering for the victims and all other \n     Americans who cry out for justice.\n       Secondly, your reform provisions will also create \n     significant time savings during appeals from federal \n     convictions as well. Examples of this include:\n       Time limitations on when habeas petitions may be filed; \n     time deadlines on when federal courts must rule on habeas \n     petitions; a requirement that federal courts prioritize \n     consideration of capital appeals; reform of the abuses \n     inherent in the probable cause process; limitations on second \n     and successive petitions.\n       As Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National \n     District Attorney's Association I am proud to inform you that \n     America's prosecutors speak with one voice and that we are \n     calling upon you and your colleagues to set your priorities \n     and enact reforms which will provide to every convicted \n     murderer the rights guaranteed by the constitution, but \n     absolutely no further consideration or delay than is \n     constitutionally required.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Robert H. Macy,\n                                                District Attorney.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in this letter, Mr. Macy makes it very \nclear that he intends to prosecute these terrorists under State law who \ncaused the Oklahoma City bombing. If he does, the Biden amendment will \nnot apply to them. So they can be on death row, even though we want \nswift, secure, and fast judgment, they would be on death row for \nanywhere up to 50 years, which is the case of one person in our society \n\n[[Page S7808]] today still sitting on death row almost 50 years later.\n  So, first, it does not take care of those Federal employees who were \nkilled outside the building should the State of Oklahoma choose to \nprosecute those responsible--as Robert Macy has stated will occur.\n  Second, we do not want piecemeal reform. If a robber kills one of the \nFederal employees the night before the bombing in Oklahoma City or \nanywhere else, why should we treat that killer any differently from the \nOklahoma terrorists simply because he would be tried in a State court \nrather than a Federal court? We need to have it apply across the board, \nand the vast majority of murders are committed in the States and \nprosecuted by the State courts, and they would not be affected by the \nBiden amendment.\n  Third, let us say that the Federal Government prosecutors, for some \nreason or other, blow the prosecution. Assume we are unable to get a \nconviction against these terrorists in the Federal courts. The double \njeopardy clause still allows the State to prosecute those terrorists or \nthose murderers in State court under State law. But if they do \nprosecute them and we do not reform Federal habeas corpus review of \nState cases, then we will have the same incessant, frivolous appeals ad \nhominem, day and night, from that point on because this amendment would \nnot take care of that problem. If we are going to pass habeas reform, \nlet us pass real habeas reform. Let us do it straight up. Let us \nprotect the constitutional rights, which our amendment does do in the \nbill. Let us protect civil liberties, but let us get some finality into \nthe law so that the frivolous appeal game will be over.\n  Basically, those are the three things: People killed who are not \nFederal employees outside the building, those prosecutions will be \nbrought in State court. And the Biden amendment would not apply to the \nbenefit of habeas reform to that case. We do not want piecemeal reform. \nIf a robber kills a Federal employee the night before the bombing in \nOklahoma City, just to give a hypothetical, and the State has to bring \nthe murder action against that individual, then why should that person \nnot be subject to the same rules as the murderers in the Oklahoma City \nbombing? And if the Federal prosecutor blows the prosecution, why \nshould not the State prosecutor be able to bring action under the State \nlaws and under those circumstances prosecute the killers and have the \nsame rule apply under those circumstances as well?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be very brief in reply.\n  With regard to the point that if someone is not a Federal employee \noutside the building is killed, fortunately, we passed the Biden crime \nbill last year, and under title 18, section 2332(A) ``Use of Weapons of \nMass Destruction''--I would refer my colleague to that--anyone killed \nat all, whether sitting across the street drinking a cup of coffee, \nwhether they are riding by in their automobile, whether they are a \nFederal employee or whether they are an alien, it does not matter; they \nare subject to the Federal death penalty. So the Senator is missing the \npoint.\n  Second, we do want universal reform of habeas corpus. Let us do it on \na bill that we are supposed to do it on. Let us do it on the crime \nbill.\n  And, No. 3, as to the idea that we are somehow going to have two \ndifferent standards apply, the real issue is under what circumstances \ndoes a Federal court have a right to review a State court's judgment. \nIt has nothing to do with terrorism under this provision. It has \nnothing to do with Oklahoma City. We should deal with it. We should \ndiscuss it. We should debate it, not on this bill.\n  I am prepared, whenever the Senator wants, to move to the tabling of \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield. Let me just make a point that a \nState prosecutor--a Democrat--is going to prosecute these terrorists, \nand this habeas reform, if the Biden amendment passes, will not apply \nto them. And that, in a nutshell, is the problem with this amendment. \nWe ought to make our habeas reform apply to both Federal and State \nconvictions.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would take issue with the last statement \nof my friend. I will not debate it now. We will have plenty of time to \ndo that.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the \nSenator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], the Senator from Pennsylvania \n[Mr. Santorum], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson], would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand one of our colleagues thought \nthis was an up-or-down vote as opposed to a tabling motion and would \nlike to ask unanimous consent to change the vote which will not affect \nthe outcome.\n                             Change of Vote\n  Mrs. BOXER. On this last rollcall vote No. 237, I voted ``yea.'' It \nwas my intention to vote ``nay.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote. This will in no way change the \noutcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to speak generally on the subject \nof habeas corpus and in support of the amendments by Senators Biden and \nLevin that will be offered to the bill.\n  At the outset, I want to emphasize my support for passage of a strong \nantiterrorism bill that gives law enforcement agencies the tools they \nneed to combat crimes of terror at home and abroad. I commend President \nClinton and the Senators who brought in legislation expeditiously \nbefore the Senate. There is much in this legislation that deserves to \nbe enacted into law as soon as possible.\n  It is unfortunate, therefore, that the proponents of the bill have \ninjected into it an unrelated and highly controversial subject; namely, \ndrastic changes to longstanding law relating to habeas corpus.\n  The manager of the bill says that habeas corpus is relevant because \nthe suspects charged in the Oklahoma City \n[[Page S7809]] bombings are charged with a capital offense. But that \nfact presents absolutely no justification for changing the rules with \nregard to State prisoners.\n  The inclusion of sweeping habeas corpus reform in this bill is the \nworst kind of opportunism, and I regret that it has occurred in the \nwake of this national tragedy.\n  When, and if, capital punishment is imposed, it must be imposed in a \nconstitutional manner. That is accomplished through the writ of habeas \ncorpus--a process so central to our constitutional system of Government \nthat it is often called the ``Great Writ.''\n  Clearly, some form of habeas corpus is needed to avoid excessive \nlitigation, repetitive reviews, and the delays that sometimes \ncharacterize the present system. In a series of decisions over the past \n10 years, the Supreme Court itself has imposed certain restrictions on \nthe ability of death row inmates to obtain review through habeas \ncorpus, and the issue has brought heated controversy to our \ncongressional debates on crime bills in recent years.\n  In the past, Senator Biden, among others, has proposed legislation to \nlimit the number and length of death row appeals, but at the same time \nto make sure that post-conviction review in the Federal courts is \nmeaningful. But he adhered to the sensible conclusion of former Justice \nLewis Powell, who in a landmark report commissioned by Chief Justice \nRehnquist said the following:\n\n       Capital cases should be subject to one fair and complete \n     course of collateral review through the State and Federal \n     system. Where the death penalty is involved, fairness means a \n     searching and impartial review of the propriety of the \n     sentence.\n\n  But the bill before us today does not strike a fair balance. It \nactually precludes the meaningful review that Justice Powell said was \nnecessary, and it increases the likelihood that innocent people will be \nexecuted in this country.\n  A principal problem is that this bill does nothing to ensure that \ndeath penalty defendants receive adequate legal representation at their \noriginal trial.\n  As many as 20 percent of all death sentences are overturned after \nFederal habeas corpus review, very often because a defendant has been \ninadequately represented at trial.\n  This bill also eliminates the current requirement that poor \ndefendants receive appointed counsel in Federal habeas corpus \nproceedings. I reject that view. The appointment of attorneys for death \nrow inmates is not a question of sympathy, it is a question of \nfundamental fairness.\n  In addition, the bill limits the circumstances under which a death \nrow inmate may raise a claim of innocence based on newly discovered \nevidence. The proposal to limit inmates to one bite at the apple is \nsound in principle, but surely our interest in swift executions must \ngive way in the face of new evidence that an innocent person is about \nto be put to death.\n  At any time prior to the execution there must be a forum in which \nnon-frivolous claims of innocence can be heard. As Supreme Court \nJustice Potter Stewart once wrote, ``swift justice demands more than \njust swiftness.''\n  Finally, the bill might be read to require Federal courts to defer to \nState courts on issues of Federal constitutional law. In part the bill \nstates that a Federal court cannot grant a writ of habeas corpus based \non Federal constitutional claims unless the State court judgment was an \n``unreasonable application of Federal law.''\n  No one thinks that under current law the Federal courts just ignore \nState court decisions, even on questions of Federal constitutional law. \nThe federal courts respect the State courts and give their decisions a \ngreat deal of attention. The specialists I have talked to tell me that \nthe Federal courts, even now, grant relief on constitutional claims \nonly when it is pretty clear that a prisoner's constitutional rights \nwere violated.\n  This being true, a bill that tells the Federal courts that they \nshould not grant relief unless they are satisfied that a prisoner's \nclearly established rights were violated may not change things very \nmuch.\n  I do not see the need for this kind of language in the bill, but to \nthe extent it allows the Federal courts to do what they are doing now, \nit may do no great harm. I just hope that, if the bill is adopted, it \nwill be interpreted correctly.\n  A contrary interpretation would stand our Federal system on its head. \nWhy should a Federal court defer to the judgment of a State court on a \nmatter of Federal constitutional law? The notion that a Federal court \nwould be rendered incapable of correcting a constitutional error \nbecause it was not an unreasonable constitutional error is \nunacceptable, especially in capital cases.\n  Ever since the days of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, the \nFederal courts have historically served as the great defenders of \nconstitutional protections. They must remain so.\n  Whatever the merits of this sweeping habeas corpus reform, such \ndrastic changes should not be adopted on this bill. Nothing in this \nlegislation would be more detrimental to the values of the Nation and \nour Constitution than for Congress, in its rush to combat terrorism, to \nstrip away venerable constitutional questions.\n  The perpetrators of the Oklahoma City tragedy will have triumphed if \ntheir actions promote us to short-circuit the Constitution.\n  This bill goes far beyond terrorism and far beyond Federal prisoners. \nIt severely limits the ability of any State prisoner--not just \nterrorists, but any State prisoner--to seek Federal court review of \nconstitutional rights. This is an extremely controversial, very \ncomplicated proposal. It is wrong to try to sneak it into an \nantiterrorism bill that we all want to pass as quickly as we reasonably \ncan.\n  The debate on comprehensive habeas corpus reform should take place \nwhen we take up the omnibus crime bill. The attempt to jam it into the \npending bill is a cynical attempt to manipulate public concern about \nterrorism, and the Congress should reject it.\n  I urge the Senate to act responsibly on this critical issue. We \nshould adopt the Biden and Levin amendments on the subject, and if \nnecessary resume the rest of the debate on habeas corpus when the crime \nbill comes before the Senate.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wanted to indicate we now have to dispose \nof the Biden amendment No. 1217. My understanding is that the Senator \nfrom Delaware is prepared to offer a second.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my intention would be to offer the second \namendment on counsel standards required in Federal habeas corpus cases. \nI think the number is 1226.\n  Then I will have one more. The most important, from my perspective, \nof the amendments I have is the one relating to the deference standard \nthat is in the Republican bill.\n  Senator Graham of Florida has indicated to me that he will not offer \nhis amendment. Senator Levin, I believe, will be ready to offer his \namendment shortly.\n  I would respectfully request that the Presiding Officer, Mr. Kyl, \noffer his amendment sometime between that. It is my intention to offer \nmy amendment last. I will offer the first three, but the last amendment \non habeas I would like very much to be my amendment on deference.\n  We will by that time have eliminated all Democratic amendments. I \nunderstand there is one--unless Mr. Kyl is withdrawing his--there is \none amendment on the other side.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have one, and we have 30 minutes equally divided on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to do that. We have apparently not reached a \ntime agreement. I am prepared to enter now into a time agreement on \nthis amendment of 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1226 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to requiring counsel for \n                      federal habeas proceedings)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1226 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with. [[Page S7810]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Delete from page 106, line 20 through all of page 125 and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(h) The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during \n     Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall \n     not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under \n     section 2254.''.\n\n     SEC. 605.

Mr. President, in 1988, we passed a bill which I had \nauthored with several others called the Death Penalty for Drug Kingpins \nAct.\n  It was the first constitutional Federal death penalty to go on the \nbooks after 1972 when the Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty.\n  I helped write that bill, much to the dismay of many of my liberal \nfriends who could not understand why I was writing such a bill. It was \na bill strongly promoted by President Bush, and it passed by a lopsided \nvote of 65 to 29, with only six Republicans voting against the bill.\n  When we passed that bill, we recognized that if the Federal \nGovernment was going to put a person to death, we better get it right. \nWe better have the right guy and we better have had a fair trial, and \nthe defendant better have had his or her day in court.\n  As part of the law, we said that the capital defendant--the defendant \naccused of a crime which carried with it the death penalty--in that \ncase the person should have a lawyer. Kind of axiomatic. They should \nhave a lawyer if they are going to go to trial, a trial in which, if \nthat person is found guilty, they will be put to death.\n  That, of course, is also what the sixth amendment of the Constitution \nof the United States says. It explicitly says that ``In all criminal \nproceedings the accused shall have the assistance of counsel for his \ndefense.''\n  Remember Clarence Earl Gideon? The case was Gideon versus Wainwright. \nThe Supreme Court held that Mr. Gideon, accused of a crime, could not \nreceive a fair trial absent the right to a lawyer.\n  In that case, the court said, ``The sixth amendment stands as a \nconstant admonition that if the constitutional safeguards it provides \nbe lost, justice will not be done. The right of one charged with a \ncrime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair \ntrials in some countries, but it is in ours.''\n  Also, in the 1988 drug bill we said that prisoners, State or Federal, \nwho are looking the death penalty in the eye should have a lawyer for \ntheir Federal habeas corpus appeals. Again, we recognize that if the \nFederal Government is going to put its stamp of approval on a man's \nexecution, he should at least have a lawyer.\n But this Republican bill does something I am not sure they intended to \ndo, but they did. This Republican bill changes all of that. \nAstonishingly, it changes all of that. In a section entitled \n``technical amendments''--we should all keep our eyes open when someone \nsays ``this is just a technical amendment''--in a section entitled \n``technical amendments,'' this bill repeals the right to counsel in \nFederal capital cases. It says that the right to counsel is no right at \nall but a matter of discretion for the judge.\n\n  Let me refer you back to Gideon versus Wainwright, that famous last \nsentence which says, ``The right of one charged with a crime to counsel \nmay not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some \ncountries, but it is in ours.''\n  It does not say it is discretionary in ours. It does not say maybe it \nis all right in ours. It does not say it is OK sometimes in ours. It \nsays, ``it is in ours.''\n  Astonishingly, this little technical amendment says the right to \ncounsel is a matter of discretion for the judge to decide.\n  I do not know what my colleagues were thinking of when they wrote \nthis. But what this seems to be saying is this: We do not care what the \nConstitution says. We do not care what the Supreme Court says. We think \nit is OK to deny a person who faces the Federal death penalty--and \nthere are now over 60 on the books--we think it is OK to deny that \nperson the assistance of counsel at his trial. I submit this \nproposition is as unthinkable as it is unconstitutional. And we should \nhave nothing to do with it.\n  The Republican bill also repeals the right we created in 1968 to a \nlawyer for Federal habeas corpus appeal. This bill says that there \nshould be no right to a lawyer, that it should instead be a matter of \ndiscretion for every individual case. What is more, the Republican \nproposal is taking away this right at the very same time it is changing \nthe rules of the game on habeas corpus, and placing new and sweeping \nrestrictions on the right of habeas corpus itself.\n  We want to change habeas corpus but they are making sweeping changes \nin the rules of the game. And in addition saying, and by the way, while \nwe are at it we are going to go back and deny you your right to counsel \nwhen you are filing such a petition. And one more thing, we are going \nto deny you the automatic right to a lawyer at your trial, before you \nare convicted.\n  It reminds me of that line that is often used, and I will paraphrase, \n``hanging first, trial later.'' What are we into here?\n  I agree we should cut down the delay and abuse of the Federal habeas \ncorpus and I have made a number of similar proposals over the years to \nimpose strict time limits on when such petitions could be filed and \nalso to limit the number that could be filed, essentially giving one \nbite out of the apple to drastically reduce the ability to have \nsuccessive petitions unless there is some egregious action that is \nlearned about after the petition is filed, the first petition.\n  But I have always believed if we are going to speed up the process, \nwhich I wish to do, if we are going to narrow the avenues of habeas \ncorpus, which I wish to do, we should at least make sure that the \npetitioner has a lawyer. That is what we said in 1988 and there has \nbeen no serious question raised about our wisdom in passing that law \nsince then.\n  Two years ago I entered into painstaking extensive negotiations with \nthe Nation's district attorneys and the attorneys general of the United \nStates over habeas corpus reform. We negotiated for months. We logged \nhundreds of hours, argued over scores of serious issues before we came \nup with a lengthy and comprehensive compromise--which, I might say and \nI probably should not, my staff will not like this, which the liberal \npress killed. The liberal press told us this was somehow a terrible \nthing to do.\n  I kept saying we better do this or they are going to take it all \naway. But I hope everybody is listening who helped kill that \ncompromise.\n  But not once in all our discussions with the Nation's prosecutors, I \nwas not talking with the public defenders. I was not talking with the \ndefense bar. I was talking with the Nation's prosecutors, the DA's back \nhome, the State's attorneys general back home. Not one time in our \ntalks did the prosecutors propose the repeal of the 1988 right to a \nlawyer in a habeas corpus petition. Not once did they argue that the \nright to counsel in habeas corpus should be discretionary. Not once did \nthey suggest that the right to counsel at a trial should be denied.\n  As a matter of fact, what they constantly said was that the best way \nto shorten the appeals, the best way to cut down on the abuse, was to \ndo it right the first time. They argued--not me--they, the prosecutors, \nRepublican and Democrat--they said if you want to get this thing on \ntrack make sure there is a competent lawyer representing these people \nduring this stage of the proceeding. Because they pointed out that most \nof the habeas corpus petitions that are granted, and the Federal courts \ngrant many, most of the ones that are granted are granted because the \ncourt concludes that the defendant did not have adequate counsel, they \nwere denied their right to know what a fair trial should be.\n  So here you had the prosecutor--not the defense bar--saying, ``Make \nsure that the defendant has legal counsel and then give him one bite \nout of the apple.''\n  These are experienced people. These are the people who try these \ncases. These are the people who respond to these habeas corpus \npetitions.\n  I might say to those who are listening, I have to keep reminding \npeople-- [[Page S7813]] habeas corpus. If a habeas corpus petition is \ngranted it does not mean anyone goes free. The man or woman still stays \nbehind bars. All it says is they get a new trial. This is not a \npetition for innocence that can be decided in terms of releasing \nsomeone. This merely says that a prisoner behind bars slips a paper \nbetween the bars and says: Send this to the judge, ask him to take a \nlook at it because I do not think I got a fair trial.\n  That is what it is. And here we had for months of negotiations--\nmonths--worked out a compromise, and these hard-nosed prosecutors in \nour home States said make sure they have counsel. That is the best \ninsurance for the public at large that we will not be wasting their \nmoney and their time.\n  Just last year the U.S. Supreme Court, which for the most part is no \nfriend of the Federal habeas petitioner, recognized the importance of \nhaving a lawyer. In the case of McFarland versus Scott, the Court said:\n\n       Quality legal representation is necessary in capital habeas \n     corpus proceedings in light of the seriousness of the \n     possible penalty and the unique and complex nature of the \n     litigation.\n\n  To say that habeas litigation is unique and complex is an \nunderstatement. Habeas petitions must meet tightened pleading \nrequirements. They must comply with the Supreme Court's intricate \ndoctrines on procedural default and waiver. Federal courts can \nsummarily dismiss any petition that appears legally insufficient on its \nface. And they can deny stay of execution where petitioner fails to \nraise a substantial Federal claim. But this provision tells these \nindigent defendants who have just been sentenced to death that they \nhave no right to the help of a lawyer, that they might have to navigate \nthe arcane, complicated and hazardous sea of the Supreme Court \njurisprudence and statutory rules by themselves.\n  Quite apart from what I believe is the fundamental unfairness of this \nproposition, I also think at a practical level it will waste a lot of \ntime and a lot of money to deny a lawyer at this point. First, ask any \nexperienced lawyer or prosecutor. Almost all would rather have a \ncompetent adversary who can adequately frame and present issues over an \nincompetent one who does not have the first clue about how to present \nhis arguments. Most experienced lawyers would tell you that having \nsomeone who has no training on the other side only slows things down \nbecause the trained lawyer and the judge end up doing a lot of extra \nwork just to figure out what the untrained lawyer is trying to say and \nto make sure reversible error is not created.\n  What is more, under the Republican proposal, valuable resources will \nbe squandered in litigation at the outset over whether counsel should \nor should not be appointed. If the judge ends up appointing counsel, \nall that time and money will have been wasted, and if the judge does \nnot appoint counsel, the indigent death row inmate will be left to find \nhis own way through some of the most complicated legal doctrines \nimaginable. This just does not make sense, in my view, as a practical \nmatter or as a matter of principle.\n  We should not in our haste to hurry up executions lose sight of our \ncommitment to constitutional values. We should not endorse proposals \nthat increase the chance that, where execution is imminent, an innocent \nperson be executed. We should not, I believe, sacrifice certainty in \nthe name of speed, or fairness in the name of vengeance.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, I really believe that everyone \nshould understand we are not talking about changing any of the ways in \nwhich we deal with habeas corpus in this amendment. We are not talking \nabout whether the Biden approach of only one petition or their approach \nof only one petition is the best one. We are not talking about whether \nwe are going to cut the delay by a year or a month or a day. What we \nare talking about is a fundamental principle, one that, as it relates \nto the trial, has been established since Gideon versus Wainwright, and \nin many instances before that, and one as it relates to Federal habeas \ncorpus that was established in 1988.\n  I ask my friend from Utah, because it may have been an oversight, \nwhether he really intended to eliminate the right to counsel at trial \nas well as the right to counsel in a habeas corpus petition.\n  So I sincerely hope my colleagues will take a close look at this. \nThis does not have to do with speeding up the process; this has to do \nwith the fundamental fairness. Are we going to stick with \nconstitutional principle established several decades ago in this \ncountry saying you are entitled to a lawyer at a trial and, if you \ncannot afford one, the court will appoint one as a matter of right and \nyou are entitled to a lawyer at the Federal level when you file a \nhabeas corpus petition? The practical implication of all that is that \nmost prosecutors will tell you that will speed the process up, not slow \nthe process down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, we will not deny counsel, nor will anybody; nor \nis it done, nor will it be done. The reason we oppose this amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware is this amendment \nwould strike the much-needed reform in 28 U.S.C. 848(q) contained in \nthe antiterrorism bill. Section 848(q), as many of our Senators and \nothers are no doubt aware, provides funding for capital litigants; that \nis, people who have been convicted of capital crimes, to hire among \nother things investigators and expert witnesses to assist them with \ntheir habeas petitions. That just presumes that there will be a lawyer \nthere as well, and there will be. I do not know of a case where a \nlawyer has not been appointed.\n  What you may not be aware of, however, is that section 848(q) permits \nthe defense counsel to contact the judge ex parte; that is, without the \nprosecutor being present, and requests additional funding for experts, \ninvestigators, researchers, and the like. In other words, defense \ncounsel can approach the judge outside the prosecutors presence and \nrequest the appointment of additional investigators or a new \npsychiatrist. The prosecutor is given neither the opportunity to \npresent nor even a chance to oppose such an appointment.\n  To add insult to injury, the court can order payment and the \nappointment to run nunc pro tunc; that is, from the time the defense \ncounsel initially hired the additional help. They can go way back. The \ndefense counsel can go hire these people, have no way of paying them, \nand then all of a sudden have an ex parte proceeding, and the judge can \norder that they be paid back to the date that the defense counsel hired \nthem. Talk about an abusive system. This means an investigator hired 6 \nmonths before can, when approved by the judge, receive payment for all \nof that investigator's past work, and in an ex parte proceeding, \nwithout the right of the prosecutor to be present. The defense counsel \ncan use whatever information the investigator provides as demonstrating \nthe need to hire that investigator and pay him from the time that he \nactually started working on the case.\n  There is absolutely no reason for ex parte proceedings on Federal \ncollateral review after the judgment is final. While such an \narrangement may arguably be appropriate at the trial level, it is not \ndefensible for postconviction collateral proceedings. It is likely that \nthe secrecy of these proceedings serves no other purpose than to permit \nthe defense counsel to, outside of the presence of the prosecutor or \nthe prosecution, argue their cases, obtain extensions of time, or \nreceive additional unwarranted investigative expenses. This is simply \nindefensible.\n  There should be no need for a confidential hearing at this point in \nthe proceeding. They will have had the hearing already. They will be on \nappeal. They will have had all kinds of constitutional protections \nunder our bill, and then to allow an ex parte proceeding to go ahead, \nthey will have raised their issues at the State level or they would be \nunexhausted. By the time the claim is presented in Federal court, all \nof these issues should have seen the light of day. Thus, no reason \nexists for defense counsel to hide whatever they may be investigating, \nnor should defense counsel be permitted to argue their petitions \noutside of the presence of other counsel.\n  It just makes sense that they would not. Section 848(q) has been \ngreatly abused, and has resulted in enormous [[Page S7814]] cost to the \nStates. The reform contained in the antiterrorism bill is thus greatly \nneeded. The Supreme Court has never required counsel in collateral \nproceedings. We do not make it discretionary to appoint counsel at \ntrial; counsel must be appointed at trial. I have to say that any \nargument that we do not is ridiculous. But this is a very, very \nimportant point.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against the Biden amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware that we have to be meticulous on right to \ncounsel. We cite Gideon versus Wainwright, and I was assistant district \nattorney when that case was decided in 1963. I am glad to say that in \nour Pennsylvania courts, in Philadelphia, counsel had been provided for \nindigent defendants long before the Supreme Court of the United States \nmade that a constitutional mandate in the landmark Gideon case, written \nby Justice Black, which said counsel was required for anyone who is \nhauled into court to face felony charges.\n  On a very personal note, I got my introduction into criminal law when \nI was assisting defendants back in March 1958, when I took my first \nturn defending indigents going down to the prison in the city of \nPhiladelphia and had, as a matter of fact, my first taste of what the \nrole of the trial lawyer was, of criminal prosecutions, and of being in \npublic service.\n  As I understand these provisions of the bill, it will greatly improve \nthe extraordinarily technical and complicated procedure that when a \nState opts into the expedited procedures, there is additional \nresponsibility on the State under the provisions of section 2261(b) to \nestablish a mechanism for the appointment of compensation and payment \nof reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel at the State \npostconviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners.\n  On the point about ex parte contacts by defense counsel, I doubt that \nthere is any real quarrel about the requirement that defense lawyers \nought to make an application in the presence of opposing counsel and \nought to make that application in advance of wanting to hire experts.\n  So it seems to me that whatever the state of the law is this is an \nadvancement in requiring that States under this provision that I just \nread have competent counsel.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. BIDEN. On page 125 of the Senator's bill, section 608, \n``Technical Amendments,'' it says ``Section 408(c) of the Controlled \nSubstance Act is amended in paragraph 34(a) by striking `shall' and \ninserting `may'.''\n  When you go and look at that paragraph in the law, it says, paragraph \n4(a) says ``notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the \ncontrary, in every criminal action in which the defendant is charged \nwith a crime,'' and then it goes on to say that the defendant, the \npresent law says, ``The defendant shall be entitled to the appointment \nof one or more attorneys and'' et cetera.\n  But the way it is changed in your law, it says that ``Notwithstanding \nany other provision of the law to the contrary, every criminal action \nin which a defendant is charged with a crime the defendant may be \nentitled.'' You strike the word ``shall'' and insert ``may.''\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do not have the referenced section. Let me get it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. All right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Even if you had a statutory provision, it would not \nalter the constitutional mandate of Gideon versus Wainwright. Not that \nwe should trifle with language which would in any way suggest \nundercutting the constitutional right to counsel, but if a statute in \nerror were to say that, Gideon versus Wainwright would control. You \nsimply cannot have a criminal proceeding where there is not counsel \nappointed for the defendant.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for 10 seconds, I think he is \nright, Mr. President, but I do not know why we should pass an \nunconstitutional statute, because this is clearly unconstitutional the \nway it is written.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond further to my colleague, if that is so, \nthat is something that I would certainly concur ought to be corrected. \nAnd I would take a look at that section right now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield time to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This certainly is not unconstitutional. This has been \nworked very carefully by top legal experts, State attorneys general and \nothers. The court has never mandated counsel in collateral proceedings, \nand I think that point has to be made. But there is going to be counsel \nappointed and always has been.\n  To be honest with you, what we are concerned about is that the way \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator from Delaware reads, we are \ngoing to wind up having nun pro tunc orders which will allow \npetitioners to have expert witness fees and investigators paid for from \nthe time that the defense counsel wants to hire all these people. The \nlaw currently allows these payments to be made at excessive cost to the \nStates on an ex parte, meaning one attorney only, proceeding. And that \njust should not be. So I hope that folks will vote this amendment down. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with the consent of my colleague--and I \nfailed to do this earlier--I would send a modification of my amendment, \na draft error correction in my amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I will withhold.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid \naside so that we can proceed to other business and also to work on some \nof the questions we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me very briefly state where we are \nright now. You can see the staffs scurrying around here. We have \nreached a meeting of the minds on two-thirds of the amendments that I \nhave offered here. The staff is trying to get precise language that \nwould accommodate the mutual agreement we have made here thus far. But \nthere is going to be one part of my amendment that is still going to be \npertinent, and I will speak to that later. But the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania and I would like to enter into a brief \ncolloquy on what I think will be the only remaining part of \ndisagreement in the Biden amendment that was sent up.\n  Very briefly, Mr. President, there were two sections of the Biden \namendment, one relating to counsel for an indigent in the filing of a \nhabeas corpus petition. The second provision is what the Senator from \nUtah spoke to, and that is the ability under present law for the \ncounsel of an indigent person to go to a judge, without notifying the \nprosecutor he is going to the judge, and in private--we call it in \ncamera--say, judge, I need you to authorize my ability to go hire a \npsychiatrist for the following reasons, or hire an investigator \n[[Page S7815]] for the following reasons. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is worried about that provision and suggests that that \nportion of the law is presently being abused. I do not believe it is \nabused.\n  I want to make a very brief statement now as to why I think that and \nwhy I am going to pursue in my follow-on amendment here the elimination \nof the provision in the Republican bill that would delete the \npossibility of an indigent defense counsel going to a judge on his own. \nThe reason for that is as follows:\n  Right now, if I am a prosecutor and I get a lead as to how I can make \nmy case better to prove the defendant did the deed, I can hire--I can \nuse--an investigator to go investigate that. If I believe there is a \nneed to make a case that the defendant is, in fact, perfectly sane and \nnot insane, I can hire a psychiatrist.\n  I can use investigative tools without ever having to go to the \ndefendant's counsel and say, ``By the way, here is what I am going to \ndo. I am going to hire this psychiatrist to prove that your defendant, \nyour client, is sane.'' Or, ``I am going to hire two investigators to \ngo down to Second and Vine and prove that the stoplight does not exist \nthere,'' or whatever.\n  So no one quarrels with that. If I am a lawyer who is hired by \nprivate funds to defend an accused person, I am not required to \ntelegraph to the prosecutor that I have hired a private detective to \ninvestigate a lead in a particular city. I do not have to tell the \nprosecutor that.\n  My worry is that if we change the law as proposed in the core \nlegislation, that what will be required for an indigent defense counsel \nis to walk into court, walk into the chambers of a judge and say, by \nthe way, judge, we better call in the prosecutor, and sit the \nprosecutor down and say, now I want to say, judge, I need your \nauthority to allow me to go hire an investigator. Here are the reasons \nthat I want to hire the investigator. The prosecutor is sitting there \ntaking notes about my case.\n  Now, that is why I think we should not delete this portion of the \nlaw.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the distinguished Senator from Delaware yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the concerns that the Senator has \nexpressed. I believe that the bill as drafted is preferable, \nnotwithstanding the arguments the distinguished Senator has raised. I \nwill come to the specific question in just a moment here.\n  I think that ex parte communications are very problemsome in any kind \nof a case, but they ought to be eliminated to the maximum extent \npossible, which is why I think that it just is not a good idea to have \none lawyer talking to the judge by himself.\n  But the language which I would focus on here is that which says no ex \nparte communication request may be considered pursuant to the section \nunless a proper showing is made concerning the need for \nconfidentiality.\n  I concur with the Senator from Delaware when he says that there ought \nnot to have to be disclosure by defense counsel in the presence of the \nprosecutor to matters which would prejudice the defendant in \ninvestigating the case on the facts, or as to getting expert opinion as \nto mental state and competency.\n  But the question I would have, and it is not really accommodated by \nthe language, is that if there is a showing of the need for \nconfidentiality, that would preclude the prosecutor gaining an upper \nhand in an unfair way. As a sponsor of this language, let me state that \nit is our intent here in this legislation that there not be a \ncircumstance in which the defense is compelled to reveal, in front of \nthe prosecutor, matters which would be prejudicial to his opportunity \nto present a defense.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, he is coming \nawfully close to what I intend. If it is read the way in which the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania reads it, which is that if \nthere is a showing for the need for confidentiality, then the judge can \nmeet only with the defense counsel and make his or her judgment. That, \nquite frankly, gets a lot closer to what I intend.\n  As the Senator feels, as a matter of principle, that we should err on \nthe side of not having ex parte proceedings, I must acknowledge in \nthese days, I err on the side of allowing indigent defense counsel to \nhave the maximum flexibility with the judge.\n  While the staff is correcting the other portions of this, I would \nlike to seek the counsel of my counsel, and determine whether or not it \nis still necessary to proceed with the last portion of this amendment.\n  I see the distinguished leader is on the floor. He always comes when \nhe worries things are slowing down. I can assure the Senator they are \nnot slowing down, they are moving along fast. We will get this done \nbefore the time would have been used had a rollcall vote been called. \nWe are very close. I think that can happen.\n  So I do not want the Senator to get upset. We have Senator Levin \nwaiting in the wings to go with his amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I had just sort of passed \nthrough the Chamber and I did not see anything happening, but there is \na lot of precedent for that.\n  As I understand, the next amendment would be the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, and there would be 50 minutes, 25 minutes on a \nside. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. While that debate is going on, it is my understanding that \nthe Biden amendment is now pending, is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the answer is yes.\n  The reason I have counseled my friend from Michigan not to go yet is \nthat the key staff people who know this issue very well, who will also \nwant to be available to Senator Hatch as well as to me, are the very \npeople negotiating this other item which is very close.\n  Apparently, we are now ready to go. We will be able to move right \naway to Senator Levin. We may be able to dispose of this right now. \nApparently, we have reached our agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. Does the Senator from Wisconsin have an amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Wisconsin wishes \nto speak on the issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Maybe we can let him do that while we nail this down.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I understand, after the disposition of the pending \namendment--if we work it out--fine; then the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Michigan; there would be two amendments remaining, one by the \nPresiding Officer and one by the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. And as I understand, one would have a 60 minute time \nagreement, the other 90 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would say we may not use all 90 minutes, but since it is \nthe last amendment, I would prefer to have that cushion.\n  Mr. DOLE. The point is, we would like to complete action. We said no \nvotes before 1 o'clock. I think it will be probably be before 2 \no'clock, would be my guess. there will probably not be any vote before \n2 o'clock, but we had hoped to complete action on this bill by 3 \no'clock so we could start on telecommunications. We are probably going \ninto the evening tonight on that bill.\n  I am told by the managers on that bill that it is a bipartisan \neffort, and may be able to complete that more quickly than we may have \nthought at the outset.\n  The bottom line is we need to finish this bill, and I know the \nmanagers are making progress. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill on the \nhabeas corpus issue. I rise today to speak against provisions in S. 735 \nthat are characterized as reforms in the habeas corpus appeals process. \nThese items that are being referred to as reforms, in my view, would \nhasten the implementation of the death penalty and might well have the \nresult of rushing innocent people to executions.\n  This is not, strictly speaking, a debate about the death penalty \nitself, but about the fundamental American right of due process.\n  Mr. President, there are several ways in which this fundamental right \nmay be undermined by the pending bill, including the requirement that \nFederal [[Page S7816]] judiciary defer to State courts. This is a major \ndeparture from more than 200 years of legal precedent, and to my mind, \nthe most egregious change proposed by habeas reform supporters.\n  There is also a general 1-year statute of limitations--6 months in \nsome cases--for filing a petition. These time limits fail to recognize \nthe time needed to develop a proper habeas petition.\n  There is also a concern which the ranking member has been discussing \nabout the elimination of the current absolute right of petitioners in \ncapital cases to counsel for Federal habeas corpus petitions and \nreplacing it with a provision that leaves assignment of counsel to the \ndiscretion of the court. I understand there has been some movement on \nthat, some progress. I am pleased to hear it and look forward to \nreviewing it.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the arguments for streamlining habeas \ncorpus procedures to limit death row appeals and implement the death \npenalty more quickly.\n  On a gut level, these arguments carry power; they paint a picture of \nconvicted criminals contemptuously manipulating our justice system to \navoid punishment for heinous crimes, all the while supposedly \nlanguishing comfortably in their prison cells. The arguments remind us \nof the lingering pain and frustration of victims' families, who are \nforced to wait, sometimes for years, before they reach the end of their \nordeals that began with the violent death of a loved one. The arguments \nalso speak to the problems of clogged courts and precious resources \ntied up in lengthy and, perhaps, duplicative habeas proceedings.\n  But the supporters of so-called habeas reform usually do not tell us \nother stories--the rest of the story.\n  They do not tell us about innocent defendants sent to death row \nbecause they could not afford competent counsel, and because some \nStates do not have procedures in place to provide effective counsel to \nindigents. They do not tell us of murder defendants watching as their \nattorneys fail to properly prepare and present a defense, either \nbecause they lack resources or because they themselves are indifferent, \nincompetent, or inexperienced.\n  They do not tell us about innocent defendants convicted because of \nsloppy investigations or prosecutorial misconduct.\n  They do not seem to take into account the amount of time it takes to \nproperly prepare and present a habeas petition.\n  They seem ready and willing to hasten to fatal judgment in the name \nof efficiency and to accept tragic mistakes as the necessary price for \ntimely justice.\n  I am not willing to support this haste.\n  While I completely understand the pain of victims' families, I do not \nwant to create more pain, and more victims of violence, by approving \nchanges in the law that could send innocent people to their deaths. \nThat in itself would be a dreadful crime.\n  We must be mindful that when we change the law, it applies to all, \nnot just to the clever manipulators of the system that supporters of \nthe habeas reform provisions of S. 735 seem to believe fill our death \nrows.\n  Consider the case of Nathaniel Carter, an innocent man wrongly \nconvicted in 1982 of the stabbing death of his mother-in-law.\n  Mr. Carter is a man about my age. His story was told in the New York \nTimes and in New York Newsday this past February. Ten witnesses placed \nMr. Carter miles from the murder scene at the time the crime was \ncommitted. Nonetheless, he was sentenced to 25-years-to-life for a\n crime he did not commit, only because New York State at that time did \nnot have a death penalty statute.\n\n  It does now, and if that statute had been in effect in 1982, the \nsentencing judge made it plain that it would have been imposed, on Mr. \nCarter, an innocent man.\n  Mr. Carter spent 28 months in prison before being exonerated. His \nformer wife eventually admitted committing the crime.\n  Nathaniel Carter was lucky, but had conditions been different, his \nluck would not have saved him. His boyhood friend, George Pataki, now \nGovernor of New York, earlier this year signed that State's new death \npenalty statute into law.\n  It is worth considering what would have happened if Mr. Carter had \nfaced the death penalty and if he would have faced the habeas reforms \nincluded in S. 735. He might well be dead for a crime he did not \ncommit.\n  So the question today is are we willing to put Mr. Carter and others \nlike him to death for the sake of hastening other deaths of some guilty \nparties?\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has handed down significant habeas decisions \nthis year in two separate cases, decisions that should be considered in \nthis debate.\n  On April 19, the Court, in Kyles versus Whitley, reversed and \nremanded the first-degree murder conviction of a Louisiana man, Curtis \nLee Kyles. Mr. Kyles was sentenced to death.\n  After his conviction, it was discovered the State had not revealed \ncertain evidence favorable to Mr. Kyles' case. His appeals to State \ncourts won him a remand for an evidentiary hearing, but the State trial \ncourt afterward denied relief. He then went to the State supreme court, \nwhich denied his application for discretionary review.\n  However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Kyles was entitled to \na new trial because there was a ``reasonable probability'' that the \ndisclosure of that evidence would have produced a different result than \nthe original conviction.\n  Had Mr. Kyles not been able to file his Federal habeas petition, as \nmight well be the case if we pass S. 735 with its habeas reform \nprovisions, which include a higher bar to habeas petitions and \ndeference to State courts, he might still be sitting in a Louisiana \nprison, awaiting death.\n  Earlier this year, in January, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its \nruling in Schlup versus Delo.\n  In that case, Lloyd Schlup, a prisoner in Missouri, was convicted of \nparticipating in the murder of a fellow inmate and sentenced to death.\n  However, Schlup, who was filing his second habeas petition, argued \nhis trial deprived the jury of critical evidence that would have \nestablished his innocence. The U.S. district court had denied relief, \nstating Mr. Schlup had not met the ``clear and convincing evidence'' \nstandard that the habeas reform provisions of S. 735 would impose.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court adopted a less stringent standard, that the \nhabeas petitioner need show that the constitutional violation \ncomplained of ``probably resulted in the conviction of one who is \nactually innocent.''\n  There is a body of evidence readily available to show that putting \nlimits on the habeas corpus process could well mean innocent people \nwill be affected in the ultimate way.\n  A 19-page staff report prepared last November for the House \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, formerly the Subcommittee on Civil \nand Constitutional Rights, found 52 cases in 20 years where innocent \npeople were convicted of capital crimes and later won release, some of \nthem by filing habeas petitions.\n  That document, entitled, ``Innocence and the Death Penalty: Assessing \nthe Danger of Mistaken Executions,'' might be worth reading before we \ndecide to reform this system in this way that reminds me very much of \nsomething that is quite the opposite of reform.\n  At one point, the report states:\n\n       These 52 cases illustrate the flaws inherent in the death \n     sentencing systems used in the states. Some of these men were \n     convicted on the basis of perjured testimony or because the \n     prosecutor improperly withheld exculpatory evidence. In other \n     cases, racial prejudice was a determining factor. In others, \n     defense counsel failed to conduct the necessary investigation \n     that would have disclosed exculpatory information.\n\n  I would also call to the attention of my colleagues a Yale Law School \nJournal piece entitled, ``Counsel for the Poor; the Death Sentence Not \nFor The Worst Crime But For The Worst Lawyer,'' published in May 1994, \nby Stephen Bright, the director of the Southern Center for Human \nRights, based in Atlanta, GA.\n  Mr. Bright's piece is a sobering, I might even say chilling \ndescription of problems encountered by defendants in capital cases.\n  Mr. Bright points out instances of States not providing sufficient \nresources to assigned defense counsel for proper investigation of a \ncase. Compared to the resources available to an aggressive prosecutor, \na defendant can [[Page S7817]] begin with a significant disadvantage in \na life-or-death fight.\n  Mr. Bright also describes cases of professional incompetence on the \npart of attorneys representing indigent clients in capital cases. Some \nof these defendants, after they were convicted and sentenced to death, \nwere able to secure competent counsel, prove their innocence, and win \njust release.\n  Capital cases are complex, and the stakes are the highest imaginable, \nso experienced counsel is needed to properly represent a defendant. \nStill, we are seeing evidence that these cases are not always tried by \nsuch experienced counsel. Imagine sitting in the defendant's chair, \nyour life on the line, knowing you are innocent, and watching your \nattorney fail to conduct proper investigation, fail to call witnesses, \nfail to present an adequate statement to the jury. Imagine that in this \ncountry.\n  When the day is done, that attorney walks home. You, the defendant, \nwalk to death row. If you cannot find experienced, responsible counsel \nfor an appeal, you walk to the gas chamber, the electric chair, or to a \nstark room with vials of poison to execute you.\n  We must not forget these stories as we debate reform.\n  Neither should we forget, in our frustration with the current system, \nthat a habeas petitioner is not free to walk the streets while awaiting \nthe ruling of the court. I think that is a misperception \nthat some have. This man or woman is in prison, not sitting in a \ncountry club.\n  Many of the stories we hear during this debate rely on their \npersuasive power on the grief and rage many of us feel after a brutal \nmurder. But let me speak a word of caution to those who stir those \nfeelings. Grief and rage are not good foundations for making good \npolicy, and emotions that strong can lead us to bad decisions and \nunintended consequences,\n and in this case, to conclude, although it may not be very frequent \nand apparently is frequent enough, it literally can lead to the \nexecution of innocent people.\n\n  I urge that the habeas provisions of this bill be removed. I do not \nthink they are appropriate to this piece of legislation. Certainly, the \nbill could go forward without them, and it would be a far better piece \nof legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came in at the very end to hear the \nremarks of my colleague from Wisconsin. I would like to thank him for \nhis eloquence. I am not a lawyer, but I do believe that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has made an essential point. I think his point about \nhabeas is as follows: Actually, regardless of your position about \ncapital punishment--I think all of us in very good faith can have \nprofoundly different views on this question--what you certainly do not \nwant to ever see happen is that someone innocent is executed, and to in \nany way, shape, or form move away from the very rights that people have \nin the appeal process, which is a frightening possibility. I think the \nSenator from Wisconsin has spoken to this in a very eloquent way.\n  I thank him for his remarks.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1252 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1252 to amendment numbered 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Delete lines 4 through 7 on page 125.\n       Strike lines 20 through 24 on page 106 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(h) Except as provided in title 21, United States Code, \n     section 848, in all proceedings brought under this section, \n     and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may \n     appoint counsel for an applicant who is or becomes \n     financially unable to afford counsel, except as\n       Strike lines 9 through 11 on page 108 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Except as provided in title 21, United States Code, \n     section 848, in all proceedings brought under this section, \n     and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may \n     appoint counsel who is or becomes financially unable\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this modification will correct the text. I \nwant to thank my colleague from Delaware for bringing our attention to \nit, as well as my colleague from Pennsylvania, who has worked with us \nto try to resolve this. We think we can resolve this matter so that we \ncan then vote on the Senator's amendment when the time comes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I urge adoption of the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1252) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah. As usual, he \nis always reasonable.\n  The effect of what the Senator has just done is to modify the \nunderlying bill that he introduced, the Hatch amendment, the Hatch \nbill, the Hatch-Dole bill.\n  It maintains in capital cases the requirement that counsel be \nappointed at trial and in a habeas proceeding, and it makes \ndiscretionary the appointment of counsel at those stages in noncapital \ncases.\n  That leaves one part of my original amendment that still needs to be \nresolved. We can speak to it in a very short order.\n  There was a third section of the existing bill that was attempted to \nbe amended by my amendment.\n  I send that modification of my amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator modifying amendment 1226?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, the Senator is modifying, actually, it is a whole new \namendment. I am attempting to modify the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear. I may have done something \ninadvertently here.\n  I do not mean to modify, I am sending the amendment to the desk, the \npurpose of which is to amend the Hatch amendment. We need a vote on it. \nI am not seeking unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the clerk will \nreport the new amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: As I understand it, this is a \nsubstitute that will replace the pending Biden amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can either withdraw the pending \nBiden amendment 1226 and send up a new amendment, or he can modify the \nBiden amendment No. 1226.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing I have learned after years, it \nis that it is very difficult to listen to staff and the Presiding \nOfficer at the same time. I apologize.\n  I should have been listening to the Presiding Officer.\n  Would he mind repeating his question to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator could either modify amendment 1226 \nor submit a new amendment, either one.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am submitting a new amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1226 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. President, I would like to withdraw amendment 1226. I hate \nnumbers and acronyms. But that is what I wish to withdraw.\n  I send a new amendment to the desk, the number of which I have not \nthe slightest idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 1226 is withdrawn\n  The amendment (No. 1226) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1253 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to requring counsel for \n                      federal habeas proceedings)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the new amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1253 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike lines 10-22 on page 125.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, that amendment has been \n[[Page S7818]] set over until some time at 1 o'clock, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No agreement has been reached on the \ndisposition of that amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before he does that, I would like to be \nable to speak for 5 minutes to my amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to \namendment No. 1226, which is now 1253, at a time to be determined by \nthe majority leader after consultation with the minority leader, but \nnot before 1 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I can speak very briefly now to my new \namendment, let me make sure that I have it straight for myself, let \nalone for all of my colleagues.\n  My original amendment was designed to do three things, to change \nthree provisions of the Hatch--I will call it the bill; it is \ntechnically an amendment--the thing we are debating, the \ncounterterrorism legislation that is before us. In that \ncounterterrorism legislation, there were a number of provisions, three \nof which were as follows: One deleted the existing statutory \nrequirement that there be counsel appointed for an indigent at a trial. \nThe second, deleted an existing statutory provision requiring counsel \nbe appointed at a habeas corpus proceeding for an indigent. And the \nthird amended existing law that says counsel for an indigent has the \nright to go before a Federal judge by himself without the prosecutor \npresent and make a request to the Federal judge for additional \nresources in order to adequately be able to protect his client's \nconstitutional interests, that is, go in to a Federal judge and say: \nJudge, I do not have the money to hire an investigator like the \nprosecutor has that I need to go to x town to interview three people.\n  The way the law exists now, that lawyer for the indigent can do just \nwhat a lawyer for a nonindigent can do and what the prosecutor can do. \nHe does not have to tip his hand to the prosecutor to say this is what \nI am about to do; this is what I am about to investigate; this is what \nI want to check out.\n  It would be a little bit like in that God-awful O.J. Simpson trial in \nthat if every time the defense hired someone to investigate something, \nthey first had to go to the prosecutor and say: By the way, I am going \nto hire this investigator to go look at the background of one of the \npolice officers, and I am going to do it on Tuesday, and I am going to \ninterview the following three people.\n  No one would expect defense counsel to have to do that with the \nprosecution present, would not have to tell the prosecutor that.\n  Conversely, the prosecutor, when they are in the middle of a trial \nand they say: My goodness--or before a trial--we better check out a \nlead that we have; we have a lead that on September 12 the defendant \nwas with Mary Jones in Oshkosh; we are going to send an investigator to \ngo to see Mary Jones and find out whether that is true--if the \nprosecutor had to say: By the way, defense counsel, on October 3 we are \ngoing to send an investigator to meet Mary Jones in Oshkosh, that would \nprejudice the State's case because the defendant could pick up the \nphone and call Mary Jones and tell Mary Jones to leave town. It is not \nreasonable.\n  What we did in the law not long ago, we said an indigent should have \nthe same rights. But an indigent does not have any money. The only \nreason a poor guy's lawyer, the one that is appointed by the court, \ngoes to the judge is because he does not have the money. Otherwise, he \nwould not have to go to the judge. All he would have to do is say: OK, \nI am hiring a guy to go check this out. But now he is able to go to the \njudge. The reason he goes to the judge is that the judge is the guy who \ndispenses the money. The judge is the guy to say: OK, I will give you \nthe money to hire that guy. You proved to me you need it. I will give \nyou the money.\n  Now, what my friends do here--and I understand their motivation; I \nthink it is pure--is they say, wait a minute now. That is costing \nmoney, and should not the prosecutor, the State, have to be in that \nroom when the defense attorney is in that room saying: Judge, I have no \nmoney, but I wish to hire an investigator to check this out.\n  They say that the State prosecutor should be able to be in that room \nwhile that is being done. Well, they would not say that if it were a \ncivil case. You would not in a civil case say, by the way, you ought to \ntell the other side that you are about to hire two people to go \ninvestigate a witness who says they saw your client walking around \nperfectly healthy when they claim to have a bad back. They say, well, \nyou would not have to telegraph that.\n  Just because somebody is poor, why should they have to give away \ntheir case in front of the prosecutor?\n  And, by the way, to put it another way, how is the State hurt by \nthis? The State is not hurt in any way by this. There is a Federal \njudge sitting there deciding whether or not there is a legitimate case \nmade to need this investigator or to need this additional resource.\n  And so what my amendment does is it strikes another provision in the \nunderlying counterterrorism bill, the Hatch bill. It strikes the part \nthat says that before a poor man's appointed counsel can ask a judge a \nquestion, he has to have the prosecutor in the room with him while he \nasks.\n  Now, my good friend from Pennsylvania, who is, along with the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, one of the best trial lawyers in \nthis place, and their previous records demonstrate that, says \nbasically: Joe, do not worry about that because our legislation says--\nand I will read it--``No ex parte proceeding, communication or request \nmay be considered pursuant to this section unless a proper showing is \nmade concerning the need for confidentiality.''\n  I understand what they intend by that. What they intend by that is to \nsolve the problem I have just raised, but under the law the use of the \nphrase ``proper showing'' means that in front of the prosecutor you are \ngoing to have to say: This is why I need this money, judge, to hire \nthis investigator.\n  The effect of that is in making your proper showing you have to make \nit in front of the prosecutor. You have now given away the very thing \nyou wanted to avoid when you asked for the closed hearing. This closed \nmeeting with the judge has nothing to do with the facts of the case, \nnothing to do with the outcome of the case, nothing to do with the \nevidence that can or cannot be submitted in the case, nothing to do \nwith the substance of the case.\n  It has to do with the resources made available to a court-appointed \nlawyer. He may go in and say: Judge, you have not given me enough money \nto be able to send out the following 20 questions to prospective \nwitnesses. I want that money. Can you give me that money to send out \nthose letters? Or to provide transportation to get a witness.\n  Remember Rosa, that woman in the O.J. trial who was going to Mexico? \nWell, it may be a situation where he said: Look, I have an indigent \nwitness who cannot get here. I do not have the money to get him here. \nCan you give us the money to get him here? The judge may say: No, I \nwill not give you the money. I do not think it is essential for your \ncase. But if the judge thinks it is essential, he can say: OK, you are \nauthorized to buy a ticket to send that person here.\n  But what you do not want to do is to necessarily have to tell that to \nthe prosecution at this point because it may be a witness you turn out \nnot using.\n  Anyway, that is the crux of this thing, and although the intention to \ncorrect my concern in the underlying remaining amendment is the law \nsays that ``upon a proper showing of the need for confidentiality'' you \ncan have this secret hearing, or this closed hearing, it does not get \nit done because ``proper showing,'' we believe, is essentially a term \nof art in the law. You have to make your case before the other person.\n  Now, the last point I will make--and this is, I think, an appropriate \npoint to make--is that the mere fact they put this in here evidences \nthe fact they know I am right. The mere fact they acknowledge that \nthere are circumstances under which confidentiality is appropriate \nmakes my case.\n  Think about that now. If they thought everything I am saying here \nmakes no sense, that it is not a legitimate point to raise, why would \nthey [[Page S7819]] provide for any circumstance under which there \ncould be a closed hearing in which only the judge and only the defense \ncounsel were present? They acknowledge by implication. They try to \ncorrect it by saying ``proper showing.'' I spent, with my staff, 20 \nminutes trying to come up with some other phrase that would get it \ndone.\n  But the truth of the matter is, it is real simple. It is human \nnature. If you have the prosecutor and the defense lawyer there and the \njudge, where the Presiding Officer is, and I have to make my case to \nyou because you are not going to automatically grant what I request, \nyou want to know why I want it. So you have to ask me, ``Joe, why do \nyou want it?'' And in order for me to convince you to give me the \nresources, I have to say to you in front of the other guy, ``Well, I \nwant it, Judge, because I think this witness is going to show that the \nwitnesses for the prosecution are lying.'' Bingo, out of the bag.\n  Now, if I could say to you, ``Judge, I can't say in front of the \nprosecutor here. Could you ask the prosecutor to step out of the room \nand I will tell you?'' If you could say that, then that will get it \ndone. I do not mind the prosecutor being in there as long as when it \ncomes to me to make my case as to why I need the resources that the \nprosecutor is not there.\n  So I toyed with the idea of changing the law to say, ``No ex parte \nproceedings, communication, or request may be considered pursuant to \nthis section unless a request is made concerning the need for \nconfidentiality.'' A request is made--a request--not a showing, because \nwhen you move from request to showing, you are required to lay your \ncards on the table. ``The very cards I have to show you, Your Honor, in \norder to get you to allow me the money,'' I have to do it in front of \nthose folks.\n  We do not ask that for a defendant who can afford a lawyer. We do not \nask that for a prosecutor. We only ask that for somebody who is poor, \nand that is a double standard. That is a double standard. To put it \nanother way, Mr. President, if we wanted to make it even for everybody, \nwe should require the privately paid defense lawyer to have to tell the \nprosecutor every single investigator he or she hires and why they hired \nthem, and we should have to tell the prosecutor they have to tell the \ndefense lawyer every single thing their investigator is doing before \nthey do it. That would be fair. Now everybody is on the same playing \nfield. Now poor folks are treated just like wealthy folks. Prosecutors \nare treated just like defendants. That would be fair.\n  But what do we have here? We have a situation where I am poor, he is \nwealthy, and she is a prosecutor. She does not have to tell me anything \nabout what she is investigating as a prosecutor. He does not have to \ntell her anything about what he is investigating as a defendant, he can \nafford it. But I have to tell everybody. It is not fair; not fair. That \nis what I am trying to correct.\n  The underlying statute is 848. My amendment strikes all of their \nreference to that statute. I would be willing to do it by just \nsubstituting the word ``request'' for ``a proper showing'' in their \nlanguage, but I do not think they are willing to accept that. So I am \nwilling, when it is the appropriate time for my colleague to respond, \nif he wishes to, or move to table this--the bottom line, Mr. President, \nis I just think this is about fairness.\n  Why should an indigent defendant have to tell the prosecutor all that \nhe is investigating? You say, ``They don't have to under the law.'' \nThey do practically, Mr. President, because they do not have the \nresources to hire these folks to do the investigation. Therefore, they \nhave to ask for that. In order to get the judge to give them those \nresources, they have to tell him why they want those resources; \nthereby, the effect is they have to tell them. They should not have to \ndo that. Wealthy defendants do not have to do it. Prosecutors do not \nhave to do it. Poor people should not have to do it.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate what my colleague is saying, \nand I know he, with his experience, feels very deeply about it. The \nreal problem is and the reason we have to oppose this amendment is \nbecause at this point in the proceedings, we have had a trial, three \nappeals, we have had other proceedings, but at this point in the \nproceedings, to which Senator Biden is referring, all claims should \nhave been out in the open. At that point, they should be out in the \nopen. They should not be investigating new claims at this point.\n  Frankly, ex parte proceedings are simply unnecessary at this point in \nthe proceedings. This is just simply another way of dragging out the \nprocess and the proceeding, permitting the defense counsel to argue his \ncase outside the presence of the prosecutor. That is why we have to \noppose this amendment.\n  I suppose we could argue that we should never finish these \nproceedings; that there is no finality; that people who do not like the \ndeath penalty want these things to go on forever hoping that nobody \never has to live up to the judgment of the court or the jury, but that \nis what we are trying to solve here.\n  The bill before the Senate protects constitutional rights. It \nprotects civil liberties. We give them every chance under our bill to \nbe able to pursue their claims. There is no reason why they should be \nable to walk into a court room and get an ex parte hearing without \nhaving counsel for the State present and having hired people to \ninvestigate new evidence over the last 6 months and then get a nunc pro \ntunc ruling of the court--in other words, that they should pay for \nthat, the State is going to have to pay for that, from the time they \nhired them right up to the present time--in an ex parte proceeding. We \nboth argued this pretty much to death.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to make one brief response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me explain why, although it sounds \nreasonable what my friend said. We have gone through the factfinding \nstage, the trial, this is just on habeas appeals, and why do you want \nto dig stuff up?\n  Many of the habeas appeals are premised on the following proposition: \nThe defendant says, ``Hey, look, I got convicted, I got convicted \nunfairly because there was perjured testimony in my trial,'' like a \ncouple trials that were mentioned here today, actually happened. I am \nnot making these up, they happened.\n  It turns out, for example, the prosecutor had a witness that would \nhave said, ``I was with Charlie Smith and he couldn't have committed \nthe crime,'' and the prosecutor never let anybody know that. \nConversely, someone gets on the stand in the trial and lies and it is \nlater found out that they lied.\n  The reason why the defense attorney needs to be able to investigate \nis to be able to root that out. You have a defendant saying, ``Look, I \nam about to be put to death, but I'm telling you, Charlie Smith lied. \nIf you just go find Harriet Wilson, I found out she knows he lied.''\n  This is what happened. I am asking my staff to check the Carter case. \nI am not sure of the facts in the Carter case. If I am not mistaken, \nthere was additional evidence found out after the trial--after the \ntrial. That is why the defendant needs the same tools available to him \nor her that a wealthy defendant would need or the prosecutor needs. \nThat is all I am saying. Do not be misled by the notion that the trial \nis over, therefore, there is no other factfinding to go on, you do not \nneed an investigator.\n  For example, in the Hurricane Carter case--I wanted to make sure I \nwas right on my facts here--after the trial was over, Hurricane \nCarter's lawyers found out that there was a polygraph test given to one \nof the witnesses, and the outcome of that polygraph test sustained \nHurricane Carter's assertion that he was innocent. It was never made \navailable. They never told anybody such a test was done. Therefore, it \ntook investigative work after the trial to go back and dig this out. \nThey dug it out.\n  Old Hurricane Carter ``ain't'' dead now, and the reason he is not \ndead now is because they dug that, among other facts, out. That is the \ninvestigative work we are talking about. Keep in mind now, this does \nnot in any way extend the number of appeals someone [[Page S7820]] can \nmake.\n This does not in any way extend the time in which appeals have to be \nfiled. This is just simple fairness. Treat poor people like you treat \nwealthy people during and after the trial.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. One more sentence. This is after direct appeals, after \ncollateral appeals have been done, after the State has decided the \nissue on perjury, or to use his hypothetical, where they would have had \nthe opportunity. All we ask is that the State not be hammered. We have \nhad judges that do these things. States have had inordinate expenses, \nand there is little or no justification for it.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Biden amendment and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \ntable the Biden amendment No. 1253 be at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the minority leader, but not \nbefore 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that the Biden amendment No. 1253 be laid aside and \nthat the Senator from Michigan be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion or yielding \nback of time on the Levin amendment it be set aside and the vote occur \non or in relation to the Levin amendment No. 1245 following the vote on \nthe motion to table the Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma has asked for some separate time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that he be given that opportunity to speak at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that the time not be charged to Senator Levin or our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment Senator Hatch \nfor his leadership on this bill, and I also compliment Senator Dole for \nhis leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and his willingness \nto bring it to the Senate this early.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, before the Senator gets into \nhis remarks, I want to also ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the Senator from Oklahoma the Senator from Michigan be \ngranted 10 minutes, without having the time count against any \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah for his leadership on this bill and for his willingness to \nbring it to the floor so quickly. I also thank Senator Dole, because I \nremember after the tragedy of April 19 in my State, talking to Senator \nDole either that day or the next day, he stated to me his willingness \nto bring legislation forward to the Senate as quickly as possible. He \nhas met that obligation. We do not usually move very fast in the \nSenate. I appreciate his willingness to schedule this as early as \npossible. I also appreciate the fact that finally we are going to bring \nthis issue to a conclusion.\n  It was my hope that we were going to finish it last night. I wanted \nto be in Oklahoma today because of some base closing hearings both in \nEnid and in Oklahoma City, Vance and Tinker Air Force bases. That is \nvery important. But I feel like this issue is most important for my \nState and for many people across our country. It is vitally important \nthat we enact habeas corpus reform.\n  On Monday of this week I was honored to meet with about a dozen \nOklahomans who had lost family members in the Oklahoma City bombing. \nThese brave individuals came to their Nation's Capital to honor their \nloved ones by asking the U.S. Senate to do one meaningful thing--enact \ntough habeas corpus reform on the antiterrorism bill.\n  There are several important parts of the bill that is before us, but \nthe one key element that will help the victims of the Oklahoma City \nbomber and other victims of violent crime in habeas corpus reform.\n  I will read a couple of the comments that some of the victim's \nfamilies made:\n\n       In Oklahoma City they had a press conference and came to \n     the State capitol to urge Congress and the President to \n     implement habeas corpus legislation that would significantly \n     reduce the appeals process and expedite the imposition of \n     death sentences. In strained, choked voices, they talked of \n     the tragedy that tore at the city, leaving shattered families \n     still only beginning to absorb the depths of their losses. \n     Connie Williams wore a button with her dead son Scott's \n     picture, bearing the words ``Beloved Scott, Our Special \n     Angel.'' His pregnant wife, Nicole, said, ``I do not want his \n     daughter to be in high school wondering why his killers are \n     still on death row.''\n\n  She is right.\n  Some of the families came up to our Nation's Capitol on Monday. One \nwas Diane Leonard. Her statement was, ``Our pain and anger are great.'' \nHer husband is gone, a Secret Service agent killed in the bombing in \nOklahoma City. I might mention he was an agent of the Secret Service \nfor 25 years. She added, ``But it would be much, much greater if the \nperpetrators of this crime are allowed to sit on death row for many \nyears.'' She is talking about the pain and anger are great, but it \nwould be much greater if the perpetrators were allowed to sit on death \nrow for many years. She is a former Tulsa resident. Diane Leonard, her \nvoice cracking with emotion, described in graphic detail the injuries \nher husband suffered. She urged Senators to have the courage to amend \nthe law to allow death sentences to be carried out in 2 or 3 years.\n  I respect the fact that some of our colleagues feel differently on \nthe death penalty. We have heard some of them speak eloquently today. \nThey are opposed to habeas corpus reform in large part, in many cases, \nbecause they do not want the death penalty to ever be carried out. I \nrespect their position, but I do not think they are correct. I think \nthey are wrong.\n  Mr. President, I fear that our criminal justice system is in critical \ncondition. The past couple of years have shown a dip in America's crime \nrate, but over the course of years our crime rate has gone up and up \nand up.\n  Today, an American is about 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be a victim \nof a property crime than he or she was in 1960.\n  Today, an American is about four times more likely to be a victim of \na violent crime than he or she was in 1960.\n  And in the face of these sobering numbers and the numbing real-life \nstories that appear on our television sets every night, our criminal \njustice system appears less and less able to dispense justice.\n  This bill, if it contains tough, new habeas corpus reforms, can be an \nessential step along the path to reform.\n  No adult in Oklahoma can consider the probable prospects for the \nOklahoma City bomber without reflecting on the man who until a few \nweeks ago was Oklahoma's most notorious killer. That man is Roger Dale \nStafford who, in 1978, murdered nine persons in two separate incidents. \nRoger Dale Stafford was given nine death sentences for those murders, \nbut he is living still.\n  Roger Dale Stafford does have an execution date; it is July 1, 1995. \nBut Roger Dale Stafford has had execution dates before, and they all \nhave come and gone. Whether this date will be the last I do not know \nfor his attorney has announced that he will seek another stay of \nexecution. Incidentally, this is the same attorney who has been \nappointed to represent Timothy James McVeigh, the man being held in \nconnection with the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Roger Dale Stafford's crimes are well known in Oklahoma, but the fact \nthat they are well known does not reduce their ability to shock and \nsadden anyone who hears of his wickedness.\n  On June 21, 1978, after searching unsuccessfully for a business to \nrob, Roger Dale Stafford, his wife, Verna, and his brother, Harold, \ndecided to stop their car, raise the hood, and feign distress, in hopes \nthat a wealthy and vulnerable Good Samaritan would come \n[[Page S7821]] along. They pulled their car to the side of the road, \nand Verna Stafford attempted to flag down passing cars. Roger and \nHarold Stafford lay in wait in the darkness.\n  Eventually, a blue Ford pickup truck with a white camper shell pulled \noff the road, and the driver, Air Force Sgt. Melvin Lorenz approached \nVerna Stafford with an offer to help. Sergeant Lorenz looked under the \nhood of the Stafford automobile and said that he could find nothing \nwrong. At that point, the Stafford brothers confronted Sergeant Lorenz \nand demanded his wallet. Roger Stafford was armed with a pistol. \nSergeant Lorenz informed the Staffords that he and his family were on \ntheir way to his mother's funeral in North Dakota, and that he could \ngive the appellant some money, but not all that he had. Roger Dale \nStafford then shot Sergeant Lorenz twice, killing him.\n  Hearing the shots, Linda Lorenz, Sergeant Lorenz's wife, got out of \nthe pickup truck and ran toward her husband. Verna Stafford knocked \nMrs. Lorenz to the ground, and Roger Stafford shot her as she fell, \nkilling her.\n  The murderers then heard a child calling from the back of the camper. \nRoger Stafford approached the camper, cut a hole in the screen, and \nfired his pistol into the darkness, forever silencing 11-year-old \nRichard Lorenz.\n  For the Lorenz murders, Roger Dale Stafford was convicted on three \ncounts of first degree murder and sentenced to death for each murder.\n  That was first of Roger Dale Stafford's murderous episodes in \nOklahoma. A month later, he struck again:\n  On July 16, 1978, Roger, Verna, and Harold Stafford robbed the \nSirloin Stockade Restaurant in Oklahoma City. The trio waited in the \nrestaurant's parking lot until all the customers had left, then knocked \non the side door of the restaurant. When the manager answered, he was \ngreeted by Roger and Harold Stafford pointing guns at him. They forced \nhim to take them to the cash register and the office safe.\n  Harold and Verna Stafford held five employees at gun-point while \nRoger Stafford had the manager empty the office safe which contained \nalmost $1300. All six employees were then ordered inside the \nrestaurant's walk-in freezer. Once inside, Roger Stafford shot one of \nthe hostages, then both men opened fire on the remaining employees. \nRoger Stafford told Verna that it was time for her to take part. He \nplaced his gun in her hand and helped her pull the trigger.\n  All six Sirloin Stockade employees died as a result of the shootings. \nThey were: Terri Michelle Horst, age 15; David Gregory Salsman, age 15; \nDavid Lindsay, age 17; Anthony Tew, age 17; Louis Zacarias, age 46; and \nIsaac Freeman, age 56.\n  For the Sirloin Stockade murders, Roger Dale Stafford was convicted \non six counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death for each \nmurder.\n  As I said, Mr. President, Roger Dale Stafford lives still, and each \nday his penalty becomes farther and farther removed from the crimes for \nwhich it is so eminently justified. Justice still waits for Roger Dale \nStafford.\n  And, why the delay? Because since his convictions, Roger Dale \nStafford has made at least 18 reported appearances in Federal and State \ncourts. He has been before the U.S. Supreme Court six times--1985, \n1985, 1985, 1984, 1984, 1984--before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n10th Circuit once, 1994, before the Oklahoma Supreme Court once, 1986, \nand before the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals nine times, 1993, \n1992, 1991, 1990, 1987, 1985, 1985, 1983, 1983. This list does not \ninclude appearances which were not officially reported. It omits one \npretrial appearance at an appellate court, 1979. And, it omits all \nactivity at the trial courts.\n  Mr. President, 17 years ago he murders teenagers, he murders an \ninnocent family that is trying to help him out, and he is still on \ndeath row. That is not justice delayed, that is justice denied.\n  What about the families that lost teenagers in that incident? What \nabout the families that lost loved ones--178--in the Oklahoma City \nbombing incident; 178, with over 400 injured? Are we going to be \ntelling them 15, 17, 20 years from now, ``Well, the appeals process is \njust very cumbersome,'' and have taxpayers paying not only the expense \nfor taking care of the perpetrators of the crime, should they be \nconvicted and receive the death sentences, as they surely should and \nhopefully will. What are we going to tell those families?\n  I met with some of the victims that lost two children. I met with \nthem Friday. A young lady in her early twenties lost both her kids. I \nmet with a daughter that lost her father just last Monday. I met with \nthree spouses that lost their spouse. One of the individuals that was \nhere was an uncle who lost his nephew, whose wife is expecting. What \nabout that child who will never see her father alive? Are we going to \ntell that child, ``Well, we are sorry, but the person that was \nresponsible for murdering your dad is still in Federal court, he is \nstill in prison living pretty well, watching TV; Uncle Sam, or the \nGovernment, is taking care of him, giving him three meals, making sure \nall his rights are protected,'' and allow him to abuse the process for \n15 years or so? I do not think so. That is not justice to the families. \nThat is not justice, period.\n  So we need habeas corpus reform. We have needed it for a long time. I \nam glad the President has reversed himself and now agreed that we need \nthis on this bill. This will allow the families to at least have some \nknowledge that there will be justice, and hopefully we will move very \nquickly.\n  Mr. President, I want to make some general comments on habeas corpus \nreform because we have needed this for a long time. First, our habeas \nsystem does not promote justice. The availability of habeas corpus to \nState prisoners, beyond the various remedies and layers of review \navailable in State courts, has little or no value in avoiding \ninjustices or ensuring that the Federal rights of criminal defendants \nare respected. The typical applicant has already secured extensive \nreview of his case in State courts, having pursued a State appeal and \noften having initiated collateral attacks in State courts. The claims \nraised by such defendants are normally without substance and are likely \nto be technical, that is, to allege procedural irregularities which \ncast no real doubt on the defendant's guilt.\n  Let me just mention the cases in Oklahoma City. I talked to a Federal \njudge, the first judge I was responsible for getting appointed in \nOklahoma. 1982 was his first year on the court. They had 193 prisoner \nappeals made to the Federal courts--193. That happened to be about 10 \npercent of their caseload. In 1992, 10 years later, they had 630. The \nnumber more than tripled, an increase to 25 percent of their caseload.\n  Prisoners are finding it pretty easy to make appeals, and they are \nappealing to the Federal system. There is no limit to the number of \nappeals. They can appeal for anything. They can appeal on habeas that \nthey were incorrectly convicted, or they can appeal and say that \nsomebody next door is smoking or somebody next door has a radio too \nloud. And they take it all the way to the Federal court. That is \nhappening hundreds of times.\n  In Oklahoma City and the western district in 1992, there were 630 \nprisoner petitions. Some of the prisoners are specializing in this. \nThere is nothing else to do. So they have legal access, they have \naccess to the library, and they can abuse this process for all it is \nworth. And so what if it ties up the court? So what if it keeps them \nkind of busy? So what if they are as guilty as they possibly can be? So \nwhat if they have been convicted and gone through every appeal in the \nprocess and been to the Supreme Court?\n  Roger Dale Stafford has had his case to the Supreme Court six times, \nand every time the Supreme Court said, ``Guilty.'' Yet he files another \npetition. I expect he has another one in the typewriter right now. It \njust so happens his attorney is a very competent, very professional, \nvery good attorney, Steven Jones. He also happens to be the same \nattorney that will be defending Mr. McVeigh. I do not want the victims \nof the Oklahoma City bombing to have to wait 17 or 20 years for \njustice. That is why we need habeas corpus reform.\n  Second, the habeas system demeans federalism. The present system of \nreview is demeaning to the State courts and pointlessly disparaging to \nthe efforts to comply with Federal law in criminal proceedings. A \nsingle Federal judge is frequently placed in the position of reviewing \na judgment of conviction that was entered by a State trial \n[[Page S7822]] judge, reviewed and found objectionable by a State \nappellate court, and upheld by a State supreme court. An independent \ndetermination of the contentions raised by the applicant is required of \nthe Federal judge although he may have no doubt that the State courts \nwere conscientious and fair. State judiciaries are presumed to be \nincapable of applying Federal law, or unwilling to do so.\n  I know Senator Kyl will have an amendment later that would address \nthat, and I compliment him for his amendment and plan to support him in \nhis efforts.\n  Third, habeas corpus defeats the demand for finality. The current \nsystem of Federal habeas corpus defeats the important objective of \nhaving an end to litigation. The costs of such a system were eloquently \ndescribed by the late Justice John Harlan in Mackey v. United States, \n401 U.S. 667, 690-91 (1971):\n\n       Both the individual criminal defendant and society have an \n     interest in insuring that there will at some point be the \n     certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that \n     attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a \n     conviction was free from error but rather on whether the \n     prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community. \n     * * * If law, criminal or otherwise, is worth having and \n     enforcing, it must at some time provide a definitive answer \n     to the questions litigants present or else it never provides \n     an answer at all. * * * No one, not criminal defendants, not \n     the judicial system, not society as a whole is benefitted by \n     a judgment providing a man shall tentatively go to jail \n     today, but tomorrow and every day thereafter his continued \n     incarceration shall be subject to fresh litigation on issues \n     already resolved.\n\n  Fourth, habeas procedures are wasteful. The current system is \nwasteful of limited resources. At a time when both State and Federal \ncourts face staggering criminal caseloads, we can ill afford to make \nlarge commitments of judicial and prosecutorial resources to procedures \nof dubious value in furthering the ends of justice. Such commitments \ncome at the expense of the time available for the stages of the \ncriminal process at which the questions of guilt and innocence and \nbasic fairness are most directly addressed. Former Chief Justice Warren \nBurger made the following points:\n\n       I know of no society or system of justice that takes such \n     scrupulous care as we do to give every accused person the \n     combination of procedural safeguards, free legal counsel, \n     free appeals, free records, new trials and post conviction \n     reviews of his case. I have seen cases--and this occurs in \n     many courts today--where three, four, and five trials are \n     accorded to the accused with an appeal following each trial \n     and reversal of the conviction on purely procedural grounds. \n     * * * In some of these multiple trial and appeal cases the \n     accused continued his warfare with society for eight, nine, \n     ten years and more. In one case more than 60 jurors and \n     alternates were involved in five trials, a dozen trial judges \n     heard an array of motions and presided over these trials; \n     more than 30 different lawyers participated either as court-\n     appointed counsel or prosecutors and in all more than 50 \n     appellate judges reviewed the case on appeals. I tried to \n     calculate the costs of all this for that one criminal act and \n     the ultimate conviction. The best estimates could not be very \n     accurate, but they added to a quarter of a million dollars. \n     The tragic aspect was the waste and futility since every \n     lawyer, every judge and every juror was fully convinced of \n     the defendant's guilt from the beginning to the end.'' 25 \n     Record of the N.Y.C. Bar Assoc. 14, 15-16 (Supp. 1970).\n\n  Fifth, the way our habeas system is used nullifies capital sentences. \nThe constitutionality of the death penalty has been settled since 1976. \nThirty-eight States now authorize capital punishment, but the \ninefficiency of current court procedures has resulted in a de facto \nnullification of capital punishment laws. The public interest \norganizations that routinely involve themselves in capital cases have \nfully exploited the system's potential for obstruction. Delay is \nmaximized by deferring collateral attack until the eve of execution. \nOnce a stay of execution has been obtained, the possibility of carrying \nout the sentence is foreclosed for additional years as the case works \nits way through the multiple layers of State and Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, this country desperately needs reform in its criminal \njustice system. Habeas corpus reform is an important part of that \nnecessary reform, and this bill is an excellent place to start \nreforming habeas corpus.\n  I agree with the families of the Oklahoma City dead: Habeas corpus \nreform is an inadequate, but necessary, memorial to the memories of \nthose who died in that dreadful, murderous blast.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Hatch for his leadership, and Senator \nDole for bringing this to the floor of the Senate and Senator Dole for \npushing the Senate for the last several days, including last night.\n  I am glad that finally we are going to have this bill come to a \nconclusion and have cloture, and allow us to have habeas corpus reform \nwhich, again, in my opinion, is the most significant element of true \ncrime control that we can enact.\n  I am hopeful we can send a positive signal to the families of the \nvictims in the Oklahoma City bombing and tell them that, yes, we are \ngoing to have an end to these endless appeals, and that justice will be \ndone and it will be done, as President Clinton said, in a timely manner \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nlegislation as well. I also pay tribute to my colleague from Oklahoma, \nwhom I think today presented an extraordinarily strong and compelling \nargument in favor of the reforms of habeas corpus that we are looking \nat today, and against a series of amendments.\n  Later in my remarks I will address some of those reforms and that \nissue, although I am unable to think of how I can address them more \nvividly and effectively than the Senator from Oklahoma has already \ndone.\n  Today I rise to also just indicate my overall support for this \nlegislation. Clearly, the people in our country and in our State of \nMichigan in particular stand back and look at the events which took \nplace in Oklahoma City with great concern. They have asked us to act. I \nbelieve this bill properly incorporates the best ideas as to the sorts \nof actions we should be taking at this time to address the problem of \nterrorism, wherever it may originate.\n  At this point I would like, in my remarks, to highlight a series of \nprovisions in the bill I have worked on with our outstanding floor \nleader and my good friend, the Senator from Utah, with the majority \nleader, and others. These provisions would facilitate the deportation \nof aliens who have committed serious crimes while in the United States.\n  The provisions at issue, contained in title III, section 303(e) of \nthe bill, require that aliens who are convicted of serious crimes in \ncourts of law in this country be deported upon completion of their \nsentences without any further judicial review of the order of \ndeportation. These expedited deportation procedures will apply to the \nalmost half a million aliens currently residing in this country who are \ndeportable because they have been convicted of committing serious \nfelonies.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, aliens who are convicted \nof felonies after entry are already deportable. They are rarely \nactually deported, however, because criminal aliens are able to request \nequitable waivers from the courts and other types of judicial review \nthat were never meant to apply to convicted felons. Such abuse of \nprocess operates to prevent the order of deportation from becoming \nfinal.\n  Notably, both the administration's antiterrorism bill and S. 735 \ncontain expedited deportation procedures for a small class of aliens \nreasonably suspected of planning future terrorist activity. The \nadministration's bill, however, makes no provision for rapid \ndeportation of aliens who have actually committed crimes. This, despite \nthe fact that the Attorney General has said that the removal of \ncriminal aliens from the United States is one of the administration's \nhighest priorities and that our prisons and jails are crowded with \ncriminal aliens. The substitute to S. 735 remedies that omission.\n  According to the FBI, foreign terrorists have been responsible for \nexactly two terrorist incidents in the United States in the last 11 \nyears: the World Trade Center bombing and a trespassing incident at the \nIranian mission to the United Nations. While the World Trade Center \nbombing was obviously a very serious matter, it should not be the \nexclusive focus of our efforts to take strong action to protect \nAmerican citizens from criminal conduct by non-citizens.\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n  More than 53,000 crimes have been committed by aliens in this country \nrecently enough to put the perpetrators in our State and Federal \nprisons right now. An estimated 20 to 25 percent of all Federal prison \ninmates are noncitizens; in California, almost one-half of the prison \npopulations are noncitizens. According to a 1995 Senate Report on \nCriminal Aliens in the United States, a conservative estimate of the \ntotal number of deportable criminal aliens presently residing in the \ncounty is 450,000. All of these aliens have committed at least one \nserious crime in this country. For that reason all are deportable under \nthe law. They have not been deported because they have been able to \nprevent the order of deportation from ever becoming final by seeking \nrepeated judicial review.\n  The grounds on which criminal aliens are legitimately entitled to \nwaivers of deportation are extremely narrow. To avoid deportation, \ncriminal aliens essentially must prove a case of mistaken identity--\nthat the alien is not who the Government thinks he is; that he is not \nan alien, at all; or that he has been pardoned or had his conviction \noverturned. Mistakes of this order do not happen often. Mistakes of \nthis order certainly have not happened 450,000 times--for each of the \ndeportable criminal aliens currently in the country. Rather, the \nalien's capacity to demand successive judicial review, even wholly \nmerit less judicial review, grinds the deportation process to a halt.\n  Meanwhile, the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not have \nadequate facilities to house this many criminal aliens. As a result, \nthe great majority of these convicted felons are released back to our \nstreets after serving their sentences, with instructions to report \nseveral months later for a hearing before the INS.\n  Needless to say, the majority of criminal aliens released from \ncustody do not return for their hearings. Having been returned to the \nstreets to continue their criminal predation on the American citizenry, \nmany are rearrested soon after their release. Thus, for example, a \nrecent study by the GAO found that 77 percent of noncitizens convicted \nof felonies are rearrested at least one more time. In Los Angeles \nCounty alone, more than half of incarcerated illegal aliens are \nrearrested within 1 year of their release.\n  The provisions at issue will put an end to this abuse of process by \ndoing the following:\n  First, they will prohibit the Attorney General from releasing \ncriminal aliens from custody prior to deportation.\n  They will also eliminate judicial review for orders of deportation \nentered against criminal aliens--although criminal aliens will still be \nentitled to challenge their orders of deportation before the Board of \nImmigration Appeals.\n  In addition, these provisions will require deportation of criminal \naliens within 30 days of the conclusion of the alien's prison sentence \nin most circumstances.\n  Finally, they will apply these expedited deportation to aliens who \nhave committed the ``General Crimes'' listed in section 1251 of title 8 \nof the United States Code. These include crimes such as murder, rape, \ndrug trafficking, espionage, sabotage, and treason.\n  These reforms are extremely reasonable. Aliens in this country who \ncommit these crimes will still be afforded all the due process \nprotections and lengthy appellate and habeas corpus review afforded \nU.S. citizens on the underlying offense. Moreover, once those appeals \nhave run and the conviction has been upheld, the alien will continue to \nbe entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge to determine \nwhether an order of deporatation should be entered. And if an order of \ndeportation is entered, the alien will still retain the right to appeal \nthe order to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The substitute to S. 735 \nonly eliminates additional judicial review for criminal aliens beyond \nthis point.\n  Without the rapid deportation provisions for criminal aliens in this \nlegislation, aliens who are convicted felons will continue to be \ndeported at the current pace, that is about 4 percent a year. At this \nrate--assuming no alien is ever convicted of another felony--it would \ntake 23 years to deport all the aliens presently residing in the \ncountry who are under felony convictions. Meanwhile, many will be \nreleased back into society to prey on more American citizens. No \ncountry, no matter how civilized, should continue to tolerate this \nabuse.\n  For that reason, as well as the many others that have been advanced \nover the past few days, we should enact this legislation, and quickly \ntoo. I urge the Senate to do just that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about another \nvery important set of provisions in this bill: the sections that would \nreform habeas corpus.\n  Like the provisions concerning deportation of criminal aliens, the \nhabeas corpus reforms in the bill correct a common abuse of judicial \nprocess in our criminal justice system. In this case they correct the \nobstructive and abusive manipulation of the writ of habeas corpus by \ncriminals who have been convicted of serious violent crimes.\n  Right now, the delay made possible by abuse of this writ allows \nconvicted criminals to essentially overrule a State's entire criminal \njustice system. By filing repetitive or frivolous habeas corpus \npetitions, criminals are able to delay the imposition of capital \nsentences indefinitely. This delay in turn seriously undercuts the \nmoral authority of the people, through their elected representatives, \nto impose this punishment on people who have committed extremely \nheinous crimes.\n  This is not fair to the people, who are entitled to determine the \npunishments to be accorded crimes committed in their States. Nor is it \nfair or even humane to the families of the victims of crime.\n  The habeas reforms in the antiterrorism bill impose reasonable limits \non the use of the writ--reforms that are long overdue. I support these \nreforms and I urge the Senate to enact the antiterrorism bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1245 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To retain an avenue for appeal in the case of prisoners who \n                   can demonstrate actual innocence)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1245 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 106, line 12, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through the end of line 17 and substitute the following:\n       ``or\n       ``(B) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed \n     in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to \n     establish that constitutional error has occurred and that \n     more likely than not, but for that constitutional effort, no \n     reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty \n     of the underlying offense.''\n       On page 110, line 3, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through the end of line 9 and substitute the following:\n       ``or\n       ``(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed \n     in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to \n     establish that constitutional error has occurred and that \n     more likely than not, but for that constitutional error no \n     reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty \n     of the underlying offense.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my intention to offer and modify this \namendment. I will do that in a moment so that the amendment clarifies \nlanguage that more precisely tracks the Supreme Court language which is \nthe subject of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the modification be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1245), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 106, line 13, strike clause (B) and substitute the \n     following:\n       ``(B) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed \n     in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to \n     establish that a constitutional violation has probably \n     resulted in the conviction of a person who is actually \n     innocent of the underlying offense.''\n       On page 110, line 4, strike clause (ii) and substitute the \n     following:\n       ``(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed \n     in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to \n     establish that a constitutional violation has probably \n     resulted in the conviction of a person who is actually \n     innocent of the underlying offense.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Justice Clark, discussing the Magna Carta, \nsaid the following:\n\n       Ever since the Magna Carta, the greatest right of personal \n     liberty has been guaranteed, and the procedures of the Habeas \n     Corpus Act of 1679 gave to every Englishman a prompt and \n     effective remedy for testing the legality of his \n     imprisonment. Considered by the founders as the highest \n     safeguard of liberty, it was written into the Constitution of \n     the United States that its privilege shall not be suspended \n     unless, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public \n     safety may require it. Its principle is embedded in the \n     fundamental law of 47 of our States.\n\n  Justice Clark went on to say:\n\n       It has long been available in the Federal courts to \n     indigent prisoners . . . both the State and Federal \n     Government to test the validity of their detention. Over the \n     centuries, it has been the common law world's freedom writ. \n     We repeat what has been so truly said of the Federal writ. \n     There is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired and \n     unsuspended, save only the cases specified in our \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, the right of habeas corpus over the years has been \nabused. It has been overused and excessively attempted to be utilized \nin many cases. Over the years, the Congress and the courts have \nattempted to rein in some of those excesses, and have done so. Both the \nSupreme Court and the Congress have in a number of ways attempted to \nrestrict the utilization of the right of habeas corpus so that it would \nnot be abused. The bill before us, in many respects, however, has \nreduced the utilization of the right of habeas corpus excessively. One \nparticular that I want to address in the next few minutes would deny \naccess to the writ on the part of somebody who a court believes is \nactually innocent.\n  I want to repeat that because this is a very narrow group of cases \nthat we are talking about. The case which this amendment addresses is \nthe case where a court determines that the prisoner filing the writ is \nprobably actually innocent.\n  I hope that sounds startling because this is a startling subject. The \nsubject is whether or not we are going to execute somebody where a \ncourt finds that the person is probably--that is the key word--actually \ninnocent of the underlying offense. I want to go back into history in \norder to give the background of this issue.\n  As I have said, the court as well as the Congress has found that the \nwrits of habeas corpus have been used excessively--the petition, more \naccurately, seeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has been \nhappening for many, many years.\n  The court in the Schlup case, which is the case I want to discuss at \nsome length, a 1995 case, went through the history of writs of habeas \ncorpus, and they found that the writ had been excessively sought, that \nthere had been repetitious petitions, there had been successive writs \nsought, and that the burden on the courts became too great.\n  So in the Schlup case, the majority said the following about the \nhistory of the applications for writs of habeas corpus.\n\n       To alleviate the increasing burdens on the Federal courts \n     and to contain the threat to finality and comity, Congress \n     attempted to fashion rules disfavoring claims raised in \n     second and subsequent petitions.\n\n  And they then went through congressional enactments starting in 1966. \nThey also then talked about what the Court has done to restrict the \napplicability and the availability of petitions for writs of habeas \ncorpus, and said the following in the Schlup case.\n\n       These same concerns--\n\n  And that is the overutilization--\n\n     resulted in a number of recent decisions from this Court that \n     delineate the circumstances under which a district court may \n     consider claims raised in a second or subsequent habeas \n     petition. In these decisions, the Court held that a habeas \n     court may not ordinarily reach the merits of successive \n     claims absent a showing of cause and prejudice.\n\n  The Court then quotes an opinion written by Justice O'Connor in the \nCarrier case. And they said in Schlup that Justice O'Connor has noted \nthe following:\n\n       In appropriate cases the principles of comity and finality \n     that inform the concepts of cause and prejudice must yield to \n     the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust \n     incarceration.\n\n  So there is an exception if the Court finds a fundamental miscarriage \nof justice. That is what courts are for. Courts can be abused but \nultimately what they must seek to do is avoid a fundamentally unjust \nincarceration and a fundamental miscarriage of justice. And this is \nwhat the Schlup court wrote.\n\n       To ensure that the fundamental miscarriage of justice \n     exception would remain ``rare'' and would only be applied in \n     the ``extraordinary case,'' while at the same time ensuring \n     that the exception would extend relief to those who are truly \n     deserving, this court explicitly tied the miscarriage of \n     justice exception to the petitioner's innocence.\n\n  That is what we now must address this afternoon. It is what do we do, \nwhat standard do we adopt when, on a second application for a petition \nof habeas corpus raising a constitutional defect, a petitioner \npersuades a court that he or she is probably innocent of the underlying \ncrime? Will we permit a second petition to be granted so that there can \nbe a hearing? We are not talking about now release from prison. We are \njust talking about whether a hearing will be available to somebody who \npersuades a court that he or she is probably innocent and is awaiting \nexecution.\n  Now, Justice O'Connor in the previous Carrier case, which is relied \non heavily in Schlup, said the following:\n\n       In an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation \n     has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is \n     actually innocent, a Federal habeas court may grant the writ \n     even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural \n     default.\n\n  And the Court went on to say:\n\n       Explicitly tying the miscarriage of justice exception to \n     innocence\n\n  And I want to repeat that word because that is the heart of this \namendment. We are only talking about people who are probably innocent \nas found by a court and as to whether or not they should be denied a \nhearing on the ground that their application is a second application \nfor the writ and not the first application but where a court now for \nthe first time, faced with new evidence, is satisfied that that \napplicant is probably innocent.\n  And here is what the Court said:\n\n       Explicitly tying the miscarriage of justice exception to \n     innocence thus accommodates both the systemic interest in \n     finality, comity, and conservation of judicial resources, and \n     the overriding individual interest in doing justice in the \n     ``extraordinary case.''\n\n  The Court went on to say the following:\n\n       Experience has taught us that a substantial claim that \n     constitutional error has caused the conviction of an innocent \n     person is extremely rare. To be credible, such a claim \n     requires petitioner to support his allegations of \n     constitutional error with new reliable evidence--whether it \n     be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness \n     accounts, or critical physical evidence--that was not \n     presented at trial. Because such evidence is obviously \n     unavailable in the vast majority of cases, claims of actual \n     innocence are rarely successful.\n\n  And the Court said that:\n\n       A petitioner does not meet the threshold requirement unless \n     he persuades the district court that, in light of the new \n     evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to \n     find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n  Now, that is a pretty strong test for being eligible for a hearing on \na second writ, that a court must find an applicant is probably \ninnocent, meaning that no reasonable juror--no reasonable juror--would \nfind that person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And the issue \nbecomes whether or not we want to require that person to be executed. \nIs that person going to be executed? Are we going to deny, as this bill \ndoes, a Federal court the right to grant a hearing on a second writ of \nhabeas corpus when a petitioner introducing new evidence convinces a \ncourt [[Page S7825]] that he or she is probably innocent? Will we deny \nthat court that opportunity?\n  Now, what the bill does is adopts the dissent in Schlup, which has a \nhigher standard--not the standard of probability but the standard of \nclear and convincing. And that is the issue on this amendment, whether \nor not we, in the Senate, are going to overturn the Supreme Court \ndecision in Schlup, which said that if a court is convinced that a \nperson is probably innocent, that is enough for that court to grant a \nhearing on a second or subsequent application for writ of habeas \ncorpus, or will we adopt the dissent in Schlup, which says, no, \nprobability of innocence is not enough. Even if somebody is probably \ninnocent of the underlying offense, we are going to execute that person \nunless there is clear and convincing evidence, evidence above and \nbeyond probability.\n  The case itself in Schlup was a case where this man was already a \nprisoner and was convicted of first-degree murder, a murder that \noccurred in prison, and was sentenced to death. In the habeas corpus \nproceedings, he produced a videotape showing him in a cafeteria lunch \nline at the time the killing occurred in a different place, sworn \ntestimony from a prison guard stating that Schlup could not have \ncommitted the murder, and sworn testimony of five eyewitnesses that \nSchlup was not present and did not participate in any way in the \nmurder.\n  The Federal court of appeals judge found--this is the court of \nappeals now, before the Supreme Court--the court of appeals judge found \n``truly persuasive evidence that Mr. Schlup is actually innocent.'' \nDespite that, the majority of the court of appeals upheld the death \nsentence and refused to grant a hearing on the new evidence. The court \nheld that under the clear and convincing test, the test that they \nthought they should follow, they would not grant a hearing in his \napplication.\n  Earlier this year, the Supreme Court overruled that court of appeals \nsaying that the clear and convincing test, which is the test in the \nbill before us, failed to provide a meaningful avenue by which to avoid \na manifest injustice in cases of actual innocence.\n  The Court ruled that the fair test for the relief sought is whether \n``a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of \none who is actually innocent.'' I am going to repeat it because that is \nthe issue in this amendment. The issue is whether we ought to adopt the \nmajority in Schlup or whether we ought to reverse it. The bill reverses \nit and goes with the dissent. The amendment would allow the majority of \nthe Supreme Court in Schlup to utilize that test in habeas corpus \nproceedings, the test being that whether a constitutional violation has \nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\n  I think most of us feel that habeas corpus has been abused, that \ntechnicalities have been raised by people who are guilty. This \namendment raises the opposite issue. This amendment raises the question \nof whether or not we are going to use a technicality to deny a hearing \nto someone who is probably actually innocent.\n  ``Probably actually innocent,'' is that enough for a hearing when \nsomeone is on death row or not? Or will the procedural technicality be \nused to deny that person--a rare case--a hearing because there had been \na previous petition filed? And to meet the test of the Supreme Court, \nthe lower court must find that it is more likely than not that no \nreasonable juror would have convicted him in light of the new evidence.\n  Mr. President, we are having to face up to the narrowest group of \ncases, the case where there is a claim that a court finds probably \ncorrect that an applicant for the great writ is probably innocent of \nthe underlying crime. We cannot avoid this by talking about \ntechnicalities. We are the ones who will determine whether a procedural \ntechnicality will stand in the way of a hearing for that small group of \nprisoners who persuade a court that they are probably innocent of the \nunderlying crime.\n  This may be and probably is only a very few percent of persons who \nare in prison on death row, but we know that these cases exist. There \nwere two of them in 1995. In addition to the Schlup case, we had the \ncase of Curtis Kyles. In that case, the Supreme Court found that the \nprosecution had improperly suppressed evidence of Mr. Kyles' innocence \nand that this evidence would have made a different result reasonably \nprobable--reasonably probable. The Court agreed with Judge King of the \nfifth circuit, who expressed ``serious reservations about whether the \nState has sentenced to death the right man.''\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again, what we are trying to do here is put \nsome finality into the habeas corpus procedures. The Senator's \namendment just allows another loophole that is unjustified and allows \nfurther appeals. Because liberal judges who are opposed to the death \npenalty do not want the death penalty imposed, there will be an \nincentive for them to find that there is probable innocence under this \namendment and the whole process will have to start over again, \nregardless of whether the petitioner is truly innocent of the crime.\n  The Hatch substitute, our bill, the Specter-Hatch bill, permits \nsuccessive habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases where the \npetitioner may be innocent. If the petitioner is innocent, he or she \ncan have successive habeas corpus petitions and our bill contains a \nsafety valve which permits Federal courts to hear legitimate claims. \nThe Levin amendment, however, weakens the standard of review for \ndetermining whether someone is innocent from a ``clear and convincing'' \nstandard, which is what we have in our bill, to a subjective \n``probably'' innocent standard.\n  In addition, the amendment guts the bill's prohibition against \nsubsequent provisions by allowing successive habeas corpus petitions \nwhere the death row inmate does not dispute his having committed the \nhomicide in question but claims the death penalty should not be \nimposed.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Levin, while it seems reasonable, is \nproblematic. When the Court rules on these issues, it does not write on \na clean slate--and I am talking about the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly held, for example, that Federal courts are not the \nforums in which to relitigate criminal cases. At the initial trial, \nsociety's resources have been concentrated in order to decide the \nquestion of guilt or innocence. Therefore, a petitioner making a claim \nof actual innocence falls well short of satisfying his burden if the \nreviewing court determines that any juror reasonably could have found \nthe petitioner guilty of the crime.\n  The proposed amendment attempts to follow the Supreme Court's recent \ndecision in Schlup versus Delo in which the Court exacerbates the \nconfusion in the lower courts, undermines the finality of lawful \nconvictions and creates a greater uncertainty as to the standard under \nwhich a court must hold an evidentiary subsequent hearing.\n  I know that I have said this many times before, but we are dealing \nwith postconviction collateral proceedings, not a trial. This is \nposttrial. Habeas corpus review is a postconviction remedy. This is \npostjury verdict. This is postsentence by the court. What it means is \nthe jury has already convicted the individual and his conviction and \nsentence have been upheld on appeal. The individual had at least two \nState appellate reviews which are subject to Supreme Court review. The \nindividual has gone to the intermediate appellate court and has gone to \nthe supreme court of the State.\n  I might add, the appellate courts have upheld the conviction and the \nState habeas petitions have thus been exhausted. In other words, there \nhas been the trial, there has been a review by the intermediate court, \nthere has been a review by the supreme court of the State. The State \nprocedures have been exhausted.\n It also means that petitions to the Supreme Court have been filed. In \nother words there have been two rounds of State review both of which \nwere the subject of a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States of America, and that both of those Supreme Court \npetitions [[Page S7826]] have been denied; and at least in collateral \ncases, as a general rule, the Governor also has ruled on the case \nbecause there has been a petition for clemency; and the Government has \nalso reviewed the claim in a clemency petition and has denied it, too. \nAt this point, the prisoner's conviction has been proved beyond a \nreasonable doubt. It has been upheld on direct and State collateral \nreview. The conviction has also been upheld on the death row inmate's \nFederal habeas petition. It is at this point in the process--after all \nof these reviews--where my colleague from Michigan wants to give \nindividual Federal judges broad, subjective authority to determine \nwhether someone is innocent of the crime he or she was convicted of. We \nallow such a determination by a Federal court but we propose a more \ncertain standard rather than the subjective standard employed in my \ncolleague's amendment.\n\n  The proposed amendment would require the district court to hold an \nevidentiary hearing or grant a second successive petition if it could \nbe shown that a constitutional violation probably resulted in an \nerroneous conviction.\n  First, what does probably mean in the law? Who knows? This standard \nwill gut our habeas corpus proposal here today. Would it be a 50-\npercent chance of innocence? Is that what it means? If that is so, then \nI think if the prisoner were probably innocent, his conviction would \nhave been overturned long ago in all of these proceedings up through \nthe State courts to the Supreme Court, to the Governor, for clemency.\n  Second, the proposed amendment would let a court decide independently \nthat a defendant might be innocent. We go through that every day in the \ncurrent system. Judges who do not want the death penalty to be imposed, \nwho are violently opposed to it, for any reason, decide there is \nanother reason to let this be prolonged again, all at a tremendous cost \nto the States and the victims of these crimes.\n  So what we are saying is, the proposed amendment would let a court \ndecide independently that a defendant might be innocent, that there was \nconstitutional error, and that he should not have been convicted. This \nis a wholly appropriate standard that we have in the bill.\n  The Levin amendment will simply serve to permit these prisoners who \nhave been duly convicted, their convictions upheld, all of their \nconstitutional rights protected, their civil liberties protected to \ncontinue to raise new claims. It allows judges who does not like the \ndeath penalty to make subjective determinations, many years after the \nconviction, to proclaim the probable innocence of a long-convicted \nmurderer. It simply serves to permit a prisoner to drag out his \nproceedings and further delay justice.\n  Delayed justice is justice denied. We are frustrated by that all the \ntime. We have a man in California sitting on death row almost for 50 \nyears--successive habeas corpus petitions all the time, on and on. In \nUtah, we had the Andrews case. It lasted 18 years. He filed over 30 \ndifferent habeas corpus petitions--30 different habeas corpus \nproceedings--over that 18 years before the death penalty was finally \ncarried out.\n  All this does is continue the old system, the old business as usual. \nFrankly, because we all know the distinguished Senator from Michigan is \none of the most eloquent advocates against the death penalty in this \nbody--and I have respect for him; I believe he is very sincere on this \nissue--I think it is fair for him to argue against the death penalty \nstraight up. But to just provide a mechanism whereby there can be \nanother appeal because some liberal judge decides there ought to be an \nappeal and will delay a sentence that the law allows, I think is wrong. \nI know of no case--not one--that has been cited to the Judiciary \nCommittee, in its years of study on this issue, in which Federal habeas \ncorpus review has been successfully employed to release an innocent \nindividual from an erroneous State court conviction. It is a myth.\n  This amendment is just another method to try to get another appeal \nand delay the ultimate imposition of the sentence.\n  Where is the case of an innocent person needing Federal habeas corpus \nreview in order to prove his or her innocence? Take Randall Dale Adams, \nthe Texas death row inmate who was the subject of the documentary ``The \nThin Blue Line.'' How did he establish his innocence after he was \nconvicted? Not through Federal habeas corpus, but through the Texas \nState court proceedings--procedures similar to those available in \nvirtually every State in the Union today.\n  Take the case of Walter McMillan, who was wrongfully convicted and \nsentenced to die for the brutal robbery-murder of an Alabama \nconvenience store clerk. Was it habeas corpus that saved his life? No, \nit was the State of Alabama. Despite being granted relief through the \nStates, both of these men were called before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by a colleague of ours, who opposes the death penalty, to \ndemonstrate why our Nation needs more Federal habeas corpus review \nrather than less. Federal habeas corpus review had nothing to do with \nit.\n  The State procedures were adequate and did the job in protecting \ntheir innocence and finding their innocence. Yet, they brought them up \nhere to try and show that Federal habeas corpus review is important.\n  I do not know of one case where Federal habeas corpus review has \nsaved the defendant. But the State procedures have. In the Federal \ncourts, the Federal direct appeal procedures have. That sort of logic, \nas in the present amendment, cannot even be called reform even when it \nexpands the rights of convicted murderers.\n  I mention these cases--Randall Dale Adams and Walter McMillan--not \nbecause I advocate abolition of Federal habeas corpus. It is clear that \nwe protect it in the Specter-Hatch antiterrorism bill. I am not \nadvocating abolition of Federal habeas corpus. The responsible scholars \nand lawyers and law enforcement professionals do support banning and \ngetting rid of Federal habeas corpus. There are many bright people who \nthink that this system is out of whack and that we do not need Federal \nhabeas corpus. But I am not arguing that position.\n  We have provided for protection of Federal habeas corpus, but we do \nit one time and that is it--unless, of course, they can truly come up \nwith evidence of innocence that could not have been presented at trial. \nThere we allow successive petitions. Any time somebody can show \ninnocence, we allow that. I simply wish to provide my colleagues some \nperspective on this issue. We in the Senate, whose duty it is to enact \ninto law the community's legitimate interest in seeing justice done \nwithin the parameters of the Constitution, should soundly reject the \npresent amendment to the Dole-Hatch bill. Indeed, the Senate has a \nparticular duty with respect to habeas corpus. As the inscription on \nthe Dirksen Senate Office Building states, ``The Senate is the Living \nSymbol of our National Union of States.''\n  The amendment before us will not only hinder and potentially defeat \nour efforts to pass a true crime bill this year, but in so doing, this \namendment will also force an unprecedented and substantial intrusion \ninto the State criminal justice system.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will vote against this amendment, as \nsincere as it is and as sincere as it is being offered. It is another \nway of just delaying the process because some people do not like the \ndeath penalty. I understand that. I think there are good arguments on \nboth sides of the death penalty. I myself would very seldom use the \ndeath penalty and only in the most heinous of cases. On the other hand, \nI think it is essential that we have it on the books. There are those \nwho would just as sincerely argue the other side, that there should be \nno death penalty, that it is cruel and unusual--even some of our \nSupreme Court Justices of the past and maybe now and in the future. But \ndo not try to do it by gumming up the procedural process posttrial that \nhas plenty of protections for defendants.\n  There is no reason for this expensive litigation process with \nfrivolous appeals to continue. That is what we are fighting today. And \nwe are acknowledging that we protect the constitutional rights and \ncivil liberties of the defendants in these matters.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan is very sincere and I acknowledge \nthat. I have a great deal of respect for his sincerity and \nintelligence. But this amendment should not pass because I \n[[Page S7827]] think it would make this process a continuation of the \ncurrent process, and I think that would be a tragedy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds to tell my friend \nfrom Utah this is not a death penalty amendment. This is a habeas \ncorpus amendment. The language in the bill reverses the Supreme Court \nopinion in the Schlup case. That opinion found that the man in that \ncase was probably innocent. I do not think anyone in this body wants to \nexecute someone who is probably innocent and deny that person a \nhearing.\n  Now, Justice O'Connor said--not your liberal judge--one of the \nmajority in the Schlup case, said, ``The court today does not sow \nconfusion in the law. Rather, it properly balances the dictates of \njustice with the need to ensure that the actual innocence exception \nremains a 'safety valve' in an 'extraordinary case'.''\n  The issue is that the bill before the Senate reverses the Supreme \nCourt. The Levin amendment is not trying to bring something new into \nthis. The Levin amendment is trying to preserve a Supreme Court opinion \nof a few months ago, joined by Justice O'Connor. That is the issue.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I rise in strong \nsupport. I think we all know that I oppose the death penalty. It is a \npenalty we reserve for those of modest means. If a person has enough \nmoney, that person will never get the death penalty in this country. \nThat is the reality.\n  That is not the question, though I find it of interest that today's \nNew York Times has a story that the South African Supreme Court \nyesterday unanimously outlawed capital punishment in South Africa. We \nare one of the few countries left in the Western world that still has \nthe death penalty.\n  The question is whether someone who is probably innocent--that is the \nlanguage of the Levin amendment--probably resulted in the conviction of \na person who is actually innocent of the underlying offense.\n  Now, whether a person is for the death penalty or against it, no one \nwants to send someone to prison who is probably innocent. We have done \nthat.\n  I can remember when we were debating this issue when I was in the \nIllinois General Assembly and a man was about to be executed, and \nsuddenly someone in the State of Georgia confessed that he had \ncommitted the crime.\n  Now, that case is clear and convincing evidence. I have to say that \nthe bill without this amendment would take care of that case.\n  There are a lot of other marginal cases. We are not just saying a \nmarginal case. The Levin amendment says where a person is probably \ninnocent, a person ought to have that chance to appeal. I cannot \nbelieve anyone who really looks at this--the Senator from North \nCarolina, the Senator from Utah, my colleagues--I cannot believe they \nwill vote against that.\n  Maybe Members will vote against it if they are not aware of what the \namendment does, and a briefing is right at the desk on either your side \nor our side. These briefings--and I do not mean this disrespectfully to \nthe fine staff--but it is very difficult to condense in a few words \nwhat these amendments do.\n  The Levin amendment says ``If you are probably innocent, you ought to \nhave the chance to appeal.'' I have a hard time believing that is not \ngoing to be accepted unanimously. Apparently, it may not be.\n  I am pleased to support the Levin amendment, proud to support it and \nvote for it.\n  I believe I have consumed my time, Mr. President. I hope I have been \nable to get the message across.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 7, 1995]\n\n          South Africa's Supreme Court Abolishes Death Penalty\n\n                         (By Howard W. French)\n\n       Johannesburg, South Africa, June 6.--In its first major \n     decision, South Africa's recently created supreme court \n     abolished the death penalty today, ending a decades-old \n     practice of executing criminals convicted of serious crimes \n     that had once given the country one of the world's highest \n     rates of capital punishment.\n       Announcing the unanimous decision, Arthur Chaskalson, \n     president of the Constitutional Court, said, ``Everyone, \n     including the most abominable of human beings, has a right to \n     life, and capital punishment is therefore unconstitutional.''\n       That the Constitutional Court chose the death penalty issue \n     for its first major ruling underscored the importance of the \n     issue in a country where for decades execution was used not \n     just as a weapon against common crime, but as a means of \n     terror in enforcing the system of racial separation known as \n     apartheid.\n       ``Retribution cannot be accorded the same weight under our \n     Constitution as the right to life and dignity,'' Mr. \n     Chaskalson said. ``It has not been shown that the death \n     sentence would be materially more effective to deter or \n     prevent murder than the alternative sentence of life \n     imprisonment would be.''\n       In a strong show of support for the ruling, each of the \n     court's 11 judges issued a written opinion backing the \n     decision. The Constitutional Court was created earlier this \n     year as an equal to the executive and legislative branches.\n       South Africa stopped executing prisoners in 1992 on the \n     orders of the former National Party Government. With violent \n     crime rampant, the number of prisoners awaiting execution on \n     death rows has since swollen to 443. Over 1,100 people were \n     executed in the 1980's. Death sentences were carried out by \n     hanging.\n       Reacting to the ruling, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said \n     the prisoners would be quickly moved off of death row. \n     According to prison wardens, the announcement set off a round \n     of wild celebration among condemned inmates at Pretoria's \n     Central Prison.\n       Elsewhere, however, comments on the ruling revealed the \n     continuing depths of political division among South Africans \n     that typically run along racial lines, one year after the \n     formal end of apartheid.\n       On radio talk shows today, reactions were deeply split \n     between black and white, with the former typically applauding \n     the abolition of the death penalty, while the latter, \n     invoking high crime rates, criticized what many whites say in \n     a gradual slide away from law and order.\n       ``Under the A.N.C., the message is that people can commit \n     any crime and get away with it,'' said one caller to a \n     Johannesburg radio station, referring to the African National \n     Congress, the party of President Nelsen Mandela.\n       Crime has become a highly emotional issue among many whites \n     here, even though blacks are overwhelmingly represented among \n     the victims of violence. Last weekend in Johannesburg alone, \n     42 people were killed, 477 businesses and homes were broken \n     into and 34 women were reported raped.\n       While whites complained of a spreading sense of impunity, \n     many blacks reacted by noting that they had been \n     disproportionately made victims of the death penalty in the \n     past through wrongful arrests and convictions.\n       Moreover, with the death penalty much more likely to be \n     applied to blacks than to whites under apartheid, capital \n     punishment had become as powerfully emotional an issue for \n     many blacks as crime has become for many whites.\n       Mr. Mandela himself made this point in a point in a \n     statement to the court during his trial for incitement in \n     1962. ``I have grave fears that this system of justice may \n     enable the guilty to drag the innocent before the courts,'' \n     he said. ``It enables the unjust to prosecute and demand \n     vengeance against the just. It may trend to lower the \n     standards of fairness applied in country's courts by white \n     judicial officers to black litigants.''\n       Two years later, in another trial, Mr. Mandela was \n     sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to overthrow \n     the government, a judgment that his supporters saw as a \n     victory because the death sentence was not imposed, even as \n     they deplored Mr. Mandela's conviction.\n       Conservative white groups condemned the ruling while many \n     predominantly black political organizations portrayed it as a \n     victory for racial justice.\n       The predominantly black African National Congress, the \n     country's largest political party and the leading force in \n     the fight against apartheid, hailed the ruling as a victory \n     for the country's new democracy, saying, ``never, never and \n     never again must citizens of our country be subjected to the \n     barbaric practice of capital punishment.''\n       ``It's making us a civilized society,'' Archbishop Desmond \n     Tutu, the Anglican primate of Southern Africa, told the South \n     African Press Association. ``It shows we actually do mean \n     business when we say we have reverence for life.''\n       Archbishop Tutu, a leading campaigner against apartheid, \n     called the death penalty ``obscenity,'' saying it, in effect, \n     said to criminals, ``We want to show you that we care about \n     life so we kill you too.''\n       Amoung white political groups the reaction to the ruling \n     was typically negative, running from carefully worded \n     statements of displeasure to outright hostility.\n       Saying that the overwhelming majority of South Africans \n     supported the death penalty, F.W. de Klerk, vice president in \n     the country's coalition transition Government, said that his \n     National Party, a predominantly white party that had governed \n     the country for decades under apartheid, would campaign to \n     reinstate capital punishment.\n       Other conservative white groups reacted even more harshly. \n     ``The rights of murderers [[Page S7828]] and rapists are \n     being held in higher regard than those of their victims,'' \n     said one Afrikaner youth organization.\n       For his part, Mr. Mandela, who served 27 years of a life \n     sentence under a succession of apartheid governments made no \n     public comment today on the ruling. The President's office, \n     however, issued a statement intended to reassure those who \n     fear a growing leniency toward crime.\n       ``The President also wishes to emphasize that this decision \n     has no bearing on the commitment of the Government to tackle \n     the problem of crime, and particularly violent crime, with \n     all the resources and determination it can muster.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there any time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak 2 minutes \non the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is pretty clear here.\n  What the Senator from Michigan does in his amendment is stick with \none part of the change in the law. Right now there is no requirement in \nthe law to file the successive petition that says that the defendant \nhas to explain why he did not file the petition before.\n  Now, under the Hatch approach and under the approach if adopted by \nSenator Levin, that is tightened up. Even Senator Levin is saying we \nhave to show cause why this was not raised before. There is only one \ndisagreement before the Senate. That is, what standard of proof do you \nhave to bring forward to show you are innocent?\n  By implication, they are agreeing a person ought to be able, if there \nis evidence of innocence, ought to be able to have another petition. \nSenator Levin says the same thing.\n  I think every American would say you ought to have another crack at \nit. The difference is, they say ``clear and convincing.'' Right now, \nthe Supreme Court says, no, you do not have to go that far, but you \nhave to go pretty far. You have to sufficiently establish the \nconstitutional violation. You said what happened to you in the lower \ncourt, you say your constitutional rights were violated in a way that \nprobably resulted in the conviction of a person who is actually \ninnocent.\n  Are we going to quibble over putting someone to death on whether or \nnot we abide by the Supreme Court majority that says all you have to do \nis say ``probably'' this resulted in a conviction of an innocent \nperson?\n  But they want to go even further. They want to say, no, ``probably'' \nis not enough. You have to show that there is clear and convincing. The \nonly thing they do not say is ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n  Keep in mind, folks, what everybody misses, when we talk about habeas \ncorpus, is this is not about having a convicted person go free. That is \nnot what this is about. Nobody under habeas corpus petition goes free. \nThey get a new trial. That is all they are saying here. I sure think \nthis is distinction with a difference that can mean the difference \nbetween life and death of an innocent person. I hope they will yield on \n``probably'' and not ``clear and convincing.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not want to prolong this. I think I \nhave 11 minutes left. I will just take a minute or two.\n  What I am saying, there has been a trial, conviction, there have been \nposttrial proceedings, there has been an appeal to the intermediate \ncourt in the State, an appeal to the supreme court of the State, then a \npetitioner of certiorari to the Supreme Court, all of which are denied, \nand a petition for clemency to the Governor. He denies. In every case \nwhere we found actual innocence, or any kind of innocence, it has been \nthrough those proceedings, not in Federal habeas.\n  I have to say that all of this is another attempt to just prolong the \nprocess and allow--call it what it is--a liberal judge who does not \nbelieve in the death penalty to prolong the process, again at a \ntremendous cost to the States, everybody concerned, and I think a cost \nto justice.\n  People out there are starting to say, my goodness gracious, is there \nno finality to the decisions, the just decisions, of the court?\n  I have to say the cases that we can cite where people have been \nhelped, where innocence has been proven, have been through that State \nprocess, not through the Federal habeas process. It is just another \nlayer of expense.\n  I am not going to knock those who are trying to do this because they \nwill sincerely do anything to stop the death penalty. I respect that.\n  If I was a defense lawyer again, I would do anything to try and \npreserve somebody's life. But I have to say it would be pretty cynical \nto keep doing what is being done in some of these cases today. We can \ncall it sincerity, but the fact of the matter is it is a legal \nobligation to do what you can. But there is an element out there in the \nlegal community which, having failed to convince the public and the \ncourts that the death penalty is wrong, has set about to eliminate the \ndeath penalty defect by making death penalty litigation too costly and \nprotracted.\n  As a lawyer I do everything I can within the law, and if we provide \nthis law, I will be doing that, and so will every other defense lawyer. \nIt is another appeal, another cost to the States, another frivolous \nappeal which we are trying to limit here while still giving the \nprotections we need in these matters.\n  The Levin amendment relies on the term ``actual innocence.'' Actual \ninnocence means--and let me just read out of the leading Supreme Court \ncase on it, Sawyer versus Whitney. This is what they held:\n\n       1. To show actual innocence one must show by clear and \n     convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error no \n     reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for \n     the death penalty under the applicable State law.\n\n  The amendment before us, the Levin amendment, will not help the truly \ninnocent. This amendment will further undermine the proper role of \nhabeas corpus and that is the effect of the amendment. The effect of it \nis not meant to overturn the fundamental defects. The Specter-Hatch \nhabeas bill has the safety valve. It has a safety valve available for \nthe truly innocent. We provide successive petitions for those who prove \ninnocence. The proposed amendment will do nothing to help the truly \ninnocent. It is merely another means of delaying justice. There are \nplenty of procedures and mechanisms in the Specter-Hatch bill to \nprotect the truly innocent. So we do not need to continue to prolong \nthis.\n  I move to table the Levin amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield his remaining time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield my remaining time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote on the \nmotion to table the Levin amendment be deferred to a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the minority \nleader, after 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I now ask the Levin amendment be laid aside so the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona can call up his amendment. I \nunderstand there is to be a 1-hour time agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be a 1-hour time agreement with the \ntime equally divided--in the usual form, we will put it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I also ask unanimous consent at the conclusion or yielding \nback of the time on the Kyl amendment that it be set aside and the vote \noccur on or in relation to the Kyl amendment following the vote on the \nmotion to table the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1211\n\n      (Purpose: To stop the abuse of Federal collateral remedies)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1211.\n\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     STOPPING ABUSE OF FEDERAL COLLATERAL REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 153 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2257. Adequacy of State remedies\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an \n     application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person \n     in custody pursuant to a judgment or order of a State court \n     shall not be entertained by a court of the United States \n     unless the remedies in the courts of the State are inadequate \n     or ineffective to test the legality of the person's \n     detention.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . STOPPING ABUSE OF FEDERAL COLLATERAL REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 153 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2257.

Adequacy of State remedies.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the reason I asked the key provision of that \namendment be read is to illustrate its simplicity. It is very simple \nand yet I think very important and necessary as an improvement to the \nbill which is before us now.\n  I want to begin by complimenting the manager of the bill, the Senator \nfrom Utah, for not only getting the bill to this point but for \ninsisting that we have habeas corpus reform in this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  My amendment will improve the habeas corpus reforms by, as was just \nread, ensuring that a case in the State courts can be reviewed in the \nState court system, but that as long as the State court system provides \nadequate and effective remedies, that person does not have the \nauthority to go over to the Federal courts and relitigate all of the \nsame claims in the Federal courts.\n  Of course, it should go without saying that there is always a review \nin the U.S. Supreme Court from any decision of the highest court of a \nState. So there is ultimately still the potential for Federal review of \na State court decision.\n  I would like to illustrate exactly what we are talking about here \nwith a hypothetical and a real case. The Senator from Oklahoma is here. \nOne of the reasons the Senator from Oklahoma is so interested in this \nprovision is because of the recent tragedy in his State. Let us assume \ntwo cases in the State of Oklahoma. In the first case, there is a \nrobbery and in the course of that robbery someone is shot. The person \nis tried in the State courts, there is an appeal to the appeals court \nand on up to the supreme court of the State--eventually a prosecution, \na conviction and a sentencing.\n  Thereafter that State court prisoner may file writs of habeas corpus \nin the Oklahoma State court system as often as that person can find \ngrounds for doing so. Those writs can be determined legally in the \nappeals and supreme court of the State of Oklahoma, and eventually of \ncourse, after the supreme court of Oklahoma has ruled, they can be \nconsidered by the U.S. Supreme Court. So that State court prisoner has \nvirtually an unlimited right to take these writs of habeas corpus up \nand down the State court system.\n  In today's law he also has the right to go to the Federal court \nsystem and essentially relitigate the exact issues. ``I have some newly \ndiscovered evidence that will prove I was innocent of the crime. I have \ngone up and down the State court system, now I would like to try my \nluck in the Federal courts.'' Under existing law, that person can do \nit.\n  What the bill says is we are going to put a couple of roadblocks in \nthe way. It should not be quite so easy for you to you do that. You at \nleast ought to have some time limits within which to file these habeas \ncorpus writs in Federal court, and the Federal courts at least ought to \ngive great weight to the previous decisions of the supreme court. Those \nare both sound provisions but they obviously do not preclude the State \ncourt prisoner from going to Federal court.\n  Let us take, on the other hand, the perpetrators of the heinous \ntragedy in Oklahoma City a few weeks ago. They will probably--he or \nthey--will probably be tried in the Federal district court in Oklahoma. \nIf convicted, there could be an appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court. But those people, \nhaving been convicted, will have their writs of habeas corpus reviewed \nonly in the Federal district court and circuit courts of the United \nStates of America. They do not have the right to go over to the \nOklahoma State court system and relitigate those same claims. So, \nwhereas the State court prisoner can use both the State system and the \nFederal system, in duplicate appeals, a Federal prisoner may only use \nthe Federal system.\n  The constitutionality is obviously clear. Either the State courts or \nthe Federal courts are competent to adjudicate constitutional claims. \nThat is established. There is no legal question about that whatsoever. \nBut the Federal court prisoner has one set of options. The State court \nprisoner, under the stats quo, has two sets of options. And we are \nlimiting them a little bit by the bill before us.\n  My amendment says: No, a Federal court prisoner adjudicates his \nclaims in Federal court. A State court prisoner adjudicates his claims \nin the State court. The only time the State court prisoner can go to a \nFederal court is from an ultimate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  This will end the duplicative appeals that we have all been \ncomplaining about. This and only this amendment will end those \nduplicative appeals. Because it will still be quite possible for State \ncourt prisoners under the bill before us to adjudicate their claims in \nState court and then go to the Federal court so long as they do it in a \ntimely manner. So long as they meet the time limits we impose in this \nbill, they can still go to the Federal court and relitigate exactly the \nsame claims.\n  What ordinarily happens is that the Federal district courts or \ncircuit courts of appeals say, ``Wait a minute, the State court has \nalready decided that. Your appeal is summarily denied.'' But that takes \ntime.\n  I just spoke to the presiding judge of the Arizona court of appeals \nand he said we summarily dismissed many of these. But he said every one \nof them has to be considered. And that is the point. From a very small \nnumber to a very large number, the district courts and the circuit \ncourts of appeals are having to handle these writs that have already \nbeen decided by the State court and, as the Federal courts have said \nover and over again, the State courts are perfectly able to resolve \nthese issues.\n  Mr. President, this is not just an idea that I have come up with. \nThis is what is happening in the District of Columbia today, and has \nbeen for the last 25 years, because 25 years ago the Congress passed a \nlaw and established that in the District of Columbia courts--by the \nway, the District of Columbia has in effect a State court system which \nparallels the U.S. District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  So it is similar to States in that it has its own system of courts. \nWe in the Congress 25 years ago said that prisoners in the District of \nColumbia can only use that quasi-State court system here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. That was tested in the U.S. Supreme Court and the \nconstitutionality was upheld in the case of Swain versus Pressley in \n1977. And there have also been other opinions with respect to the \nconstitutionality of what was done. One judge, as a matter of fact, \neven wrote that because of this experiment in the District of Columbia, \nwhich has worked very well for the last 25 years, that the Congress \nought to consider the same kind of limitation of remedies in the State \ncourts, exactly what we are proposing here today with my amendment.\n  So at the invitation of Judge McGowan, we are proposing an amendment \nwhich says in the State courts, [[Page S7830]] you do like the District \nof Columbia. You exhaust your remedies in the State court. You can go \nto the U.S. Supreme Court, but not jump over to the Federal District \nCourt and the Circuit Court of Appeals to litigate the same claims.\n  Judge Robert Bork has written a letter in support of my amendment. He \nwrites, in part:\n\n       Your proposed amendment to the antiterrorism bill to stop \n     the abuse of Federal collateral remedies is an excellent and \n     much-needed reform. There is no doubt about the \n     constitutionality of the provision you propose, nor is there \n     any doubt about the need for your amendment. Your amendment \n     is a sorely needed reform to a situation that is now out of \n     hand.\n\n  Mr. President, the constitutionality of what I propose is beyond \nquestion. It has been tried for 25 years here in the District of \nColumbia. It is found to be very workable. Everybody agrees that we \nneed to limit duplicative appeals.\n  Therefore, it seems to me that, if we are to really make the \nprovision of habeas corpus reform in this bill work, we do not just \nplay with it at the edges by proposing some time limits and providing \nfor deference to State court proceedings. We go right to the heart of \nmatter and say if you have a complete and adequate remedy in the State \ncourts, then that is what you will get except, of course, for your \nultimate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. You cannot jump over to the \nFederal system of courts to readjudicate those very same claims.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is on his feet. I would like to yield time \nto the Senator from Oklahoma to further discuss this particular \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to compliment my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona for his leadership. He brought this amendment to \nmy attention. I told him I was not very familiar with it, but I told \nhim I would do a little more homework. I have. I have become more \nconvinced that he is on the right track.\n  I talked to the Federal judge in the Western District of the State of \nOklahoma, and I asked him about the number of appeals; prisoner \npetitions. We find out in the last 10 years they more than tripled, and \nhave actually consumed about 25 percent of the work load in the western \ndistrict. The court has before them hundreds of prisoner petitions and \nappeals that have to be reviewed.\n  The Senator from Arizona makes an excellent point, and says the \nStates have ajudicated these cases thoroughly. They have gone all the \nway through the State courts, through the appeals process, State \nsupreme courts, and then all the way even--with capital punishment \ncases--to the Supreme Court.\n  Yet, they continue to press, and want to run through the Federal \ncourt system as well where the Federal judges do not have time to go \nthrough the entire case, where there is almost a presumption that, if \nthey have to do that, maybe the Federal Government knows better, which \nis not always correct. The Federal judges I have talked to said we are \nin serious need of habeas corpus reform.\n  I compliment my friend and colleague from Arizona for, I believe, \ntruly making more significant reform. I think Senator Hatch's bill has \nsome good reform. I compliment him for it. The reforms in S. 735 will \nhelp expedite the procedures. There are time limits under the proposal \nnow before us from the Senator from Utah. Senator Kyl's amendment would \ngo much, much further. It would eliminate these hundreds of, in almost \nall cases--at least, in my State, frivolous petitions placed before the \nFederal courts, frivolous but yet they still take time. At 25 percent \nof the caseload, you are talking about a very significant amount of \ntime and energy and dollars that now are being expended by frivolous \nappeals because many prisoners become quite good at filing petitions, \nand there is no limit whatsoever on the number of petitions that they \ncan file.\n  So I compliment my colleague from Arizona for his leadership and for \ncoming up with very significant reform. I appreciate the fact that we \nhave outstanding scholars such as Judge Bork and others who have \nendorsed the reforms in this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to yield 7 minutes of additional \ntime to the junior Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, let me thank the Senator from Arizona for bringing this \nup. I think it is significant for all of us to realize that had it not \nbeen for the bombing in Oklahoma City, we would not be here today. We \nwould not even be having a discussion. There would not be a debate on \nhabeas reform. There would not be a counterterrorism bill.\n  Certainly, this contentious item of habeas that we have been trying \nto bring up, at least for the last 9 years that I know of, would not \neven be discussed in an open debate as it is today. So it is very \nsignificant for people to understand this is all precipitated by the \ntragedy that took place in April of this year in Oklahoma City.\n  On Monday of this week, we had a group of people that came up from \nOklahoma. Among others, they were Diane Leonard, whose husband, Don, a \nSecret Service agent, was killed in the bombing; we had Glenn Seidl, \nwho lost his wife, Kathy; Kay Ice, who lost her brother, Paul, a \nCustoms Agent; Mike Reyes, who lost his father and was injured himself; \nand Danny McKinney, Linda's husband. It goes on and on. There is not \ntime to name all of them. But they were here for one reason. That \nreason is that they wanted to be sure that we had the strongest \npossible habeas reform in this bill.\n  So when you stop and realize what has happened in Oklahoma, and what \nhappened in Oklahoma as I mentioned once before on this floor, but I \nthink it is worth bringing up again at this point because it gives you \nan insight into what the families of the victims in Oklahoma are \nthinking about because it is something that is contemporary right now--\na guy named Roger Dale Stafford is scheduled to be executed on July 1. \nI do not know whether he will be. It is hard to say. In the spring of \n1978, someone stopped to help him with his car. He was broken down in \nOklahoma. He murdered in cold blood a Sergeant Lorenz, and the \nsergeant's wife and small son, and drove 60 miles to Oklahoma City, and \ncommitted a great crime known as ``The Sirloin Stockade Crime,'' where \nhe rounded up six people and took them into the refrigerator, tied them \nup, and executed the six of them. He has been found guilty on all nine \ncounts and has nine death sentences. That was 17 years ago.\n  I might suggest that Roger Dale Stafford today is 100 pounds heavier \nthan he was 17 years ago. So I am sure he is eating well. He has been \nin the cell, probably living under better conditions than he was \nbefore, for the past 17 years.\n  I cannot help but think when anyone is considering a crime of the \nmagnitude of that which we had in Oklahoma City, Mr. President, that \nthey spend a lot of time thinking, ``What is the downside? What is the \nworst thing that can happen to me if I get caught and convicted? It is \ngoing to be that I will be executed. Wait a minute. The average time \nbetween conviction and execution in America is 9\\1/2\\ years. So I will \nbe there for 10 or 15 or 20 years watching color TV in an air-\nconditioned cell.''\n  That loses its deterrent value for those of us who are narrow enough \nin our thinking to believe that punishment is a deterrent to crime.\n  So without this, we have no way of delivering the message to other \nindividuals who might be considering such a heinous crime as that which \nwas committed in Oklahoma City.\n  So let me just say that I am here today on behalf of multitudes of \npeople in the State of Oklahoma who were killed in the brutal bombing, \nthe mass murder that took place last April in Oklahoma City.\n  The message they told us last Monday to deliver on the floor of this \nSenate, the loud and clear message, was yes, if this does not pass, we \nstill want to support the bill as it is right now and the habeas \nelement that is in the bill. That is fine. But the message was let us \nget the strongest possible habeas [[Page S7831]] reform that we can \nhave. That happens to be the John Kyl amendment.\n  So I am not here speaking on behalf of one U.S. Senator from the \nState of Oklahoma. I am speaking on behalf of the families of those \nindividuals who were killed in that very brutal act in April of this \nyear.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, does the Senator reserve the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Both Senators from Oklahoma have conducted themselves in an \nexemplary manner following the tragedy in their State in a way both to \nhelp the people of their State but also to try to do everything they \ncould to assist law enforcement officials to bring to justice the \nresponsible parties and to see to it that there are changes in the law \nthat perhaps can help prevent those kinds of things from happening in \nthe future and, in the cases where they cannot be prevented, that the \npeople are brought to justice.\n  I very much appreciate the support of both of the Senators from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time at \nthis point should anyone from the minority wish to speak.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me say while our colleague from Oklahoma is in the \nChamber that I, too, admire the way in which he and his senior \ncolleague have conducted themselves in the wake of such a horrible \ntragedy. I do not in any way question that the victims' survivors, \nfamilies of the victims in Oklahoma City, want what he states, and that \nis a change in the way habeas corpus works. They do not want any more \nStaffords. They cannot understand, nor can I, why Stafford is in jail \nfor 17 years after having filed apparently successful petitions to \ndelay his execution, and they want action.\n  But I would say that we would be on habeas corpus whether or not that \ngod-awful tragedy in Oklahoma had occurred. The Republican crime bill \nhas the habeas corpus petition in it. We are scheduled to take up the \nRepublican crime bill. We were scheduled to take up the Republican \ncrime bill before we left for our Easter recess. Then we were scheduled \nto take it up before we left for Memorial Day. Now we are scheduled to \ntake it up before the Fourth of July recess.\n  In that Republican crime bill is the reform of habeas corpus. In the \ncrime bill that I offered 2 years ago, 18 months ago, there was a \nreform of habeas corpus. So I just want to make it clear that the \nSenate's attention is not focused on habeas corpus at this moment \nbecause of what happened in Oklahoma and the counterterrorism bill. It \nis a convenient--and I mean that in a literal sense; I do not mean that \nin a disparaging way--it is a convenient vehicle to move up the debate \non this issue, but the debate was necessary and inevitable.\n  Let me point out there are three sort of teams in this debate. One \nteam says keep habeas corpus the way it is; we do not want any changes \nin habeas corpus. I got a bite out of that apple over the last couple \nyears because every time I would offer amendments on habeas corpus I \nwould read in the editorial page of the New York Times about how \nSenator Biden is emasculating habeas corpus, and what a terrible thing \nhe is doing, and the compromises Senator Biden is working out are--and \nit went on and on. Every liberal newspaper in America pointed out that \nwanting to change habeas corpus from the way it is to make sure that \nthe Staffords of the world are executed----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Just for a moment, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me clarify. I used the words ``at this level.'' I do \nnot believe we would be having the debate at this level if it had not \nbeen for the fact it did not happen.\n  I might also observe that the same attorney, who is a very capable \nand competent attorney in Oklahoma, Steven Jones, the one who so \nsuccessfully got the delays in the Stafford case, is the same attorney \nthat is handling Timothy McVeigh's case here, too.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  But there are basically three points of view on this floor in a broad \nsense. One is, do we maintain the status quo on habeas corpus? That is \nmade up of half a dozen to a dozen Members on my side and one or two \nMembers on the Republican side. And they do not want to see any change \nin habeas.\n  There is a second school of thought in a broad sense represented by \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, who is a capable and competent \nlawyer in his own right and knows this area well, as he demonstrated by \nhis presentation. And that is to say, in effect, as I read what he says \nbut what others have said as well, that State courts are fully \ncompetent to determine whether or not somebody's constitutional rights \nhave been violated. And that is a respected, understood, and clearly \narticulated school of thought that has existed for some time and has \nbeen in a very articulate manner stated here today.\n  There is a third school on this floor that says status quo is bad. We \ndo not want habeas corpus to continue as it statutorily has and has \nbeen interpreted by the courts over the last couple decades. We want it \nchanged.\n  Now, we differ. There are limits to that third group, and they range \nsomewhere between Senator Specter and probably me. And Senator Specter \nand I have been for years debating this issue, agreeing and \ndisagreeing, but we are into that school that says, wait a minute, do \nnot take the Federal courts totally out of this or, in effect, take \nthem totally out of it but drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many times they are \nable to file one and what constitutes a successive petition.\n  Now, I am certain that the Senator from Oklahoma was right when he \nticked off the names of the families of the victims and said they want \naction. I would respectfully suggest that it is unlikely that they know \nthe difference between a successive petition based upon probable \ninnocence versus clear and convincing evidence. Most lawyers on this \nfloor do not know the difference. Most lawyers who practice law do not \nknow the difference; 85 percent of the highest paid lawyers in America, \nif you brought them in and sat them down in these chairs and asked them \nto define what a successive petition is, could not do it, could not do \nit. I am talking about the thousand-dollar-an-hour guys. They could not \ndo it.\n  Now, I do not mean that to malign the legal profession. They do not \nhandle these cases. Death penalty cases, habeas cases are complicated. \nJust like I could not, if I were back in the practice of law, explain \nto you a complicated antitrust provision. I did not practice antitrust \nlaw.\n  So with all due respect, what I am proposing and will propose --and \nmy opposition to the Kyl amendment is just as likely to be acceptable \nto those folks in Oklahoma as anyone else's because the effect of what \nI wish to see happen--and I think a majority in here--is to make sure \nthat we are no longer in a situation where this fellow Stafford could \nbe gaining weight in an air-conditioned cell after having filed 17 \npetitions.\n  If we adopt the amendment that I am going to offer after this \namendment, Stafford would be dead. No more Staffords. There is no legal \nway in which anyone could hang around, after having been convicted of a \ncapital offense, for 17 years, let alone 7 years, because there are \nstrict time limits and strict circumstances under which a second \npetition could be filed.\n  Now, one of the problems here is that we confuse all crimes with \napples and oranges. We hear about delay all the time, and it is true, \nwith all due respect, even the Kyl amendment will not fundamentally \nchange the delay. If you take a look at where the delay occurs--and \njust pick this one case that we talk about--and I will get the second \ngraph, if I can, about the length of delay in State courts versus \nFederal--the case often cited is this Guerra case, to find out how long \nthis fellow, after having been convicted, languished in, at the expense \nof the taxpayers, a prison avoiding the inevitable.\n  Of the delays that took place, only--still, there are delays--24 \npercent of them were because of what the Federal courts did. And 76 \npercent, or 9 years 2 months' worth of delays had nothing to do with \nthe Federal courts. They were all in the State court in the State of \nTexas. [[Page S7832]] \n  Leave that graph up for another moment, please. I want to make sure \neverybody understands. The State of Texas, under State court and State \nlaw, provided for 9 years 2 months' worth of delay.\n  The Federal courts, having Federal habeas available, did, in fact, \nadd to the delay, 2 years and 10 months. But let us eliminate, as my \nfriend from Arizona wishes to do, in effect, the ability of the Federal \ncourts to get into the game. There still would have been a 9-year-2-\nmonth delay in the execution of a man who was convicted and should have \nbeen put to death. The point is, the end result of all this was he \nended up with a granting of habeas in the end. The point is, it was 9 \nyears 2 months in the State court.\n  In the State of California, we heard a lot of talk about how Federal \nhabeas corpus causes all these delays. The delays in execution of the \ndeath penalty, much of the responsibility is in the State courts. The \nCalifornia experience: California's Supreme Court has on its docket \nfour capital cases that have been fully briefed for over 7 years, but \nthe State court has not even heard the argument yet. It has nothing to \ndo with the Federal courts. You have four cases, as of a month ago, \nwhen this chart was made up for a hearing. Maybe something has happened \nin the last month, but as of a month ago, there were four capital cases \nin the California Supreme Court where the petitioners seeking redress \nfiled their briefs 7 years ago, and the State court has not even acted \nyet. Translated, that means 7 years living off the taxpayers in an air-\nconditioned cell because the California State Supreme Court has not \neven looked at the briefs or, if they looked at them, have not told \nanybody they looked at them.\n  The California Supreme Court has taken more than 8 years to decide 24 \nof the cases in which it affirmed the death penalty.\n  One State habeas petition has been pending for 4\\1/2\\ years and \nanother has been pending for 6 years. This is not even getting to the \nFederal court.\n  The reason I cite this is the distinguished former Member of Congress \nand attorney general of the State of California, Mr. Lungren, came \nbefore our committee and said, ``The Federal courts should work like \nthe State courts work. My State of California really knows what it is \ndoing.'' Look at what the State of California knows.\n  I understand the anger. I feel angry and aggrieved as an American \ncitizen that convicted killers are in California sitting in the jails \nfor 7 and 8 years because the court has not even gotten around to \nlistening to what they have to say. You cannot put them to death, \nbecause they filed a petition but they have not gotten around to \nlooking at the petition.\n  What are we doing, though, when we decide that we are angry about \nthat? We are saying the answer is get the Federal Government out of \nthis, the Federal courts out of this. That does not solve the problem, \nbut it creates another problem. The problem it creates when there is no \nFederal habeas corpus is bad decisions. Bad decisions made by State \ncourts allow people who deserve another trial to not get it. Their \nconstitutional rights are violated. A significant number of the habeas \ncorpus petitions that are filed are granted.\n  I admit I cannot change the State of California. I have no authority \nas a Federal official to tell the State of California how they should \nlook at their petitions. But I can do one thing. When it gets to the \nbottom here and they finally act, under the proposal I want, they get \none chance to get into Federal court, to say the State court judges did \nnot know what they were doing on the Constitution.\n  Keep in mind now, what I am proposing means when all this is done, \nwithin 6 months, the person in jail has to file a petition in Federal \ncourt. If they do not, they are out of luck, and they can only file a \nsecond petition under the same ground rules that my friends from the \nRepublican Party, that Senator Specter and Senator Hatch's bill says, \nwhere we differ, which I will debate later, where we differ, Senators \nSpecter, Hatch and Biden, is on what they are allowed to look at once \nthey get that petition in front of them. I will speak to that later.\n  But look, I really think, to quote my old friend Sid Balick again, \n``You gotta keep your eye on the ball here.'' The vast majority of us \nin this body want to and have been trying for years to change the old \nsystem to limit the time in which a petition can be filed and to limit \nthe number of petitions that can be filed. So essentially you get one \nbite out of the apple.\n  What my friend from Arizona would do would deny that one bite. I ask \nyou, what damage is done to the Nation allowing a person who, after the \nfact, learns that perjured testimony was used against him; after the \nfact, learns that information was made available to the prosecution \nwhich went to his innocence that was never made known to him; after the \nfact, after the fact, after the trial, after the appeals?\n  If you have to file it within 6 months, I do not know how much \nadditional weight old Stafford would have gained in 6 months, but it \nwould not have been 100 pounds. What is the alternative? The \nalternative, for example, in this Guerra case was when they finally got \ndown to it, they granted his appeal. They said, ``Wait a minute, you \ndid not get it right at the trial.''\n  But I, with the greatest amount of respect, suggest that although I \nunderstand the motivation, it will not speed up the process. All it \nwill do is enhance the likelihood that a person whose constitutional \nrights have been denied--and those constitutional rights usually relate \nto whether they are innocent or guilty--whether they have had a chance \nto make their case.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment would bar a prisoner even from being able to \nfile a habeas petition if the State court system has in place what are \ndetermined to be adequate and effective procedures to test the legality \nof the prisoner's detention.\n  This amendment makes clear that the State court need not have gotten \nthe result right in a particular case and, in fact, it need not even \nhave applied its system fairly in a particular case. All it says is \nthey have to have had a process, and if they had a process, even though \nit may not have been applied fairly in a particular case, even though \nit may not have gotten the result right on a constitutional basis, the \nFederal court cannot look at it.\n  Everyone agrees that there is a need to end the delays in the system. \nIt just does not work right now. But I also think everyone agrees that \nthere should be a fair process and one that does not execute innocent \npeople.\n  We know most prosecutors and law enforcement officers are honorable. \nMost cases proceed fairly, and we can have confidence in the result. \nUnder my approach, after the first petition, most of that will be made \nclear. They will be rejected and they will be put to death. And I \nsupport the death penalty. The Biden crime bill is the only reason why, \nif McVeigh is convicted in Oklahoma, he would be put to death. I wrote \nthe law. If he is tried in Federal court without that law having been \npassed, he could not be put to death. I support the death penalty. But \nI do not support a reasonable ability for a person, if they have a \nstrong case, to suggest they did not get a fair trial, to be able to \nhave one bite out of the apple to determine in Federal court whether \nthat was true.\n  We all know that occasionally prosecutors or cops act in bad faith, \nas Senators do, as doctors do, as lawyers do, as housewives do. Every \none of our professions, every one of them, has some bad apples. So, \noccasionally, prosecutors or cops act in bad faith and there are cases \nwhich have demonstrated that. As we all know, our judicial system will \nmake honest mistakes and has done so.\n  The recent case of Kirk Bloodworth is one example. Bloodworth was \nconvicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young \ngirl. After a new trial, he was again convicted and sentenced to life \nimprisonment. Subsequent DNA testing confirmed his innocence. \nBloodworth lost 9 years of his life because of the error in our legal \nsystem. Habeas corpus has existed to correct just such errors, and to \nensure that there will never be another Leo Frank, another innocent \nperson who has been executed.\n  You do not have to have 17-year delays to ensure that. You do not \nhave to have any delay to ensure that. But what you have to have is the \nability of a Federal court, on one occasion, to look at the facts in \nthe petition and [[Page S7833]] make a judgment as to whether or not a \nnew trial is warranted.\n  So I respectfully suggest that the debate between the Senator from \nArizona and me is not about maintaining the status quo; it is about how \nwe change the status quo. I respect the Senator's intelligence and \nmotivation greatly. But I also respectfully suggest that his approach, \nA, does not solve the real problem--State court delay--and, B, takes \naway the one last shot, as a practical matter, that one has to get \nbefore a Federal court.\n  Now, I will acknowledge--and I suspect he would agree--that 75 years \nago Federal review was probably needed much more than it is today, \nbecause the competence of State court justices was, in some cases, de \nminimis. And the prejudice that existed in some States--my own \nincluded--was real and palpable, making it very difficult for some \npeople to get a fair trial and get their constitutional rights \nguaranteed. I acknowledge that. That is why the Leo Frank case \ngenerated a change in statutory habeas corpus. He was a Jew and he was \nput to death in large part because he was a Jew. Facts were overlooked, \nand a decade later it became clear from witnesses that he did not \ncommit the crime.\n  Most States do not operate that way anymore. I will pick a State so \nthat I am not being parochial and bragging about my State court system, \nand I will not brag about the Arizona State court system, which is very \ngood. I know several of their State supreme court justices and State \ncourt judges. They are first rate. I will pick a State. I would rank \nthe New York State court of appeals, their highest court, over the last \n50 years, up against any Federal district court or Federal circuit \ncourt of appeals in the Nation. But I cannot say that for probably 20 \nStates that I will not name, because it would be a violation of Senate \nrules, and because I would be maligning the justices of other States. \nBut I will say, as Barry Goldwater once said, ``In your heart, you know \nI am right.'' In your heart, you know there are certain States you \nwould just as soon not be tried in for a capital offense as other \nStates.\n  So what this does--although I acknowledge that State courts get it \nright the vast majority of the times, I will put this in the negative--\nwhat damage is done by the proposal of time limits built into the \nproposal I am making and that are made, I might add, in the underlying \nbill, that say you have to file a petition within a certain amount of \ntime and there is a limited circumstance under which you can file a \nsecond petition.\n  So for those reasons, and others which I will not take the time to \nspeak to, I am going to oppose the amendment of my distinguished friend \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. President, Is any time left in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 12 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I was not clear, the Senator from Arizona \nhas 12 minutes. The Senator from Delaware has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I reserve my 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will yield myself 6 minutes of my remaining \ntime. I would like to respond to the comments of the Senator from \nDelaware. They were well put and thoughtful, and I think they \ncontribute to the debate. I am going to consider the arguments that he \nmade, with the primary arguments in reverse order, if I might.\n  The last argument he made essentially was what happens when, after \nthe fact, the defendant finds something out that might enable him to \nwin his freedom? That, of course, is the rationale for the writ of \nhabeas corpus. Of course, the answer is, if you are a Federal court \nprisoner, you have the opportunity to file a writ of habeas corpus in \nthe Federal courts. If you are a State court prisoner, you have the \nright to file a habeas corpus petition in the State courts. So that is \nyour remedy for something that happens after the fact.\n  The Senator from Delaware said it must be a fair process, and indeed \nit must be. Under my amendment, one of the things that can be \ncontested, and could be contested in Federal court, is that the remedy \nof the State is not adequate or fair. Finally, with regard to this last \npoint, the Senator from Delaware said he will be proposing an amendment \nthat at least gives the prisoner in the State court system one shot in \nthe Federal courts and primarily base that argument on the notion that \nwhile great strides have been made in State courts' competence over the \nyears, there may still be some situations where the State court would \nnot be as competent as the Federal court.\n  I would like to respond to this in a couple of ways, Mr. President. \nFirst of all, we do have one shot in the Federal system under my \namendment. It is directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. That right exists \ntoday, and it could not be taken away in our amendment, and we do not \ndo that, of course. So if a State court prisoner believes that, despite \nall of the hearings he has gotten in the State court system, he still \nhas not gotten a fair shake, and that he has really two things that he \ncan claim--first, the State court system is not fair, and secondly, he \ncan go to the U.S. Supreme Court and make his final point there.\n  Let me read something that Justice Powell wrote not too long ago that \nI think goes to this point:\n  He said this nearly 20 years ago:\n\n       We are unwilling to assume that there now exists a general \n     lack of appropriate sensitivity to constitutional rights in \n     the trial and appellate courts of the several States. State \n     courts, like Federal courts, have a constitutional obligation \n     to safeguard personal liberties and to uphold Federal laws.\n\n  That was in the case of Stone versus Powell, in 1976.\n  Later, speaking to the American Bar Association, Justice Powell said:\n\n       Another cause of overload in the Federal court system is \n     conferring Federal habeas corpus jurisdiction to review State \n     court criminal convictions. Repetitive recourse is \n     commonplace. I know of no other system of justice structured \n     in a way that assures no end to the litigation of a criminal \n     conviction. Our practice in this respect is viewed with \n     disbelief by lawyers and judges in other countries.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think that particular issue is disposed of by, \namong other things, the words of Justice Powell.\n  A second point the Senator from Delaware said is that most of the \ndelay is in State courts. He is correct, although the chart he has \nthere represents one case. He has about 25 or 24 percent of the delay \nin the Federal courts, and the rest in the State court. Actually, there \nis a better figure than that, and the figure is about 40 percent in the \nFederal courts, 60 percent in the trial courts.\n  This is from the Powell committee report, and it talked about overdue \nprocess. The Powell committee report on page 27 notes ``Federal habeas \ncorpus made up 40 percent of the total delay from sentence to \nexecution, in a sample of 50 cases.'' That is 50 cases as opposed to \none case.\n  The point of the matter is the Senator from Delaware is correct in \nnoting that most of the delay would be State courts. I submit, however, \nthat that is due to several factors. I am not sure the statistics fail \nto account for the fact that most of the cases are in State court. As a \nmatter of fact, there are not that many in the Federal court.\n  Say it is between 25 and 40 percent. At least under my amendment we \nare dealing with 40 percent of the problem. That is not insignificant. \nOr, the least, taking the number of the Senator from Delaware, 25 \npercent of the problem.\n  Whereas the Senator from Delaware would simply make it more difficult \nto get into Federal court if you are a State court prisoner, we say you \ncannot. As Federal legislators, what we can do something about, the \nFederal court, we do something. We say you cannot go there. It is up to \nthe States to deal with the rest of the problem which is before them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware made a point with \nrespect to Senator Inhofe's presentation, and it was a valid point. But \nI think it makes a point too far, or one point too much.\n  The Senator from Delaware said it is doubtful that Senator Inhofe's \nconstituents understand the difference between the Hatch and Kyl \namendment, and mentions a lot of lawyers could not identify the \ndifference. He is correct. I do not believe that makes the case.\n  It is true we have to be careful about what we do here. It is also \ntrue that [[Page S7834]] while the common citizen may not understand \nthe technicalities, the legalities, even the word habeas corpus coming \nfrom Latin, the common citizen does understand when something is \nbroken. And the Senator from Delaware made an eloquent case for the \nproposition that something is drastically broken when people can stay \non death row as long as they do.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma made the same point, 16 or 17 years, with \nthe average being over 9 years. The system is drastically broken. It \ndoes not take a lawyer to figure that out.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude at this point that the ordinary man \nmay not understand all of the technicalities we are talking about, but \nhe knows something is broken here. The fix in my case is quite simple. \nFederal prisoners go to Federal court, State prisoners go to State \ncourt with an ultimate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but State \nprisoners do not get the extra bites of the apple in the Federal court. \nIt is a simple solution.\n  The solution in the bill and the solution of the Senator from \nDelaware is much more complex. We will impose some limitations on how \nyou get into the Federal court. That does not stop you from getting in \nthe Federal court. So if you want to solve between 25 and 40 percent of \nthe problem, voting for the Kyl amendment will definitely do that.\n  It has been held as constitutional. It is supported by Judge Bork and \nby many others. I submit it would be a good addition to this bill. I am \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Delaware needs \nhis remaining 4 minutes. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I shall be brief, holding to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be granted 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona. At the outset, I acknowledge his \nexperience in the field. But it is my view that Federal review of State \ncriminal convictions, especially in capital cases, is very, very \nimportant in order to guarantee appropriate constitutional safeguards.\n  I believe the death penalty is an effective deterrent against crimes \nof violence. I spoke earlier about my own experience as a district \nattorney of Philadelphia, and before that as an assistant district \nattorney where I tried murder cases. My thought is that it discourages \nmany professional robbers and burglars from carrying weapons because of \nconcern that a killing might result and they would face the possibility \nof first-degree murder and the death penalty.\n  I believe that it is very, very important, Mr. President, if we are \nto retain the death penalty, we have to use it very, very carefully.\n  There are some 37 States which favor the death penalty. Thirteen \njurisdictions in the United States oppose it. It took many years to \nbring back the death penalty on the Federal level, having achieved that \nonly last year.\n  The news from South Africa is they have abolished the death penalty. \nThe death penalty is not in use in many jurisdictions, in many nations. \nI think it is very, very important to retain the death penalty as an \neffective weapon. Therefore we have to use it very, very carefully.\n  I have objections to the pending amendment both on constitutional \ngrounds and on public policy grounds. I am well away of the contention \nthat there is constitutional support to it. Frankly, I doubt that the \nconstitutional support would stand up.\n  When we are dealing with the question of jurisdiction of the Federal \ncourts to entertain questions on Federal issues, on constitutional \nissues, I believe it is necessary that the Federal courts retain that \njurisdiction as a constitutional matter.\n  I am aware of ex parte McCardle and aware of the distinctions on \nhabeas corpus where there is supposedly an adequate State habeas corpus \nremedy. When someone comes into the Federal courts on habeas corpus, \nespecially in a capital case, and makes an assertion of denial of \nactual rights on privilege against self-incrimination or coerced \nconfession or ineffective counsel or absence of counsel or search and \nseizure issues, I believe it is necessary as a constitutional matter \nthat the Federal courts retain that kind of jurisdiction.\n  In our Judiciary Committee hearings, this is a question which I \nfrequently ask the nominees as to whether they believe the Congress has \nthe authority to take away jurisdiction on constitutional issues from \nthe Federal courts. It is too lengthy a subject to discuss at any \nlength today.\n  Beyond the constitutional issue is a matter of public policy. I think \nit is very important to have the kind of detached, objective review \nthat the Federal courts give.\n  In many of our States we have elected judges. I think that is, in \nsome circumstances, perhaps in many circumstances, an impediment to the \nkind of review we have by judges who have life tenure.\n  I recall reading for the first time in law school the case of Brown \nversus Mississippi, 1936, a decision by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates saying that the due process clause which limited State action \nwarranted the Supreme Court of the United States to reverse a \nconviction in a State court in a capital case. Without reciting the \ncase of Brown versus Mississippi and the horrendous facts there, it was \nnot until 1936 that the Supreme Court of this country intervened in a \nState criminal matter to say that it violated the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Federal courts have been providing the safeguards on \nconstitutional rights significantly through Federal habeas corpus. I \nbelieve that has to be maintained. In urging the adoption of the \nSpecter-Hatch amendment, our amendment really goes to the issue of \ncurtailing the time.\n  Some might say that it is a restriction on defendant's rights. I \nthink, actually, it is not, for reasons I stated earlier, on the \nchallenge to cruel and barbarous treatment, keeping someone on death \nrow for a protracted period of time.\n  The international court I referred to earlier this morning, refused \nan extradition from England to Virginia, because Virginia kept \nprisoners on death row for 6 to 8 years, which was deemed a violation \nof cruel and barbarous treatment.\n  I think, Mr. President, on constitutional grounds and on public \npolicy grounds we ought not to restrict the jurisdictions of the \nFederal courts.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He makes some good points that I would like to respond \nto, but at this point I would like to ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Mississippi be allotted the same amount of time that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania spoke on, so that I may utilize the remaining \namount of my time to close the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for letting me have this time and for his effort on this \namendment. I certainly am pleased to support it because I think it \nreally does what needs to be done in this area of habeas corpus, \nbecause it provides that when a State--State--provides adequate and \neffective remedies for considering prisoners' claims, there is simply \nno basis for allowing additional rounds of litigation on the same \nclaims in the lower Federal courts.\n  I am not a constitutional expert. But let me just read what Judge \nRobert Bork has said about this particular amendment. He says:\n\n       [This] . . . amendment to the anti-terrorism bill to stop \n     the abuse of federal collateral remedies is an excellent and \n     much-needed reform. . . . There is no doubt about the \n     constitutionality of the provision you propose. . . . Nor is \n     there any doubt about the need for [the] amendment. . . . \n     [The] amendment is a sorely needed reform to a situation that \n     is now out of hand.\n\n  Again, I am not a constitutional expert and I know when we have bills \nlike this the lawyers descend on the floor and start arguing. There are \nvery good merits on both sides. But let me just say what I hear from \nthe American people when I go to my State and other \n[[Page S7835]] States. They think there is horrible abuse in this area. \nThey think these endless appeals are totally out of control and that it \nshould be cut back and cut back significantly.\n  I want to emphasize, this does still allow for the Supreme Court to \nbe involved. But how many rounds are we going to have? The American \npeople understand how this system is being abused. That is what is so \napplicable in this case. If we have a process whereby the people who \nwere involved in the bombing in Oklahoma City are found, apprehended, \nindicted, convicted and sentenced, if you will, perhaps to death, and \nthen we go through a long, protracted process of appeals through the \nState courts, appeals through the Federal courts, the American people \nare going to be even more horrified at our judicial system in America.\n  They are looking now at the Simpson trial and wondering what have we \nwrought? This is one small step in the right direction.\n  Under current law, habeas corpus claims that are rejected after \nthorough consideration in the State courts are readjudicated in the \nlower Federal courts. It is duplicative review in the Federal courts \nand it is needless and time consuming. The habeas corpus provision in \nS. 735 reduces this redundancy, but it does not eliminate it.\n  I commend the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, for the good work he \nhas been doing in this area for years. Finally he has brought this \nissue almost to a climax. But I think now Senator Kyl will go one step \nfurther and that will really help in dealing with this problem of \nabuse, delay, and repetitive litigation in the lower courts, the State \ncourts, and the Federal courts.\n  Under current law, criminal defendants in the State present their \nclaims at their trials, in State court appeals, in State collateral \nproceedings, and in applications for review by State supreme courts and \nthen by the U.S. Supreme Court. After exhausting these State remedies, \nprisoners can then go back and initiate additional rounds of litigation \nthrough the habeas corpus proceedings in the lower Federal courts, \npresenting the same claims that have already been raised and decided in \nState court review. As a result of this redundant review, the criminal \njustice system in the United States really now is plagued with problems \nof delay and abuse.\n  We talked about, I guess it was, cruel and inhuman punishment in the \npast. The Supreme Court addressed the question of people staying in \njails awaiting final conclusion of their trials or convictions, and \nthat was ruled as being wrong. What about the fact that many of them \nnow sit on death row for years and years with access to libraries and \ncomputers and everything they could possibly need so they continue to \ndrag out this process? There has to be an end to it.\n  The habeas corpus provisions in the bill, S. 735, do moderate the \nredundancy of the current situation through the time limits on Federal \nhabeas filings, stricter limits on the repetitive habeas filings, and \nmore deferential standards of review. But they do not address the \nunderlying problem of pointless readjudication in the lower Federal \ncourts. The Kyl amendment addresses the root cause of the existing \nproblems of delay and abuse by eliminating these habeas corpus reviews \nof the State judgments.\n  I think we have seen where this has been changed in the District of \nColumbia. That has worked quite well. The experience here in DC \ndemonstrates that the rights of defendants can effectively be protected \nwithout the redundancy of these habeas corpus reviews in the lower \nFederal courts. This amendment, as I understand it, would extend those \nbenefits to all the other States.\n  Punishment is intended to be a deterrent to heinous crime. Under the \npresent system, however, many killers do not fear the punishment \nbecause they know of the delays that will be involved. The Kyl \namendment addresses this problem, and I commend him for his efforts. I \ncertainly support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Let me respond quickly to my friend's comment in response to what I \nhad said.\n  First of all, he said this is about winning freedom. This is not \nabout winning freedom. Habeas corpus is granted--no freedom. It means a \nnew trial.\n  He points out very forthrightly that he attempts to prevent folks \nfrom going to Federal court except as it relates to being able to go to \nthe Supreme Court. It is not the Supreme Court's job to take a detailed \nlook at every State court conviction. It is for the Supreme Court to \ndecide weighty issues of Federal constitutional law. That is why we \nhave Federal courts and that is why my committee spends so much time, a \nsignificant portion of it, considering the nomination of Federal \njudges. Our system depends on Federal courts, all the Federal courts, \nbeing the safeguarders of Federal law.\n  Let us just put this in very practical terms. Let us assume he is \nright, the State courts are fully capable and do not need any Federal \nreview. What you end up with is as many as 50 different interpretations \nof the Federal Constitution; 50 different ways in which 50 different \nStates could interpret whether or not a constitutional right has been \ndenied or not denied. Just from a very practical standpoint that is not \ngood policy. Whereas, when you have the appeal to the Federal court \nsystem, that becomes the law, the law of the land governing all 50 \nStates.\n  I also point out that the State--as the Senator said: Look, we allow \nfolks who are convicted in State court to go to State courts for their \nappeal and folks convicted in Federal court to go to the Federal courts \nfor their habeas corpus petitions. The problem is that Federal court \njudges are trained in their experiences in interpreting the Federal \nConstitution. State courts hardly deal with the Federal Constitution. \nThey deal with the State constitutions. We should have the people who \nare trained and experienced in interpreting the Federal law relative to \nthe Federal Constitution being able to determine whether there has been \na violation of that Federal law or, in this case, the Federal \nConstitution.\n  Last, Justice Powell, I am confident--and I am willing to bet; you \nare not allowed to bet on the floor--but figuratively speaking, I would \nbe willing to bet him dinner at any restaurant in America that Justice \nPowell does not support his amendment. I can say that with certainty \nbecause Justice Powell's commission came forward with an explicit \nguarantee that there would be access to Federal courts; an explicit \nguarantee. They made it absolutely clear that it is essential there be \naccess to the Federal courts. I do not doubt that Judge Bork would \nsupport this, I do not doubt that at all. In fact, I am certain he \nwould and we should all keep that in mind.\n  So I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 6 minutes. The \nSenator from Delaware has 1 minute 1 second.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask both sides to allow me to have a few \nminutes just to make--I ask unanimous consent I be given a few minutes \njust to make some short comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate and I really \nwant to compliment the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I think this \nhas been one of the most spirited parts of this whole debate on the \nhabeas corpus provisions of the bill. I deeply appreciate, of course, \nthe frustration some have with the Federal court's micromanagement of \nState court decisions. Indeed, I think the abuses of Federal habeas \ncorpus practice fuel the desire to remove the Federal courts altogether \nfrom the review process. The Kyl amendment would effectively end \nFederal habeas review of State convictions where the State already has \npostconviction collateral review. And I can appreciate my colleague's \nwillingness to address the gross abuse that currently occurs under our \nFederal habeas process. We are all sick of it. Something has to be \ndone.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment would return habeas review to its original \nmoorings, as a corrective process where no other real remedy exists. \nAnd it deserves consideration. [[Page S7836]] \n  In the early history of this country, habeas review was not available \nat common law to review by any other court a conviction of a felony \nentered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The function of the writ \nwas to free people who had been imprisoned illegally. Let us understand \nwhat I am saying. The constitutional great writ is preconviction.\n  That is the Constitution writ. The writ of habeas corpus we are \ntalking about is postconviction, and it is a statutory writ that can be \nchanged readily by the Congress of the United States. Senator Kyl has \ncogently pointed out that that is exactly what it is. The writ is \nguaranteed against suspension by the Constitution. The earlier great \nwrit was well understood to refer to habeas for Federal prisoners, only \nFederal prisoners. The Kyl amendment appreciates the history of the \nwrit and attempts to return it to its original understanding. He has \nargued that nobly and well.\n  I think the proposal of the Senator from Arizona deserves close \nscrutiny, and he should be complimented for his efforts to address this \ndifficult problem. I have to say that I believe there needs to be \npostconviction habeas corpus review. But I also believe that the \nSenator makes a very strong point because, as a lot of people do not \nknow, the District of Columbia has done away with postconviction habeas \ncorpus review, collateral review. And it has worked very well in the \nDistrict of Columbia. All the Senator is saying perhaps is that we \nshould consider doing that for the country as a whole.\n  So I just wanted to make these few short comments. I have to say that \nI compliment my friend and colleague from Arizona for his intelligence \non this issue, and for the very, very spirited debate that we have had \nhere on this. I want to express that for all concerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to use the remainder of my time \nand close the debate, if there are no others who wish to speak.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment the Senator from \nDelaware who has conducted a very intelligent and thoughtful debate. I \nappreciate that. I very much appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Utah just now. It is only because of his tenacity that this issue \nis before us. As he said, he has been fighting this issue for years to \ntry to bring some reform to the Senate and was able to do that finally \nin the bill that he brought to the Senate floor. I appreciate very much \nhis efforts.\n  I also appreciate the comments he just made. He is exactly correct in \ndescribing my amendment as an attempt to return the habeas petition to \nits original meaning. There is a statutory postconviction remedy, as he \npoints out. I believe he is very familiar, as a matter of fact, with \nCongress' law of 25 years ago under which the District of Columbia uses \na purely quasi-State court system for the review of its writs and does \nnot allow prisoners to go into the Federal system, a system which has \nworked very well and which we have been invited to consider as a result \nby Federal judges who have written on the subject.\n  Let me also address briefly two points, one made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and one by the Senator from Delaware. The Senator from \nPennsylvania questioned the constitutionality of what we are doing \nhere. I understand the point he was making. But I do not think that the \nconstitutionality of what we are proposing here is in doubt. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has upheld this procedure unanimously in a 1977 opinion, \nSwain versus Pressley. The opinion was written by Justice Stevens. That \nwas--to use the phrase--``bandied about'' a fairly liberal court in \n1977. Subsequently, the Federal courts have consistently held that the \nremedy provided in this District of Columbia court system, which does \nnot permit a Federal writ of habeas corpus, is adequate and effective \nto test the legality of detention.\n  Among the cases are, for example, Garris versus Lindsay in 1986, a \nD.C. Circuit Court case, and Saleh versus Braxton, a District of \nColumbia District Court case in 1992. So consistently the courts have \nupheld, and I also cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the \nconstitutionality, as well.\n  The Senator from Delaware argued finally that there could be 50 \ndifferent interpretations of the constitutional law, if the State court \nprisoners are relegated only to a State court habeas remedy. With all \ndue respect, I do not think that is correct because, as we all know, \nthose of us who are constitutional lawyers anyway, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt precedents must be followed when State supreme courts--or as in \nNew York's case, it is called the court of appeals, or the circuit \ncourts--are adjudicating constitutional questions, they must follow \nU.S. Supreme Court precedents.\n  Therefore, it is not possible for there to be 50 different \ninterpretations of Federal law by State supreme courts unless those \ncourts are dealing in bad faith, and I am sure that no one is \nsuggesting that is the case. It has always been the case that under our \nConstitution, the Framers contemplated that State courts would be \nmaking these interpretations. As a matter of fact, there is an \ninteresting book by Curt Sneideker who writes to this point. He said \nthat in our judicial system it has been understood from the very \nbeginning that State courts could pass on Federal questions. And, by \nthe way, he cites Federalist Papers No. 82 for that proposition. \nIndeed, the Constitution itself expressly directs them to do so in \narticle VI, clause 2.\n  So very clearly, the State courts have always been thought of as a \nplace where Federal constitutional issues could be resolved. As I noted \nearlier, Justice Powell has made a very convincing case, and he is not \nthe only one. But he specifically has made a convincing case that the \nState courts have the competence to rule on these issues.\n  Mr. President, just in summary, again I compliment both managers of \nthis bill for the very intelligent way in which they have approached \nthis issue. I appreciate the opportunity to debate my amendment in this \nway, and I will simply say that in summary, what I am trying to do with \nmy amendment is to ensure that there is an adequate remedy for all \nhabeas petitions for both Federal and State court prisoners, Federal \nprisoners in the Federal system, State court prisoners in the State \ncourt system, but to limit State court systems to the State just as \nFederal writs are limited to the Federal system.\n  The only exception which we could not take away, even if we tried--\nand, of course, we do not want to--even in the State court system, \nprisoners have the ability to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nultimate Federal court, to test the propriety of the final decision of \nthe State court, in most cases called the State supreme court. So there \nis adequate ability to protect the constitutional rights of both State \nand Federal prisoners.\n  My amendment simply helps to solve this problem of overburdened \nFederal courts by taking out of the Federal courts somewhere between 25 \nand 40 percent perhaps of the cases that are currently adjudicated not \nonly in State courts but in a duplicative way in the Federal courts, as \nwell.\n  I urge that my colleagues support my amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute and 19 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my staff pointed out to me, as I sat down \nwhen I said we should keep that in mind, I said in jest that we should \nkeep that in mind, my reference was to Judge Bork. I believe Powell \ndoes not support this, the Powell Commission would not support this, \nand that Justice Bork would. We should keep in mind the distinction.\n  But I would also like to point out, as my staff pointed out to me, in \nWright versus West, the Supreme Court case decided a couple of years \nago, where the Bush administration sought to ask the Supreme Court to \nrule on the standard of full and fair, which is what Senator Kyl is \nproposing, Justice Rehnquist, from his home State of Arizona, refused \nto adopt the standard that Senator Kyl is proposing. He is certainly no \nliberal. He refused to adopt the standard and insisted that there be \naccess to the lower Federal courts. [[Page S7837]] \n  But I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me again compliment both managers of the \nbill. I think this has been a good debate. I reiterate my amendment \nsimply restricts the State court prisoners to the Start court as \nprisoners until they are able to go the to U.S. Supreme Court. I \nbelieve this will significantly reduce the number of duplicative \nappeals. That is what this is all about on the habeas corpus reform, to \nstrengthen the bill. In any event, I reiterate that this is a good bill \nthat we should all support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment both Senator Kyl and Senator \nBiden. Both have presented very interesting and good arguments. They \nboth deserve being listened to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the Kyl \namendment be at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, do we first have to ask for the yeas and \nnays?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \nsupporting S. 735, the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act. This \nlegislation contains a broad range of needed changes in law to enhance \nour country's ability to combat terrorism, both at home and from \nabroad. The managers of this bill have described its provisions in some \ndetail, so I will not repeat their comments. Briefly, however, this \nbill would increase penalties: for conspiracies involving explosives, \nfor terrorist conspiracies, for terrorist crimes, for transferring \nexplosives, for using explosives, and for other crimes related to \nterrorist acts.\n  The bill also contains habeas corpus reform to curb the abuse of \nhabeas corpus and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay \nand abuse in death penalty cases. The bill also includes provisions to \ncombat international terrorism, to remove aliens, to control \nfundraising for foreign terrorists, and procedural changes to \nstrengthen our counterterrorism laws. Among those strengthening laws \nare a requirement to use chemical tagging in plastic explosives, to \ncriminalize a threat to use a weapon of mass destruction, and to add \nconspiracy crime to certain terrorism offenses.\n  Finally, the bill authorized increased funding for Federal law \nenforcement agencies, providing $1.5 billion over 5 years for the FBI, \nDEA, assistant U.S. attorneys, the INS, and the U.S. Customs Service.\n  Mr. President, I would like to concentrate the remainder of my \ncomments of two provisions of mine that are included in this bill with \nthe assistance of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole. These two \nprovisions are the Terrorist Exclusion Act and the Law Enforcement and \nIntelligence Sources Protection Act, both of which I have introduced \nseparately this session of Congress.\n  Traditionally, Americans have thought of terrorism as primarily a \nEuropean, Middle Eastern, or Latin American problem. While Americans \nabroad or U.S. diplomatic facilities have been targets, Americans have \noften considered the United States itself largely immune from acts of \nterrorism. Two events have changed this sense of safety. The first was \nthe international terrorist attack of February 26, 1993, against the \nNew York World Trade Center, and the second was the shocking domestic \nterrorist attack this April 19 against the Federal building in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  I first introduced the Terrorist Exclusion Act in the House 2 years \nago, and this year I have reintroduced the legislation in the Senate \nwith Senator Brown as my original cosponsor. The Terrorist Exclusion \nAct will close a dangerous loophole in our visa laws which was opened \nup in the Immigration Reform Act of 1990. That bill eliminated then-\nexisting authority to deny a U.S. visa to a known member of a violent \nterrorist organization.\n  The new standards required knowledge that the individual had \npersonally been involved in a past terrorist act or was coming to the \nUnited States to conduct such an act. This provision will restore the \nprevious standard allowing denial of a U.S. visa for membership in a \nterrorist group.\n  The elimination of authority to exclude a foreigner from the United \nStates for mere membership in a terrorist group happened in the context \nof Congress' rewrite of the old McCarran-Walter's Act. The McCarran-\nWalter's Act contained a wide range of visa exclusions for ideological \nor associational reasons. But in narrowly refocusing all visa \nexclusions on personal acts, it perhaps inadvertently treated \nforeigners who join violent terrorist organizations no differently than \nif they had merely joined a political club, or fraternal order. This \nremoved a valuable tool for protecting American lives. In my view, and \nI am sure the view of the vast majority of Americans, there is a \ndifference.\n  I discovered this dangerous weakness in our visa laws in early 1993 \nduring my investigation of the State Department failures that allowed \nthe radical Egyptian cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, to travel to and \nreside in the United States since 1990. I undertook this investigation \nin my role as ranking Republican of the House International Operations \nSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over terrorism issues, a role I \nhave continued in the Senate as chair of the International Operations \nSubcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Sheikh Rahman is the spiritual leader of Egypt's terrorist \norganization, the Islamic Group. His followers have been convicted for \nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and the sheikh \nhimself is now on trial for his alleged role in planting and approving \na second wave of terrorist acts in the New York City area.\n  The significance of Sheikh Abdel Rahman is that he was clearly \nexcludable from the United States under the old pre-1990 law, but the \nlegal authority to exclude him ended with enactment of the Immigration \nReform Act that year. He was admitted to this country through an \namazing series of bureaucratic blunders.\n  But then, the 1990 law came into effect, and the State Department was \nforced to try to deport him on the grounds that he once bounced a check \nin Egypt and had more than one wife, rather than the fact that he was \nthe known spiritual leader of a violent terrorist organization. This \nwas before the World Trade Center bombing.\n  A high-ranking State Department official informed my staff during my \ninvestigation that if Sheikh Abdel Rahman had tried to enter after the \n1990 law went into affect, they would have had no legal authority to \nexclude him from the United States because they had no proof that he \nhad ever personally committed a terrorist act, despite the fact that \nhis followers were known to have been involved in the assassination of \nAnwar Sadat.\n  The urgency of passing this provision comes from the sad truth that \nevery day American lives continue to be put at risk out of deference to \nsome imagined first amendment rights of foreign terrorists. This is an \nextreme misinterpretation of our cherished Bill of Rights, which the \nFounders of our Nation intended to protect the liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  In my reading of the U.S. Constitution I see much about the \nprotection of the safety and welfare of Americans, but nothing about \nprotecting the rights of foreign terrorists to travel freely to the \nUnited States whenever they choose.\n  The second of my bills contained in S. 735 is the Law Enforcement and \nIntelligence Sources Protection Act. This legislation would \nsignificantly increase the ability of law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to share information with the State Department for the purpose \nof denying visas to known terrorists, drug traffickers, and others \ninvolved in international criminal activity.\n  This provision would permit denials of U.S. visas to be made without \na detailed written explanation for individuals who are excluded for law \nenforcement reasons, which current law requires. These denials could be \nmade [[Page S7838]] citing U.S. law generically, without further \nclarification or amplification. Individuals denied visas due to the \nsuspicion that they are intending to immigrate would still have to be \ninformed that this is the basis, to allow such an individual to compile \nadditional information that may change that determination.\n  Under a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act [INA], a \nprecise written justification, citing the specific provision of law, is \nrequired for every alien denied a U.S. visa. This requirement was \ninserted into the INA out of the belief that every non-American denied \na U.S. visa for any reason had the right to know the precise grounds \nunder which the visa was denied, even if it was for terrorist activity, \nnarcotics trafficking, or other illegal acts. This has impeded the \nwillingness of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to share with \nthe State Department the names of excludable aliens.\n  These agencies are logically concerned about impeding an \ninvestigation or revealing sources and methods if they submit a name of \na person they know to be a terrorist or criminal--but who we do not \nwant to know that we know about their activities--who then goes on the \nlookout list, is denied a visa, and then is informed in writing that he \nor she was denied a visa because of known drug trafficking activity. \nThat drug trafficker then will know that the DEA knows about his or her \nillegal activity and may be developing a criminal case. This \ninformation is something the United States would want to protect, until \nthe case against is completed and, hopefully, some law enforcement \naction is taken. At the same time, however, for the protection of the \nAmerican people we should also make this information available to the \nDepartment of State to keep the individual out of our country.\n  The key issue is that travel to the United States by noncitizens is a \nprivilege, not a constitutional right. There is no fundamental right \nfor extensive due process in visa decisions by our consular officers \noverseas. While I believe that our country should do what we can to be \nfair in our treatment of would-be visitors to the United States, in \ncases where providing information to an alien would harm our own \nnational security, complicate potential criminal cases or potentially \nreveal sources and methods of intelligence gathering, we should err on \nthe side of protecting Americans, not the convenience of foreign \nnationals.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate Senator Dole, Senator Hatch, and \nall of my other colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--who have been \ninstrumental in bringing this comprehensive counterterrorism bill to \nthe Senate floor for swift action. This is an example of our capacity \nto act quickly on a bipartisan basis and in cooperation with the \nadministration on critical issues. It is my hope that this bill is an \nexample of what we can accomplish together in this body, and I hope we \nwill continue to approach issues important to the future of our Nation \nin this manner.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. I now ask that the Kyl amendment be laid aside and the \nSenator from Delaware be recognized to offer the last amendment to this \nbill as soon as we have a quorum call.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business? Are we on the \nfinal amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe we just dispensed with \nthe Kyl amendment. There is no pending amendment at this time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is there a time agreement on the Biden amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nof the distinguished Senator from Arizona be laid aside; that as soon \nas the distinguished majority leader is finished, we can move to the \nfinal amendment, the Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time is the Biden amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 90 \nminutes equally divided between Senator Biden and myself.\n  Mr. COHEN. Reserving the right to object, I might indicate to the \nSenator from Utah that Senator Biden indicated he will allow me to have \nan additional 15 minutes separate and apart from this agreement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us make it 105 minutes with 45 minutes----\n  Mr. DOLE. I have a better idea. Why not the Senator from Utah give \nhim 15 minutes of his 45.\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be fine.\n  Mr. COHEN. I do not want to take the time of Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. DOLE. We want to finish this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine with me. Half-hour to me, an hour to Senator \nBiden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Does the Senator from \nMaine object?\n  Mr. COHEN. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, then it would appear to me that we are not \ngoing to finish this bill until after 5 o'clock. But we will take up \nthe telecommunications bill. We will be here late because we have \nfrittered away the afternoon here. We hoped to conclude action on this \nbill by 1 o'clock. It is now 3:30, and it is going to be 5 or 6 \no'clock. So we do not have any recourse because Senator Pressler and \nSenator Hollings have been waiting all day long to take up the \ntelecommunications bill, and there will be votes and there will be \namendments probably until 10 or 11 o'clock tonight. So if we can \nfinish, whenever we finish this bill, we will be on the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  I understand the Senator from Delaware is now prepared to offer his \namendment, which will be the final amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Maine \nis prepared to speak and utilize his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from Utah \nfor allowing me to use 15 minutes of his time. I will try and cut it \ndown if I can, because I do not want to trespass on his time, \nespecially since I am going to be speaking in opposition to his \nposition. So it is kind generosity on his part, superimposed by the \nmajority leader, I might add, but nonetheless I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I have in my past life been both a prosecutor and \ndefense counsel. I believe firmly that some reform of habeas corpus is \nnecessary. Successive and repetitive petitions, appeals and Supreme \nCourt reviews have led to excessive delays and imposed costs on State \nprosecutors' offices that otherwise would be dedicated to law \nenforcement. I think these delays have rightly been perceived by the \nAmerican people as an abuse of the judicial process by those opposed to \nthe death penalty.\n  I also want to point out that I oppose the death penalty, but I \ncannot support a system that allows respect for the law to be \nundermined. Consequently, I believe many of the procedural reforms \ncontained in S. 735 are appropriate and necessary.\n  I support limits on successive, repetitive petitions. I support a \nstatute of limitations for filing habeas petitions. And I support time \nlimits on judicial consideration of habeas cases. I think these reforms \nshould be sufficient to eliminate the abuses of the habeas system that \nhave led to decade-long delays in many capital cases.\n  But the goal of habeas corpus reform ought to be that prisoners have \none complete bite at the apple.\n  The bill before the Senate gives prisoners one bite at the apple but \nchanges the law so that the bite is incomplete. It weakens the \nstandards under which Federal courts review constitutional errors that \ntake place in State courts by requiring a Federal court to defer to a \nState court's reasonable interpretation and application of \nconstitutional law.\n  By weakening the effectiveness of the writ in this way, I think it is \ngoing to erode what has been a cherished procedure over the centuries, \nthe hallmark [[Page S7839]] of Anglo-American jurisprudence. The writ \nof habeas corpus is the last line of defense for constitutional rights.\n  An effective habeas remedy is especially necessary in modern times \nbecause of the poor caliber of legal representation capital defendants \nare being provided in capital trials.\n  Many of the States that produce a large number of capital cases have \nno minimum competency standards for defense counsel. One State limits \nthe compensation for court-appointed counsel to $1,000 for all pretrial \npreparation and trial proceedings--I repeat, $1,000 for all pretrial \npreparation and trial proceedings.\n  Another State pays a maximum of $2,500. A survey by the Mississippi \nTrial Lawyers Association estimated that the average capital defense \nattorney is compensated at a rate of $11.75 an hour, just 2\\1/2\\ times \nthe minimum wage.\n  There are reported cases of trial counsel sleeping during trial, not \npresenting any mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of the \ntrial, having only 6 months of legal experience and no criminal trial \nexperience, or filing a one-page brief on appeal.\n  In one of his last opinions from the bench, Justice Blackmun listed \nsix egregious examples of the poor representation many capital \ndefendants receive. One case Justice Blackmun described was that \ninvolving John Young, who was represented in his capital trial by an \nattorney who was addicted to drugs and who a few weeks after the trial \nwas incarcerated on Federal drug charges. The court of appeals of the \neleventh circuit rejected Young's ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim on Federal habeas review and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. \nYoung was executed in 1985.\n  In another case, Larry Heath was represented on direct appeal by \ncounsel who filed a six-page brief before the Alabama Court of Criminal \nAppeals. The attorney failed to appear for the oral argument before the \nAlabama Supreme Court and filed a brief in that court containing a one-\npage argument and citing a single case. The eleventh circuit found no \nprejudice, and the Supreme Court denied review. He was executed in \n1992.\n  The bill before the Senate does nothing to remedy the serious problem \nof incompetent counsel in State court capital cases. But in light of \nthis, I think the Biden amendment is all the more imperative to \nmaintain the effectiveness of habeas under these circumstances. When \ntrial counsel has done little to protect a capital defendant's \nconstitutional rights at trial, at the very least, it seems to me the \nFederal Government ought to provide effective Federal court review of \nthe State court conviction and sentence to ensure that the core \nconstitutional requirements have been satisfied.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Biden has already talked at some \nlength about the case of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter. I read a book that \nwas written some time ago called ``The 16th Round.'' In ``The 16th \nRound,'' we have a description of what happened to Rubin ``Hurricane'' \nCarter, the one time the middleweight prizefighter. It was not a death \npenalty case, but it was a case of an innocent man being convicted for \na crime he did not commit, primarily because he was a black man who was \nin the vicinity when a triple murder was committed.\n  It was way back in June 1966. Two light-skinned black men, one \ndescribed as thin, about 5 feet 11 inches, shot and killed three people \nin a Paterson, NJ bar. Carter, a very dark-skinned, stocky, \nprizefighter, 5 feet 8 inches tall, was driving in the vicinity with \ntwo other people. They were stopped by the police and then released \nbecause they did not match the description of the killers. Later that \nnight, Carter and a man named John Artis were again picked up by the \npolice, but the survivor of the shooting failed to identify them as the \nkillers. They were given lie detector tests and they passed.\n  In the meantime, a small-time thief who was robbing a factory nearby \nthe murder site told the police he had seen the commission of the \ncrimes, and in an attempt to curry favor with the police, he told them \nRubin ``Hurricane'' Carter was the killer.\n  Based on that information, Carter and Artis were tried, convicted, \nand sentenced. Carter himself was sentenced to life in prison.\n  Ten years later, after the thief recanted his trial testimony, Carter \nand Artis were given new trials. Then at the time of trial the thief \nrecanted his recantation. Carter and Artis were convicted again. The \nNew Jersey Supreme Court affirmed Carter's conviction by a vote of 4-3.\n  Then a habeas corpus petition was filed in Federal court. In 1985, \nthe court issued an opinion finding two serious constitutional \nviolations: The prosecutor's misuse of a lie detector test and the \ndenial of equal protection due to the prosecutor's unfounded racial \nallegations against the defendants. The prosecution argued that the \ndefendants were simply out to murder white people when, in fact, the \nevidence was that they both had many white friends.\n  The third circuit upheld the lower court's decision to grant the \npetition. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. And the State of New \nJersey finally dismissed the indictment.\n  Here we have a situation where a person spent over 20 years in prison \nover charges that were false. The attorney for Mr. Carter has written \nto Senator Hatch to point out that if a proposal similar to the one on \nthe floor right now were law today, Carter's habeas corpus petition \nwould have been dismissed. He said, ``I do not see what legitimate \ncriminal justice purpose would be achieved by such a result.''\n  Indeed, the 16th round never would have occurred. The 15th round \nwould have knocked Carter out for the rest of his life, without him \never having a legitimate opportunity to challenge the injustice that \ntook place 20 years ago.\n  So let us not fool ourselves. The substantive changes to the habeas \nbill being proposed are not designed just to eliminate frivolous cases. \nThey are designed to weaken the Federal courts' role in scrutinizing \nState court verdicts for constitutional error. Prof. Henry Monaghan \nfrom Columbia University said it very well in a letter to Senator \nHatch. He acknowledged that he is ``no fan of habeas corpus.'' But he \nwas satisfied that the changes in the Supreme Court law and the \nprocedural reforms in this bill ``would go a long way to eliminating \nabuses.'' He went on to urge that the substantive standards not be \naltered:\n\n       I believe the writ's core function of affording independent \n     Federal review to mixed questions of law and fact should be \n     retained and that the deference provision in S. 735 should be \n     withdrawn. The deference provision in S. 735 would keep \n     habeas corpus from serving any meaningful role. Effectively, \n     it would repeal the habeas corpus statute.\n\n  Similarly, a former State prosecutor recently wrote to me that the \n``reasonableness'' rule of deference in this bill is not the way to \nspeed up habeas corpus review. It is not a way to prevent the same \nprisoner from filing more than one petition. Rather, ``it is an \nunprecedented attack on the rule, as old as the Republic, that Federal \ncourts have the last word on what the Federal Constitution means and \nhow it is to be applied. It would require Federal courts to stand by \nand do nothing even if presented with a State court ruling that was \nwrong, and the cause of the person being unjustly imprisoned or even \nexecuted.''\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is important that those accused of \nserious capital crimes have one complete bite at the apple. I believe \nthe Biden amendment will make sure that one bite is complete and not \nincomplete. I hope that it will receive the endorsement of the Senate, \nbecause habeas corpus without it will become a hollow remedy, one that \nI do not think would be worthy of the title ``the Great Writ.''\n  A strong case has been made for the procedural reforms in this bill. \nThey will increase respect for the law by stopping the endless delays \nand appeals of capital sentences. But no case has been made for \nchanging the substantive standards applicable in federal courts for \nwell over a century. When we are making such radical changes in our \nlegal system, we should act prudently. We can always cut back on habeas \nin the future if the procedural reforms in this bill do not work. But \nwe may never recover the habeas process once it has been effectively \nbeen repealed by the substantive changes being proposed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine. The Senator \nfrom Maine has a reputation in this [[Page S7840]] body of being one of \nthe most thoughtful, and when he speaks in debates, unlike the Senator \nfrom Delaware, a most measured Senator, and one whose career has been \nmarked by observable high points of principle. And this is, I detect, \nfrom his speech, a principled issue here. This is an important issue. \nThis is not one where we should, quite frankly, be guided by the \nlegitimate but sometimes not fully articulated concerns of our \nconstituents.\n  I believe what our constituents want is what the Senator from Maine \nhas outlined. I doubt whether there is a man or woman in America who \nthinks that Hurricane Carter should not be free today. I doubt whether \nthere are any people in America today who would have been happy had \nthis been the law and had he been denied the opportunity to make that \nfinal plea in Federal Court.\n  Yet, if we amend the law along the lines of the Biden amendment, \nwhich Senator Cohen supports, we would have drastically cut down \nfrivolous appeals and drastically cut down successful appeals. As a \nmatter of fact, there is no difference in the time limitation for \nfiling an appeal and the number of successive appeals that are allowed \nbetween what Senator Hatch wants and what we want. The big difference \nin what the Senator from Maine and I are saying is the standard the \ncourt is able to apply when the Federal court looks at, as Professor \nMonaghan states, those mixed questions of fact and law. This would \nessentially not allow them to look at fact, just theoretically the law.\n  So what I propose to do is precisely what Professor Monaghan, who is \nnot a fan of habeas corpus, wants done. Let us be real clear right from \nthe start here what we are arguing about and what we are not arguing \nabout. Again, as my old buddy Sid Balick, says, ``keep your eye on the \nball.'' What are we arguing about and what are we not arguing about? We \nare not arguing about whether or not to speed up the process of habeas \ncorpus review, and we are not arguing about reducing the current abuses \nin the system.\n  I agree with my Republican colleagues from Utah and Pennsylvania that \nwe have to have a strict statute of limitations and a strict limit on \nsuccessive petitions. Put another way, how many times after that first \none, or under what circumstance, can you file another petition if you \nare able to at all. Nothing I am trying to do today, nothing in my \namendment would change what the Republicans propose for speeding things \nup or cutting down on abuses. They have a 6-month statute of \nlimitations in their bill. I am not trying to make that 9 months or 1 \nyear or 2 years. I am not proposing to change a single word in the \nstatute of limitations. As this chart up here shows, in the Biden \namendment the time limits for filing a petition are the same as in the \nSpecter-Hatch provision. We both set limits on time.\n  Nothing in my amendment, nothing at all, would change what the \nRepublicans propose for speeding things up or for cutting down on \nabuses.\n  The Republicans have a new strict limit on successive petitions in \ntheir bill. Many of my liberal friends think these restrictions are \nexcessive. I do not. I have not attempted to change a word. I have not \nattempted to change a word on their bill relating to successive \npetitions. Not a period, not a comma of their proposal is changed by my \namendment.\n  Put another way, at the end of the day, or the end of today, even if \nI were to win everything I am asking for, the statutory right of habeas \ncorpus will be drastically altered from what it is today. No longer \nwill we see a guy filing petition after petition. No longer will my \nfriend from Utah, my distinguished friend from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, my friend from Pennsylvania, my new friend and colleague from \nOklahoma, be able to put up on a board or reference cases which are \nreal and exist today where someone has sat, after having been convicted \nfor a capital offense, on death row for 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 16, or 19 \nyears. That will not be possible if we adopt my amendment.\n  Now, usually, the Senator from Utah has a chart out here listing the \nnumber of petitions in several cases. I am not making light of that. \nWhen he brings out that chart, if he does in his response, I want \neveryone to look at it and understand that if the Biden amendment \npasses, that would be the end of charts like that.\n  There would no longer be an ability for a convicted prisoner, \nconvicted of a capital offense, to be able to file those successive \npetitions and delay for the number of years the charts have always \nshown.\n  I also point out that we will still have the problem of irresponsible \nState courts who do not read briefs, who do not take the time to follow \nthrough. I cannot affect that, nor can they. At a Federal level, we \nwill have eliminated the ability to have those successive petitions.\n  So let the Senate be clear on what we are not arguing about. What we \nare arguing about is whether we should dismantle the habeas corpus \nprocess by dramatically restricting the Federal power of the Federal \ncourts to decide whether a State court got it wrong, whether a State \ncourt wrongly convicted a person, whether a State court is wrongly \nsending a person to death. That is what we will be changing.\n  That is where I part company with my Republican friends. I want to \nfix the problem. They want to do away with the right. I want to get a \nhabeas corpus petitioner in and out of Federal court quickly. I do not \nwant to make it practically impossible for him to get into Federal \ncourt. I want to say you get in, and you must get in quickly, and you \ncan only get in under certain circumstances, and you are out. The \nRepublicans want to slam the door of the Federal courthouse closed.\n  I know there are a lot of things about Federal overreaching, but one \nthing I do not think most Americans--whether they are liberal or \nconservative, whether they are moderate, whether they are Republican or \nDemocrat--I do not think they believe that is a remedy, to slam the \nFederal courthouse door. They do not want it swinging off its hinges, \nbut they do not want it slammed shut.\n  What I propose is--to be able to use this silly metaphor--to be able \nto open the door once, walk through the door, and say, ``Federal \njudges, experts on the Federal Constitution, listen to my plea. Make a \ndecision. If you decide against me, I'm out, but listen to it.''\n  As the Senator said, the lawyer for Hurricane Carter, and I suspect \neveryone else would agree he would be a man in jail the rest of his \nlife were that door slammed shut, had it been slammed shut in the way I \nbelieve this present bill does.\n  So that is what we are arguing about.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1224\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to deleting the rule of \n                      deference for habeas corpus)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1224.\n\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Delete page 105, line 3, through page 105, line 17.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let Members be clear about what we are \ntalking about.\n  A petition for habeas corpus--I want to complicate this--a petition \nfor habeas corpus is literally and simply a piece of paper on which a \nState prisoner says, ``I have been denied my constitutional rights in \nthe following way,'' and takes that paper or has his lawyer take the \npaper and file that in a Federal court.\n  In almost all instances, this is after his remedies have expired in a \nState court system. The issue is whether he or she should be able to \nfile that in Federal court and under what circumstances.\n  The piece of paper that a habeas corpus petition is written on says \nthat the prisoner claims to be held or sentenced to death in violation \nof the Federal Constitution, the U.S. Constitution. It does not ask \nthat the prisoner be released, but it does ask that he be given a new \ntrial.\n  Habeas corpus is the means by which Federal courts ensure that State \n[[Page S7841]] courts are following the Constitution. It ensures that \nthose in jail or on death row were not only not put there mistakenly, \nbut that they were not put there in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I might add, if we, in fact, eliminate Federal habeas corpus or in \neffect eliminate Federal habeas corpus, what we do is we leave to 50 \ndifferent States the potential for 50 different interpretations of fact \nand law.\n  We all know if a Federal court makes a judgment on a Constitution in \na circuit or in a district, it usually goes to a circuit, and then to \nthe Supreme Court. We get a final national judgment on how to read that \nprovision and that fact/legal mixture under the Federal Constitution. \nWe have a uniform application of the law.\n  The writ of habeas corpus, known historically as the ``great writ,'' \nis enshrined in the Constitution itself, which provides that ``The writ \nof habeas corpus shall not be suspended,'' article I, section 9.\n  Unfortunately, under the current system, guilty people can sometimes \ndelay their death sentences by filing frivolous habeas petitions. There \nis no time limit on when the petition has to be filed, and there is no \nstatutory limit on the number of petitions.\n  I have, in years past, proposed legislation that would reform this \nsystem to generally limit a petitioner to one petition in Federal \ncourt, and to impose strict limits on when that petition had to be \nfiled. But my legislation also recognized in that one round of Federal \nreview, the prisoner is allowed and must be allowed a full and careful \nreview to ensure that we do not execute innocent people.\n  The death sentence is unlike any other. There is no turning back once \nit has been carried out; to state the obvious, a mistake cannot be \nfixed. Because of that, we cannot allow the death penalty to be used \nagainst innocent people and we cannot allow it to be carried out \nunfairly.\n  I am certain all of my colleagues would agree that, although the \ndeath penalty should be applied swiftly and with certainty, the worst \nthing in the world would be for it to be applied wrongly.\n  My amendment tries to preserve the important role that habeas plays, \nwhile reducing delays. It strikes at what I believe is the issue that \ntruly rises above all else in the Republican bill. It strikes the \nprovision in the Republican bill that I think is the most troublesome, \nand that is the so-called rule of deference, which has been known \naround here the last 20 years that I have been here as the full and \nfair rule.\n  This, in my view, and probably in the view of advocates of both sides \nof the habeas corpus debate, is the single most important provision of \nthe Republican bill and the single biggest difference between my \napproach and their approach.\n  As the chart I have just had put up illustrates, when it comes to \nspeeding things up, Senator Hatch and I are in the same spot. Both our \nbills have time limits on when a petition can be filed. Both our bills \nhave limits on successive petitions. But our bill differs when it comes \nto the issue of deciding these petitions.\n  I said the Federal courts should exercise independent review while \nthe Specter-Hatch bill requires Federal courts to defer to the States.\n  It is important to realize that the deference standard in the \nSpecter-Hatch bill effectively makes the rest of the bill irrelevant. \nAfter all, what difference does it make what the time limits are if the \nFederal courts are going to be precluded from examining what the State \ncourts did in any event? What difference do the time limits make? That \nis the fundamental difference in our approaches, because that is what \nthe result of the Specter Hatch bill will be.\n  Let me give a hypothetical example. Suppose an innocent man is \ncharged with a capital crime and during the investigation one of the \nwitnesses identifies someone else as having committed the crime other \nthan the defendant, a fact which is concealed from the defendant. And \nthere are cases where this has occurred.\n  At trial the witness identifies the defendant, the innocent man, even \nthough the prosecution has in its possession the evidence that another \nwitness identifies someone else as having committed the crime. But at \ntrial, the second witness identifies the defendant, the innocent man.\n  In addition, the witness testifies that he has never met the \ndefendant before when, in fact, the prosecutor knows that the witness \nharbors a grudge against the defendant, the witness who identifies the \ndefendant.\n  Now, the prosecutor goes ahead and does not tell the defense about \nthe details of what the witness previously said, that he previously \nsaid, no, I identify somebody else, and where the prosecution knows \nthat the identifying witness has a grudge against the defendant.\n  The State courts go ahead and uphold the conviction anyway, reasoning \nthat the truthful evidence would not actually prove the defendant \ninnocent.\n  Let me get this straight now. If in a trial the stenographer here is \naccused of killing John Doe and the prosecutor interviews me as a \nwitness. I say no, he did not kill John Doe, Charlie Smith killed John \nDoe. But then I say, no, I change my mind. I think he did kill John \nDoe.\n  The prosecutor investigates and finds out that the stenographer and I \nhave hated one another for the last 20 years, or I have held a grudge \nagainst the stenographer because he took down one of my speeches \nincorrectly.\n  They never do that, I might add.\n  Now, the prosecutor does not tell the defendant about my grudge \nagainst the defendant and about the fact that I initially identified \nsomebody else. So, now there is a trial and he is convicted.\n  After the conviction takes place, he files a petition for the writ of \nhabeas corpus and proves that this information was withheld from him; \nthat it would have made a difference to the jury. And the State court \nof Delaware says: No, no, even if that is true, it does not prove that \nhe is innocent. It just proves that I have a grudge against him and it \njust proves that the prosecution was not totally honest. But it does \nnot prove his innocence. Therefore, hang him. Or, in Delaware, lethal \ninjection.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is under the language of this bill the \nState court's decision on this issue, that is the scope of the \nprosecutor's duty to turn over the information, would be the absolute \nlast word because, as long as the State court decision could be \ndescribed by a lawyer as being reasonable, the Federal court could not \noverturn it. In this example, an innocent man may be put to death \nbecause, under this bill's provisions, the issue before the Federal \ncourt would be, was it reasonable for the State court to say that they \nare upholding the conviction because the information withheld would not \nhave proved his innocence?\n  The probability is the Federal court would have to say that is \nreasonable. It may not be right. We might not have decided it that way, \nbut it is reasonable. A reasonable man could say, all right, even if \nthe jury had known this, it did not prove his innocence. They still may \nhave convicted him. The Republican bill says:\n\n       An application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n     person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court \n     shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was \n     adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless \n     the adjudication of the claim * * * resulted in a decision \n     that * * * involved an unreasonable application of, clearly \n     established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court \n     of the United States.\n\n  That is a heck of a standard to have to apply.\n  So, I say goodbye to the stenographer. He is off to death row. He \nprobably thinks he is off to death row when he has to come out here and \ntake down my speeches. But he is off to death row. Because even \nthough--even though--the prosecution withheld evidence that goes to his \ninnocence, instead of the court saying, ``This would have made it \ndifficult for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt he was \nguilty,'' which would have been a reasonable conclusion to reach as \nwell, they said ``This does not prove that he is innocent so we are not \ngoing to overturn the conviction.'' So he is gone. Because, as long as \nthe State court decision could be described by a lawyer as being \nreasonable, the Federal court has to defer to the State court.\n  The effect is there is no habeas corpus review on matters of fact and \nlaw at a Federal level. My amendment simply strikes this language. It \nleaves in the bill the rest of the reforms--time limits, limits on \nsecond petitions--but it strikes the deference rule and allows \n[[Page S7842]] the current practice of independent review by the court, \nthe Federal court. The Federal court should be able to say in that \ncircumstance: We understand what the State court did but under our \ninterpretation of the Constitution and his constitutional rights we \nbelieve that withholding this information was so prejudicial that he \nshould get a second trial with all the facts being known. They should \nbe able to do that. This would preclude them from doing that.\n  I think there are four parts of this long sentence I read up here on \nthe board, four parts of this long sentence which have a devastating \neffect.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair).\n  Mr. BIDEN. First, the language sets out clearly what the general \nprinciple is. The general principle in this language in the Hatch bill \nis that Federal courts shall not grant a claim that was adjudicated in \nState court proceedings. That is what is at the top. It seems to me \nthat is what the sponsor of this bill views as the most desirable \noutcome in a habeas petition. Of course, this is directly contrary to \nthe purpose of habeas corpus, which is to have Federal courts, and in \nparticular the Supreme Court, decide issues of Federal constitutional \nlaw.\n  The second problem, in this instance, the bill seems to allow an \nexception to the general rule but one that is likely to be illusory \nbecause a claim can be granted only if the State court's application of \nFederal law to the facts, before it was unreasonable, not merely wrong \nbut unreasonable. It could be wrong but viewed as reasonable. This is \nan extraordinary deferential standard to the State courts, and I \nbelieve it is an inappropriate one. It puts the Federal courts in the \ndifficult position of evaluating the reasonableness of a State court \njudge rather than simply deciding whether or not he correctly applied \nthe law, not whether he did it reasonably. You can have a reasonable \nmistake. They could reasonably conclude that on a constitutional \nprovision, it should not apply, when in fact the Supreme Court would \nrule it must apply. Reasonable people could have reached the conclusion \nprior to the application of the Miranda decision that it was reasonable \nnot to tell someone their rights. That is a reasonable decision. It may \nnot be born out of animus. The Supreme Court said no. You have to tell \npeople their rights. A reasonable standard of review is the lowest \nstandard used by Federal courts.\n  In reviewing the constitutionality of statutes, for example, in cases \nwhere courts used the reasonable or rational standard, it looks only at \nwhether there is any rational basis supporting the statute. It is a \ncursory standard of review. In fact, looking at thousands of cases \nsince the late 1930's, our Supreme Court has found--to the best of my \nknowledge--no statute invalid when they have applied the reasonable \nstandard.\n  Reasonable people, like Senator Hatch and I, are going to be arguing \non the floor about the regulatory reform bill and about the takings \nclause and all of those issues, right now if the U.S. Congress passes a \nlaw saying you cannot have more than 2 parts per billion of a \ncarcinogenic substance in the liquid effluent coming out of your \nfactory, the Supreme Court says not whether that does or does not cause \ncancer, they say it is reasonable for those folks in the Senate and the \nHouse to conclude that is dangerous and, therefore, they will uphold \nthe statute.\n  It is the lowest standard. It is one thing to apply that when we are \nprotecting the public against environmental pollution. It is another \nthing when we are applying that standard to the application of \nconstitutional rights to individuals. There we have always applied the \nhighest standard. The Government has been required to meet the highest \nstandard before they can put someone in jail or put them to death. This \nreasonableness standard reduces to its lowest common denominator.\n  The court also uses a reasonableness standard in reviewing Federal \nagencies' interests, and the administrative statutes. I will not get \ninto it now. But the Chevron case and others are cases we debated about \nwhether or not, in applying civil law, which standard we should apply. \nBut the bottom line is this, folks. If the standard is reasonableness, \nit is the lowest common denominator. And, if the Federal court is \nrequired to give deference to a State court on the grounds that it \nacted reasonably as opposed to correctly, a lot of folks--I should not \nsay a lot; I do not know how many--but there will be individuals who \nwill be put to death where they otherwise would not have been put to \ndeath if the Federal court were able to apply the standard that \ndetermines their ability to go back and look at the facts and the law \nand make an independent judgment.\n  By the way, let me say the whole reason to have the ability of a \ndefendant to go into Federal court is to allow Federal judges to apply \nthe Federal Constitution and determine whether they think the State \ncourt applied it correctly. But if you limit what they can look at and \nthe standard they use in review, you have in effect undercut the very \nrationale for allowing the defendant to get into that Federal court in \nthe first place.\n  The third problem with this language is the bill's reasonableness \nexception is limited not only by the requirement that the decision must \nhave been unreasonable, but that it must have been unreasonable in \nlight of Supreme Court law. So even if there is a Federal court \ndecision directly on point, the State court could ignore it as long as \nthe application of law had not been directly decided by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, as a former prosecutor and a first-\nrate trial lawyer, there are a number of lower Federal court decisions \nthat never get to the Supreme Court because no one bothers to conclude \nthat they were wrongly decided. And they are accepted as Federal law. \nIn this case, you could have all the districts or the circuits agreeing \non one application of the law, and the State court ignore what the \nFederal courts have said because there is no Supreme Court decision on \npoint. That seems to me to be a very dangerous precedent. Even so, if \nthere is a Federal court decision directly on point, under this \nlanguage, the State court could ignore it as long as the Supreme Court \nhas not spoken to it. In other words, State courts could ignore the \ndecisions of the lower U.S. courts interpreting the Constitution \nwithout any prospect of being corrected by Federal courts.\n  For example, an appeals court recently held that a defendant cannot \nbe prosecuted criminally and have his property forfeited under the \ncivil forfeiture laws because of the double jeopardy clause prohibiting \nthat. That ruling is clear. It is unambiguous. But it is not a Supreme \nCourt ruling. Under this bill, a State court, which subsequently \nrefused to follow that interpretation, could not be corrected by habeas \ncorpus review because it could never get back into the Federal court \nsystem.\n  This limitation on Supreme Court laws is particularly nonsensical \nbecause the Supreme Court generally does not accept for review \ndecisions by circuit courts of appeal unless there is a split in the \ncircuits, as the Presiding Officer knows. If all the circuits agree on \na principle of law, the Supreme Court would have no reason to address \nit.\n  So under this standard that we are about to write into the law, a \nState court could ignore a rule that all the circuit courts agreed on \nand no Federal court could correct that State decision. That is \npreposterous; maybe unintended, but that is the effect.\n  Fourth, the exception to the general rule in habeas shall not be \ngranted if the State court ajudicating the claim is further narrowed by \nthe language in the statute requiring that the Federal law at issue \nmust have been clearly established. Not only must the decision of the \nState court have been unreasonable, and not only must it have been \nunreasonable in light of Supreme Court law, not Federal law, but it \nmust have been unreasonable in light of Supreme Court law that is \nclearly established.\n  The one thing we know is that where lawyers are involved, there is \nlittle that can be said to be clearly established. So where the \napplication of a U.S. Supreme Court decision to a new set of facts is \nunclear, the State court need not worry about it.\n  For instance, the Supreme Court quite logically has held that the \nprosecution must give to the defendant any evidence it has that is \nfavorable to him. It is called justice--justice. This is not a game. \nProsecutors are not [[Page S7843]] there to determine whether they can \nwin. They are there to do justice. And so the Supreme Court has said \nthat, if the prosecution has at its disposal evidence that goes to the \ninnocence of the defendant, that has to be made available to the \ndefendant. But is a certain kind of evidence favorable to the accused? \nThat might not be clearly established. And so the State courts will be \nfree to go their own way.\n  For example, a clear case would be assume that in the State court, \nthe prosecutor had evidence there were two witnesses at the same time \nwho said the defendant did not do it. Well, they cannot withhold that \nfrom him. But they may conclude at the State court level that they have \nevidence there is a motel receipt that indicated the defendant was at \nsuch and such a place when this crime was committed. They can \nreasonably conclude at a State court level we really do not think that \ngoes to the innocence, that is not favorable to the defendant, that is \na marginal question so we are not going to tell him.\n  Now, what you have to do, if you are filing a Federal habeas corpus \nappeal to get them to go back and get them to look at that, you have to \nprove that judgment was unreasonable even though there is a Supreme \nCourt decision out there saying you have to make things that are \nfavorable to the defendant available to the defendant, because it is \nnot clearly established law, because it is not around long enough to \nhave been applied to 10, 20, 30 fact circumstances.\n  Now, it seems to me that we are requiring an awful lot of hurdles and \nlimitations on what a Federal judge can look at once we get to court. \nAgain, keep our eye on the ball here. We are not talking about \nsuccessive abilities to get into Federal court. We are not talking \nabout extended time limits to get into Federal court. We are not \ntalking about whether or not you can get into Federal court repeatedly. \nWe are only talking about when you get to Federal court what is the \nFederal judge able to look at. And right now the Federal judge is able \nto look at the whole thing from ground up if he wants to. He can make \nan independent decision based on what the specific statement by the \ndefendant is in his petition as to why they should be granted a new \ntrial. They can go back and look at the facts in the case and the law \nand apply them in conjunction with one another.\n  So let me summarize what I think this language in the Hatch bill \nsays. First, it states that habeas relief cannot be granted by a \nFederal judge if a State court has adjudicated the claim, which is \ndirectly contrary to the entire purpose of Federal habeas corpus.\n  Second, it creates what looks to be an exception but one that is \nlargely illusory. It requires that a State court merely behave \nreasonably--not correctly, reasonably. It requires that a State court \nmerely act reasonably in relation to a Supreme Court decision, not in \nrelation to decisions of lower Federal courts in their State. And it \nrequires them to act reasonably only if the Supreme Court law can be \nsaid to be clearly established. All this amounts to is that State \ncourts in almost every case will be free to reach virtually any \ndecision without any chance of Federal review later. This rule, the so-\ncalled rule of deference, turns habeas on its head. The purpose of \nhabeas is to correct State court errors. But if Federal courts have to \ndefer to State court decisions, they will not be able to correct their \nmistakes except in the most egregious circumstances.\n  Now, through the years we have fought in this Chamber battles over \nthe so-called full and fair standard, essentially what Senator Kyl had \nintroduced. At least he was straightforward and blatant about it. He \nsaid: Look, my purpose here is to do away with any State prisoner being \nable to get into a Federal court, period, and because the Constitution \nsays you can go to the Supreme Court under rare circumstances, I am not \ngoing to try to eliminate it. But he said 40 percent of the delay is in \nFederal court, so what I am going to do is do away with the ability to \nget into Federal courts.\n  Straightforward. This provision suggested by my Republican friend \nessentially does the same thing, making it sound like we are really \nletting someone get in.\n  Admittedly, the most egregious cases, which would not be captured by \nthe Kyl amendment, would be captured in this amendment. But the vast \nmajority of cases are in a gray area. And again my proposal to delete \nthis standard will in no way slow the process up and will in no way \nincrease the number of opportunities that a prisoner has to file a \npetition.\n  While this language looks different than full and fair, the language \nin this bill would have virtually the same effect. It would prevent \nFederal courts from granting relief for a violation of the Federal \nConstitution because it would require deference to the State decision \nunless that decision were unreasonable. Being wrong would not be enough \nto get it overturned. It would have to be unreasonable.\n  If I can make an analogy to the Presiding Officer--who is the only \none here at the moment and so that is why I am speaking to him, \nalthough I always like to speak to him--it is like this deal with good-\nfaith exceptions to the fourth amendment, search and seizure. All of a \nsudden, by the way, my friends on the right side of the Chamber, my \nright and on the ideological right, all of a sudden are beginning to \nrealize: Wait. Maybe we do not want to do away with that so quickly. \nBut at any rate, there is an exception that if a cop violates the \nfourth amendment but did it in good faith, it should be admissible in \ncourt.\n  Well, you can theoretically argue that makes sense. But how about \nwhere a court wrongly but in good faith, in good faith wrongly decides \na provision in the Constitution, wrongly decides it, the result of \nwhich is the person goes to death. Are we going to reward ignorance? \nAre we going to reward reasonableness just because it came from the \nState? It may be reasonable that he reached that decision but wrong. \nWrong. This would preclude Federal courts from looking at the merits--\nwhether it was wrongly decided. They only get to do it if it meets the \nthreshold that it was an unreasonable application of the facts and the \nlaw.\n  When the Supreme Court announces a constitutional wrong such as the \nright of the defendant to know about evidence held by the prosecutor \nthat suggests he is innocent, it necessarily leaves open the question \nof how that general rule applies to specific facts. Does that mean \nevidence that could be used to impeach a witness must be turned over? \nHow strong does the evidence need to be before the requirement kicks \nin? The Supreme Court cannot possibly decide all of these issues in one \ncase.\n  But lawyers arguing in courts will be able to come up with all sorts \nof different ways of applying that general rule in individual cases. \nAnd many of those ways of applying them may be reasonable. That means \nthat Federal courts will be unable to review State decisions through \nhabeas corpus and begin to establish some uniform law in that portion \nof the country. Instead, virtually any decision a court reaches will \nhave to be considered acceptable solely because it was reasonable.\n  I ask everybody listening to this, do we want 25 different \ninterpretations of what is reasonable? Do we want 25 or 50 different \nversions of what is reasonable? That flies in the face of the notion of \na uniform application of the only unifying document that exists in our \nNation, the U.S. Constitution. This would mean that the Federal \nConstitution would be determined by State court judges.\n  Placing primary responsibility for the Federal Constitution in the \nhands of State courts is a dramatic departure from this country's \nhistorical principle, and that is that it is the Federal courts that \nshould be the final arbiters of Federal law. It would relegate us to a \nsystem in which the 50 State court systems and in fact the individual \njudges within those systems are the separate and ultimate arbiters of \nwhat the Constitution means.\n The meaning of the Federal Constitution could be different, depending \non what State you are in.\n\n  Independent review is the only sensible approach, I suggest. Even \nJustice O'Connor has said in rejecting a judicially created full and \nfair rule--which is what this rule is--that:\n\n       We have never held in the past that Federal courts must \n     presume the correctness of State court legal decisions.\n\n  Let me stop there and read it again:\n\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n       We have never held in the past that Federal courts must \n     presume the correctness of State court legal decisions.\n\n  This requires us to presume--presume--the correctness of State court \ndecisions. I am not certain that the State of Mississippi would apply \nthe Constitution the same way the State of New York would, as the State \nof California would, as the State of New Hampshire would. I do not know \nif anybody else is very sure of that.\n  Let me go on and read the entire quote from Justice O'Connor:\n\n       We have never held in the past that Federal courts must \n     presume the correctness of State court legal decisions or \n     that State courts' incorrect legal determination has ever \n     been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. We have \n     always held that Federal courts, even on habeas, have the \n     independent obligation to say what the law is.\n\n  That is the Federal constitutional interpretation by the Supreme \nCourt. I quote her again:\n\n       We have never held . . . that State courts' incorrect legal \n     determination has ever been allowed to stand because it was \n     reasonable.\n\n  This would allow incorrect State court decisions to stand because \nthey are reasonable, although incorrect.\n  That quote, I might add, was from Wright versus West, decided in \n1992. Even Justice Rehnquist----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the Senator from Delaware has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, although I have \nmuch more, that I be allowed to have 7 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, even Justice Rehnquist publicly stated that \nthis full and fair doctrine goes further than is wise, and the Supreme \nCourt, reflecting that view, has on at least five occasions refused to \napply this doctrine. Let me give some of the cases.\n  The effect of the deference rule is best illustrated, I think, by \nlooking at some of the real-life cases. The last time the Federal \ncourts were required to defer to State courts, we executed an innocent \nman. That was in 1915. There is a chart I have to illustrate that.\n  Leo Frank, a Jewish man, had been convicted and sentenced to die by a \njury intimidated by an angry lynch mob outside the courtroom. The mob \ncould be heard inside the courtroom. Mr. Frank's lawyers were so \nintimidated that they left the courtroom at times because they feared \nfor their lives.\n  Nevertheless, the State court reviewing the conviction concluded the \ntrial had been fair and upheld the conviction. A majority of the \nSupreme Court voted to uphold the conviction and, after determining \nthat they were required to defer to the State court decision, upheld \nthe conviction. The dissenters thought independent review was \nappropriate and, on that basis, they concluded that the State court \ndecision was wrong.\n  The Supreme Court applied the rule of deference in 1915, and Mr. \nFrank was killed in prison by an angry mob, and later the actual \noffender confessed and Frank was posthumously pardoned. But because of \nthe deference rule, an innocent man was executed, and that is what is \nat stake today. We are talking about going back to the 1915 standard.\n  Several years later, after the Frank case in Moore versus Dempsey, \n1923, the Supreme Court was faced with another similar case. Again, \nthis time several African-American men were on trial for murder, which \nthey claim was self-defense, when a mob attacked them in their church \nand set the church on fire. At the trial, the same mob armed and \nsurrounded the courthouse. The State court held that there had been no \nviolation of the constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial \njury, notwithstanding those little incidental facts.\n  This time, the Supreme Court rejected the deference rule and \nconcluded that independent review is required and the dissenters argued \nthat the Federal court should defer to the State court decision and \nvoted to uphold the conviction.\n  Many years later, in the famous 1953 case of Brown versus Allen, the \ncourt considered a case in which the defendant had confessed after \nbeing subjected to psychological and physical coercion, sleep \ndeprivation, and other types of pressure that put the confession and \nthe resulting conviction in serious doubt.\n  The State court found the confession to be voluntary, notwithstanding \nthe circumstances. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction, \napplying independent review. Had they been required to apply this \nstandard, they would have been required to hold that person guilty, \neven though he had been subjected to psychological and physical \ncoercion and sleep deprivation before the confession was granted.\n  These Supreme Court cases, and others I will not take the time to go \ninto, illustrate in concrete terms what the effect of the deference \nrule is. There are also lower court cases in which habeas relief has \nbeen granted. These cases would be decided differently under the \ndeference rule.\n  Consider the recent case of Herrera, who was convicted of murder and \nsentenced to death. The State court denied his appeal and the habeas \npetition. A few months ago, a Reagan appointee of the Federal bench \ngranted habeas relief because the prosecutor had threatened and \nintimidated witnesses and failed to disclose evidence that proved Mr. \nHerrera innocent and knowingly used false evidence in a closing \nargument to the jury.\n  That was not some wacko liberal judge appointed by a liberal \nPresident. That was a judge appointed by Reagan. If, in fact, this law \nhad existed at the time, he would not have been able to make that \njudgment. For instance, one woman told the police Herrera had not \ncommitted the killing. She was threatened by a police officer who said \nhe would take away her daughter unless she cooperated. The prosecutor \nknew this. The prosecutor also insisted she change her testimony to \nimplicate Herrera, and the judge found many other such violations of \nlaw, but the State court concluded, no, he was guilty; the conviction \nshould stand.\n  The Federal court corrected it. Based on this severe misconduct, this \nReagan-appointee judge said but for the conduct of the police officer \nand the prosecutor, either Herrera would not have been charged with the \noffense or the trial would have resulted in acquittal. The prosecutor's \nmisconduct was designed to obtain a conviction and another notch in \ntheir guns despite the overwhelming evidence that another man was the \nkiller and the lack of evidence pointing to Herrera.\n  This remarkable finding that a constitutional violation would put an \ninnocent man on death row would not have occurred under the Hatch-\nSpecter bill. The same claims had been made to the State courts. There \nwas nothing new in the Federal court habeas petition, but the State \ncourt found that they did not amount to a constitutional violation. If \nthe bill's deference rule had been in effect, the Federal judge would \nhave been foreclosed from correcting the State court's decision and \nsaving an innocent man's life.\n  Let me pose the question to Senator Hatch. In the Herrera case, the \ncourt was confronted with various questions, including whether the \nconduct of the police officer, when intimidating witnesses and \nwithholding evidence, amounted to a violation of the Constitution.\n  I would like to ask him when he comes back, would not his bill, which \nrequires deference to the decisions of the State court, have prevented \nthe judge from granting Federal habeas relief?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, it is the Herrera case.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is the Herrera case.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think so. The fact of the matter is, let me just \ntake a second and look at that Herrera case.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to describe another case: Fred Macias. He was \nconvicted of murdering two people in their homes. The main evidence was \nthe testimony of another man who admitted having been in the house when \nthe murder occurred, but who then claimed Macias was with him and \ncommitted the murder. Macias' lawyer did such a poor job. He did not \ninvestigate and discover a credible witness who provided an alibi.\n  The State court rejected Macias' claim that his lawyer had failed to \ngive him an effective representation. Only when a Federal court looked \nat the fact an innocent man was facing the death sentence was the \nconviction thrown out. [[Page S7845]] \n  The prosecution still tried to reindict Macias, but on being \npresented with all the evidence, a grand jury in that same jurisdiction \nrefused to indict Macias again.\n  Again, as I read the Hatch-Specter bill, the Federal court would have \nbeen forced to defer to the State court. So I would like to also point \nout another case, that of Hurricane Carter, which has been referred to.\n Carter was convicted of the murder of three people--despite the fact \nthat he did not match the physical description of the killers, and was \nsentenced to life in prison.\n\n  The prosecution used the eyewitness testimony of a thief who at first \ndenied seeing Carter at the scene. But the police then showed the \nwitness a manufactured lie detector test that falsely showed he was \nlying.--In the face of this pressure, the witness changed his \ntestimony. The fact that the witness had been pressured into his \ntestimony using a false lie detector was not disclosed to the \ndefendant, and was concealed from the jury.\n  The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the conviction--but the Federal \ncourts concluded that the prosecutor had unconstitutionally withheld \nevidence favorable to Carter. After habeas was granted, the State \ndismissed the indictment rather than seek a retrial in which it would \nhave to give all the evidence to the defendant.\n  The deference rule in this bill would have prevented the Federal \ncourts from correcting the State court's decision that the prosecutors \nhad not violated the Constitution.\n  In fact, in that case, the State of New Jersey tried to win the case \nby arguing that the Federal court should defer to the State court. The \nFederal court instead exercised independent review, and ruled for Mr. \nCarter.\n  Let me also discuss the case of Walter McMillian. McMillian was \nconvicted of murder and sentenced to death. The main evidence at trial \nwas the testimony of a white man who claimed to have been an \naccomplice, and who was granted immunity. Two other witnesses testified \nthat they had seen McMillian's truck in front of the dry cleaners. The \njury ignored the testimony of a number of friends and family members \nwho said he was at a fish fry.\n  After trial, a new investigation showed that the alleged accomplice \nwho testified against McMillian at trial did not even know him at the \ntime of the offense.\n  That, in fact, he had denied McMillian's involvement in three \ninterviews before finally fingering McMillian.\n  That witnesses who claimed to have seen McMillian's low-rider truck \ncould not have done so since the truck was not a low-rider at the time \nof the offense.\n  That the accomplice had complained to prison doctors that he was \nbeing pressured to frame McMillian, and that the doctors told the \nprosecutors about this before trial.\n  And that the State had interviewed other inmates who said the \n``accomplice'' had told them he was going to frame a man.\n  The new investigation into the McMillian case showed that all of this \nevidence was withheld from the defendant at trial.\n  Despite this new evidence, the Alabama trial court refused to grant \nrelief, turning down the constitutional claims about perjured testimony \nand Government misconduct. Eventually, the Alabama Appeals Court \nreversed. But, had the Alabama Appeals Court come out the other way, \nthe deference language would have barred the Federal court from \npreventing the execution of an innocent man.\n  While my colleagues rightly point out the crush of repetitive \npetitions--many of which are frivolous, they leave the impression that \nhabeas is no longer needed.\n  The cases I have just described demonstrate how important it is to \npreserve independent Federal review. While most State courts try to \napply the law properly, sometimes they fail because of police or \nprosecution misconduct, or simply because they make mistakes.\n  Here are a few more examples of recent cases in which Federal courts \ngranted habeas relief:\n\n       In Brown versus Lynaugh (5th Cir. 1988), Habeas relief was \n     granted because the presiding judge left the bench, took the \n     witness stand and provided evidence against the defendant. \n     Even though that type of conduct seems to make the trial \n     patently unfair, the State court didn't think so. The rule of \n     deference has prevented the Federal Courts from correcting \n     that error.\n       In McDowell versus Dixon (4th Cir. 1988), the conviction of \n     a dark-skinned African American was reversed because the \n     prosecutor had withheld eye-witness statements that the \n     assailant was white. The state courts found that this error \n     did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The Federal \n     court overruled and granted habeas relief. The deference rule \n     would have prevented the Federal courts from granting relief.\n\n  These cases demonstrate that habeas corpus is still needed--and that \ninjustices continue to occur. Without habeas, those injustices would be \nleft to stand uncorrected.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Everyone agrees that there is a need to end the delays and that the \ncurrent system just doesn't work right. But I also think everyone would \nagree that we should have a fair process--one that does not execute \ninnocent people.\n  We know that most prosecutors and most law enforcement officers are \nhonorable. Most cases proceed fairly, and we can have confidence in the \nresult.\n  But occasionally, prosecutors or cops act in bad faith--and there are \ncases which have demonstrated that. And, as we all know, our judicial \nsystem can make mistakes--and has done so.\n  The recent case of Kirk Bloodsworth is one example. Bloodsworth was \nconvicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young \ngirl. After a new trial, he was again convicted and sentenced to life \nin prison. Subsequent DNA testing confirmed his innocence. Bloodsworth \nlost 9 years out of his life because of an error in our legal system. \nHe was lucky to escape with his life.\n  Mistakes do happen. Innocent people are convicted and sentenced to \ndie.\n  Habeas corpus has existed to correct such errors--and to ensure that \nthere will never be another Leo Frank--that there will never be another \ninnocent person--man who is executed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I hope that the Senator from Utah, when he gets an opportunity, will \nrespond to my question relating to the case I raise. I thank the Chair \nfor the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this chart, I think, says about everything \nthat needs to be said on this. Everything that Senator Biden has said \ncan be answered by the Specter-Hatch bill. These are the inmates on \ndeath row versus the actual executions. There were 2,976 inmates on \ndeath row as of January 1995. The yellow bar on the chart shows 281 \nexecutions since 1977. There are multiple frivolous appeals in almost \nevery one of these almost 3,000 death row cases. If they lose on one, \nthey conjure up another one, and then they conjure up another one, and \nthey conjure up another one, just like Andrews in Utah--18 years, 30 \nappeals. Every one of them were frivolous; every one was denied. No \nquestion of guilt. No question of problems. No question he did the \nmurders. Yet, it took 18 years. And every time he brought up a habeas \ncorpus petition, the victims and their families had to relive the whole \nmurder situation again. You wonder why people in this country are \nworried about the laws and do not believe in them.\n  There is no finality, no way of solving these problems. It is a \nfarce. Why is it? Because liberal judges--and I have to say active \ndefense lawyers who are doing their jobs under a system that allows \nthis charade to go on and on--continue to allow this to happen because \nthey do not like the death penalty.\n  I think we ought to face that death penalty straight up and down. If \nyou have arguments against the death penalty, I understand that. I know \nthere are two sides to it. I do not like it myself, except in the most \nheinous of cases. I would never use it unless it was a really heinous \ncase, like the Andrews case, or like any number of other cases, like \nthe Manson case. He was saved by the Furman case, the Supreme Court \ncase where we had a temporary law on whether or not the death penalty \nis to be inflicted. There are many others you can talk about.\n  Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment. It is offered to \nmodify the standard of habeas corpus reform that we have proposed in \nthis antiterrorism [[Page S7846]] bill. Our present system of \nmultilayered State and Federal and collateral appeal has resulted in \nenormous delays. I have just made the case between sentencing and \njudicial resolution as to whether the sentence was lawful, without any \nimprovement in the quality of the adjudication. The resulting lack of \nfinality saps public confidence in our criminal justice system and \nundermines the proper roles of the State and Federal Government. I know \nthere are people here who believe that only the Federal courts tell the \ntruth. That just is not true. State courts, in many respects, are just \nas good, if not better, than the Federal courts--in these areas, just \nas good. I get a little tired of the Federal courts being demeaned and \nmaligned because, basically, people do not like the death penalty.\n  A system incapable of enforcing legally imposed sentences cannot be \ncalled just and must be reformed. I mentioned in my home State of Utah, \nfor example, the William Andrews case. He delayed imposition of a \nconstitutionally imposed death sentence for 18 years, and we went \nthrough 30 appeals, and the survivors--I think there was one where they \npoured Drano down his throat. There were others, too, and they would \ndrive pencils through their eardrums before killing them. This survivor \nhad to be there each time and had to go through it each time, had to \nhave it recollected each time. There was no question of guilt, no \nquestion of the sentence, and no question it was constitutional. Yet, \nit took 18 years and 30 appeals and millions of dollars to get done. He \nwas not an innocent person seeking freedom from an illegal punishment. \nRather, he committed a particularly heinous crime and simply wanted to \nfrustrate the demands of justice.\n  The Andrews case is hardly an isolated example. As I have said, as of \nJanuary 1995 there were almost 3,000 people on death row. Yet the \nStates have executed only 263 since 1973--38 last year. Now, Federal \nhabeas corpus proceedings have become, in effect, a second round of \nappeals in which convicted criminals are afforded the opportunity to \nrelitigate claims already considered and rejected by the State courts.\n  The abuse of habeas corpus litigation, particularly in those cases \ninvolving lawfully imposed death sentences, has seriously eroded the \npublic's confidence in our criminal justice system. It has drained our \nState criminal justice resources and has taken a dreadful toll on the \nvictims' families and those who have to live through that every time \nthere is a habeas petition found.\n  The single most important provision contained in the habeas reform \nproposal in S. 735, the bill today, is the standard of review that this \nprovision has. It determines the degree of deference the Federal court \nwill give to the decisions of a State court.\n  I notice the standard of review on the habeas proposals by the Biden \nstaff-prepared poster. It says that Specter-Hatch requires Federal \ncourts to defer to State courts in almost all cases, even if the State \nis wrong about the U.S. Constitution. That is absolutely false. The \nfact of the matter is, currently, Federal courts have virtual de novo \nreview of a State court's legal determination. Under our change, \nFederal courts would be required to defer to the determination of State \ncourts, unless the State court's decision was ``contrary to or involved \nin an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal laws as \ndetermined by the Supreme Court.'' I will read that again.\n\n       An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n     person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court \n     shall not be granted with respect to any claim adjudicated on \n     the merits in a State court proceedings unless the \n     adjudication of that claim (1) resulted in a decision that \n     was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of \n     clearly established Federal laws as determined by the Supreme \n     Court of the United States or (2) resulted in a decision that \n     was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in \n     light of the evidence presented in the State court \n     proceeding.\n\n  This is a wholly appropriate standard. It enables the Federal court \nto overturn State court positions that clearly contravene Federal law. \nIt further allows the Federal courts to review State court decisions \nthat improperly apply clearly established Federal law. The standard \nalso ends the improper review of the State court decisions.\n  After all, State courts are constrained to uphold the Constitution \nand faithfully apply Federal law as well. There is simply no reason \nthat Federal courts should have the ability to virtually retry cases \nthat have been properly adjudicated by our State courts. There is no \nreason to allow Federal courts to do that. If you talk to your State \nattorneys general, they will tell you that a review standard is the \nsingle most important provision of our bill. Meaningful reform will \nstop repeated assaults upon fair and valid State convictions through \nspurious petitions filed in the Federal courts. We cannot stop the \nspurious petitions without changing the standard under which these \npetitions are reviewed.\n  If the Biden amendment passes, we are back to business as usual, \nexcept for some time constraints. Even then it is business as usual, \nbecause there will be repetitive frivolous appeals allowed by the \nliberal judges in almost every case brought to them where they can make \nany kind of a claim, regardless of whether it is legitimate or not.\n  It happens all the time now. People are fed up to here with it and \nare sick of it. That is why this issue is so important. We have the \nbalance of the procedural protections afforded to defendants against \nthe need for maintaining the integrity of the finality of decisions of \nour State courts.\n  Mr. President, I think that part of the disagreement we have with \nrespect to the appropriate standard of review in habeas petitions \ninvolves differing visions as to the proper role of habeas review. \nFederal habeas review takes place only after there has been a trial.\n  A direct review by the State appellate court, usually in intermediate \ncourt, another direct review by the State supreme court, then a third \nreview or fourth review by the U.S. Supreme Court on a petition for \ncertiorari. Thus we have a trial in at least three levels of appellate \nreview, four different ways of protecting the rights of the defendant.\n  In a capital case, the petitioner often files a clemency petition, so \nthe State executive branch also has an opportunity. That is five: The \ntrial, the initial appeal to the intermediate court, the State supreme \ncourt, the petition to the Federal Supreme Court, and the petition for \nclemency to the Governor. Five different protections for the defendant. \nThose are the direct appeals.\n  Then we give them separate habeas appeals all the way up to the State \ncourts again, all the way up to through the Federal court again.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania was at an \nIntelligence Committee hearing and needs to get back there. So I will \ninterrupt my remarks to grant him 5 minutes for his remarks on this \nvery important issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, for yielding to me at this time. I have \nworked with him intimately on this legislation.\n  As he has noted and I noted earlier, we are in the midst of an \nIntelligence Committee meeting, a committee which I chair, so I \nappreciate his yielding to me for a few moments.\n  I have sought recognition to support Senator Hatch and to oppose the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  This legislation is the result of a great deal of work over many, \nmany years. It has been going on since the 1980's. As I commented \nearlier, a habeas corpus reform bill was passed by the U.S. Senate in \n1990, but it did not survive a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Legislation to reform habeas corpus has been considered and \nreconsidered each year for many years. The provision which is being \ndebated now, I think, is a reasonable compromise. It is not my absolute \npreference on the kind of language that I would have chosen had I \nwritten the bill alone, but I think it is a reasonable compromise.\n  Part of my concern is that when we change the standards it breeds a \nlot of new litigation to have interpretations of untested language. I \nthink there is substantial latitude here for interpretation. \n[[Page S7847]] \n  Current law gives significant deference on questions of law and on \nfactual determination to State court determinations. Under the current \nbill, I think there is still a good bit of latitude which the Federal \njudge will have when he makes a determination under a habeas corpus \npetition. There will be deference to the determinations of the State \ncourt, but the Federal judge will still have latitude to alter the \nState court decision in any case in which the Federal judge determines \nthat it was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of \nclearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, or resulted in a decision that was based on an \nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence \npresented in the State court proceedings.\n  So there still is latitude for the Federal judge to disagree with the \ndetermination made by the State court judge. It is my sense, having \nlitigated these cases as an assistant district attorney years ago, in \nthe Federal and State courts, that where there is a miscarriage of \njustice, the Federal court can come to a different decision than was \nmade in the State court proceedings.\n  The language in the habeas corpus reform bill passed earlier this \nyear by the House is even more restrictive than the language in the \nSenate bill. The House bill contains a provision that precludes the \ngranting of a writ of habeas corpus unless the State court's decision \nis arbitrary. This is an even more restrictive standard than that in \nthe Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, in the legislation which is pending before us, there \nare provisions which I consider a step backward from the bill which \npassed the Senate in 1990, which would have eliminated the requirement \nof exhaustion of State court remedies.\n  Were I to craft a bill myself, I would not require an exhaustion of \nState court remedies before the filing of a Federal habeas corpus \npetition because if that exhaustion requirement were not present there \nwould be a much more orderly and a prompt disposition of these \ncontested issues.\n  Were exhaustion of State remedies not necessary, we would not have \nthe interminable tennis match back and forth between the State and \nFederal courts as illustrated by the Pennsylvania case of Peoples \nversus Castille, which is illustrative of the complexity of bouncing \nback and forth between the courts.\n  In the Peoples case, the defendant was convicted in the State court \nof aggravated assault. The conviction was reviewed and upheld by the \nPennsylvania superior court, an intermediate appellate court. Then the \ncase went to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on what is called an \nallocatur application, a request for review. The Supreme Court of \nPennsylvania denied the petition for allocatur but the court may do so \neither considering the case on the merits or refusing to hear it as a \ndiscretionary matter.\n  The defendant then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which sent the \ncase back to the State court, holding that Peoples had failed to \nexhaust his available State remedies because it was unclear whether the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court had considered the merits in denying \nallocatur.\n  The case then went from the district court to the court of appeals \nwhich reversed the district court, saying that there had been an \nadequate exhaustion of State court remedies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The State then went to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates which hears few cases. Thousands apply and the year in which the \ncourt agreed to hear this appeal only about 150 cases were heard. They \ntook this case. The Supreme Court of the United States then reversed \nthe circuit court and sent the case back to the district court.\n  Now, had there been no requirement for an exhaustion of State court \nremedies, the case could have had one hearing in the Federal court, all \nof the issues would have been decided, and I think decided about the \nsame way if we did not have State court proceedings, bearing in mind \nthat there had already been a full decision by a State appellate court \nwhich had upheld the judgment of conviction in the first instance.\n  What we are really looking at with about 2,900 inmates on death row, \nthere were only 38 cases in which the death penalty was carried out. It \nwould be very much in the interests of the objective of swiftness and \ncertainty to put an end to the long delays. Eliminating the requirement \nof exhaustion of State remedies would go a long way to achieving these \ngoals.\n  The State prosecutors and the attorneys general, however, disagree \nwith my view as to what is in the public interest on the issue of \nexhaustion. We have the same objective. That is, to make the punishment \nswift and certain, to eliminate the long delays which are a detriment \nto law enforcement and undermine the deterrent effect of the death \npenalty, not to have the matter come to closure for the families of the \nvictims, and not to harm the interests of the defendants, as \ninterpreted by some international tribunals, which say it is cruel and \nunusual punishment to have the cases last longer than 6 to 8 years, an \nissue also raised by two of the current Justices of the Supreme Court, \nas I mentioned earlier today. I will not go into that because of the \nlimitation of time.\n  The issue of exhaustion of State remedies has been eliminated, \nhowever, because this bill does not abolish to exhaustion requirement. \nUnlie the resolution of this issue in the 1990 legislation, which \npassed the Senate, which eliminated the requirement of exhaustion of \nState remedies, that provision is not in this bill.\n  I refer to that to illustrate how uniformity and consensus cannot be \nachieved on these difficult issues, and different people will have \ndifferent views. But what we come down to at bottom in this legislation \nthat is currently crafted, I think, is a realistic compromise. I think \ndefendants' rights are protected. There are increased protections in \nthis legislation with the appointment of counsel. We have the \nrequirement that there are timetables and limitations periods so the \ndefendants' rights, the States rights, and the victims' rights are all \nprotected.\n  I think it is a carefully crafted compromise which ought to be \nenacted to promote the interests of all parties involved. That is why I \nurge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware on this state of the record.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding to me at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I have enjoyed \nworking with him on this Specter-Hatch habeas corpus reform. Without \nhim I do not think we would be nearly as far along as we are, so I want \nto personally thank him for the efforts he has put forward.\n  Let me get back to what I was saying. Look at all the reviews these \ncases have: The trial, the direct review to the intermediate court, the \ndirect review to the State supreme court, the direct review to the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America, petition to the Governor \nfor clemency.\n  But that is not the end. In virtually every State a postconviction \ncollateral proceeding exists. In other words, the petitioner can file a \nhabeas corpus petition in State court. The petition is routinely \nsubject to appellate review by an intermediate court and the State \nsupreme court. The prisoner then may file a second petition in the U.S. \nSupreme Court and may also, of course, seek a second review of that by \nthe Governor. So after conviction we have at least six levels of review \nby State courts, two rounds of review at least in capital cases by the \nState executive.\n  Contrary to the impression that may be left by some of my colleagues \non the other side of this issue, Federal habeas review does not take \nplace until well after conviction and numerous rounds of direct and \ncollateral review.\n  The Supreme Court has clearly held in Goeke versus Branch that habeas \nreview is not an essential prerequisite to conviction. Indeed, this \nvery term the Supreme Court reaffirmed that principle that the \nConstitution does not even require direct review as a prerequisite for \na valid conviction, and that is the Goeke case. [[Page S7848]] \n  Now that we have the proper context for this debate, let us look at \nthe proposed standard again. Under the standard contained in S. 735, \nFederal courts would be required to defer to the determinations of \nState courts unless the State court's decision was ``contrary to or \ninvolved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law \nas determined by the Supreme Court.''\n  That is a wholly appropriate standard. It enables the Federal court \nto overturn State court decisions that clearly contravene Federal law. \nIndeed, this standard essentially gives the Federal court the authority \nto review de novo whether the State court decided the claim in \ncontravention of Federal law.\n  Moreover, the Federal standard, this review standard proposed in S. \n735, allows the Federal court to review State court decisions that \nimproperly apply clearly established Federal law. In other words, if \nthe State court unreasonably applied Federal law its determination is \nsubject to review by the Federal courts.\n  What does this mean? It means that if the State court reasonably \napplied Federal law, its decision must be upheld. Why is that a \nproblematic standard? After all, Federal habeas review exists to \ncorrect fundamental defects in the law. If the State court has \nreasonably applied Federal law it is hard to say that a fundamental \ndefect exists.\n  The Supreme Court in Harlow versus Fitzgerald has held that if the \npolice officer's conduct was reasonable, no claim for damages under \nBivens versus Six Unknown Agents can be maintained.\n  In Leon versus United States, the Supreme Court held if the police \nofficer's conduct in conducting a search was reasonable, no fourth \namendment violation ensues or would obtain, and the court could not \norder suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of the search.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed the principle that no \nremedy is available where the Government acts reasonably. Why, then, \ngiven this preference for reasonableness in the law, should we empower \na Federal court to reverse a State court's reasonable application of \nFederal law to the facts? If we give that power that Senator Biden will \ngive, we have hundreds of judges who do not like the death penalty, who \nare just going to give repeated habeas corpus reviews any time some \nclever defense lawyer demands it--which is exactly what we have today.\n  Our proposed standard simply ends the improper review of State court \ndecisions. After all, State courts are required to uphold the \nConstitution and to faithfully apply Federal law so there is no reason \nfor what the distinguished Senator from Delaware is arguing for.\n  He does not believe in the death penalty. I understand that. I \nrespect him for that. But the arguments against meaningful habeas \nreform, like we have in this bill, are in reality arguments against the \ndeath penalty. If that is so, then let us debate the efficacy of the \ndeath penalty. Let us not continue frivolous appeal after frivolous \nappeal at a cost of billions of dollars in this society, just because \nwe do not like the death penalty. Let us decide whether death is the \nappropriate sanction for people like those who murdered 168 individuals \nin Oklahoma City, for whom I am wearing this memorial set of ribbons \npinned on me by the daughter of one of the victims, somebody, I have to \nsay, by whom I was very moved.\n  I am prepared to debate the point on whether or not the death penalty \nis an appropriate penalty. But let us not disguise the argument under \nthe guise of phony habeas corpus.\n  The second argument I think my friends are making is that they \nfundamentally distrust the decisions of the State courts. It is an \ninsult to all of the wonderful, fine State court judges around this \ncountry. They cannot show cases that literally show that the State \ncourts cannot do the job.\n  Let me just give an illustration. We have heard a lot about the Rubin \nCarter case, ``Hurricane'' Carter. The fact of the matter is we have \nheard all kinds of arguments relating to that case.\n  He is supposed to be an innocent individual, falsely held in prison \ndespite his innocence. As a trial lawyer, I know that you should always \nbe suspicious of alleged evidence offered at the last minute by your \nopponents. And this Carter case is no different.\n  Here, at the last minute, we hear about still one more apocryphal, \nhighly disputed case on which there is absolutely no agreement \nwhatsoever about the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\n  First we are told that Carter was falsely convicted in New York--\nwell, he was convicted for murder--twice, but in New Jersey. Then we \nare told that he served 28 months, when, in fact, he served for nearly \n20 years. And now, we are told, without any supporting proof, that he \nis innocent of the very murders that two juries have found--beyond a \nreasonable doubt--that he committed. And we are supposed to believe \nthese unsupported allegations of innocence--allegations made by \nSenators who don't even know what State Rubin Carter was tried in?\n  These allegations are directly disputed by the prosecutors in New \nJersey who know this case best. They are directly disputed by every \njury and every court that has reviewed this case. And we should \nremember that it was Judge Lee Sarokin--\n a very liberal judge--who was the district judge that released Rubin \nCarter, after nearly 20 years in jail. And he released him not because \nhe was innocent, but because of a procedural objection to the \ncomposition of the jury. An objection raised 20 years after the fact.\n\n  The Carter case does not show the value of Federal habeas corpus--the \nCarter case is a fresh indictment of the current system. It shows more \nclearly than ever, that if you can get your habeas petition before the \nright liberal Federal judge, you can get out of State prison, \nregardless of your innocence or guilt.\n  Here is what the New York Times--one of the most liberal papers in \nour Nation--said about Judge Sarokin's decision in the Carter case: it \nsaid that the judge's decision was ``flawed by excessive lecturing on \nthe need for `compassion' and the injustice of a possible third trial'' \nfor Rubin Carter. Well, I submit that the Federal courts are not \nempaneled to provide compassion, they are there to provide justice. In \nthe area of habeas, they are there to provide a constitutional back-up \nfor constitutional issues. The Hatch/Dole bill preserves that function \nof the Federal courts.\n  The floor of the U.S. Senate is not the place to determine the guilt \nor innocence of persons involved in highly disputed cases. That is what \nhearings are for.\n  Where were these defenders of the alleged innocence of this three-\ntime murderer when the Judiciary Committee held hearing after hearing \non the specific question of whether habeas corpus was needed to protect \ninnocent prisoners? They were nowhere.\n  I have asked witness after witness to show me a case--even one case--\nwhere Federal habeas corpus has been used to free an innocent man or \nwoman, and not one case has been cited. Specifically, I asked Chief \nJudge Charles Clark of the fifth circuit if he could name even one case \nthat he had ever seen in which Federal habeas corpus had resulted in \nthe release or retrial of an innocent man. And he could not. Yet he was \nthe chief judge of the largest circuit in the Nation--running from \nTexas to Florida in those days. Not one case.\n  So forgive me if I am a bit reluctant to accept today the unsupported \nallegations made on the Senate floor as to the alleged innocence of \nprisoners who have long been held to be guilty of serious crimes.`\n  It should also be pointed out that the Carter case rebuts entirely \nthe point that the Senator from Delaware has made several times to the \neffect that habeas petitions only result in retrials--they do not \nresult in release. So he says. But there was no retrial for Rubin \nCarter--nor could there be after 20 years. He was released outright--\ndespite the jury verdict that he murdered three individuals.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. We can go on and on. There are a number of others. \nVirtually every case brought up--I do not know the Garrett case, but \nevery case brought up can be distinguished.\n  The Frank case, cited by Senator Biden, involved a lynching. There \nwas nothing State or Federal corrective process could have done to help \nMr. Frank. It was wrong that they lynched [[Page S7849]] him, but it \nhappened. That case, decided in 1915, occurred at a very different time \nand under very different circumstances. That is not applicable to this \ndebate. We can go on and on.\n  Madam President, this is the most important stage in criminal law in \nthe last 30 years, and maybe in our lifetime. This is a change to stop \nthe incessant frivolous appeals that are eating our country alive. We \nhave the chance to really, really do something about this while at the \nsame time protecting constitutional rights and civil liberties for \neverybody, and doing it in an appropriate, legally sound manner. This \namendment will do that.\n  I hope we will vote down all of these amendments that we have heard \ndebated here today.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote on the motion to table \nthe Biden amendment No. 1253 be the standard 15-minute vote and that \nall remaining stacked votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--I have the \napproval of Senator Biden to do this--on behalf of myself and Senator \nBiden, that all action on amendment No. 1241 be vitiated, the Heflin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, do we have rollcall votes ordered on \nevery one of the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have rollcall votes ordered on the first \nthree with the exception of 1224.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the Biden amendment, and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, a rollcall vote is ordered on one which \nis not a motion to table, and the rest are motions to table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 1253\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Utah to lay on the table amendment No. 1253 offered by \nthe Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden].

Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1254) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to reconsider.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Comprehensive \nTerrorism Prevention Act. The Oklahoma City bombing brought into sharp \nfocus the reality and horror of domestic terrorism in America. The \ndeath toll of the bombing now stands at 167, making it the deadliest \nmass murder in the history of the United States. This legislation will \nenhance the ability of law enforcement to combat both foreign and \ndomestic terrorism. It is a strong, adequate response to the serious \nproblem of terrorism, and will provide the United States with the \nnecessary tools to respond to the international and domestic terrorist \nthreats and prosecute these despicable acts to the fullest extent of \nthe law.\n  Madam President, I had wanted to offer an amendment to this bill that \nwas designed to make a technical correction to the existing law banning \nhandgun bullets capable of piercing body armor. Law enforcement \nrepresents the first line of defense against threats to our internal \nsecurity. My amendment therefore was designed to give the maximum level \nof protection to our police officers by extending the current \ncomposition-based ban on cop-killing bullets to provide that any bullet \ncapable of penetrating body armor will be banned, regardless of the \nbullet's physical composition. I decided not to pursue adoption of the \namendment, however, because of my concern that it would slow action on \nthis important bill. I intend to offer this amendment to the next \nappropriate vehicle.\n  Madam President, the provisions in this bill are vitally important to \nour efforts to respond to international and domestic threats of \nterrorism. I, therefore, fully support this bill, and I am confident \nthat because of our actions today, America will be more fortified \nagainst the evils of terrorism.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President. Today, as the Senate considers final \npassage of S. 735, legislation designed to combat domestic and \ninternational terrorism, I regret that I must oppose the final version \nof the bill. I regret it because I believe that appropriate steps can \nbe taken by this Congress to add to the tools currently available to \nlaw enforcement to combat terrorism. Especially in light of the recent, \nhorrific tragedy in Oklahoma City, enhancement of the ability to combat \nthe growing menace of terrorism is timely and necessary.\n  However, as Congress rushes to respond, we can not let our fervor for \naction allow us to unwisely circumscribe basic protections long \nenshrined in our Constitution. Unfortunately, I believe that as the \nbill stands, the Senate has gone too far in changing and restricting \nthe application and availability of the right to appeal court decisions \nunder the writ of habeas corpus. This writ has been a fundamental part \nof our jurisprudence since our country's founding. It is a critical \npart of the means by which our system of justice guarantees that \neveryone has the opportunity for a fair trial and that the rights \ngranted under the U.S. Constitution will be respected and enforced.\n  With this time-honored tradition of habeas corpus so much a part of \nthe bedrock legal principles which underpin our society, why are we \nconsidering changing it all? The answer is clear and has been readily \nacknowledged by the proponents of this so-called reform: they want to \nexpedite the execution of those who have received the death penalty. It \nis that simple. There is no other driving force behind these efforts; \nefforts which incidentally have been around for years now. Those who \nfavor the death penalty are frustrated that appeals under habeas corpus \nare available for those who protest their innocence and claim they were \ndenied a fair trial. They argue that with an appeals process that lasts \nfor years, the deterrent effect of the death penalty is lost. Thus, \nthey want to drastically limit the ability of those convicted of crimes \nand given the death penalty to appeal their convictions, despite the \nfact that the sentence, if carried out, is irreversible and final.\n  Let me be clear. I harbor no sympathy for those appropriately found \nguilty of murder and strongly believe that it is critical that they \nface certain and severe punishment, including life in prison without \nparole. The victims deserve no less, the criminal deserves no more. \nHowever, I do oppose the death penalty. I do so because I believe that \nthe death penalty is not a conscionable punishment in a civilized \nsociety. The reason is obvious; the death penalty once carried out \ncannot be reversed if turns out that an individual really was innocent. \nIndeed, I note that the last time an individual was executed in my \nstate of Rhode Island, it was later proved that he did not commit the \ncrime. It strikes me as remarkable that in a legal system which has the \ndeath penalty, such as ours, that procedures would be sought which \nlimit the opportunities otherwise available for an individual to prove \nhis innocence. If anything, I believe that additional avenues should be \navailable for the proof of innocence, not fewer. But the bill before us \ntoday does just that--it limits the rights of the accused to have their \nconvictions reviewed for error. This is wrong and in my opinion, a sad \nday in the U.S. Senate.\n  Accordingly, I feel that the limited good done by the bill--by which \nI mean the commendable efforts to fight terrorism--is outweighed by the \nattack on habeas corpus which has been included. Interestingly enough, \nefforts to limit the changes in habeas corpus to apply only to Federal \nterrorism cases, the supposed reason for this bill, were rejected. The \nentire habeas corpus system, meaning for both those cases brought in \nState and Federal courts, has been changed. It brings into question the \ntrue motivations behind attaching this language to this bill--a bill \nthat on its face has great public appeal and is being moved by a sense \nof urgency given the events in Oklahoma City in April. But despite my \nprofound sympathy for the victims of the bombing in Oklahoma City--\nindeed as well as all terrorist acts--and my desire to do something \nabout relieving the pain they suffer, I believe that in good \nconscience, I cannot support the bill as it stands given the changes it \ncontains to habeas corpus.\n                JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CRIMINAL ALIEN CASES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, section 303(e) broadens the class of \ncriminal aliens subject to special expedited deportation procedures and \neliminates all judicial review.\n  Every Member of this body is willing to take every reasonable step to \npunish criminal aliens and deport them from the United States.\n  But the Justice Department reports that this provision is a step \nbackward [[Page S7852]] in our fight against crime. It disrupts strong \nprovisions against criminal aliens enacted in last year's crime bill \nand only recently implemented through regulation. It ties the Attorney \nGeneral's hands in obtaining convictions against criminal aliens. And \nit eliminates all judicial review in these cases--a major departure \nfrom fundamental principles of due process.\n  This provision harms our crime fighting efforts in at least three \nways.\n  First, it eliminates the Attorney General's ability to target the \nremoval of the most serious offenders within the resources she has \navailable. It applies to all criminal aliens, regardless of the gravity \nof their offense. Under current law, only aggravated felons--those \ncommitting the most serious offenses--are placed in expedited \nproceedings. Under this section, however, all criminal aliens must be \nremoved within 30 days, whether they are murderers or petty \nshoplifters.\n  An immigrant with an American citizen wife and children sentenced to \n1-year probation for minor tax evasion and fraud would be subject to \nthis procedure. And under this provision, he would be treated the same \nas ax murderers and drug lords. INS is required to detain him. He gets \na quick deportation hearing from an immigration judge in the Justice \nDepartment and he is out within 30 days--no judicial review, no \nnothing.\n  Over the past 2 years, the President and Congress have increased \nsubstantially the number of immigration officers and immigration judges \nto handle these cases. As a result, over the next year, the \nadministration will double the number of criminal aliens deported to \nmore than 58,000.\n  But even with the additional funds, resources are still limited. The \nJustice Department would be required to divert resources from the \nBorder Patrol, from naturalization, and from other important activities \nto accommodate this provision.\n  The Immigration Subcommittee is now considering legislation which \nwill reform the criminal alien definitions. We should allow that \nprocess to proceed, rather than make premature and drastic changes in \nthe current definition and due process.\n  The second way in which this provision harms law enforcement is that \nit requires the Attorney General to detain all those in this broadened \ncategory of criminal aliens, with no allowance for those whose home \ncountries will not or cannot take them back. This is the case today \nwith Cuba, Vietnam, and Bosnia. In these cases, the Attorney General \nwould be required to keep the alien in indefinite detention, even if \nthe offense is relatively light and the Attorney General believes the \nalien would pose no danger to the community.\n  This is a drastic and unnecessary expense to the taxpayer. It takes \njail space and resources away from more pressing criminal enforcement.\n  Under this provision, a Cuban refugee convicted of shoplifting in \ncertain States could face life imprisonment in an INS jail.\n  Finally, by providing that all criminal aliens be removed within 30 \ndays of the issuance of a deportation order, the provision ignores real \nlaw enforcement needs. The 30-day requirement may be waived where \ncriminal aliens are cooperating with law enforcement as witnesses. \nHowever, there is no allowance for other law enforcement purposes. For \nexample, an alien convicted and ordered deported for one offense could \nnot be held in the United States for trial under other offenses for \nwhich the alien may subsequently be charged.\n  In the World Trade Center bombing, for example, one of the suspected \nconspirators in the case was already in jail for another crime. Under \nthis provision, he would be subjected to mandatory deportation within \n30 days of the issuance of a deportation order for the first crime, and \nwould not be available for prosecution under the second--and far more \nserious--crime.\n  In addition to undermining the war on crime, this amendment virtually \neliminates the Attorney General's flexibility to grant discretionary \nrelief from deportation for long-time permanent residents convicted of \nlesser crimes. This discretionary relief is available to permanent \nresidents who have resided here for at least 7 years. It is granted if \nthe immigration judge believes their equities in the United States--\nsuch as American citizen spouses or children or contributions to their \ncommunities--outweigh the gravity of their offense.\n  Under current law, permanent residents with aggravated felony \nconvictions who serve at least 5 years in prison are ineligible for \nthis discretionary relief from deportation. However, under this \nprovision, this discretionary relief would be denied to permanent \nresidents for carrying a concealed firearm, drug abuse, or addiction, \nin which no conviction would even be required, any drug\n offense involving more than 30 grams of marijuana, and other such \ncrimes. They could live here productively for 30 years and have an \nAmerican citizen wife and children. But for them, it is one strike and \nyou are out.\n\n  Similarly, refugees could also be deported to the hands of their \npersecutors for relatively small offenses.\n  Under this provision, for example, a refugee from Rwanda could put a \nbill in the mailbox and realize he forgot to put a stamp on it. When he \ninnocently tries to remove the letter from the mailbox and he is \narrested for tampering with the mail--a felony. Due to poor \nrepresentation, he accepts a plea bargained sentence of 1 year. To his \nsurprise, he is suddenly subject to expedited deportation with no \njudicial review.\n  Under this provision, an older immigrant who came to the United \nStates as a child but was never naturalized gets tired of a rash of \nrobberies on her store and buys a firearm which she doesn't realize is \nillegal. She is convicted of a felony. Even though she is married to an \nAmerican and has four U.S.-citizen children, she must be placed in \nexpedited deportation proceedings with no recourse to the courts.\n  A long-time permanent resident could decide to go fishing. He hooks \nand kills what he does not realize is a rare fish, which is a strict \nliability felony with a mandatory minimum of 1 year. Even though he is \nmarried to an American and has U.S.-citizen children, he is convicted, \nserves his time, and is immediately deported with no prospect for \njudicial review.\n  These are the kinds of cases which can easily happen if this drastic \nprovision is allowed to stand.\n  Even if we accept--as this provision proposes--that virtually any \noffense results in automatic deportation, the elimination of judicial \nreview alone would be grounds for opposing this provision. This is a \nmajor departure from fair principles of due process.\n  The need for judicial review in this instance is obvious. Immigration \njudges in the Justice Department make mistakes.\n  For example, in a recent ninth circuit case, the panel reviewed an \nimmigration judge's deportation order against someone convicted of drug \ntrafficking who claimed to be a U.S. citizen but did not have a lawyer. \nThe court found that the immigration judge's order was ``not based on \nsubstantial evidence.'' In this case, a possible U.S. citizen could \nhave been erroneously deported if the court had not intervened.\n  It is because of cases such as these that the standing policy of the \nAmerican Bar Association is that legislation should not:\n\n       Limit the availability and scope of judicial review of \n     administrative decisions under the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act to less than what is provided . . . in the \n     Administrative Procedures Act: in particular judicial review \n     of . . . denials of stays of execution of exclusion or \n     deportation orders . . . and constitutional and statutory \n     writs of habeas corpus.\n\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to the counter-terrorism bill \nwhich would correct these problems. While I will not offer the \namendment at this time, it is my hope that the grave problems of the \ncurrent language will be addressed as the bill proceeds.\n  The provision in the pending bill would do nothing to enhance our \nability to exclude suspected terrorists. It would impede current \nefforts to remove dangerous criminal aliens. And I hope it will be \naddressed at a later stage.\n                      alien terrorist removal act\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to commend Senators \nDole and Hatch for incorporating my bill, S. 270, the Alien Terrorist \nRemoval Act of 1995, into S. 735, the comprehensive antiterrorism \nlegislation now before the Senate. [[Page S7853]] \n  I also want to thank Senator Specter again for the opportunity to \ntestify before his Terrorism Subcommittee last month regarding my alien \nterrorist removal bill.\n  My bill--now the alien terrorist removal title of S. 735--essentially \nembodies the Smith-Simpson amendment that the Senate passed unanimously \nas part of the crime bill in the last Congress. Unfortunately, certain \nHouse Members of the conference committee insisted on the removal of \nthe Smith-Simpson amendment from the 1994 crime bill.\n  This year, however, Madam President, the Clinton administration \nproposed its own substantially identical version of my bill as a part \nof its omnibus antiterrorism legislation. Thus, I am confident that the \nalien terrorist removal title of S. 735 will enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport here in the Senate, will be supported by the House as well, and \nwill be signed into law by the President in the next few weeks.\n  Let me summarize briefly for the benefit of my colleagues what the \nalien terrorist removal title of S. 735 is all about. The alien \nterrorist removal provisions of the bill would establish a new, \nspecial, judicial procedure under which classified information can be \nused to establish the deportability of alien terrorists.\n  The new procedures provided under title III of S. 735 are carefully \ndesigned to safeguard national security interests, while at the same \ntime according appropriate protection to the necessarily limited \nconstitutional due process rights of aliens.\n  Under current law, Madam President, classified information cannot be \nused to establish the deportability of terrorist aliens. Thus, when \nthere is insufficient unclassified information available to establish \nthe deportability of a terrorist alien, the Government faces two \nequally unacceptable choices.\n  First, the Justice Department could declassify enough of its evidence \nagainst the alien in question to establish his deportability.\n  Sometimes, however, that simply cannot be done because the classified \ninformation in question is so sensitive that its disclosure would \nendanger the lives of human sources or compromise highly sensitive \nmethods of intelligence gathering.\n  The Government's second, and equally untenable, choice would be \nsimply to let the terrorist alien involved remain in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, that is not just a hypothetical situation. It happens \nin real cases. That is why the Department of\n Justice--under both Republican and Democratic Presidents and Attorneys \nGeneral--has been asking for the authority granted by my bill--now \ntitle III of S. 735--since 1988.\n\n  Utilizing the existing definitions of terrorism in the Immigration \nAct of 1990 and of classified information in the Classified Information \nProcedures Act, title III of S. 735 would establish a special alien \nterrorist removal court made up of sitting U.S. District Judges that is \nmodeled on the special court that was created by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Under title III of S. 735, the U.S. district judge sitting as the \nspecial court would personally review the classified information \ninvolved.\n  Without the compromising classified information, the alien in \nquestion would be provided an unclassified summary of the classified \ninformation involved.\n  Ultimately, the special court would determine whether, considering \nthe record as a whole, the Justice Department has proven, by clear and \nconvincing evidence, that the alien is a terrorist and should be \nremoved from the United States.\n  Finally, any alien ordered removed under the provisions of title III \nof S. 735 would have the right to appeal to the full U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  In closing, let me say that the most serious threat that our Nation \nfaces in the post-cold-war world is the scourge of terrorism.\n  Foreign terrorism came to our shores in 1993 with the World Trade \nCenter bombing. Tragically, with the Oklahoma City bombing in April, we \nlearned the bitter lesson that we face the threat of terrorism from \ndomestic extremists as well.\n  Now, this historic 104th Congress is doing its job by moving quickly \nto respond to those twin threats. I urge the prompt passage of S. 735 \nand, once again, I commend the sponsors for incorporating my alien \nterrorist removal bill into their landmark legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, after the despicable attack on the \nMurrah Federal building in Oklahoma City almost 2 months ago, I reacted \nwith the same feelings of shock and outrage as millions of other \nAmericans.\n  Those feelings run deeper than language can adequately describe. The \npictures of the ravaged building, the stories of the victims and the \nfamilies will never be forgotten.\n  Madam President, there should be absolutely no debate about our \nnational resolve to fight terrorism and to keep it from our shores. No \nAmerican wants to fear that the kind of thing that happened in Oklahoma \nor at the World Trade Center in New York will occur in their hometown \nor that one of their loved ones will be hurt by this kind of heinous \nact.\n  Fighting terrorism requires that we take strong and forceful steps to \nstop terrorists before they strike, and if they do strike, to \nprosecute, convict and punish them.\n  We need to make sure that law enforcement officers have the resources \nto investigate and prosecute terrorist acts; we need to give them tools \nto apprehend terrorists before they strike.\n  There are a number of provisions of this legislation that are aimed \nat achieving that goal, and I strongly support those proposals.\n  The bill would make available about $1.2 billion to increase law \nenforcement resources to carry out these tasks. There are provisions \nadded during floor consideration to provide for tracer elements to be \nplaced in explosives to help identify where these materials are likely \nto have originated. There are other provisions included in this bill \nthat are also likely to help us fight terrorist threats.\n  Nevertheless, I intend to vote against this legislation. I believe \nthat in the haste to respond to a national tragedy, we may be making \nmistakes that will be difficult to undo.\n  There are a number of provisions in this legislation that are \nproblematic, and quite frankly, I am equally concerned about the \nprocess which brought this measure to the floor of the Senate, the \nhasty debate, and the pressure to clear the measure without \nunderstanding the implications of what is being proposed.\n  The Administration proposed legislation to deal with international \nterrorism earlier this year; that initial proposal was quickly reshaped \nas a result of the Oklahoma City tragedy into a bill to deal with \ndomestic terrorism. Although hearings were held in the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Committee never met to debate the bill, there is no \ncommittee report, and the measure which was called up by the leader was \ndrafted in private and introduced shortly before many Members left town \nfor the Memorial Day recess.\n  It has also become the vehicle for what is called ``habeas corpus \nreform.'' What is described as ``reform'' is in fact an attempt to \nrewrite and weaken what is known as the ``Great Writ''--the common law \ninstrument that allowed citizens to challenge the lawfulness of their \ndetention by the crown. Suddenly, habeas reform has become a tool for \nfighting terrorism. I find that a stretch of the imagination. What we \nhave is a classic, political move to get another agenda wrapped into an \nemotionally charged, moving vehicle.\n  In the past year, many of our basic, fundamental protections against \ngovernment intrusion contained in the Bill of Rights have been under \nassault. I think many Americans are unaware that these reform movements \nare in fact assaults upon fundamental rights--not just the rights of \ncriminals, but the rights of all Americans to be free from government \noverreaching and harassment.\n  I spoke at some length earlier today on my very grave concerns about \nhow the so-called habeas reforms engrafted into this bill aimed at \nspeeding up executions threaten the rights of the innocent and raise \nthe spectre of gross miscarriage of justice taking place.\n  There are also a number of other provisions of this bill that I \nbelieve are either not well thought out or misguided.\n  For example, last night the Senate adopted by a voice vote an \namendment [[Page S7854]] authorizing a greater role for the military in \ndomestic antiterrorism activities.\n  Provisions dealing with this issue were included in the \nadministration's original proposal and they were of great concern to me \nand a number of Senators who do not believe that the military should be \nplaying a role in domestic law enforcement efforts.\n  Madam President, one of the hallmarks of a democratic society is the \nseparation of the military--whose primary function is to defend the \nNation from outside threats--from internal law enforcement \nresponsibilities. Military dictatorships use soldiers to enforce their \nlaws; democracies do not.\n  This country has a very closely defined set of rules, arising out of \nthe Bill of Rights itself and applied by our judicial system, which \nguarantee due process and fairness in the administration of justice. \nLaw enforcement personnel are trained in carrying out these rules; \nsoldiers are not.\n  I recognized, Madam President, that a very sincere effort was made by \na number of the principal authors of these provisions to craft a very \nnarrow exception to the posse comitatus law, the 1878 statute which \nlimits the role of the military in domestic law enforcement activities.\n  However, I believe that both the process used to craft this amendment \nand the substance of this amendment are flawed. This broadening of the \nauthority of the military, albeit in a narrow area, was not part of a \nbill reported by the committees of jurisdiction, but rather was \nintroduced and voice voted within the span of a few hours last night. \nThere were no hearings on this specific proposal, no committee report \nfiled outlining the expectations of how it will operate, and no real \npublic debate over its provisions. Rather, we had a voice vote on \nlanguage most of us had first seen a few hours earlier.\n  That is not the way to deal with such a fundamental issue. There is \nno reason for this hasty disposition of this kind of important issue.\n  Beyond the process used, I have concerns about whether the amendment \nitself may operate to open the door to perhaps an even broader role for \nthe military than even the administration had initially proposed. The \nadministration's proposal did not explicitly give the military the \nauthority to make an arrest, although it had language about disabling \nand disarming individuals that was troublesome. The amendment adopted \nlast night gives the Department of Justice and the Department of \nDefense the\n authority to promulgate regulations governing the role of the military \nand provides that those regulations shall not authorize arrests by the \nmilitary except under ``exigent circumstances'' or as otherwise \nauthorized by law. In other words, the military is given the power to \nmake arrests, but the regulations will limit that authority to certain \ncircumstances.\n\n  Madam President, while I recognize the authority being created is \nlimited to cases involving biological or chemical weapons, I am \nconcerned that we have opened a door that may be hard to close in the \nfuture when the case is made that the military can play a greater role, \nfor example, in the war on drugs or other areas which have been the \nsubject of heightened public concern. I do not believe that it is \nnecessary to give the military arrest powers within the U.S. If \nmilitary needs to be involved in a domestic investigation, I believe \nthat civilian law enforcement officials should be present and available \nto make any arrests needed. The notion that military personnel will be \noperating without accompanying civilian officials is very troubling. If \nauthority is needed to detain an individual until a civilian law \nenforcement official arrives, arguments can be made for that authority, \nbut that does not justify, in my mind, granting a direct power to make \nan arrest under any type of circumstances.\n  Madam President, in a similar vein, I am concerned about the \namendment adopted yesterday which loosens the requirements in current \nlaw for issuance of a warrant for what is called a ``roaming'' or \n``roving'' wiretap. The Fourth Amendment, in very explicit language, \nrequires that no search warrant may issue unless ``particularly \ndescribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized.''\n  The Fourth Amendment was written in such precise terms because the \ndrafters of the Constitution were aware of the practice of British \nauthorities of obtaining sweeping search warrants that allowed them to \nsearch wherever and whenever they pleased. The rights of the people to \nbe secure in their homes from government officials barging in was not a \nright recognized before the American revolution. It is perhaps a unique \nAmerican right, but it is one that many of us regard as sacrosanct.\n  The requirement for specificity is especially important with respect \nto wire tap authority because a wire tap is particularly invasive--no \none knows that a government agent is listening to your private \nconversations. The law has long required that a wire tap warrant be \nvery narrowly and carefully drawn. Current law allows a roaming wire \ntap--that is one that moves from place to place--only where there is an \nallegation that the suspect is moving form place to place with the \nintent to avoid interception of the communication. The amendment \nadopted strikes the ``intent'' requirement and allows such a wiretap \nwhere the person's actions and conduct would have the effect of \nthwarting interception from a specified facility. Again, this provision \nopens the door to greater government powers. I am not convinced that an \nadequate case has been made that this broader and potentially abusive \nauthority is needed.\n  There are other provisions of the bill that may also have problems \nthat I will not take the time to outline here. In sum, I\n think the bill was hastily crafted and goes beyond what is needed to \ndeal with a terrorist threat.\n\n  Madam President, less than a year ago, I confronted this same \nsituation when the Clinton administration's crime bill came to a final \nvote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Just as with this bill, there were a number of provisions in that \nlegislation that I supported. I supported the concept of putting more \npolice officers on the streets. I supported prevention programs as \nsensible and cost-effective ways to head off criminal activity.\n  But I objected to other provisions.\n  I objected to the expansion of the death penalty, a form of state-\nsponsored violence that few civilized nations practice. I note in \ntoday's papers that the Supreme Court of South Africa, a nation that \nhas executed people for 350 years has ruled that the death penalty \nviolates that nation's constitution.\n  The pending legislation would also add new death penalties to federal \nlaw. I oppose those provisions as well.\n  I also opposed some of the provisions of last year's crime bill that \nI believed amounted to unnecessary and counterproductive Federal \nintrusion into the war on crime, which is best fought at the State and \nlocal level.\n  Because of these objections, I voted against that bill.\n  Because of my objections today, I am voting against this one.\n  I believe that we are acting in haste, making law from outrage and \nnot from deliberation.\n  I believe that despite good intentions and provisions of the bill \nthat would provide additional resources to law enforcement personnel \nfighting terrorists, that we are not passing a thoughtful, meaningful \nresponse to a real threat. Instead, we are rewriting habeas corpus law \nbecause some proponents of these changes saw an opportunity in this \nbill to move their agenda. We are opening the door to a greater role \nfor Federal Government take actions that will invade the lives of our \nconstituents without reasonable grounds.\n  When we act in haste, we multiply our chances of error and I see \nerrors in this bill. I cannot support it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n735, the antiterrorism bill.\n  This bill poses serious dilemmas for me, and for this Congress. It \nrequires us to face some of the real dangers that exist in the modern \nworld, and it motivates us to act in the interest of protecting the \npeople. But it also makes us face the cost of freedoms we enjoy as \nAmericans.\n  It is disturbing to me when the Congress is faced with a decision to \nincrease protection for the people by chipping away at the edges of \nfreedom.\n  But in this case, the imperative is clear. We have heard many \ncompelling [[Page S7855]] stories on this floor about the horrors of \nOklahoma City, the tragedy of the World Trade Center. These stories are \nreal; they involved real Americans in today's world. I need not repeat \nthese stories here. Let me simply acknowledge what we all feel: These \nevents have shaken every American to the core of their being. To reduce \nthe likelihood of such events occurring in the future, and to preserve \na peaceful existence for Americans, we must act.\n  We must empower our law enforcement officials to zero in on terrorist \norganizations, at home and abroad. This bill does that.\n  We must make these crimes a high priority within the judicial system, \nand clearly subject terrorist activities to prosecution. This bill does \nthat.\n  We must cripple the ability of terrorists to finance their activities \nin our own backyard. This bill does that.\n  We must draw on all the expertise of the Government, including the \nmilitary where appropriate. This bill does that.\n  This bill contains many provisions that will improve our ability as a \nnation to prevent, combat, and prosecute against terrorist activities. \nAs a result of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, we \nowe it to the victims to act. As Senators in an increasingly dangerous \nworld, we owe it to all citizens to protect the quality of life unique \nto the United States of America. Therefore, I will support S. 735.\n  Madam President, having said that, I must add a few concerns. I do \nnot think it is ever a good idea to legislate in the heat of the \nmoment. Cases like this are most susceptible to the laws of unintended \nconsequences. As we broaden the reach of law enforcement, and as we \nbroaden the application of penalties, we as elected officials have an \nequal obligation to keep from unnerving the people we are trying to \nprotect. We have no idea what kind of mistakes will be made, or whose \nrights will be infringed, when this bill is implemented. It will be \ncritically important for law enforcement officials of all types to keep \nin mind the responsibilities to protect the citizens that go along with \nthe kind of broad new powers we are bestowing on them.\n  Likewise, we have to recognize the dangers of internal hatred and \nanger. If there is one thing we can conclude from recent tragedies, it \nis this: We must remain vigilant against extremism of all types. These \nare forces that may be motivated by legitimate feelings of frustration \nwith the Government. But there are very clear lines that we must not \ncross. Our system of Government is geared toward discourse and debate; \nif we lose the ability to air out our differences through honest \ndebate, and if we cannot agree to disagree when we have to, the entire \ncountry will suffer. We all have a responsibility to zealously defend \nour collective rights to democratic government.\n  To this end, I feel strongly that all of us--politicians, activists, \ncitizens--have a contribution to make toward maintaining civil \ndiscourse. We can improve the environment dramatically by simply toning \ndown the rhetoric. If we are going to protect constitutional democracy \nand our rights as citizens to express our opinions, we have to learn to \nrespect each other as people.\n  Finally, Madam President, I would like to add a comment regarding the \namendment offered by the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Biden. He rightfully pointed out that this legislation takes on \nan issue that is far too complicated to resolve here: habeas corpus \nreform. This is the wrong time and the wrong bill on which to attempt \nto resolve a debate that has raged in this country for years. As I said \nbefore, I believe it is unwise to legislate in the heat of the moment. \nBy including the limits on habeas corpus in this bill, the majority is \ndoing just that. I believe the Senate should instead have a thorough, \nthoughtful debate about habeas corpus independent of this legislation. \nIt is simply too important to run through the Senate on a bill narrowly \ntargeting antiterrorism activities.\n  Therefore, I support the Biden amendment. While it is obvious the \nvotes are not there to postpone the debate over habeas corpus to a \nlater time, at least the point has been made on the Senate floor.\n  Madam President, I hope my remarks are persuasive in pointing out the \ndilemmas in passing this legislation. While we can take comfort knowing \nthis bill strengthens the hand of law enforcement to aggressively \npursue terrorists, none of us should take comfort in what it might mean \nfor innocents caught in the middle as the antiterrorism effort \nintensifies. I support S. 735 with some reluctance, and sincerely hope \nthat authorities will use their new powers as judiciously as the spirit \nof freedom implores.\n  Madam President, on Monday, June 5, the Senate adopted by a vote of \n90-0 an amendment by the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, to \nrequire the use of taggants to mark materials used in the construction \nof explosives. I was unavoidably detained, and therefore not present \nfor that vote. I apologize to the leaders for my absence; had I been \npresent, I would have voted ``aye'' on the Feinstein amendment. If \nthere is one straight-forward thing we can do to help law enforcement \ninvestigate bombings, it is requiring the use of taggants.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the horrific April 19 bombing of the \nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City shocked and stunned \nAmericans. Every single one of us has been forced to confront the risks \nand the vulnerability of our open society. The United States needs a \nsystematic and comprehensive counterterrorism policy to detect, deter, \nprevent, and punish terrorist acts.\n   Congress must consider and pass an effective antiterrorism bill; we \nmust do so on a bipartisan basis. The problem is too dangerous to be \ntreated in a partisan manner. We must stand together to protect the \ncitizens of the United States.\n  One of the greatest fears that we all have for the safety of our \ncitizens is the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist \nelements. As demonstrated by the recent Tokyo subway tragedy, even very \nlimited use of chemical agents can cause widespread death and disaster. \nWe must ensure that our Nation has the ability to marshall all \navailable assets and expertise to deal with the potential use of mass \ndestruction by terrorists.\n  For that reason, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring an amendment to \nauthorize Department of Defense assistance to law enforcement \nauthorities in emergency situations involving biological and chemical \nweapons. This amendment is patterned on authority which currently \nexists for the Department of Defense to provide technical assistance to \nincidents involving nuclear weapons and materiel. The amendment has \nbeen carefully drawn to limit the involvement of the military in law \nenforcement activities. Indeed, we have focused on the critical need to \nmarshall the unique expertise of the military for use in these \ncatastrophic situations.\n  The legislation pending before the Senate today will lay the \nfoundation for an antiterrorism plan for America.\n  As the Senate considers legislation directed at antiterrorism, I am \naware that we will also consider subsequently during this session \nmodified anticrime legislation. I will continue to support measures \nthat will provide local and State officials, and law enforcement \npersonnel, the appropriate resources needed to combat the rising crime \nrate. This week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released \npreliminary crime reports for 1994. The reports showed crime rates \ndropping from the year before. The crime rate may appear to decrease \nslightly, but not enough to calm the fears of many citizens. Crime will \ncontinue to terrorize Americans until the Congress can assist the \nStates with adequate funds and legal tools necessary to make a drastic \nreduction in the crime rate.\n  I have no doubt that the General Services Administration has stepped \nup security at our Federal buildings as a result of the tragic events \nwhich occurred in Oklahoma City. The House held hearings on Federal \nbuilding security shortly after the event.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, it is my intention to hold a hearing soon regarding \nbuilding security under the auspices of the Federal Protective Service \nof the GSA.\n  I am increasingly concerned by recent reports which have indicated \nthat memos produced within GSA have indicated internal skepticism about \nhow reductions in the Federal Protective [[Page S7856]] Service of the \nGSA could adversely affect the agency's ability to assess and analyze \nFederal building security in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and \nVirginia.\n  It is my intention to review this matter for the Senate.\n   Madam President, while the Senate debates the legislation before us \ntoday, we must all realize that no legislation can make America totally \nsafe. An open, democratic society simply will not allow for total and \nabsolute security for our Nation.\n  Because of the freedom our society demands, we must be evervigilant \nconcerning possible threats to our citizens. I have always been totally \ncommitted to maintaining the readiness of our Armed Forces whenever a \nthreat to our national security becomes imminent. I am also totally \ncommitted to maintaining the readiness of our Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement personnel to confront any domestic threat which may \narise anywhere in the United States.\n  I do have a major concern with this legislation: we must ensure that \nits provisions do not violate the Constitution or place inappropriate \nrestrictions on the personal freedoms protected by the first amendment. \nI will not support provisions which will prohibit free exercise of \nreligion or speech, or which impinge on the freedom of association.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I abhor and condemn terrorism in any \nform. Our Nation cannot tolerate terrorism--be it foreign or domestic--\nand our Nation's law enforcement must have the tools it needs to fight \nthis menace.\n  There are some very important reforms in this bill that would be \nhelpful. They include habeas corpus reform, which is the only change \nthat will really have an impact in the Oklahoma City case.\n  I will vote for this bill in order to send a strong message of \nsupport for those reforms to the House and any future House-Senate \nconference working on this legislation.\n  However, for the record, my vote is not an endorsement of each and \nevery provision of this bill. I am not convinced that the bill before \nus today is the best we can do to assist law enforcement in fighting \nagainst terrorism, and I would like to discuss some of the specific \nreservations I have.\n  First and foremost are potential constitutional problems such as \nthose relating to the sections on restricting fundraising, excluding \nand deporting aliens, the new wiretapping authority we adopted last \nnight, and acquisition of information including consumer records.\n  In all fairness, there are conflicting opinions even among my \ncolleagues who are lawyers about whether some of these provisions will \nsurvive court review. I have been assured that the safeguards contained \nin the bill are sufficient to overcome potential constitutional \nproblems. For that reason, I have decided not to oppose the entire bill \non this basis. However, I remain concerned about these provisions and \nwould hope they can be further improved before the Senate takes action \non a final bill.\n  Another section of the bill that I think could be improved is the new \nlanguage relating to taggants in explosives. Although I joined a \nunanimous Senate in voting for changes made on the floor during debate, \nI am not by any means convinced this is the best way to approach that \nissue. After the Senate acted, I was contacted by several resource-\nbased industries in my State suggesting concerns that had not been \nraised or reviewed previously. I hope the House and any future \nconference will take a close look at that section and make improvements \nthat will balance the interests of law enforcement with those of the \naffected industries.\n  There are other items in this bill that I question, but those are \nsome of the most important, I do not think we would be sacrificing any \ntools needed by law enforcement if we were to make improvements in \nthese sections.\n  I commend the majority leader and Senator Hatch for their hard work \nto deliver a bill that will strengthen the hand of law enforcement in \nfighting terrorism. I hope the bill will be improved as it moves \nthrough the remaining steps of the legislative process, so that I can \nvote for a truly effective package.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the Oklahoma City bombing and the earlier \nbombing of the World Trade Center demonstrate clearly that the United \nStates must respond seriously to those--whether foreign or domestic--\nwho seek to make their point through the mass killing of Americans.\n  These events demand that we examine our current laws and practices to \nensure that we are doing everything that is necessary and appropriate \nto guard against the threat. We must take strong action to counteract \nterrorism, both foreign and domestic.\n  There are steps we can take and should take.\n  Let me outline the key terrorism proposals from the President's bill \nthat are contained in the substitute we will vote on shortly. These \nprovisions include:\n  A new offense to assure Federal jurisdiction over all violent acts \nwhich are motivated by international terrorism.\n  This provision will cover gaps in current Federal law--for example, a \nterrorist who commits mass murder on private or State-owned property \nmay now be subject only to State court jurisdiction.\n  This offense carries a new death penalty, complementing the terrorism \ndeath penalty in last year's crime bill.\n  The bill will implement an international treaty to require a \ndetection agent to be added to plastic explosives.\n  It will enhance the Government's ability to obtain consumer credit \nreports and hotel/motel and vehicle rental records in foreign \nintelligence investigations. It does not change the law governing such \ninformation for domestic investigations.\n  It gives the Government greater ability to exclude from entering the \nUnited States those aliens who are involved in terrorist activities.\n  Let me also mention the amendments offered by Democrats to add tough \nlaw enforcement provisions to the Republican bill.\n  The Lieberman amendment, which was adopted, expands wiretap \nauthority. It gives new authority for multiple-point wiretaps provided \nto Federal law enforcement.\n  Another Lieberman amendment, which was defeated, with no Republicans \nvoting for it, gives authority for emergency wiretaps--identical to \nauthority currently available for organized crime investigations--in \nterrorist investigations.\n  The Feinstein amendment, which was adopted, requires taggants. It \ngives authority to Secretary of the Treasury to require taggants in \nexplosives. Taggants assist law enforcement by providing a means to \ntrace the source of an explosive.\n  The Nunn-Thurmond-Biden-Warner amendment, also adopted, gives new \nassistance against chemical and biological weapons. The posse comitatus \nexception to allow the use of military to assist in the investigations \nof chemical and biological weapons.\n  The Kerrey amendment, also adopted, increases funding for Federal \nantiterrorist enforcement. It adds $262 million for ATF new explosives \ninvestigators and for Secret Service security initiatives.\n  The Boxer amendment, again, adopted, increases penalties for gun and \nexplosives crimes. It extends statute of limitations for National \nFirearms Act offenses.\n  A Levin amendment, adopted by the Senate, increases penalties for the \nuse of explosives.\n  A Feinstein amendment, again, adopted, prohibits the distribution of \nbombmaking material intended to be used for a crime.\n  A Leahy amendment, first as adopted, assists victims of terrorist \nattacks. It provides assistance and compensation for victims of \nterrorist attacks.\n  The Leahy-McCain amendment, as adopted, raises special assessment on \ncriminal penalties.\n  The Specter-Simon-Kennedy amendment, as adopted, deports criminal \naliens. It enhances protection of classified information when deporting \nalien terrorists.\n  Another Feinstein amendment, also adopted, increases international \nefforts against terrorism. It prohibits arms sales to countries who are \nnot cooperating fully with U.S. antiterrorist efforts.\n  Particularly with these tough amendments now added to the bill, this \ncounterterrorism is a big step forward [[Page S7857]] in giving law \nenforcement new tools to fight and prevent terrorism. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me announce for my colleagues, we are going to move to \nthe telecommunications bill after this vote, and I understand Senator \nHollings and Senator Pressler are ready to do that. We will have \nopening statements. I have an amendment that I will offer. I think the \ndistinguished Democratic leader has an amendment he may offer. These \namendments may be accepted. But we are trying to find a couple of bona \nfide amendments that can be offered tonight and voted on in the \nmorning.\n  If that is the case, if we have a couple, we can debate those \namendments tonight and not have any more votes tonight and have those \nvotes in the morning.\n  I will assume we can find one additional amendment so this will be \nthe last vote tonight. Any votes that are ordered tonight will occur \nprobably fairly early in the morning, around 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, are the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can \n     be used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are \n     capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as \n     substantial damage to property and the environment;\n       (2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including \n     byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist \n     activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat \n     of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the \n     United States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons \n     who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear \n     materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for \n     their offenses;\n       (4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and \n     used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has \n     increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the \n     legislation that implemented the Convention on the Physical \n     Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of \n     title 18, United States Code;\n       (5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other \n     countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in \n     increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, \n     thereby decreasing the security of such materials by \n     increasing the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;\n       (6) the illicit trafficking in the relatively more common, \n     commercially available and usable nuclear and byproduct \n     materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life \n     and environmental damage;\n       (7) reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's \n     suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these \n     materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently \n     conducted their black market sales of these materials within \n     the Federal Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, the \n     former Soviet [[Page S7875]] Union, Central Europe, and to a \n     lesser extent in the Middle European countries;\n       (8) the international community has become increasingly \n     concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear \n     byproduct materials;\n       (9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased \n     access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a \n     significant future threat that the United States must use all \n     lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such \n     materials;\n       (10) the United States has an interest in encouraging \n     United States corporations to do business in the countries \n     that comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other \n     developing democracies;\n       (11) protection of such United States corporations from \n     threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is \n     important to the success of the effort to encourage such \n     business ventures, and to further the foreign relations and \n     commerce of the United States;\n       (12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it \n     may affect the health, environment, and property of United \n     States nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal \n     activity occur outside the territory of the United States, \n     and are primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and\n       (13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that \n     provides adequate protection to United States interests from \n     nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and \n     from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held \n     for other than peaceful purposes.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     Federal law enforcement agencies the necessary tools and \n     fullest possible basis allowed under the Constitution to \n     combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation \n     that may result from illegal possession and use of \n     radioactive materials.\n\n     SEC. 802.

Madam President, I would like to thank Bob Dole for his \nstrong leadership. It was an honor to work with him. Arlen Specter for \nhis legal acumen, Joe Biden for his statesmanship and Don Nickles and \nJames Inhofe for their able input. All of these Senators were vital to \nthe passage of this bill.\n  I would also like to commend the following staffers for their long, \nhard work:\n  Democrats: Cynthia Hogan, Ankor Gouel, Chris Putals, Demetra Lambros, \nMimi Murphy, Tracy Doherty, and Mike O'Leary.\n  Republicans: Mike O'Neill and Mike Kennedy. These two men worked, \nliterally, around the clock. Also, Ashley Disque, John Gibbons, Dennis \nShea, Richard Hertling, Lee Otis, Eric Mayfield, and Manus Cooney.\n  All of these people helped make this bill possible. The President \ncalled on Congress for swift action, and we delivered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, immediately after the Oklahoma City \ntragedy, President Clinton was right on target when he said that the \nperpetrators of this vicious crime should face justice that was \n``swift, certain, and severe.''\n  I am pleased to report to the American people and to the President \nthat, with today's passage of the antiterrorism bill, we are one giant \nstep closer to achieving this important goal.\n  The most critical element of this bill, and the one that bears most \ndirectly on the tragic events in Oklahoma City, is the provision \nreforming the so-called habeas corpus rules.\n  By imposing filing deadlines on all death row inmates, and by \nlimiting condemned killers convicted in State or Federal court to one \nFederal habeas petition--one bite of the apple--these landmark reforms \nwill go a long, long way to streamline the lengthy appeals process and \nbridge the gap between crime and punishment in America.\n  It is dead wrong that we must wait 8, or 9, or even 10 years before a \ncapital sentence is actually carried out. And, of course, it is \nterribly unjust to the innocent victims of violent crime and their \nfamilies.\n  As I said yesterday, if the Federal Government prosecutes the \nOklahoma City case and the death penalty is sought and imposed, the \nexecution of the sentence could take as a little as 1 year once these \nreforms are enacted into law.\n  I want to thank President Clinton for his efforts this past week in \ndiscrouraging Democratic amendments. No doubt about it, the President's \ninvolvement has helped speed up the process here in the Senate. I \nparticularly commend the President for finally coming around to the \nview that habeas reform is an essential ingredient of any serious anti-\nterrorism plan.\n  I want to thank the two managers, Senator Hatch and Senator Biden, \nfor their persistence in guiding this legislation through the Senate. \nOn this side of aisle, Senator Hatch has provided the intellectual glue \nthat has kept this effort together. And, of course, I want to thank my \ntwo colleagues from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles and Senator Inhofee, \nwhose help in this process has also been invaluable.\n  Finally, I commend the good people of Oklahoma City, who self-\nsacrifice and resiliency during this very difficult time has been an \ninspiration for us all. The families of some of the bombing victims \ntravelled all the way to Washington this past Monday to let us know \nthat we must take action now to put an end to the endless delays and \nappeals that have done so much to weaken public confidence in our \nsystem of criminal justice. It is gratifying to see that their efforts \nhave had such a profound impact here in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, it has been a difficult process, but \nwe have now reached the conclusion of this worthy debate. I want to \ncommend Majority Leader Dole and Minority Leader Daschle and the \nmanagers of this legislation, Chairman Hatch and [[Page S7878]] Senator \nBiden, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for their skill \nand resolve in moving this important and complex measure through the \nSenate.\n  It is proper for the Senate, at the request of the President, to \nundertake this legislative action to put in place safeguards to ensure, \nto the extent we can, that terrorism does not occur in the future. It \nis my hope that this legislation will provide one more avenue toward \nthe national healing that is needed in the aftermath of one of the most \nsenseless and disturbing acts in the history of man.\n  I have joined with all my colleagues to condemn this act in the \nharshest terms. However, despite my abhorrence of this horrible crime, \nI am unable to support this legislation. As many of my colleagues are \naware, I am a long-time opponent of capital punishment. This \nlegislation, under section 2332b, on page 7 of the bill, provides for \nthe imposition of the death penalty in the following manner:\n\n       (1) Whoever violates this section shall, in addition to the \n     punishment provided for any other crime charged in the \n     indictment, be punished--\n       (A) if death results to any person, by death, or by life \n     imprisonment for any term of years or for life;\n\n  Madam President, I could support this provision if the clause ``by \ndeath'' were excluded. Because it has not been deleted, and because the \ndeath penalty is so repugnant me, I am unable to support this \nlegislation which has many meritorious provisions.\n  I would like my colleagues to take note of a recent event in the \ncountry of South Africa. I am informed that the highest court in South \nAfrica has struck down the death penalty in that country on the basis \nthat it constitutes cruel and inhumane punishment. In his opinion, \nChief Justice Arthur Chaskalson said, ``Retribution cannot be accorded \nthe same weight under our constitution as the right to life and \ndignity.'' He went on to make a point made by death penalty opponents \non this floor many times: ``It has not been shown that the death \nsentence would be materially more effective to deter or prevent murder \nthan the alternative sentence of life imprisonment.''\n  I believe it is time for this country to follow the lead of the South \nAfricans. I have long held that capital punishment is a barbaric \npenalty, certainly one that should be abhorrent to a society such as \nour own.\n  I have marveled at the strides the South Africans have made over the \npast decade. It was not too many years ago that the United States put \ngreat pressure on the Government of South Africa to improve their \nhorrible human rights record. While this new decision is being met with \nthe expected cries of opposition, it now appears to me that the South \nAfricans are setting an example for us on human rights.\n  I merely make note of this enlightenment in South Africa as this body \ncontinues down the road of support for capital punishment. It is my \nhope that some day my colleagues will realize this is a failed, \nprimitive and sickening policy. I regret that, on that basis, I am \nunable to support S. 735.\n\n\n               the comprehensive terrorism prevention act\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I am deeply concerned that the Senate \nhas chosen in this legislation to radically alter the ancient writ of \nhabeas corpus an subjiciendum. Four separate Democratic amendments that \nwould have moderated the bill's extreme habeas corpus provisions were \nrejected today.\n  It is troubling that the Senate has undertaken to revise the Great \nWrit of Liberty in a bill designed as a response to the Oklahoma City \nbombing. Habeas corpus reform has very little to do with terrorism. The \nOklahoma City bombing was a Federal crime and will be tried in Federal \ncourts. The controversy over habeas corpus is a result of excess \nlitigation by State court prisoners who believe they were wrongly \nconvicted in State courts. According to the Emergency Committee to Save \nHabeas Corpus, a group of 100 of the Nation's most distinguished \nattorneys, scholars, and civic leaders, ``Cutting back the enforcement \nof constitutional liberties for people unlawfully held in State custody \nis neither necessary to habeas reform nor relevant to terrorism.''\n  Article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution provides that:\n\n       The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 permitted State prisoners convicted in \nState courts to challenge the constitutionality of their imprisonment \nin Federal district court. This is a right we have honored in the \nUnited States for well over a century.\n  The legislation before us will require our Federal courts to defer to \nState court judgments unless a State court's application of Federal law \nis unreasonable. Our Federal courts will be powerless to correct State \ncourt decisions--even if a State court decision is wrong. The bill \nrequires deference by the Federal courts unless a State court's \ndecision is unreasonably wrong. This is a standard that will \neffectively preclude Federal review.\n  This Senator understands the need for habeas corpus reform, and I \nwould support legislation to impose reasonable limitations on appeals. \nBut this bill goes far too far. It will in many cases transform the \nState courts--not the Federal courts established under article III of \nthe U.S. Constitution--into the arbiters of Federal constitutionality.\n  This legislation will eviscerate the writ of habeas corpus, and that \nis something this Senator in good conscience must oppose. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Emergency \nCommittee to Save Habeas Corpus, and the list of its members, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Emergency Committee\n\n\n                                        To Save Habeas Corpus,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We understand that the Senate may \n     act next week on the habeas corpus provisions in Senator \n     Dole's terrorism legislation. Among these provisions is a \n     requirement that federal courts must defer to state courts \n     incorrectly applying federal constitutional law, unless it \n     can be said that the state ruling was ``unreasonably'' \n     incorrect. This is a variation of past proposals to strip the \n     federal courts of the power to enforce the Constitution when \n     the state court's interpretation of it, though clearly wrong, \n     had been issued after a ``full and fair'' hearing.\n       The Emergency Committee was formed in 1991 to fight this \n     extreme proposal. Our membership consists of both supporters \n     and opponents of the death penalty, Republicans and \n     Democrats, united in the belief that the federal habeas \n     corpus process can be dramatically streamlined without \n     jeopardizing its constitutional core. At a time when \n     proposals to curtail civil liberties in the name of national \n     security are being widely viewed with suspicion, we believe \n     it is vital to ensure that habeas corpus--the means by which \n     all civil liberties are enforced--is not substantively \n     diminished.\n       The habeas corpus reform bill President Clinton proposed in \n     1993, drafted in close cooperation with the nation's district \n     attorneys and state attorneys general, appropriately \n     recognizes this point. It would codify the long-standing \n     principal of independent federal review of constitutional \n     questions, and specifically reject the ``full and fair'' \n     deference standard.\n       Independent federal review of state court judgments has \n     existed since the founding of the Republic, whether through \n     writ of error or writ of habeas corpus. It has a proud \n     history of guarding against injustices born of racial \n     prejudice and intolerance, of saving the innocent from \n     imprisonment or execution, and in the process, ensuring the \n     rights of all law-abiding citizens. Independent federal \n     review was endorsed by the committee chaired by Justice \n     Powell on which all subsequent reform proposals have been \n     based, and the Supreme Court itself specifically considered \n     but declined to require deference to the states, in Wright v. \n     West in 1992.\n       We must emphasize that this issue of deference to state \n     rulings has absolutely no bearing on the swift processing of \n     terrorism offenses in the federal system. For federal \n     inmates, the pending habeas reform legislation proposes \n     dramatic procedural reforms but appropriately avoids any \n     curtailment of the federal courts' power to decide federal \n     constitutional issues. This same framework of reform will \n     produce equally dramatic results in state cases. Cutting back \n     the enforcement of constitutional liberties for people \n     unlawfully held in state custody is neither necessary to \n     habeas reform nor relevant to terrorism.\n       We are confident that the worthwhile goal of streamlining \n     the review of criminal cases can be accomplished without \n     diminishing constitutional liberties. Please support the \n     continuation of independent federal review of federal \n     constitutional claims through habeas corpus.\n           Sincerely,\n     Benjamin Civiletti.

Madam President, I commend President Clinton for his \nveto of the rescissions bill this afternoon. Once again, the President \nhas made clear his strong commitment to education and to the students \nand working families of the Nation.\n  By vetoing this bill, the President has said ``no'' to the \nelimination of violence and drug prevention programs for 20 million \nstudents in 90 percent of our schools.\n  He has said ``no'' to the elimination of school reform grants to \n2,000 schools in 47 States.\n  He has said ``no'' to the drastic cuts in reading and math assistance \nfor 135,000 pupils.\n  He has said ``no'' to the elimination of community service support \nfor 15,000 young men and women ready, willing, and able to serve their \ncommunities and earn money for their education.\n  He has said ``no'' to the elimination of opportunities for thousands \nof young high school students to participate in school-to-work \nprograms.\n  He has said ``no'' to ending the promising start we have made on \nputting modern technology in schools.\n  He has said ``no'' to deep cuts like this to pay for tax cuts for the \nrich.\n  The battle has now been squarely joined against drastic anti-\neducation Republican budget proposals that would mean the largest \neducation cuts in the Nation's history.\n  These Republican budgets are indefensible--they would cut 33 percent \nof the Federal investment in education by the year 2002, and slash over \n$30 billion in Federal aid to college students.\n  Every student, every parent, every American understands that \neducation is the indispensable foundation of a better life for \nthemselves and their children. Deep Republican cuts in education are a \nbetrayal of the hopes and dreams of families for their children. They \nundermine the Nation's future strength. Our schools, colleges, and \nstudents deserve a helping Federal hand--not the back of Republican \nhands.\n  This veto is right, and I am confident it will be sustained by the \nCongress.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7880-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7880-S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, it is indeed ironic that the Clinton \nadministration--whose policy on Bosnia needs to be checked hourly--is \non the attack against those in Congress like myself who have \nconsistently argued for a policy that candidate Clinton advocated. \nMaybe administration officials are tired of attacking each other in the \npress and have decided to take their frustration out on the Congress.\n  The administration's arguments against withdrawing the U.N. \nprotection forces and lifting the arms embargo are neither based on \nfact nor on American experience.\n  First we have a statement from the Secretary of Defense today that \nwithdrawing U.N. forces would lead to a humanitarian disaster. I do not \nknow if the Pentagon has been keeping up with the news over the last \nfew months, but the situation in Bosnia is and has been a humanitarian \ndisaster for the last couple of years, despite the presence of 22,000 \nU.N. troops. The U.N. mission in Bosnia has failed. Bandages like the \nquick reaction force will not change that fact.\n  Secretary Perry also told the Armed Services Committee today that the \ncasualty rate in Bosnia dramatically dropped, which he attributed to \nthe presence of U.N. forces. As the recent hostage taking has painfully \ndemonstrated, the U.N. forces cannot even protect themselves let alone \nthe Bosnians. And I say this understanding the bravery of each of the \nindividuals who are there. They are in a very, very difficult \nsituation. They cannot protect themselves. They are placed there by \ntheir governments.\n  Furthermore, the heaviest Bosnian casualties were in areas where U.N. \nforces were either not deployed or deployed too late--in northern and \neastern Bosnia.\n  So it seems to me that the real reason casualties dropped is because \nthe Bosnians, over time, have acquired more weapons and have been able \nto better defend themselves. That is why the casualty rate has gone \ndown.\n  The second argument made by the administration is that the lifting of \nthe arms embargo would Americanize the war and make the United States \nresponsible for events in Bosnia.\n  Let us not fool ourselves--America is responsible now. We already \nhave a responsibility. America is responsible because it has not been a \nleader, rather it has meekly followed the Europeans' failed approach.\n  As for the accusation that lifting the arms embargo would \n``Americanize'' the conflict, it seems to me that the United States has \nplenty of experience from Central America to Afghanistan in providing \nmilitary assistance without being drawn into a quagmire with American \ntroops on the ground. The real recipe for getting bogged down is to \nsend United States ground troops into Bosnia without a mission, which \nis why the resolution I intend to submit would authorize, with strict \nconditions, the use of United States ground forces for the clearly \nstated purpose of withdrawing U.N. protection forces from Bosnia--not \nfor peacekeeping, not for reconfiguration, not for strengthening, or \nany other proposed deployments supported by the Clinton administration.\n  Furthermore, Bosnian officials have repeated time and time again that \nthey do not want United States ground troops. Just a couple days ago, \nin response to news that a European quick reaction force would be \ncreated, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said ``Please untie our \nhands, arm the Bosnians. We do not want your boys to die for us''--\nBritish boys, French boys, or American boys.\n  Finally, when those of us who advocate lifting the arms embargo--and \nI am talking about Republicans and Democrats; this has never been a \npartisan issue on this floor, it has been supported by many Democrats \nand a great number of Republicans--point out that other countries would \nalso participate in arming the Bosnians, we are told this would allow \nIran to arm the Bosnians. The fact is the arms embargo has guaranteed \nthat Iran is a key supplier of arms to Bosnia and administration \nofficials have actually used that fact to argue that there is no need \nto lift the arms embargo.\n  What other choices do the Bosnians have? They are going to find \nweapons where they can find weapons.\n  From statements made by State Department officials to the press, one \ngets the impression that Iran is the Clinton administration's preferred \nprovider of weapons to the Bosnians. If the administration has a \nproblem with Iran arming Bosnia, it should be prepared to do something \nabout it.\n  We can do something about it. It would not take very long.\n  If the arms embargo is lifted, America would not be the only country \nto provide assistance. Countries like Turkey, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, \nKuwait, and Pakistan would offer financial and military assistance. In \naddition, former Warsaw Pact countries would be free to sell their vast \narsenal of Soviet-style weapons that have been designated for export \npursuant to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. Since the \nBosnians presently use Soviet-style equipment, acquiring former Soviet \nbloc equipment would minimize the amount of training they would \nrequire. Furthermore, any training, whether by United States military \nadvisers or other country military advisers, could [[Page S7881]] be \nconducted outside of Bosnia--in Croatia or Slovenia, for example.\n  Madam President, administration officials should quit fighting \namongst themselves and begin real consultations with the Congress, \nconsultations based on the facts and not on wild accusations or \nunrealistic scenarios. It is time to take sides--with the victims of \nthis aggression. It is also high time for America to exercise \nleadership and end its participation in this international failure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7880-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        VETO OF RESCISSIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will just say that on the rescissions \nveto by the President today, it is highly regrettable President Clinton \nchose a bill cutting spending for the first veto. The $16.4 billion \nrescissions bill would have provided for $9 billion--$9 billion, a lot \nof money in real savings--an important downpayment in getting our \ncountry's financial house in order.\n  The President made a serious mistake in judgment in vetoing this \nmeasure. It would have provided funding to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency for disaster relief, to Oklahoma for reconstruction, \nand debt relief for Jordan to support the peace process, money for \nCalifornia.\n  Speaker Gingrich and I have previously said we met the administration \nmore than halfway. The President asked for Jordan debt relief, we met \nhis request. The President asked for FEMA funds for disaster relief in \n40 States, and we met his request. The President threatened to veto if \nstriker replacement language was included in the bill, we took it out. \nWe left AIDS funding, breast cancer screening, childhood immunization, \nHead Start, and other programs untouched, and still we came up with $9 \nbillion in net real savings.\n  We, in the Congress, held up our end of the bargain, but President \nClinton missed a valuable opportunity--a golden opportunity--to join us \ncutting spending.\n  Now, with three-quarters of the fiscal year almost gone, we are \nlosing the opportunity to enact real savings this year. In the face of \nthe budget deficit that mortgages our children's future, we in the \nCongress will proceed to pass a budget that puts us on the path to \nbalance by the year 2002. We owe it to our children, and we owe it to \nour grandchildren.\n  For the sake of generations to come, it is time for the President to \nstop being an obstacle in the road and join us in our responsibility to \nsecure our Nation's economic future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7881-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7881-S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 45, S. 652, the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The bill will be stated by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 652) to provide for a pro-competitive, \n     deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to begin Senate floor \nconsideration of S. 652--the comprehensive communications bill which \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation overwhelmingly \napproved late last month on a vote of 17 to 2--The Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  The future of America's economy and society is inextricably linked to \nthe universe of telecomunications and computer technology. \nTelecommunications and computer technology is a potent force for \nprogress and freedom, more powerful than Gutenberg's invention of the \nprinting press five centuries ago, or Bell's telephone and Marconi's \nradio in the last century.\n  This force has helped us reach today's historic turning point in \nAmerica.\n  The telecommunications and computer technology of 21st-Century \nAmerica will be hair-thin strands of glass and fiber below; the magical \ncrackling of stratospheric spectrum above; and the orbit of satellites \n23,000 miles beyond. With personal computers interconnected, telephones \nuntethered, televisions and radios reinvented, and other devices yet to \nbe invented bringing digitized information to life, the \ntelecommunications and computer technology unleashed by S. 652 will \nforever change our economy and society.\n  At stake is our ability to compete and win in an international \ninformation marketplace estimated to be over $3 trillion by the close \nof the decade. The information industry already constitutes one-seventh \nof our economy, and is growing.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \nthe core of my agenda is to promote creativity in telecommunications \nand computer technology by rolling back the cost and reach of \ngovernment. Costly big-government laws designed for another era \nrestrain telecommunications and computer technology from realizing its \nfull potential. My top priority this year is to modernize and \nliberalize communications law through passage of the bill before us \ntoday, S. 652: Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n1995.\n\n\n             A. The Advent of Telecommunicatons Regulations\n\n  Most telecommunications policy and regulation in America is based \nupon the New Deal era Communications Act of 1934. The 1934 Act \nincorporated the premise that telephone services were a natural \nmonopoly, whereby only a single firm could provide better services at a \nlower cost than a number of competing suppliers. Tight government \ncontrol over spectrum based services was justified on a scarcity \ntheory. Neither theory for big government regulation holds true today, \nif it ever did.\n  The 1934 Act was intended to ensure that AT and other monopoly \ntelephone companies did not abuse their monopoly power. However, \nregulatory protection from competition also ensured that AT would \nremain a government-sanctioned monopoly. In exchange for this \ngovernment-sanctioned monopoly, AT was to provide universal service. \nAT retained its government-sanctioned monopoly until antitrust \nenforcement broke up the Bell System and transferred the monopoly over \nlocal services to the Bell Operating Companies.\n  The Communications Act has become the cornerstone of communications \nlaw in the United States. The 1934 Act established the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and granted it regulatory power over \ncommunications by wire, radio, telephone, and cable within the United \nStates. The Act also charged the Federal Communications Commission with \nthe responsibility of maintaining, for all the people of the United \nStates, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide and worldwide wire and radio \ncommunications service with adequate facilities and reasonable charges.\n  Prior to 1934, communications regulation had come under the \njurisdiction of three separate Federal agencies. Radio stations were \nlicensed and regulated by the Federal Radio Commission; the Interstate \nCommerce Commission had jurisdiction over telephone, telegraph, and \nwireless common carriers; and the Postmaster General had certain \njurisdiction over the companies that provided these services. As the \nnumber of communications providers in the United States grew, Congress \ndetermined that a commission with unified jurisdiction would serve the \nAmerican people more effectively.\n  The 1934 Communications Act combined the powers that the Interstate \nCommerce Commission and the Federal Radio Commission then exercised \nover communications under a single, independent Federal agency.\n  The Communications Act of 1934 was based, in part, on the Interstate \nCommerce Act of 1888. For example, the requirement for approval of \nconstruction or extension of lines for railroads was taken directly \nfrom the ICC Act. Prior to 1934, wire communications were regulated by \nthe same set of laws that\n regulated the railroads. Radio communications were regulated under the \n1927 Federal Radio Act. In 1934, the Federal Communications Commission \nwas created to oversee both the wireline communications and radio \ncommunications. [[Page S7882]] \n\n  The telecommunications industry today is a dynamic and innovative \nindustry, with new technology being introduced on daily basis. The \ntelecommunications industry, however, is regulated under a set of laws \nthat are antiquated and never designed to handle the challenges of \ntoday's industry.\n  Telecommunications laws and regulations are not able to adequately \ntake into account the advent of telecommunications competition, and, \nindeed, have slowed the introduction of competition into many segments \nof the industry. These laws did not contemplate the development of \nfiber optics, the microchip, digital compression, and the explosion of \nwireless services. It is time to revise and amend the 1934 act to fit \nthe new and future competitive telecommunications industry.\n\n\n                 B. The Modification of Final Judgment\n\n  Since 1984, the Bell operating companies have been restricted from \nentering various lines of businesses as a result of the consent decree \nentered in the antitrust case, United States versus Western Electric.\n  The consent decree, commonly referred to as the modification of final \njudgment, or the MFJ, places the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia and Judge Harold Greene as the administrator of the decree, \nand establishes a procedure by which the Bell operating companies can \nobtain waivers from the decree's restrictions.\n  Recent years have seen a proliferation of legislative and judicial \naction to change the provisions of the original consent decree that \ndivested American Telephone and Telegraph of its local exchange service \nand created the regional Bell operating companies. Currently prohibited \nfrom providing long distance service, manufacturing telecommunications \nequipment, and, up until July 1991, providing information services, the \nBell operating companies and others have long advocated open entry into \nthese new lines of business, contending that such action would \ninvigorate the telecommunications marketplace.\n  In opposition, certain consumer organizations, electronic publishers, \nlong distance carriers, the Justice Department, and other industry \ngroups over the past few years have opposed entry on the grounds that \nthe courts should administer an antitrust consent decree and that so \nlong as the Bell operating companies face little or no competition in \ntheir core business of providing local telephone service, they should \nnot be permitted to enter competitive lines of business.\n  During the past 10 years a number of waivers have been granted, but \nthe process has slowed in recent years. More fundamentally, the \njudicial process is necessarily limited; the district courts \nconstitutional role is simply to apply the law and administer the \ndecree, and not make informed policy decisions about how communications \nlaw and the communications and computer industry should develop.\n  Moreover, given the vulnerability of the telephone industry to \nselective, cherry-picking competition, it is likely that the limited \nnature of today's competition will have a significant effect on the \nindustry's revenues in general, and on local telephone rates in \nparticular.\n  Consequently, although the consent decree served a useful purpose \ninitially, it no longer serves the public interest at this dynamic time \nin the evaluation of the communications and information industry. In \nplace of a process that subjects the communications industry to the \nterms of a consent decree entered 12 years ago and administered by a \nsingle district court, the Congress will reassert its proper policy \nrole and administer a new Federal policy designed to promote \ncompetition, innovation, and protect consumers.\n  Prior to the implementation of the MFJ in 1984, as noted previously, \nAT was the monopoly telecommunications provider in the United States. \nAT's Long Lines Department provided long distance telephone service \nto virtually everyone in the country. AT maintained owership of the \n22 Bell operating companies, which provided local telephone service on \na monopoly basis to approximately 85 percent of the population.\n  In addition, AT owned Western Electric, which manufactured almost \nall the equipment needed for the operation of the telephone network. \nAT also owned Bell Telephone Laboratories, Bell Labs, which conducted \nthe most extensive research involving high technologies and \ntelecommunications of any industrial research center in the world.\n  The roots of the MFJ go back over 100 years. In 1882, Bell Telephone, \nthe predecessor of AT, designated Western Electric Co. as the \nexclusive manufacturer of its patented telecommunications equipment. \nDuring the early 1900's Bell Telephone maintained a majority interest \nin Western Electric; by 1925 it had 100 percent owership of the \ncompany.\n  By that same year, Bell Telephone established Bell Telephone \nLaboratories to conduct its research and development. The Bell system's \nrapid expansion triggered interest from the Department of Justice and \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission--which then had jurisdiction over \ninterstate telephone service--for possible\n antitrust violations.\n\n  Following other antitrust action, in 1974, the Department of Justice \nfiled an antitrust suit against AT The suit claimed that AT \nmisused its Bell system monopoly of the local exchange network to \nrestrict competition in the manufacturing of telecommunications \nequipment, and in the market for interchange service through refusal to \nprovide competitors with interconnection to the local networks and, \ntherefore, access to end customers. After years of litigation, the case \nwas settled in 1982 with entry of a modification of final judgment by \nJudge Harold Greene, which was negotiated by AT and the Justice \nDepartment.\n  The debate about the proper role of the Bell operating companies in \nthe communications industry has often overshadowed the larger question \nof which government bodies should be establishing national \ntelecommunications policy. Courts make rulings, as they should, solely \non the narrow questions confronting them. Consequently, courts do not \nand cannot ensure that broader concerns about sound economic goals are \nfully considered.\n  As a result of these concerns, which have been fueled by a period of \nglobalization and intense international competition in the \ntelecommunications industry, I believe, and the committee believes that \nwe in Congress as the expert in the oversight of the telecommunications \nindustry, should have authority to manage these issues in order to \ndevelop telecommunications and information policy in a coordinated \nmanner.\n  At this juncture in the evolution of the communications industry the \nCongress should be the locus of authority on questions involving \ntelecommunications competition, deregulation and consumer protection. \nWe have the ability to see a more complete spectrum of issues, as \ncompared to the narrow view of discrete issues which a court and the \nDepartment to Justice necessarily takes in the context of litigation. \nMoreover, we can consider broad policy goals in establishing and \nadministering telecommunications policy.\n\n\n                           C. Regulatory Lag\n\n  While America is still the world's leader in information technology, \nwe are no longer in the position of being unchallenged. Historically we \nwere an economic and technological Gulliver standing astride a world of \ncompetitive Lilliputians. But that's just not true any longer. \nAmerica--especially we in the American legislative and regulatory \nsystem--must respond and respond now.\n  At a minimum, government should try to avoid doing harm. \nUnfortunately, government and regulators have a rather sorry history of \nslowing the introduction of new technologies and competition. The \nexamples of this regulatory lag are numerous and all too common. \nRegulatory lag means we don't get investment stimulus that competition \nand new entry spur and, more importantly, the public is denied new \nservice and product options.\n  1. Competition in customer premises equipment:\n  Competition and open entry first came to telecommunications with \nrespect to customer premises equipment (CPE). This competition, \nhowever, was initially resisted by the FCC. For many years, AT \nprohibited customers or anyone else from connecting any equipment to \nits telephone network or to telephones themselves that AT did not \nsupply. Bell tariffs forbade all foreign attachments--meaning equipment \n[[Page S7883]] not provided by Bell itself. Unfortunately, regulators \nendorsed this anti-competitive practice for almost 70 years.\n  Through prodding from the Federal courts, the commission eventually \nallowed devices deemed not injurious to the telephone network to be \nconnected to the network. This was only after the courts conferred on \nsubscribers the right to use their telephones in a way that had private \nbenefits without being publicly detrimental\n  It took the Commission more than a decade to extend the new law to \ninclude equipment that was connected electronically, not just \nphysically, to the network. The Commission limited restrictions on \ninterconnection to protecting the network from harm. The details of \nequipment interconnection were not fully implemented until the \ncommission adopted part 68 of its rules in 1975, nearly 20 years after \nthe original court determination so that carriers themselves would be \nfree to compete on equal terms in the open market.\n  2. Competition in long distance services:\n  The commission was equally slow in authorizing interexchange--or long \ndistance--competition. In the 1940s, long distance service was provided \nexclusively over wires, and the same basic economics that seemed to \npreclude competition in local service applied equally to long distance \nservice. The development of microwave and satellite technologies \nradically changed that picture, making competition both practical and \ninevitable. The first few, faltering steps in the direction of a \ncompetitive marketplace, were taken by the commission in 1959 but it \nwasn't until 1980 that the commission formally adopted an open entry \npolicy for all interstate services.\n  Competition in the interexchange market developed slowly as the \ncommission gradually and incrementally responded to changes in market \npressures, technology, and consumer demand for new and varied long \ndistance services. Microwave relay technology, developed by Bell \nLaboratories during World War II, prompted the beginning of IXC \ncompetition by offering a viable, less expensive alternative to AT \nexisting wireline facilities for transmitting long distance \ncommunications.\n  The commission first permitted entry of non-AT services for \nprovision of private services. In 1959, the FCC, finding a need for \nprivate services and foreseeing no risk of harm to established \nservices, authorized certain private companies to provide microwave \nservices and to establish private microwave networks for their own \ninternal use. Although described as a narrow, limited decision, the \nAbove 890 decision prompted a flood of applications from private \norganizations seeking authorization to establish private microwave \nlong-distance networks. It also brought pressure for entry into other \nfields.\n  MCI applied to the FCC for authority to provide private, non-switched \ncommunications service between St. Louis and Chicago. This service \nstill did not involve interconnection with AT's public network. In \n1969, the commission approved MCI's limited point-to-point system, \nsaying it was designed to meet the interoffice and interplant \ncommunications needs of small businesses. Again, however, the decision \nwas narrow.\n  The commission was concerned about permitting unregulated carriers to \nengage in creamskimming, and it generally still adhered strongly to the \nphilosophy that the public network should remain a regulated monopoly. \nNonetheless, it prompted a deluge of applications seeking authorization \nof similar microwave facilities, reflecting a public demand for \ncompetitive alternatives.\n  A few years later, the commission formalized a policy of allowing \nentry of new carriers into the private line, or Specialized Common \nCarrier (SCC), field to provide alternatives to certain interstate \ntransmission services traditionally offered only by the telephone \ncompany. The commission did not, however, define the scope of services \nit was opening up to competition, a matter that would prove troublesome \nas pressures for increased competition rose.\n  Although each time emphasizing the limited nature of its decision, \nthe commission had, over the course of 2 decades, continued to approve \nthe entry of new providers of telephone services, albiet at times \nreluctantly and with prodding by the courts, and only in provision of \nprivate line services.\n  When it came to permitting direct competition with AT public \nswitched long distance service, the Commission's reluctance hardened. \nMCI had eventually obtained approval for its private line offerings, \nbut when it later proposed new switched service in direct competition \nwith AT's MTS services, the FCC refused approval.\n  In doing so, the Commission reiterated that its Specialized Common \nCarrier decision was meant to allow entry only into private line \nservice and not into direct competition with the public network. The \nCourt of Appeals, however, reversed the commission's failure to approve \nMCI's proposed offering, rejecting the commission's argument that its \nSpecialized Common Carrier decision authorized only private line \nservices.\n  After Execunet I, the commission still refused to order AT to \ninterconnect with MCI. The Court of Appeals, in Execunet II, then \nexplicitly mandated interconnect, emphasizing that Specialized Common \nCarrier was a broad decision to permit competition in the long distance \nmarket and that such competition necessarily required AT to provide \nphysical interconnection to the public network.\n  The Execunet decisions opened virtually all interstate IXC markets to \ncompetition. In response to this new judicially imposed reality, the \nFCC lowered entry barriers, eliminated rules prohibiting sharing of \nheavy use, bulk rate circuits, and directed AT to permit the resale \nand sharing of these circuits by competitors.\n  During this same era, the commission approved interstate packet-\nswitched communications network offerings that introduced value-added \nnetworks which resold data processing functions through basic private \nline circuits, and unlimited resale and shared use of private line \nservices and facilities. Tariff restrictions against the resale and \nshared use of public switched long distance services were removed in \n1980. Since this time, the FCC has strongly supported the growth of \ncompetition.\n  The resulting competition has had well documented public benefits of \ngreat scale and scope.\n  3. Enhanced Services:\n  The MFJ Consent Decree's information services restriction required \nthe Bell Companies to seek waivers for the provision of voice answering \nservices, electronic mail, videotext, electronic versions of Yellow \nPages directories, E911 emergency service, and directory assistance \nservices provided to customers of nonassociated independent telephone \ncompanies.\n  The restriction on the provision of voice mail services was lifted in \nthe late 1980's. In the first 2 years of RBOC participation, the voice \nmail equipment market grew threefold and prices declined dramatically. \nBetween 1988 (when the RBOCs were permitted entry) and 1989, the market \nfor voice mail services grew by 40 percent, with total revenues rising \nfrom $452 million to $635 million.\n  Prices have also fallen. For example, telephone companies today \ncharges as little as $5 per month for its residential voice messaging \nservice. Similar services in 1987 cost 2 to 10 times more. Output has \nrisen. The U.S. market for voice mail and voice response equipment \nincreased from $300 million in 1988 to over $900 million in 1989. The \nnumber of voice message mailboxes increased from 5.3 million in 1987 to \n7.7 million in 1988 to 11.6 million in 1989.\n  4. Spectrum Allocation:\n  The introduction of both FM radio and television was significantly \ndelayed by years of FCC equivocation over which bands would be assigned \nto which uses. Equally egregious delays preceded the introduction of \ncellular telephone service.\n  FM Radio. FM radio technology was invented in 1933, but did not \nreceive widespread use until the 1960s. Lack of FCC support contributed \nto FM's lack of popularity. One glaring example occurred in 1945. By \n1945, 500,000 FM receivers had been built, but were all rendered \nuseless when the FCC decided to [[Page S7884]] move FM channels to a \ndifferent spectrum band. FM languished for so long that the inventor of \nFM eventually committed suicide in despair.\n  TV. The modern television was developed in the 1930s and exhibited by \nRCA in 1939, but the FCC took 2 more years to adopt initial standards. \nIt was then discovered that channel allocation was inadequate, and the \nFCC froze all applications for TV licenses for 4 years, until 1952. In \nthe year after the freeze alone, the number of stations tripled. It \ntook another 10 years before regulations for UHF/VHF frequencies were \nfinalized.\n  Cellular. In 1947 Bell Labs developed the concept of cellular \ncommunications and by 1962, AT had developed an experimental cellular \nsystem. It took another 15 years for regulation to catch up with the \nnew technology; in 1977 the FCC finally granted Illinois Bell's \napplication to construct a developmental celluar system in Chicago. The \nFCC took 8 years to finalize the boundaries of cellular service areas. \nThe delay cost the cellular industry an estimated $86 billion.\n  5. Out of Region Competition by Bell Companies:\n  The Department of Justice, with the concurrence of Judge Greene, \noriginally held that the MFJ consent decree forbade the RBOCs from \nproviding services outside their own regions. The D.C. Circuit however \noverruled them both and found that the BOCs are not restricted to \nproviding service only within their home territories; they are free to \noffer intraLATA services anywhere in the country. The RBOCs now compete \nheavily against one another in cellular service. The provision of other \nlocal services, however, is impeded by the interexchange restriction, \nwhich the Department and the decree court have so far refused to lift \neven outside the service areas of the individual RBOCs.\n  6. Bell Company Manufacturing:\n  In June 1991, outages in 5 states and the District of Columbia forced \nBell Atlantic and other Bell companies to work closely with a switch \nmanufacturer to determine the cause of the outages and prevent their \nrecurrence. The Department of Justice told Bell Atlantic that, \nnotwithstanding the emergency, Bell Atlantic could not work with the \nmanufacturer without a waiver of the decree's manufacturing \nrestriction. On July 9, 1991, Judge Greene ordered a hearing with Bell \nAtlantic, the Department of Justice, AT, and MCI and granted the \nwaiver on July 10, 1991.\n  7. Cable Networks:\n  The FCC--at the behest of broadcasters--crippled and almost killed \ncable television, by means of a number of regulatory restrictions such \nanti-siphoning rules. The commission's stated justification for \nrestricting cable was that it did not want to jeopardize the basic \nstructure of over-the-air television.\n  8. Video Dialtone:\n  By defining video dialtone service as common carriage, not broadcast, \nthe FCC has successfully preempted a raft of State cable regulation and \nfranchise fees. It has also subjected these services to a raft of \nregulations. Telephone companies have been invited to provide a basic \nplatform that delivers video programming and basic adjunct services to \nend users, under Federal, common-carrier tariff.\n  Video dialtone providers must offer sufficient capacity to serve \nmultiple video programmers; they must make provision for increased \nprogrammer demand for transmission services over time; and they must \noffer their basic platform services on a nondiscriminatory basis. The \ndial tone moniker is misleading; the video connections are strictly \nbetween the telco central office and customers. But the number of \nprograms offered from a video dialtone server can be expanded \nindefinitely. The commission has attempted to maintain strict \nseparation between the provision of video dialtone conduit, and \nprovision of the programming itself. Video dialtone as defined by the \ncommission is plainly more like telephone carriage than like cable or \nbroadcasting.\n  9. Direct Broadcast Satellite:\n  When the FCC first considered licensing Direct Broadcast Satellite \nservice (DBS) in the early 1980s, the National Associate of \nBroadcasters raised the specter of siphoning. DBS would result in the \nloss of service to minorities, rural areas, and special audiences by \nsiphoning programming, fragmenting audiences, and reducing advertising \nsupport. It would rob free local television service of advertising \nrevenues. UHF stations would be especially threatened. The cable \ntelevision industry joined in the assault on DBS by denying access to \nprogramming. The service has only recently become available.\n  10. Computer and Software:\n  AT invented the transistor and in the 1960s and 1970s \ndeveloped some of the most powerful computers--was barred for years (by \nthe 1956 antitrust consent decree) from competing in the computer \nmarket against IBM. The upshot was that IBM completely dominated \ncomputing for many years. AT had also developed the Unix operating \nsystem around which the Internet was built--it couldn't commercialize \nthat aggressively either. Now Microsoft is being accused of \nmonopolizing the industry with the MS-DOS and Windows alternatives.\n  11. Delay in RBOCC Information and Inter-LATA Services Relief:\n  In 1987, the Justice Department recommended the removal of the \ninformation services restriction on the RBOCs. This was not opposed by \nAT In September of 1987, Judge Greene permitted the RBOCs to enter \nnon-telecommunications businesses without obtaining a waiver, but did \nnot lift the information services ban.\n  On April 3, 1990, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia remanded Judge Greene's decision to continue the ban on RBOC \ninformation services. Eventually, on July 25, 1991, Judge Greene \nrelented and permitted RBOCs to provide information services. RBOCs \nwere finally granted the right to provide information services more \nthan 4 years after the Justice Department recommended that the \nrestriction be removed.\n  There have been numerous examples of egregious delays in granting \neven non-controversial decree waivers. For example, Bell Atlantic \nsought a waiver in 1985 to allow it to serve Cecil County, Maryland as \npart of its Philadelphia cellular system. Bell Atlantic submitted \nanother waiver to provide cellular service to 3 New Jersey counties \nthrough its Philadelphia-Wilmington system on October 24, 1986.\n  These waivers were necessary to the provision of uninterrupted \ncellular service between Washington and New York. Judge Greene finally \ngranted the second waiver on February 2, 1989, almost two-and-a-half \nyears after it was filed and the Cecil County waiver was not approved \nuntil 1991, nearly 5 years after it was first sought.\n  RBOCs have filed more than 200 MFJ waivers that Judge Greene has \nruled on. These waiver requests first go to the Department of Justice, \nand then move to Judge Greene. Unfortunately, the waiver process is \nalso very time consuming. The average age of an RBOC waiver request \npending before the Department of Justice is about 2\\1/2\\ years old.\n  Once the Justice Department passes the waiver on to Judge Greene, it \ntakes approximately 2 years before Judge Greene rules on it. This has \nmade the average waiver process more than 4\\1/2\\ years to work its way \nthrough the system.\n                    D. The New Competitive Landscape\n\n  The competitive landscape is changing, and, if Congress does not act \nto overhaul the telecommunications legal landscape, consumers will once \nagain be denied benefits of competition and new technology. Wireless \nservices have exploded since the Bell System breakup. Wireless counted \nless than 100,000 customers at that time.\n  Today, there are more than 25 million cellular subscribers. \nAdditionally, companies just spent more than $7.7 billion for the major \ntrading area PCS licenses. There is obviously a market for more \nwireless communications. Cable has more than doubled its subscriber \nbase since the MFJ.\n  For local telephone services, States such as New York, Illinois, and \nCalifornia, have been leading the way in opening the local market to \ncompetition. Competitive access providers did not even exist at the \ntime of the MFJ. Today, CAP's are in 72 cities, and have built 133 \ncompeting networks. Rapid changes in technology have broken down the \nnatural monopoly Congress based the 1934 act on. Competition is still \nslow to fully develop in some areas, and in some \nmarkets. [[Page S7885]] \n  History teaches us that, under existing law, the FCC and the courts \nhave not been able to respond to market and technology changes in an \nexpeditious manner. This delay prevents the consumer from gaining the \nbenefits of competition, such as lower rates, better services, and \ndeployment of new and better technologies.\n  The courts, FCC and Justice Department have been micro-managing the \ngrowth of competition in the telecommunications industry. That is why \nthe committee believes it is incumbent upon Congress to exercise its \nrightful authority in this area, and pass legislation that will open \nthe entire telecommunications industry to full competition. Without \nlegislation, it may be years, or decades, before America sees the \nbenefits of a truly open and competitive telecommunications industry.\n  Meanwhile our foreign competitors are moving ahead aggressively. In \nGreat Britain, cable-telco competition is growing rapidly. The major \ncable players in the UK are, in fact, American telco and cable \ncompanies. Prices for telephony provided over cable lines are 10 to 15 \npercent lower than that provided over British Telecoms network. Here in \nthe United States by contrast, the combination of the 1984 cable-telco \nprohibition and entry barriers into the local telephone market prevent \nsuch competition from developing.\n  In Japan the government is providing interest free loans to cover 30 \npercent of the investment for Japan's broadband optical fiber network. \nAlso planned are favorable tax measures for optical fiber and related \ninvestments. Meanwhile in the United States when American companies say \nthey'll invest their own money in new networks, the government at both \nthe Federal and State level visits endless regulatory hassle on the \nproponents.\n\n\n         e. importance of telecommunications to economic growth\n\n  At the heart our actions in the 104th Congress is private sector \neconomic growth and private sector jobs through less Government \nregulation. To achieve our goal, we need increased capital investment.\n  Telecommunications is an especially important sector to spur \ninvestment because it provides a big multiplier effect. The Japanese \nGovernment has estimated that for each dollar--or yen--invested in \ntelecommunications, you get 3 dollars' worth of economic growth--a real \ntelecom kicker.\n  America's edge has always been our grasp of technology. Today, \ntelecommunications and computers are at the cutting edge. Americans \ntoday have the broadest choice and best prices for these information \neconomy products and services in the world.\n  For instance, 98 percent of American homes have television and radio, \n94 percent a telephone. Close to 80 percent have a VCR, while 65 \npercent subscribe to cable TV--96 percent have the option. We are \nrapidly approaching 40 percent of homes with PC's and 36 percent with \nvideo games. Multimedia and CD-ROM sales are flourishing.\n  The Internet and computer on-line services are reaching millions of \nAmericans. DBS has been successfully launched with 150 channels of \ndigital video and audio programming services. A vibrant new wireless \ncommunications industry is growing with cellular--25 million \nsubscribers--and paging--20 million users--soon to be joined by \nEnhanced Specialized Mobile Radio, Global Satellite Systems, and \nPersonal Communications Services.\n  First. Digitization and industry convergence meet--Regulatory \napartheid:\n  Telecommunications policy in America, under the 1934 Communications \nAct, has long been based on the now faulty premise that information \ntransmitted over wires could be easily distinguished from information \ntransmitted over the air. Different regulatory regimes were erected \naround these different information media.\n  This scheme might best be described as ``regulatory apartheid''--each \ntechnology had its own native homeland. These once neat separations and \ndistinctions between the media no longer make sense.\n  The explanation for the rapid convergence of previously distinct \nmedia lies with digitization. Digitization allows all media to become \ntanslatable into each other. As Congress' Office of Technology \nAssessment stated in a recent study: ``A movie, phone call, letter, or \nmagazine article may be sent digitally via phone line, coaxial cable, \nfiber-optic cable, microwave, satellite, the broadcast air, or a \nphysical storage medium such as tape or disk.''\n  The same technological phenomenon to sweep the computer industry \nduring the 1980's is now sweeping the telecommunications industry--we \ncan learn valuable lessons from the experience in the computer \nindustry.\n  Second. Computers and phones:\n  By the early 1980's, AT and IBM were two of the largest and more \npowerful companies in the world. On January 8, 1982, the Federal \nGovernment chose two different destinies for the mammoth companies. The \nGovernment agreed to dismiss its case against IBM; by contrast, AT \nwould be divested, freed from all antitrust quarantines and so \npermitted to enter the computer business.\n  At the time, Intel was already over a decade old. Apple was growing \nfast. And IBM had just introduced a brand-new machine, based on an \nIntel microprocessor. Big Blue's new machine--its personal computer--\nwas small and beige. Three weeks after the break-up of AT was \ncomplete, in January 1984, Steve Jobs stepped out on the podium at the \nannual stockholders' meeting of Apple Computer and unveiled the new \nMacintosh.\n  The impact of unfettered competition has devastated IBM. The only \nthriving parts of its hardware business today are at the bottom end, \nwhere Big Blue's small beige machines have been open, standardized, and \nwidely copied from the day they were introduced. Between 1985 and 1992, \nIBM shed 100,000 employees. IBM's stock, worth $176 a share in 1987, \ncollapsed to $52 by\n year's end 1992. In 1992, the New York Times would announce ``The End \nof I.B.M.'s Overshadowing Role.'' ``IBM's problems,'' the Times noted, \n``are due to its failure to realize that its core business, mainframe \ncomputers, had been supplanted by cheap, networked PC's and faster \nnetworked workstations.'' In a desperate scramble for survival, IBM is \nbreaking itself into autonomous units and spinning off some of its more \nsuccessful divisions. IBM itself is only one of many first-tier vendors \nof PC's today, with a market share of 8 percent.\n\n  The impact on the computer industry, however, has been intense \ncompetition spawning rapid technological advancement. A $5,000 PC in \n1990--featuring Intel's 80486 running at 25 MHz--had the processing \npower of a $250,000 minicomputer in the mid-1980's, and a million-\ndollar mainframe of the 1970's. Five years later, that same $5,000 PC \nis two generations out of date--with a third new generation on the \nhorizon. Systems with nearly twice the processing power of that 1990 \nsystem--using Intel's 486DX2-66 chip--are available for under $1,500, \nand Intel runs advertisements encouraging owners of these chips to \nupgrade to newer ones. Systems with more than twice the processing \npower of that system--featuring Intel's 120 MHz Pentium chip--are now \navailable, most for under $5,000. Intel is currently promising faster \nand faster iterations of its Pentium chips--running at 133 and 150 \nMHz--before it releases commercial versions of its next-generation P6, \nwhich promises to move the price-performance curve astonishingly \nfarther out than today. The computer industry is still firmly in the \ngrip of Moore's Law, which holds that the number of transistors that \ncan be placed on a microchip--a rough estimator of the power of the \nchip--doubles every 18 months.\n  The upshot is that consumers can purchase systems with four times the \npower of the 1980's mainframes at one-fiftieth of the price. Put \nanother way, systems today have over 200 times the value of systems in \n1984. By contrast, long-distance calls today represent only twice the \nvalue of long-distance calls in 1984. Had price-performance gains of \nthe same magnitude occurred in the long-distance market since 1984, the \nresults would have been equally stunning. For example, in 1984, a 10 \nminute call at day rates between New York and Los Angeles cost a little \nless than $5, today it costs $2.50. Had competition and technological \nadvances developed in the long distance market as it did in the \ncomputer market, that same call would cost less than 3 cents. \nAlternatively, a 10 minute call from New York to Japan--cost roughly \n$17 in 1984 and $14 today. Had long-distance [[Page S7886]] service \nadvanced as rapidly as the personal computer industry, that call would \ncost less than 9 cents.\n  Third. Lessons learned:\n  Yet as the United States stands at this critical crossroads--the dawn \nof a new era in high technology, entertainment, information and \ntelecommunications--America continues to operate under an antiquated \nregulatory regime. Our current regulatory scheme in America simply does \nnot take many dramatic technological changes into account.\n  Progress is being stymied by a morass of regulatory barriers which \nbalkanize the telecommunications industry into protective enclaves. We \nneed to devise a new national policy framework--a new regulatory \nparadigm for telecommunications--which accommodates and accelerates \ntechnological change and innovation.\n  The very same digitization phenomenon supports the prospect of \ncompetition by telephone companies and against telephone companies, by \ncable companies and against cable companies, by long distance companies \nand against long distance companies. Incumbents on opposite sides of \nthe traditional regulatory apartheid scheme have quite different views \nabout which kind of competition should come first.\n  If Congress cannot come to grips with digitization and convergence, \nthe private sector cannot be expected to wait.\n Indeed, the multifaceted deals and alliances of the last several years \nindicates that industry is not waiting.\n\n  Look at a short list of some of these deals:\n  US West/Time Warner. The world's largest entertainment company, and \nsecond ranking cable company, teaming up with the RBOC for the western \nUnited States.\n  AT/McCaw. The biggest long distance and equipment maker joining \nwith the biggest cellular carrier. That came on the heels of AT \nacquiring one of the biggest computer companies--NCR.\n  Sprint/Cable Alliance. The third largest long distance company--and \nonly company with local, long distance and wireless capability--joining \ncable's TCI, Comcast, Cox, and Continental to form an alliance to \nprovide a nationwide wireless communications service--and the prospect \nfor joining Sprint's broadband long distance lines with cable's high \ncapacity local facilities.\n  Microsoft. There has been an almost endless series of strategic \nalliances being struck between Microsoft, the world's largest computer \nsoftware company, and companies in numerous information and \ntelecommunications businesses for the purpose of delivering interactive \nservices.\n  HDTV Grand Alliance. The companies teaming up to bring HDTV to \nAmerica include AT largest telecom equipment maker--General \nInstrument--the largest cable TV equipment maker--and Phillips--the \nworld's largest TV set maker.\n  In addition, layered on top of these and many other deals and \nalliances is the globalization phenomenon--a breakdown of geographic \nbarriers: all the RBOC's have foreign investments; British Telecom and \nMCI in partnership; Sprint planning the same with France Telecom and \nDeutsche Telecom; AT also working with Singapore Telecom, Cable & \nWireless's Hong Kong Telephone, and the Netherlands Telecom.\n  We can no longer keep trying to fit everything into the old \ntraditional regulatory boxes--unless we want to incur unacceptable \neconomic costs, competitiveness losses, and deny American consumers \naccess to the latest products and services.\n  Since becoming chairman of the committee I have been actively working \nwith leaders in the telecommunications and information industry to \nreform this outmoded and antiquated, regulatory apartheid system in \norder to make exciting new information, telecommunications and \nentertainment services available for America.\n  It is time for American policymakers to meet this new challenge much \nthe way an earlier generation responded when the Russians launched \nSputnik. The response must be rooted in the American tradition of free \nenterprise, de-regulation, competition, and open markets--to let \ntechnology follow or create new markets, rather than Government \nmicromanaging and stunting developments in telecommunications and \ninformation technology.\n  By reforming U.S. telecommunications policy we in Congress have an \nunparalleled opportunity to unleash a digital, multimedia technology \nrevolution in America. By freeing American technological know-how, we \ncan provide Americans with immediate access to and manipulation of a \nbounty of entertainment, informational, educational, and health care \napplications and services.\n  Passing S. 652, The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation \nAct of 1995, will have profound implications for America's economic and \nsocial welfare well into the 21st Century.\n  Fourth. Universal service:\n  An additional, but often overlooked, reason for immediately moving \nforward with S. 652 and telecommunications regulatory reform concerns \nthe problems affecting the centerpiece of American communications \npolicy--maintaining universal voice telephone service at reasonable and \naffordable prices.\n  The explicit subsidies--those of known magnitude and direction--can \nand should be maintained. These are the ``Universal Service Fund,'' the \n``Link-Up America'' program, and others the FCC made part of the \noverall access charge system.\n  The implicit--or hidden--subsidies are much more at risk. The present \nscheme cannot be maintained when new technology is changing so rapidly \nand customers are provided with an ever-increasing buffet of choices. \nThis implicit subsidy scheme must be reformed and fixed. We cannot \nafford to wait any longer to start that reform process.\n\n\n               f. what s. 652 does: chief reform features\n\n  First. Universal telephone service:\n  The need to preserve widely available and reasonably priced telephone \nservice is one of the fundamental concerns addressed in The \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. The \nlegislation as reported requires all telecommunications carriers to \ncontribute to the support of universal service. Only telecommunications \ncarriers designated by the FCC or a State as ``essential \ntelecommunications carriers'' are eligible to receive support payments.\n  The bill directs the FCC to institute and refer to a Federal-State \njoint board a proceeding to recommend rules to implement universal \nservice and to establish a minimum definition of universal service. A \nState may add to the definition for its local needs.\n  Second. Local telephone competition:\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 \nreforms the regulatory process to allow competition for local telephone \nservice by cable companies, long distance companies, electric \ncompanies, and other entities.\n  Upon enactment the legislation preempts all State and local barriers \nto competing with the telephone companies. In addition it requires \nlocal exchange carriers [LEC's] having market power to negotiate, in \ngood faith, interconnection agreements for access to unbundled network \nfeatures and functions at reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates. This \nwould allow other parties to provide competitive local telephone \nservice through interconnection with the LEC's facilities. The bill \nestablishes minimum standards relating to types of interconnection that \na LEC with market power must agree to provide if requested, including: \nunbundled access to network functions and services, unbundled access to \nfacilities and information, necessary for transmission, routing, and \ninteroperability of both carriers' networks, interconnection at any \ntechnologically feasible point, access to poles, ducts, conduits and \nrights-of-way, telephone number portability, and local dialing parity.\n  As an assurance that the parties negotiate in good faith, either \nparty may ask the State to arbitrate any differences, and the State \nmust review and approve any interconnection agreement.\n  The bill requires that a Bell company use a separate subsidiary to \nprovide certain information services, equipment manufacturing, in-\nregion interLATA services authorized by the FCC, and alarm monitoring. \nIn addition a Bell company may not\n market a subsidiary's service until the Bell company is authorized by \nthe FCC to provide in-region interLATA services. [[Page S7887]] \n\n  S. 652 also ensures that regulations applicable to the \ntelecommunications industry remain current and necessary in light of \nchanges in the industry. First, the legislation permits the FCC to \nforbear from regulating carriers when forbearance is in the public \ninterest. This will allow the FCC to reduce the regulatory burdens on a \ncarrier when competition develops, or when the FCC determines that \nrelaxed regulation is in the public interest. Second, the bill requires \na Federal-State joint board to periodically review the universal \nservice policies. Third, the FCC, with respect to its regulations under \nthe 1934 act, and a Federal-State joint board with respect to State \nregulations, are required in odd-numbered years beginning in 1997 to \nreview all regulations issued under the act or State laws applicable to \ntelecommunications services. The FCC and joint board are to determine \nwhether any such regulation is no longer in the public interest as a \nresult of competition.\n  The bill modifies the foreign ownership restrictions of section 310 \nof the 1934 act, if the FCC determines that the applicable foreign \ngovernment provides equivalent market opportunities to U.S. citizens \nand entities.\n  The bill also requires that equipment manufacturers and \ntelecommunications service providers ensure that telecommunications \nequipment and services are accessible and usable by individuals with \ndisabilities, if readily achievable, a standard found in the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act.\n  Third. Long distance relief for the Bell companies:\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 \nestablishes a process under which the regional Bell companies may apply \nto the FCC to enter the long distance or interLATA market. Since the \n1984 breakup of AT, the Bell companies have been prohibited from \nproviding services between geographical areas known as LATAs, [Local \nAccess and Transport Areas]. The legislation reasserts congressional \nauthority over Bell company provision of long distance and restores the \nFCC authority to set communications policy over these issues. The \nAttorney General has a consulting role.\n  The reported bill requires Bell local companies and other LEC's \nhaving market power to open and unbundle their local networks, to \nincrease the likelihood that competition will develop for local \ntelephone service. It also sets forth a competitive checklist of \nunbundling and interconnection requirements.\n  If a Bell company satisfies the competitive checklist, the FCC is \nauthorized to permit the Bell company to provide interLATA services \noriginating in areas where it provides wireline local telephone \nservice, if the FCC also finds that Bell company provision of such \ninterLATA service is in the public interest. Out-of-region interLATA \nservices may be provided by Bell companies upon enactment.\n  S. 652 allows the Bell companies to provide interLATA services in \nconnection with the provision of certain other services immediately, \nwith safeguards to ensure that the Bell companies do not use this \nauthority to provide otherwise prohibited interLATA services. For \nexample the reported bill requires a Bell company to lease facilities \nfrom existing long distance companies if it uses interLATA service in \nthe provision of wireless services and certain information services.\n  Finally, the bill requires a Bell company providing in-region \ninterLATA service authorized by the FCC to use a separate subsidiary \nfor such services.\n  Fourth. Manufacturing authority for the Bell companies:\n  The judicial consent decree that governed the breakup of AT in \n1984, the MFJ, also prohibited the Bell companies from manufacturing \ntelephones and telephone equipment. The AT\n breakup itself, the globalization of the communications equipment \nmarket, the concentration of equipment suppliers, the increasing \nforeign penetration of the U.S. market, and the continued dispersal of \nequipment consumption have greatly diminished any potential market \npower of the Bell companies over the equipment market.\n\n  The bill permits a Bell company to engage in manufacturing of \ntelecommunications equipment once the FCC authorizes the Bell company \nto provide interLATA services. A Bell company can engage in equipment \nresearch and design activities upon enactment.\n  In conducting its manufacturing activities, a Bell company must \ncomply with the following safeguards:\n  A separate manufacturing affiliate.\n  Requirements for establishing standards and certifying equipment.\n  Protections for small telephone companies--a Bell manufacturing \naffiliate must make its equipment available to other telephone \ncompanies without discrimination or self-preference as to price \ndelivery, terms, or conditions.\n  Fifth. Cable competition, video dialtone and direct-to-home satellite \nservices:\n  The bill permits telephone companies to compete against local cable \ncompanies upon enactment, although until 1 year after enactment the FCC \nwould be required to approve Bell company plans to construct facilities \nfor common carrier video dialtone operations. The bill also removes at \nenactment all State or local barriers to cable companies providing \ntelecommunications services, without additional franchise requirements.\n  The reported bill does not require telephone companies to obtain a \nlocal franchise for video services as long as they employ a video \ndialtone system that is operated on a common carrier basis, that is, \nopen to all programmers. If a telephone company provides service over a \ncable system--that is, a system not open to all programmers--the \ntelephone company will be treated as a cable operator under title VI of \nthe 1934 act.\n  Whether a telephone company uses a video dialtone network or a cable \nsystem, it must comply with the same must-carry requirements for local \nbroadcast stations that currently apply to cable companies. A separate \nsubsidiary is not required for a Bell company carrying or providing \nvideo programming over a common carrier platform if the company \nprovides nondiscriminatory access and does not cross-subsidize its \nvideo operations.\n  The bill maintains rate regulation for the basic tier of programming \nwhere the cable operator does not face effective competition--defined \nas the provision of video services by a local telephone company or 15 \npercent penetration by another multichannel video provider. The bill \nminimizes regulation of expanded tier services.\n  Specifically the bill eliminates the ability of a single subscriber \nto initiate at the FCC a rate complaint proceeding concerning expanded \ntier services. In addition, the FCC may only find rates for expanded \ntier service unreasonable, and subject to regulation, if the rates \nsubstantially exceed the national average rates for comparable cable \nprogramming services.\n  States may impose sales taxes on direct-to-home satellite services \nthat provide services to subscribers in the State. The right of State \nand local authorities to impose other taxes on direct-to-home satellite \nservices is limited by the bill.\n  Sixth. Entry by registered utilities into telecommunications:\n  Under current law, gas and electric utility holding companies that \nare not registered may provide telecommunication services to consumers. \nThere does not appear to be sufficient\n justification to continue to preclude registered utility holding \ncompanies from providing this same competition.\n\n  The bill provides that affiliates of registered public utility \nholding companies may engage in the provision of telecommunications \nservices, notwithstanding the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n1935. The affiliate engaged in providing telecommunications must keep \nseparate books and records, and the States are authorized to require \nindependent audits on an annual basis.\n  Seventh. Alarm services:\n  The bill prohibits a Bell company from providing alarm monitoring \nservices. Beginning 3 years after enactment, a Bell company may provide \nsuch services if it has received authorization from the FCC to provide \nin-region interLATA service. The bill requires the FCC to establish \nrules governing Bell company provision of alarm monitoring services. A \nBell company that was in the alarm service business as of December 31, \n1994 is allowed to continue providing that service, as long as certain \nconditions are met. [[Page S7888]] \n  Eighth: Spectrum flexibility and regulatory reform for broadcasters:\n  If the FCC permits a broadcast television licensee to provide \nadvanced television services, the bill requires the FCC to adopt rules \nto permit such broadcasters flexibility to use the advanced television \nspectrum for ancillary and supplementary services, if the licensee \nprovides to the public at least one free advanced television program \nservice. The FCC is authorized to collect an annual fee from the \nbroadcaster if the broadcaster offers ancillary or supplementary \nservices for a fee to subscribers.\n  A single broadcast licensee is permitted to reach 35 percent of the \nnational audience, up from the current 25 percent. Moreover, the FCC is \nrequired to review all of its ownership rules biennially. Broadcast \nlicense terms are lengthened for television licenses from 5 to 10 years \nand for radio licenses from 7 to 10 years. Finally, new broadcast \nlicense renewal procedures are established.\n  Ninth. Obscenity and other wrongful uses of telecommunications:\n  The decency provisions in the reported bill modernize the protections \nin the 1934 act against obscene, lewd, indecent, and harassing use of a \ntelephone. The decency provisions increase the penalties for obscene, \nharassing, and wrongful utilization of telecommunications facilities, \nprotect families from uninvited cable programming which is unsuitable \nfor children, and give cable operators authority to refuse to transmit \nprograms or portions of programs on public or leased access channels \nwhich contain obscenity, indecency, or nudity.\n  The bill provides defenses to companies that merely provide \ntransmission services, navigational tools for the Internet, or \nintermediate storage for customers moving material from one location to \nanother. It also allows an on-line service to defend itself in court by \nshowing a good-faith effort to lock out adult material and to provide \nwarnings about adult material before it is downloaded.\n\n\n                  G. The Deregulatory Nature of S. 652\n\n  Ronald Reagan once joked--in the midst of a debate over the budget--\nthat the only reason Our Lord was able to create the World in 6 days \nwas that he didn't have to contend with the embedded base.\n  I have been wrestling with the communications issues since I came to \nCongress. We all have. This has become the congressional equivalent of \nChairman Mao's famous ``Long March.''\n  Nothing in the field is easy. We are dealing with basic services--\ntelephone, TV, and cable TV--that touch virtually every American \nfamily. We are dealing with massive investment--more than half a \ntrillion dollars. We are dealing with industries which provide almost \ntwo million American jobs. We are dealing with high-tech enterprises \nthat are critical to the future of the American economy, and our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  The stakes are high for everyone. And it is the sheer number of \nissues and concerns that accounts for the complexity of any \nlegislation.\n  First. A major step forward:\n  But let me talk briefly about some of the major steps forward which \nare envisioned in this bill.\n  When the former head of the National Telecommunications & Information \nAdministration testified before the Senate, he commented that, \n``Everything in the world is compared to what.''\n  Well, virtually all of the bills which the Senate or the House has \ndealt with over the past generation took the concept of regulated \nmonopoly as a given.\n  Whether we are talking about Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin's bill, \nH.R. 1315 in the House in the 1970's; or Senator Packwood's effort back \nin 1981--S. 898: All of these bills assumed that monopoly, like the \npoor, would always be with us.\n  Second. A paradigm shift:\n  My bill changes that. Instead of conceding that concern, this bill:\n  Removes virtually all legal barriers to competition in all \ncommunications markets--local exchange, long distance, wireless, cable, \nand manufacturing.\n  It establishes a process that will require continuing justification \nfor rules and regulations each 2 years. Every 2 years, in other words, \nall the rules and regulations will be on the table. If they don't make \nsense, there is a process established to terminate them.\n  It restores full responsibility to Congress and the FCC for \nregulating communications. Under the bill that the House passed last \nspring, for example, you would have still had a substantial, continuing \ninvolvement in communications policy on the part of the Justice \nDepartment and the Federal courts. This bill brings the troops home.\n  Third. Genuinely deregulatory:\n  I understand the concerns that some of my colleagues have raised. \nSenator McCain has raised the question of whether this bill is \nderegulatory enough. Senator Packwood has asked if we could not speed \nup the transition to full, unregulated competition. These are valid \nconcerns.\n  But let me highlight some of the deregulatory steps which this bill \nmakes possible now.\n  First, it will make it possible for the FCC immediately to forebear \nfrom economically regulating each and every competitive long-distance \noperator. The Federal courts have ruled that the FCC cannot deregulate. \nThis bill solves that problem and makes deregulation legal and \ndesirable.\n  Second, this bill envisions removing a whole chunk of unnecessary \ncable television price controls now. We leave the power to control \nbasic service charges, until local video markets are more competitive. \nBut the authority to regulate the nonbasic services, the expanded \ntiers, is peeled back. That represents\n a major step toward deregulation and more reliance on competitive \nmarkets.\n\n  Third, this bill contains a competitive checklist for determining \nBell Co. entry into currently prohibited markets like long distance and \nmanufacturing. After Bell companies satisfy all the requirements, the \nFCC must, in effect, certify compliance by making a public interest \ndetermination.\n  This is not--contrary to some allegations--more regulation. At least \none of the Bell companies--NYNEX--can probably fulfill all the \nchecklist's requirements very soon, because State regulators have \nalready required that company to make the most of the necessary changes \nin the way it does business. The bill also explicitly says that the \ncompetitive checklist cannot be expanded.\n  So, if you read all the provisions in the bill in context, you will \nsee that there simply is no broad grant of discretion to the Federal or \nState regulators here. We have essentially spelled out the recipe for \ncompetition, and it is incumbent on them to follow it.\n  Fourth.--Future orientation:\n  Let me mention another critical aspect of this bill, it is future \noriented.\n  Too many of the earlier measures were focused on the status quo. What \nthey basically did was rearrange existing markets and services. The \n1984 and 1992 Cable Television Acts, for instance, did not take steps \nto encourage competition, it kept in place all the restrictions on \ntelephone company and broadcast competition. Moreover, the 1984 Cable \nAct also maintained exclusive franchising for cable television.\n  This bill essentially seeks to change that focus. We assumed that \ncable television might become an effective competitor to local phone \ncompanies, for instance, so we sought to get rid of any regulations \nthat would block that. We also assumed that local phone companies might \nbe effective cable competitors, so we tried to get rid of restrictions \non that kind of competition.\n  In the case of broadcasting, we recognized that this important \nindustry is going to need much more flexibility to compete effectively \nin tomorrow's multichannel world. So, we will allow broadcasters to \noffer more than just pictures and sound as well as multiple channels of \npictures and sound, if they so choose. Under this bill, they will have \nthe flexibility they need to compete in evolving markets.\n  Fifth. Safeguarding core values:\n  This bill is aggressively deregulatory. It seeks to achieve genuine, \nlong-term reductions in the level and intensity of Federal, State and \nlocal governmental involvement in telecommunications.\n  But this bill is also responsibly deregulatory. When it comes to \nmaintaining universal access to telecommunications services, for \ninstance, it does that, It establishes a process that will make sure \nthat rural and [[Page S7889]] small-town America doesn't get left in \nthe lurch.\n  This bill also maintains significant Federal oversight. \nTelecommunications, remember, isn't like trucking, or railroads, or \nairline transportation. The services we are talking about here are \nmarketed and consumed directly by the public.\n  This bill seeks to advance core values. I know that the Exon \nAmendment--which places limits on obscene and indecent computer \ncommunications--has sparked controversy. All that amendment actually \ndoes is apply to computer communications the same guidelines and \nlimitations which already apply to telephone communications.\n  Sixth. Further responsibility:\n  This bill also recognizes the fact that deregulation is always a \ngradual, transitional process--and that Congress has the responsibility \nto stay involved.\n  All of us know that good legislation is only one facet of the overall \nderegulatory process. Other requirements are careful scrutiny of \nbudgets, of appointments to the FCC and other agencies, and effective \nCongressional oversight. No one should try to fool themselves into \nbelieving that we can get away on the cheap. We can't.\n  If we are serious about deregulating this marketplace and--more \nimportantly--expanding the range of competitive choices available to \nthe American public, Congress is going to have to stay a central \nplayer.\n  Seventh. Summary of affirmative aspects:\n  Let me summarize, then, what I see as very positive, affirmative \naspects of this bill:\n  First, it dispenses with the old government-sanctioned monopoly model \nand replaces it with a process of open access which will lead to more \ncompetition across-the-board, in every part of the communications \nbusiness. It flattens all regulatory barriers to market entry in all \ntelecommunications markets. The more open access takes hold, the less \nother government intervention is needed to protect competition. Open \naccess is the principle establishing a fair method to move local phone \nmonopolies and the oligopolistic long distance industry into full \ncompetition with one another. Completion of the steps on the pro-\ncompetitive checklist will give both the long distance firms and the \nlocal telephone companies confidence that neither side is gaming the \nsystem.\n  Second, it eliminates a number of unnecessary rules and regulations \nnow--by giving the FCC the discretion to forebear from regulating \ncompetitive communications services, by removing unneeded, high-tier, \ncable price controls.\n  Third, it establishes a process for continuing attic-to-basement \nreview of all regulations on a 2 year cycle.\n  Fourth, it seeks to create an environment that is more conducive to \nmore new services and more competitors--by allowing broadcasters and \ncable operators, for instance, greater competitive flexibility, and \ngiving local and long distance phone companies more chances to compete \nas well.\n  Fifth, it terminates the involvement of the Justice Department and \nthe Federal courts in the making of national telecommunications policy.\n  Sixth, the bill emphasizes effective competition while also \nsafeguarding core values, such as universal service access and \nlimitations on indecency; and,\n  Finally, it maintains the responsibility of Congress to continue to \nwork through the budget, oversight, and confirmation processes to move \nthis critical sector toward full competition and deregulation.\n\n\n                         h. benefits of s. 652\n\n  In General. Competition and deregulation in telecommunications as a \nresult of the Pressler Bill means:\n  Lower prices for local, cellular, and long distance phone service, \nand lower cable television prices, too.\n  More and less costly business and consumer electronics to make U.S. \nbusiness more competitive and American citizens better informed.\n  Expanded customer options, as business is spurred to bring new \ntechnology to the marketplace faster. In addition to more choices for \nlong distance, cellular, broadcast, and other services where \ncompetition already exists, competition and choice in local phone and \ncable services will be introduced.\n  High technology jobs with a future for more Americans, economic \ngrowth, and continued U.S. leadership in this critical field. The \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors estimates that deregulating \ntelecommunications laws will create 1.4 million new jobs in the \nservices sector of the economy alone by the year 2003. In a Bell \nCompany funded study, WEFA concluded that telecommunications \nderegulation would cause the U.S. economy to grow 0.5 percent faster on \naverage over the next 10 years, creating 3.4 million new jobs by the \nyear 2005, and generating a cumulative increase of $1.8 trillion in \nreal GDP. Finally, George Gilder has estimated $2 trillion in \nadditional economic activity with the Pressler Bill.\n  More exports of high-value products, and greater success on the part \nof U.S.-based telecommunications equipment $10.25 billion, and services \n$3.3 billion, companies as well as computer equipment $29.2 billion, \ncompanies as they leverage their domestic gains to make more sales \noverseas.\n  In Media. Competition and deregulation in electronic media including \nbroadcasting, cable, and satellite services means:\n  More Networks and Channels. In the early 1970s, there were three \nnational TV networks and virtually no cable systems. Today, there are 6 \nnational TV networks, plus 10,000 cable TV systems serving 65 percent \nof American homes--96% have the cable option--with DBS now offering \ndigital service to millions more. The average American family now has \naccess to some 30 video channel choices. Much more is on the way if the \nPressler Bill is enacted into law.\n  More News and Public Affairs. Cable deregulation--spurred by \nsatellite communications deregulation--made more news and public \naffairs programming available. CNN, C-SPAN, and ESPN are prime \nexamples. Local all news channels and local C-SPAN-oriented programming \nis on its way if deregulation occurs.\n  More Jobs. Relaxing broadcast rules and regulations--spurred by the \ngrowth of cable TV--made it possible for some 300 new TV and 2,000 new \nradio outlets to emerge. This created 10,000 new jobs in broadcasting.\n  Small town and rural America parity. Satellites and cable TV service \nmeans small town and rural Americans command nearly the same media \nchoices only big city residents once enjoyed. This democratization has \nspurred public awareness of national and international events--as well \nas encouraged fuller participation in the political process.\n  Political shift. Satellites, cable, talk radio, and C-SPAN, which \nwere a specific result of deregulation and competition in \ncommunications, were prime ingredients to last year's landmark national \npolitical shift. Further decentralization of media control through \nderegulation will accelerate this democratization phenomenon.\n  In telephone service. Competition and deregulation in the telephone \nbusiness means:\n  Lower prices. Deregulation of phone equipment resulting in faster \ndeployment of advanced equipment has made it possible to reduce local \nphone rates by $4 billion since 1987. More long distance competition \nhas meant nearly $20 billion in price cuts since 1987. Virtually all \nAmericans now have far more choices in phone equipment and long \ndistance service--and with the Pressler Bill will see choices in local \nphone services.\n  New options. Sixty million American families now have cordless \nphones. Twenty-five million now have cellular phones. Fifty million \nhave answering machines. Twenty million have pagers. Deregulation has \nallowed technology to evolve to meet the demands of an increasingly \nmobile society.\n  Special benefits. Cellular phones have helped millions of American \nwomen feel safer and more secure. They have made it possible to drive \nsafely under even the most severe weather conditions, because now help \ncan be called.\n  Computer services. Competition and deregulation in telecommunications \nwill speed the deployment of the so-called information superhighway. \nCurrently, 40 percent of American homes have a personal computer. \nComputers are ubiquitous for American business. There is one school \ncomputer for every nine students. Competition and deregulation will \nmean new communications [[Page S7890]] facilities that will magnify the \npower of these computers.\n  International competitiveness. Telecommunications is a prime leverage \ntechnology. Competition and deregulation expands\n business access to this new technology. That makes American business \nmore competitive globally. Deregulation also spurs U.S. production and \nexport of high value-added products like computers, advanced telephone \nswitches, mobile radios, and fiber optics. Each dollar invested in \ntelecommunications results in $3 of economic growth.\n\n  For agriculture. For agriculture, competition and deregulation in \ncommunications means:\n  Efficiency. Farms today are the most technology-intensive small \nbusinesses. American farmers will be able to harness computer, \ncommunications, and satellite technology to stay the world's most \nefficient lowest cost food producers.\n  Integration with the national community. Communications advances help \nintegrate the farm community with Americans nationwide. Farm families \nwill have the same news, public affairs, and entertainment choices \nnearly any American does.\n  Distance learning/telemedicine. Schools in small town and rural areas \nwill be able to offer the same schooling options as those in the \nsuburbs and major cities. Telemedicine systems will improve the quality \nof health care available in small town and rural America, especially \nfor the home bound elderly in our society.\n  More jobs. Deregulation means more modern communications systems as \ncosts drop for small town and rural areas which, in turn, help these \nareas attract and retain businesses and jobs. Communications \nderegulation in Nebraska meant thousands of new jobs for the State. \nDeregulation in North Dakota did the same--one of the country's biggest \ntravel agencies now operate out of Linder and employs several hundred \nlocal people.\n  For Government. For Government agencies, competition and deregulation \nin telecommunications means:\n  Better service. With voice mail, smart phone services--for example, \nto renew your library book, press 1, facsimile, and electronic mail, \nFederal, State and local agencies will be able to provide the public \nbetter service.\n  Reduced cost. Technology through deregulation and competition also \nhelps Government curb costs. Taxpayers thus get better service without \nhaving to pay more. The right-sizing of Government agencies is made \npossible.\n  Responsiveness. Using all the latest communications technologies, \nGovernment offices will be able to greatly expand their constituent \nservices, including here on Capitol Hill.\n  For business. For business, competition and deregulation in \ntelecommunications means:\n  No geographical disadvantage. The ability to locate businesses away \nfrom center cities, and to allow many workers, especially working \nmothers, to telecommute thus reducing urban traffic congestion, \npollution problems, and easing child care problems.\n  Expanding markets. Fax, 800-numbers, United Parcel, and Federal \nExpress have made it possible for even the smallest companies today to \ncompete on a state-wide, regional, national, and even international \nscale.\n  Working smarter. Satellite networks, computerized point-of-sale \nterminals--cash registers--and computerized inventory systems often \nlinked directly to suppliers make it possible for U.S. retailers and \nother businesses to stay very competitive without being overstocked or \nunderstocked. Technology which will be made more available through \nderegulation has also allowed stores to operate in once remote areas. \nWal-Mart has become America largest retailer, despite its largely rural \norigins, chiefly because the company was able to harness the best in \ncontemporary communications.\n  For educators. For educators, competition and deregulation in \ntelecommunications means:\n  Greater parity. Students in small town and rural America, and in \ninner cities, will be able to access the same information and \ninstructional resources only wealthy suburban districts have. Advanced \nmath, science, and foreign language courses that many schools could not \noffer previously are available through telecommunications. This reduces \nthe pressures to close or consolidate small town and rural schools and \nother institutions, which helps communities maintain their unique local \ncharacter.\n  Lower costs. Competition lowers the cost of telecommunications \nequipment and services. This makes it possible for schools to adopt \ncommunications techniques without needing to expand budgets and local \ntaxes.\n  For law enforcement. For law enforcement, competition and \nderegulation in telecommunications means:\n  Efficiencies. Communications equipment prices will continue to fall. \nPolice will be able to afford to buy on board computers, advanced \nradiocommunications, and other high-tech systems. This magnifies the \neffectiveness of law enforcement budgets.\n  Better coordination. Advanced communications and computer systems \nwill result in far better coordination among Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies. Nationwide criminal records, drunk driving, \nstolen car, and other checks can be undertaken quickly and cheaply. \nThis means law breakers will face a higher risk of apprehension, which \nmeans a stronger deterrent against crime.\n  Personal security. Advanced computer and communications technology \nplace home security systems within reach of more and more American \nfamilies. Easier access to cellular phones will help Americans stay \nsafer and feel more secure. At the same time, these telecommunications \nand information technologies help police, fire department and emergency \nmedical services drastically reduce response times. In the case of \nemergency medical services far better on-the-spot service will be \nprovided.\n  For South Dakota and other small city and rural areas:\n  The bill is designed to rapidly accelerate private sector development \nof advanced telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \ncompetition.\n  Recent series of television commercials have shown people sending \nfaxes from the beach, having meetings via computer with people in a \nforeign country, using their computer to search for theater tickets and \na host of other services that soon will be available. My bill would \nmake those services available even sooner by removing restrictive \nregulations.\n  A person living in Brandon could work at a job in Minneapolis or \nChicago, students in Lemmon would be able to take classes from teachers \nin Omaha, and doctors in Freeman could consult with specialists at the \nMayo Clinic. Telecommunications can bring new economic growth, \neducation, health care and other opportunities to South Dakota.\n  Competition in the information and communications industries means \nmore choices for people in South Dakota. It will also mean lower costs \nand a greater array of services and technologies. For instance, \ncompeting for customers will compel companies to offer more advanced\n services like caller ID or local connections to on-line services such \nas Prodigy and America On-Line.\n\n  It hasn't been that long since Ma Bell was everyone's source for \nlocal phone service, long-distance service, and phone equipment. Now \nthere are over 400 long-distance companies and people can buy phone \nequipment at any department or discount store. Under my bill, \neventually people would be able to choose from more than one local \nphone service or cable television operator.\n  This new competition also should lead to economic development \nopportunities in South Dakota. People will be able to locate businesses \nin towns like Groton and Humboldt and serve customers in Hong Kong or \nNew York City. We are entering an exciting era. I want to spur growth \nand bring new opportunities to South Dakota and everywhere in America.\n\n\n                             j. conclusion\n\n  S. 652 is legislation providing for the most comprehensive \nderegulation in the history of the telecommunications industry.\n  Enacting this bill means ending regulatory apartheid. Under the \nCommunications Act of 1934 and the Federal judiciary's Modification of \nFinal Judgment, sectors of the communications industry are forcibly \nseparated and [[Page S7891]] segregated. This created Government-\nimposed and sanctioned monopoly models for the telecommunications \nsector.\n  S. 652 tears down all the segregation barriers to competition and \nends the monopoly model for telecommunications. It opens up \nunprecedented new freedom for access, affordability, flexibility, and \ncreativity in telecommunications and information products and services.\n  Passing S. 652 will hasten the arrival of a powerful network of two-\nway broadband communications links for homes, schools, and small and \nlarge businesses. For my home State of South Dakota, and other States \naway from the big population centers, this reform bill will make the \nInternet and other computer communications more easily accessible and \naffordable.\n  Local phone companies, long-distance phone companies, cable TV \nsystems, broadcasters, wireless and satellite communications entities, \nand electric utility companies all will gain freedom to compete with \none another in the communications business.\n  S. 652 is not only a deregulation bill, it is a procompetitive bill. \nThere is an important distinction. The 1984 Cable Act; for instance, \nderegulated rates for the cable industry but explicitly kept intact the \nbarriers keeping telephone, electric companies, broadcasters, and \nothers from competing for cable TV service. Keeping the monopoly model \nin place while lifting the lid on prices led directly to a backlash and \nreregulation in the Cable Act of 1992.\n  This reform law will open the door for billions of dollars of new \ninvestment and growth. The United States is the world leader in \ntelecommunications products, software, and services. Still, we labor \nunder self-defeating limits on our ability to grow at home and compete \nabroad. Most foreign countries retaliate for the strict U.S. limits on \nforeign investment. This keeps us out of markets where we would have \nthe natural competitive advantage and leaves them open to our \ncompetitors. Telecommunications innovation and productivity is \nflourishing in such countries as the United Kingdom, which has \neliminated many barriers to foreign investment. The new legislation \nwill lift limits on foreign investment in U.S. common carrier \nenterprises on a fair, reciprocal basis.\n  To maintain our world leadership position we need new legislation. S. \n652 will improve international competitiveness markedly by expanding \nexports. In 1994, according to the Department of Commerce, \ntelecommunications services--local exchange, long distance, \ninternational, cellular and mobile radio, satellite, and data \ncommunications--accounted for $3.3 billion in exports. \nTelecommunications equipment--switching and transmission equipment; \ntelephones; facsimile machines; radio and TV broadcasting equipment, \nfixed and mobile radio systems; cellular radio telephones; radio \ntransmitters, transceivers and receivers; fiber optics equipment; \nsatellite communications systems; closed-circuit and cable TV \nequipment--accounted for $10.25 billion in exports. Finally, computer \nequipment accounted for $29.2 billion in exports. With this new \nlegislation, telecommunications and computer equipment and services \nwill be America's No. 1 export sector.\n  S. 652 will spur economic growth, create new jobs, and substantially \nincrease productivity. As noted earlier, each dollar invested in \ntelecommunications results in 3 dollars' worth of economic growth. The \nClinton/Gore administration estimates that with telecommunications \nderegulation the telecommunications and information sector of the \neconomy would double its share of the GDP by 2003 and employment would \nrise from 3.6 million today to 5 million by 2003. The WEFA Group, in a \nBell Company funded study, stated that with telecommunications \nderegulation 3.4 million jobs would be created in the next 10 years. In \naddition, the GDP would be approximately $300 billion higher, and \nconsumers would save approximately $550 billion. Finally, George Gilder\n recently testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that if \ntelecommunications deregulation like that contemplated in S. 652 does \nnot take place, America will lose up to $2 trillion in new economic \nactivity in the 1990s.\n\n  S. 652 will also assist in delivering better quality of life through \nmore efficient provision of educational, health care and other social \nservices. Distance learning and telemedicine applications are \nespecially important in rural and small city areas of America. With the \nadvent of digital wireless technologies the cost of providing service \nwill be lowered tenfold thus closing the gap between the costs of \nserving urban and rural areas.\n  If we in Congress do our job right, by passing this legislation, we \nhave the potential to be America's new high-tech pioneers--an \nopportunity to explore the new American frontier of high-tech \ntelecommunications and computers that will be unleashed through bold \nfree enterprise, de-regulatory, procompetitive, open entry policies. By \ntaking a balanced approach which doesn't favor any industry segment \nover any other, we will First, stimulate economic growth, jobs, and \ncapital investment; second, help American competitiveness; third, \nminimize transitional inequities and dislocations; and fourth, actually \ndo something very good for universal service goals.\n  Mr. President, on March 28, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation voted 17 to 2 to report S. 652, the Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  Telecommunications policy usually rates attention on the business \npages, not as a front-page story. Still, for the average American \nfamily, legislation to reform regulations of our telephone, cable, and \nbroadcasting industries is surely one of the most important matters the \n104th Congress will consider.\n\n\n                        open, deliberate process\n\n  Mr. President, this reform legislation was years in the making. It is \nthe handiwork of numerous Senators from both parties, who have shared a \ncommon recognition that our laws are outdated and anticompetitive.\n  The recent hearing process which informed the Commerce Committee and \nled to development of S. 652 began in February 1994. During 1994 and \n1995 the Commerce Committee held 14 days of hearings on \ntelecommunications reform. The committee heard testimony from 109 \nwitnesses during this process. The overwhelming message we received was \nthat Americans want urgent action to open up our Nation's \ntelecommunications markets.\n  At the beginning of the 104th Congress, on January 31 of this year, I \ncirculated a discussion draft of a telecommunications deregulation bill \nwhich reflected ideas from all the Republican members of the Commerce \nCommittee. I invited the comments of ranking Democratic member Hollings \nand other Democratic members. In just 2 weeks time, Senator Hollings \npresented a comprehensive response. He has been a tremendous ally in \nthis effort, as have many of my colleagues on the committee.\n  Senator Hollings and I and Democratic and Republican members of the \ncommittee, together with the majority and minority leaders, then \nengaged in an open, deliberate, productive process of discussion and \nnegotiation.\n  Mr. President, it is accurate to say that staff from both parties \nhave worked night after night, weekend after weekend, with scarcely any \nrespite, since before Christmas on this bill.\n  Mr. President, just as it won overwhelming bipartisan support in \ncommittee, S. 652 deserves passage by a strong bipartisan vote here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  When I travel around my State of South Dakota and see the craving for \ndistance learning, for telemedicine, for better access to the Internet \nand the other networks taking shape to improve our productivity and \nquality of life, it helps me understand the need for this legislation, \nthe need to work and fight for this reform.\n  Mr. President, the obstacles for progress in telecommunications are \nnot technical. They are political. We have it in our power to tear \nthose obstacles down. S.\n 652 does a substantial part of the job of tearing them all down.\n\n\n                 restoring congressional responsibility\n\n  S. 652 returns responsibility for communications policy to Congress \nafter years of micromanagement by the courts. This bill will terminate \njudicial control of telecommunications policy, in particular, Federal \nJudge Harold [[Page S7892]] Greene's ``Modification of Final Judgment'' \nregime which has governed the telephone business since the breakup of \nAT in 1984.\n  When the courts control policy, they are restricted to narrow \nconsiderations. Congress, on the other hand, takes into account a whole \nrange of economic and social implications in establishing a national \npolicy framework. S. 652 provides such an approach to \ntelecommunications reform.\n  Piecemeal policymaking by the courts severely delays productive \neconomic activity. The average waiver process before the Department of \nJustice and the court takes an average of 4\\1/2\\ to 5 years to \ncomplete. Such delays cause uncertainty in markets and significantly \nreduce investment in telecommunications, an increasingly vital sector \nof our economy.\n\n\n                        profoundly pro-consumer\n\n  Our electronic media are in a creative tumult known as the digital \nrevolution. New technology is erasing old distinctions between cable \nTV, telephone service, broadcasting, audio and video recording, and \ninteractive personal computers. In many instances, the only thing \nstanding in the way of consumers and businesses enjoying cheaper and \nmore flexible telecommunications services are outdated laws and \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, S. 652 is profoundly proconsumer. The bill breaks up \nmonopolies--that's proconsumer. The bill sweeps away burdensome \nregulations. This will lower consumer costs--that's proconsumer.\n  The bill opens up world investment markets for the U.S. \ntelecommunications business. The impact will be more jobs, new \nservices, lower costs--that's proconsumer.\n  Mr. President, American consumers and businesses want to enjoy the \nfull benefits of the digital revolution. They want more communicating \npower, more services, more openings, and lower prices. They want wide-\nopen competition.\n  It is possible for Americans to have all of these. The obstacles in \ntheir way are not technical. We have the most powerful economy, the \nmost advanced technological base in the world. The obstacles are \npolitical.\n  The information industry already constitutes one-seventh of the U.S. \neconomy. Worldwide, the information marketplace is projected to exceed \n$3 trillion by the close of the decade. Today's Federal laws prevent \ndifferent media from competing in one another's markets, although they \nhave the technical ability to do so.\n  The regional Bell operating companies are protected with monopoly \nstatus in the local residential phone service markets. But they are \nbarred from manufacturing phone equipment, offering long-distance \nservice, or competing in a cable video market. Cable companies, though \ntechnically capable, are forbidden to offer competing phone service.\n  The status quo preserves monopolies and keeps American consumers from \naccess to an array of products and service options. The existing system \nof law, regulation, and court decrees, holds back the American \ntelecommunications industry from its full potential to compete in world \nmarkets.\n  S. 652 would change all this. It would bring about the most \nfundamental overhaul of communications policy in more than 60 years. It \nwill break up the monopolies and increase competition. S. 652 \nimmediately lifts regulations barring local telephone companies' entry \ninto cable service and cable's entry into the local phone business.\n  It allows electric utilities to offer service in both the phone and \ncable markets, and provides fair, effective, and rapid means to make \ncertain that local Bell companies abandon all vestiges of monopoly. \nThen it allows those companies into the long-distance and phone \nequipment manufacturing markets.\n  This bill ends decades of protectionism in the telephone investment \nmarkets. This will help assure access to capital to build the Nation's \nnext generation informational networking.\n  On a reciprocal basis, it will give Americans more freedom to profit \nby making major investments in the telecommunications projects of \ngrowing markets abroad. For households and business in my home State of \nSouth Dakota and all around the Nation, S. 652 means lower prices for \nlocal, cellular, and long-distance phone service and lower cable \ntelevision prices, too. The new competition also will spur companies to \nbring new technology and services to the marketplace faster.\n  Phone customers would be assured the same number of digits and the \nsame listing in directory assistance and the white pages, whether they \nchoose the local Bell company or a new competitor. What is more, phone \nnumbers will be portable. A customer will keep the same number even if \nhe or she moves among phone companies to get better prices.\n  S. 652 promotes competition in cable markets while protecting \nconsumers from surges in rates. The outcome, I fully expect for \nconsumers, perhaps as soon as a year from enactment of the bill, is \nplentiful competition and low rates without Federal controls.\n  Freeing business from overregulation is creative and it is \nproconsumer. There was heavy skepticism 15 years ago about deregulating \nnatural gas prices, but look at the results. I remember I was in the \nHouse of Representatives in those days and everybody said if we \nderegulate natural gas, prices are going to soar. They did not. They \nwent down. Natural gas prices are lower than ever.\n  Now consider how dramatic the difference in proconsumer advances have \nbeen between an unregulated part of the information sector--personal \ncomputers--compared with the heavily-regulated telephone sector.\n  The personal computer success story is especially important in my \nState of South Dakota. Because a firm that was a tiny start-up in South \nDakota a few years ago, Gateway 2000, is now a major player in personal \ncomputer markets. It is one of the quality leaders in home computing \nproducts.\n  Computer industry entrepreneurs were free to gamble on the personal \ncomputer. No Federal or State regulator told them what they could and \ncould not build, what specifications they had to meet, what markets to \ntarget. Market competition was fierce. Technological progress was \nbreathtaking.\n  By 1990, the upstart personal computer industry was selling for \n$5,000 a computer with as much processing power as a $250,000 \nminicomputer of the mid-1980's, more than that of a million-dollar \nmainframe of the 1970's. Now personal computers with more than twice \nthe processing power are available for $1,500.\n  The upshot, in terms of price and power, is that today's computer \nsystems have over 200 times the value of systems in 1994. Even with the \nhistoric breakup of the AT long-distance monopoly, the telephone \nbusiness has remained heavily regulated, and consumers have gained \nvalue. In 1984, a 10-minute call from New York to Los Angeles cost $5. \nToday it cost $2.50. It should cost less, and will cost less.\n  If competition and technological advances have developed in the long-\ndistance market, as they had in the computer market over the same \nperiod, that same phone call would cost less than 3 cents today, rather \nthan $2.50. Three cents.\n  The regulatory status quo needs shaking up. That is what S. 652 would \ndo. It would do less for big existing companies than for the businesses \nand services that are still waiting to be created, and many of those \nwill be small businesses. Most important, it would help bring about an \nexplosion of new job opportunities and services for the American \npeople.\n  Let me take just a moment to describe in detail the key reforms in S. \n652. First, universal telephone service, the need to preserve widely \navailable and reasonably priced services is a fundamental concern \naddressed in S. 652. The bill preserves universal service, improves it, \nand makes it cost less.\n  It requires all telecommunications carriers to contribute to the \nsupport of universal service. Only telecommunication carriers \ndesignated by the FCC or a State as ``essential telecommunication \ncarriers'' are eligible to receive support payments. The bill directs \nthe FCC to institute and refer to a Federal-State joint board, a \nproceeding to recommend rules to implement universal service and to \nestablish a minimum definition of universal service. A State may add to \nthe definition for its local needs.\n  Mr. President, to smaller cities and rural communities and others who \ndepend upon universal service nothing is [[Page S7893]] changed. They \ncontinue to enjoy affordable access to phone service as before. The \nmost important impact of S. 652 is structural and management reform in \nuniversal service that will save the American taxpayers $3 billion over \nthe next 5 years. I think that is important to say. The universal \nservice of this will cost less in these years.\n  For local telephone competition, S. 652 gives a green light to local \ntelephone competition. The bill breaks up the old monopoly system for \nlocal phone service. All Federal barriers to competition will be \nremoved, and all State and local barriers will be preempted. Cable \ncompanies, long-distance companies, electric companies and other \nentities will gain a chance to offer lower prices and better service \nfor local phone service.\n  Upon enactment, the legislation preempts all State and local barriers \nto competing with the telephone companies. In addition, it requires \nlocal exchange carriers having market powers to negotiate, in good \nfaith, interconnection agreements for access to unbundled network \nfeatures and functions that reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates.\n  This allows other parties to provide competitive service through \ninterconnection with the LEC's facilities. The bill establishes minimum \nstandards relating to types of interconnection that an LEC with market \npower must agree to provide if requested, including the following: \nUnbundled access to network functions and services; unbundled access to \nfacilities and information; necessary for transmission, routing, and \ninteroperability of both carriers' networks; interconnection at any \ntechnological feasible point; access of polls, ducts, conduits, and \nrights of way; telephone number portability; and local dialing parity.\n  As an assurance that the parties negotiate in good faith, either \nparty may ask the State to arbitrate any differences, and the State \nmust review and approve any interconnection agreement.\n  There is long distance and manufacturing relief for the Bell \ncompanies. The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n1995 establishes a process under which the regional Bell companies may \napply to the FCC to enter the long-distance market. Since the 1984 \nbreakup of AT, the Bell companies have been prohibited from providing \nlong-distance service. S. 652 reasserts congressional authority over \nBell company provision of long distance and restores the FCC authority \nto set communication policy over those issues. The Attorney General has \na consulting role.\n  The bill requires Bell local companies and other LEC's with marketing \npower to open and unbundle their local networks to increase the \nlikelihood that competition will develop for local telephone service.\n  It sets forth a competitive checklist of unbundling and \ninterconnection requirements. If a Bell company satisfies the \nchecklist, the FCC is authorized to permit the Bell company to long-\ndistance service if this is found to be in the public interest.\n  Once a Bell company has met the checklist requirements, it also will \nbe allowed to enter the markets for manufacturing phone equipment.\n  In conducting its manufacturing activities, a Bell company must \ncomply with the following safeguards:\n  A separate manufacturing affiliate;\n  Requirements for establishing standards and certifying equipment;\n  Protections for small telephone companies. A Bell manufacturing \naffiliate must make its equipment available to other telephone \ncompanies without discrimination or self-preference as to price \ndelivery, terms, or conditions.\n  This bill also opens international investment markets.\n  S. 652 lifts limits on foreign ownership of U.S. common carriers. The \nbill establishes a reciprocity formula whereby a foreign national or \nforeign-owned company would be able to invest more than the current 25 \npercent limit in a U.S. telephone company if American citizens or firms \nenjoyed comparable opportunities. This would allow increased investment \nin and by the U.S. telecommunications industry, which enjoys worldwide \ncomparative advantage.\n  Finally, in the area of cable competition, the bill permits telephone \ncompanies to compete against local cable companies upon enactment, \nalthough until 1 year after enactment the FCC would be required to \napprove Bell company plans to construct facilities for common carrier \n``video dialtone'' operations. The bill also removes at enactment all \nState or local barriers to cable companies providing telecommunications \nservices, without additional franchise requirements.\n  The bill maintains rate regulation for the basic tier of programming \nwhere the cable operator does not face ``effective competition,'' \ndefined as the provision of video services by a local telephone company \nor 15 percent penetration by another multichannel video provider. The \nbill minimizes regulation of expanded tier services. Specifically the \nbill eliminates the ability of a single subscriber to initiate at the \nFCC a rate complaint proceeding concerning expanded tier services. In \naddition, the FCC may only find rates for expanded tier service \nunreasonable, and subject to regulation,\n if the rates substantially exceed the national average rates for \ncomparable cable programming services.\n\n  In the area of spectrum flexibility and regulatory reform for \nbroadcasters, if the FCC permits a broadcast television licensee to \nprovide advanced television services, the bill requires the FCC to \nadopt rules to permit such broadcasters flexibility to use the advanced \ntelevision spectrum for ancillary and supplementary services, if the \nlicensee provides to the public at least one free advanced television \nprogram service. The FCC is authorized to collect an annual fee from \nthe broadcaster if the broadcaster offers ancillary or supplementary \nservices for a fee to subscribers.\n  A single broadcast licensee is permitted to reach 35 percent of the \nnational audience, up from the current 25 percent. Moreover, the FCC is \nrequired to review all of its ownership rules biennially. Broadcast \nlicense terms are lengthened for television licenses from 5 to 10 years \nand for radio licenses from 7 to 10 years. Finally, new broadcast \nlicense renewal procedures are established.\n  Entry by registered utilities into telecommunications is allowed.\n  Under current law, gas and electric utility holding companies that \nare not registered may provide telecommunication services to consumers. \nThere does not appear to be sufficient justification to continue to \npreclude registered utility holding companies from providing this same \ncompetition. The bill provides that affiliates of registered public \nutility holding companies may engage in the provision of \ntelecommunications services, notwithstanding the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act of 1935. The affiliate engaged in providing \ntelecommunications must keep separate books and records, and the States \nare authorized to require independent audits on an annual basis.\n\n\n                             alarm services\n\n  Beginning 3 years after enactment, a Bell company may provide such \nservices if it has received authorization from the FCC to provide in-\nregion interLATA service. The bill requires the FCC to establish rules \ngoverning Bell company provision of alarm monitoring services. A Bell \ncompany that was in the alarm service business as of December 31, 1994 \nis allowed to continue providing that service, as long as certain \nconditions are met.\n  Finally, continuous review and reduction of regulation.\n  The bill also ensures that regulations applicable to the \ntelecommunications industry remain current and necessary in light of \nchanges in the industry. First, the legislation permits the FCC to \nforbear from regulating carriers when forbearance is in the public \ninterest. This will allow the FCC to reduce the regulatory burdens on a \ncarrier when competition develops, or when the FCC determines that \nrelaxed regulation is in the public interest.\n  Second, the bill requires a Federal-State Joint Board to periodically \nreview the universal service policies.\n  Third, the FCC, with respect to its regulations under the 1934 act, \nand a Federal-State Joint Board with respect to State regulations, are \nrequired in odd-numbered years beginning in 1997 to review all \nregulations issued under the act or State laws applicable to \ntelecommunications services. The FCC and Joint Board are to determine \nwhether any such regulation is no longer in the [[Page S7894]] public \ninterest as a result of competition.\n  In short, Mr. President, this bill promotes deregulation as far as it \nlogically should go. It provides a kind of ``sunset'' process for all \nregulations which the bill does not abolish immediately.\n  I welcome the coming debate and vote on S. 652. I urge my colleagues \nto reassert congressional responsibility for telecommunications policy.\n  Let me say, in summary and in conclusion, Mr. President, what we are \ntrying to do here is to get everyone into everyone else's business. The \neconomic apartheid that has been a part of telecommunications since the \nact of 1934 should be brought to an end.\n  I believe the passage of this bill would be like the Oklahoma land \nrush, the going off of the gun, because presently a lot of investment \nin the United States is paralyzed because we do not have a roadmap for \nthe next 5, 10, or 15 years until we get into the wireless age.\n  What is happening is that many of our companies are investing in \nEurope or abroad because they are prohibited from manufacturing or \ndoing something here. As a result, American jobs are being lost.\n  This particular bill, if we can pass it, will provide a roadmap which \nbusinessmen and investors will be able to invest in and make an \nexplosion of new devices, an explosion of new jobs, and will help our \ncountry a great deal.\n  I think it will help consumers by lowering prices and providing more \ndevices, and it will also help labor by providing more jobs of the type \nthat we need in our country.\n  I wish to pay tribute again to Senator Hollings and his staff and all \nthe Senators on the committee who have worked so hard--and Senators in \nthis Chamber. I have spoken to all 100 Senators at some point on this \nbill and it has been a long time getting it up. I hope we can proceed \nthrough today and tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as the communications bill, S. 652, \ncomes up for consideration, my first urge is one of gratitude. I want \nto thank the majority leader and minority leader for their leadership \nin calling up this bill and, of course, I particularly want to thank \nthe chairman of our committee who has been outstanding in working all \nday long in getting this bill to the floor.\n  Senator Lott on the majority side and Senator Inouye, who was the \nchairman of our Communications Subcommittee, now the ranking member, \nhave been working around the clock. Of course, particular thanks goes, \nagain, for our staff members. I thank the chairman's staff--Paddy Link, \nKatie King, and Donald McLellan. On my staff particular gratitude must \ngo to Kevin Curtin, John Windhausen, and Kevin Joseph for all their \nefforts.\n  We do not extend such thanks casually. This effort started in the \nfall of 1993, and every Friday morning we would meet with the Bell \ncompanies, the regional Bell operating companies. Every Tuesday morning \nthe staffs would meet again with the competing interests of long \ndistance and all the other industry interests. We have continued those \nmeetings right up to this afternoon. We have been working, meeting, \nreconciling, trying our dead-level best to bring a complicated measure \nup to the modern age of telecommunications.\n  To this Senator, they have all done an outstanding job. So it is not \na casual ``thanks,'' but it is one that is very genuine and sincere. We \nthank them all for their cooperation and understanding.\n  As this bill is called up, it is good to note and emphasize that the \nCommerce Committee reported it by a vote of 17 to 2 on March 23. It is \na product of months and months of consideration and discussion by the \ncommittee and by Senators all involved. In the last Congress, Senators \nInouye, Danforth, and I sponsored S. 1822, which was approved at that \ntime by the Commerce Committee by a vote 18 to 2.\n  The committee held 31 hours of testimony, 11 days of hearings, and \nheard from 86-plus witnesses. In this Congress, the committee on S. 652 \nhas held 3 days of hearings on telecommunications reform, heard from a \nnumber of witnesses representing a broad variety of interests.\n  S. 652 achieves a very, very important objective. Most important of \nall the objectives was the requirement of universal telephone service \nthat would be available and affordable and continued to be outstanding. \nWe have the finest communications services in the world.\n  This Senator went through the experience of airline deregulation. And \ntruth is truth, and facts are facts. Do not come and tell me how \nairline deregulation is working. All of the airlines have just about \ngone broke. And I can tell you from paying just to go from Charleston \nto Washington and Washington to Charleston and back, it is just an \ninordinate 600 and some odd dollars. What has happened is 85 percent of \nAmerica is subsidizing some 15 percent for the long haul. They talk \nabout market forces, market forces. We had a good arrangement on the \nregulated airline service, and we have come full circle now with \nregulating foreign airlines and KLM taking over Northwest, British Air \ncoming in on USAir, and all the rest being saved while we proudly stand \nup as politicians blowing hot and hard how wonderful airline \nderegulation is working. That is hooey.\n  I wanted to make sure that we did not fall in and mess up in this \nparticular one with the wonderful telecommunications service that we \nhave had. This bill promotes competition in the telecommunications \nmarket and restores regulatory authority over the industry to the \nFederal Communications Commission. That administrative entity has also \nbeen outstanding in their rendering of decisions and moving forward as \nbest they could with the technological developments. But the \ncompetition of the communications and regular telephonic service and \nlong distance evolved into a heck of a monopoly that we could not \nderegulate. I was on the teams that worked all during the 1970's and \nthe early 1980's. Finally, the Department of Justice had to bust it up. \nWe found out that they were so strong politically and financially that \nthey could cancel out any and everybody. Senator Dole on the majority \nside, this Senator on the minority side, all during the 1980's tried to \nget it back to the FCC, and we were blocked. This Senate passed the \nmanufacturing bill to allow the Bell companies to get into \nmanufacturing, passed by a vote of 74, bipartisan, and it was blocked \nover on the House side.\n  So the difficulty has really been in trying to get it from Judge \nGreene back into the administrative body where the people's decisions \nand policies are made by the Congress, administered by the Federal \nCommunications Commission, but blocked by the industry itself time and \ntime again.\n  Let me also mention Judge Greene who has done an outstanding job. I \nwant to make note that it was just announced that Judge Greene will \nenter senior status this August. I just could not give him enough kudos \nin the way he has handled this, almost a one-man administrative \nresponsibility for over 10 years now in his deliberate approach to the \nneeds of the public by maintaining at the same time universal service.\n  The basic thrust of this bill is clear. Competition is the best \nregulator of the marketplace. But until that competition exists, until \nthe markets are opened, monopoly-provided services must not be able to \nexploit the monopoly power to the consumers' disadvantage. Competitors \nare ready and willing to enter the new markets as soon as they are \nopened. Competition is spurred by S. 652's provisions, specifying \ncriteria for entry into the various markets.\n  For example, on a broad scale, cable companies will provide telephone \nservice; telephone companies will offer video services, as pointed out \nby our distinguished chairman; and telephone companies will, in \naddition, provide to the consumers the continued universal service; the \nconsumers will be able to purchase local telephone service from several \ncompetitors; electric utility companies will offer telecommunications \nservices; the regional Bell operating companies will engage in \nmanufacturing activities. All of these participants will foster \ncompetition with each other and create jobs along the way. Of course, \nlong distance will enter the local exchange, and as the local exchange \nis opened, the regional Bell operating companies will enter into long \n[[Page S7895]] distance. So we are really moving very expeditiously \ninto the competitive market.\n  We should not attempt to micro- manage the marketplace. Rather, we \nmust set the rules in a way that neutralizes any party's inherent \nmarket power so that robust and fair competition can ensue. This is \nCongress' responsibility.\n  So this bill transfers jurisdiction over the modified final judgment \nfrom the courts to the Federal Communications Commission. Judge Greene, \nas I mentioned, has been overseeing that modified final judgment in an \noutstanding fashion. He was doing yeoman's work in attempting to ensure \nthat monopolies do not abuse that market power. Now it is time for the \nCongress to reassert its responsibilities in this area.\n  Let me address some of the specific areas of importance. The need to \nprotect advanced universal service is one fundamental concern of the \ncommittee in reporting S. 652. Universal service must be guaranteed, \nthe world's best telephone system must continue to grow and develop, \nand we must ensure the widest availability of telephone service. Under \nthis bill, all telecommunications carriers must contribute to their \nuniversal service fund. A Federal-State joint board will define \nuniversal service. This definition will evolve. It is a flexible \nrequirement--a requirement, I should say rather, of flexibility so that \nthe definition will evolve over time as technologies change so that \nconsumers have access to the best possible services.\n  Special provisions in the legislation address universal service in \nrural areas to guarantee that harm to universal service is avoided \nthere. One of the most contentious issues in this whole discussion has \nbeen when the regional Bell operating companies should be allowed to \nenter the long distance market.\n  Under section VII(C) of the modified final judgment consented to buy \nall the RBOC's and attested to in the hearings that we have had on this \nbill, as a group the test has been whether the RBOC's seeking entry \ninto long distance could have a substantial possibility of impeding \ncompetition in that long distance market which it seeks to enter.\n  Last year, S. 1822 contained a requirement that the Department of \nJustice utilize this test in considering any application for the \nregional Bell operating companies' entry into long distance. In \naddition, the FCC was to utilize a public interest test for considering \nany such application. This was an approach to which the regional Bell \noperating companies agreed during the last Congress. This year, earlier \ndraft provisions, however, set a date certain for entry by the RBOC's \ninto the long distance market.\n  So after all the hearings and much discussion and negotiation, we \ndetermined that this self-defeating approach of a calendar ruling there \nwould be no consideration of the competitive circumstances in the \nmarketplace.\n  So S. 652 specifies that the FCC may approve any application to \nprovide long distance if it finds, one, that the RBOC has fully \nimplemented the unbundling features specified in the competitive \nchecklist in the new section 255 of the Federal Communications Act of \n1934;\n two, the RBOC will provide long distance using a separate subsidiary; \nand, three, application is consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity.\n\n  Mr. President, when I mentioned that section 255 is a new section \nunder the Communications Act, I should say of 1934. It is good to point \nout that we have used the original Communications Act of 1934, as \namended, for the simple reason that over the 60 plus years we now have \na complex body of law, special rulings, interpretations of legal \nexpressions and requirements by the courts. We are now tasked with the \njob of trying to bring competition to a regulatory structure based on a \nmonopoly and open up the marketplace.\n  I remember in an earlier debate we had this year it was brought out \nthat 60,000 lawyers are registered to practice before the District of \nColumbia bar, 59,000 of whom are probably members of the federal \ncommunications bar. That is why you will see every effort to change \nevery little word and analyze every phrase. So we have really had a \ndifficult task trying to break up the monopoly of the local telephone \ncompanies and to open the market so competition could ensue and yet it \nis the monopoly that has provided us with the universal service we all \nenjoy. We do not want to penalize or jeopardize in any sense the \nregional Bell operating companies that have been doing an outstanding \njob because there is no shortcut there. If you penalize them and put \nthem into an uncompetitive position, then, of course, your rates are \nbound to go up.\n  So S. 652 is a balanced bill. The public interest test is fundamental \nto my support for the legislation. In making this public interest \nevaluation, the FCC is instructed to consult with the Department of \nJustice which may furnish the Federal Communications Commission with \nadvice on the application using whatever standard it finds appropriate, \nincluding antitrust analysis under the Clayton and Sherman Acts and \nalso section VIII(C) under the Modified Final Judgment.\n  Mr. President, this is great leap from the actual and demonstrable \ncompetition test originally proposed in S. 1822 from the last Congress. \nWhile I would prefer a more active Department of Justice role, and an \nexplicit reference in the statute to the section VIII(C) test, I \nsupport the provisions of S. 652 because the FCC will have the benefit \nof the Department of Justice views prior to making any decision. The \nDepartment of Justice may well decide to base its decision on whether \nthere is a substantial possibility that the regional Bell operating \ncompany will impede competition through use of its monopoly power or \nany other standard under the antitrust law. The report accompanying \nthis bill makes it clear.\n  I might emphasize at this particular point the leadership that \nalready this year has been given by the antitrust division, by the \nDepartment of Justice and the outstanding director, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, Ms. Anne Bingaman. She has obtained what we as politicians \nhave been trying over 4 years to get together, and that is about a \nmonth ago on national TV there appeared the regional Bell operating \ncompany, Ameritech, the long distance company AT, the Department of \nJustice and the Consumer Federation of America, all four entities \nimportant to the entire process agreeing on the steps of unbundling, \ndialing parity, access, interconnection, all of these things all ironed \nout that in the technological world of communications we have debated \nback and forth over these many years. They have gotten together. They \nare going into Grand Rapids and Chicago, and, of course, the RBOC is \ngetting into long distance.\n  And so while we politicians on the floor of the Senate will be \ndebating in the next few days, no doubt it should be mentioned that the \nDepartment of Justice, under the leadership of Ms. Anne Bingaman, has \nalready gotten the parties together. I am convinced that their consent \ndecree now before Judge Greene will be affirmed.\n  S. 652 requires that an RBOC must provide long distance using a \nsubsidiary separate from itself to avoid any cross-subsidization \nbetween local and long-distance rates. These and other safeguards in \nthe bill should prevent against RBOC abuses in the long-distance \nmarket.\n  The committee-approved bill also includes some deregulation rates for \ncable television. The Democratic proposal at the beginning of the year \ndid not suggest any such deregulation because from 1986 to 1992 cable \nrates had risen three times faster than the rate of inflation, so that \nthe Congress back in 1992 overwhelmingly imposed rate regulation and \nnew service standards on the cable operators.\n  We passed the 1992 Cable Act largely in response to the complaints \nfrom consumers that rates had soared beyond reason and service was \npoor. The bill actually became law with the bipartisan vote to override \nPresident Bush's veto.\n  Now, since the 1992 act was adopted, the cable industry has \nexperienced significant growth. Subscribership is up, stock values in \ncable companies have risen dramatically, and debt financing by the \ncable industry rose in 1994 by almost $4 billion over the 1993 levels. \nBut the Consumer Federation of America estimates that $3 billion has \nbeen saved for American consumers through the rate regulation that has \nbeen put into [[Page S7896]] place. Yet some in the industry maintain \nthat cable regulation produces uncertainty in financial markets and \nthat cable operators will need to be able to respond to new competitors \nthrough additional revenues.\n  S. 652, therefore, changes the standard of regulation for the upper \ntiers of cable programming. It makes no changes in the regulation of \nthe basic tier. Under the bill, a rate for the upper tier cannot be \nfound to be unreasonable unless it substantially exceeds the national \naverage rate for comparable cable programming.\n  This standard will allow cable operators greater regulatory \nflexibility for the upper tiers. The bill retains the FCC's authority \nto regulate excessive rates charged to the upper tiers.\n  In addition, the bill changes the definition of effective competition \nin the 1992 act to allow cable rates to be deregulated as soon as the \ntelephone company begins to offer competing cable services in the \nfranchise area. Once consumers have a choice among entities offering \ncable service, the need for regulation no longer exists.\n  S. 652 increases the ability of any entity including television \nnetworks to own more broadcast stations. Today, the FCC rules allow an \nentity to own broadcast stations that reach no more than 25 percent of \nthe Nation's population. This limit was imposed out of concern that \nbroadcast stations would be owned by a few individuals, and that \nconcentration would not be beneficial to our local communities or yield \nthe benefits that result from the expression of diverse points of view. \nS. 652 would increase that level to 35 percent.\n  Any modification in the national ownership cap is important because \nof localism concerns. Local television stations provide vitally \nimportant services in our communities. Because local programming \ninforms our citizens about natural disasters, brings news of local \nevents, and provides other community-building benefits, we cannot \nafford to undermine this valuable local resource.\n  Earlier drafts of the legislation would have eliminated many of the \nFCC regulatory limits on the broadcast industry. By contrast, S. 1822, \nas approved by the Commerce Committee last year, required the FCC to \nconduct a proceeding to review the desirability of changing these \nrules.\n I think the bill with 35 percent permeation is an acceptable \ncompromise between those positions.\n\n  In addition, the bill repeals a prohibition on cable broadcast \ncrossownership. S. 652 makes no change in the other broadcast ownership \nrules such as the duopoly rule or the one-in-the-marketplace rule. \nRather, the FCC is instructed to review these rules every 2 years, and \nthey can change it upon review.\n  This comprehensive bill strikes a balance between competition and \nregulation. New markets will be open, competitors will begin to offer \nservices, consumers will be better served by having choices among \nproviders and services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I myself would have gone \nfurther in several areas covered by the legislation, but I have seen \nthat any one sector of the telecommunications industry can stop this \nbill and checkmate the others, as I have stated before. \nTelecommunications reform is too important to let this opportunity go \nby.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it should be emphasized that here is one \nindustry that suffered from deregulation. You cannot approach this \nproblem in S. 652 as we bring it into the technological age without \nthinking back to 1912 when David Sarnoff was a clerk in Wanamaker's \nstore and the sinking of the Titanic was occurring. They raced him up \nto the roof of Wanamaker's. He set up his wireless, made radio contact \nwith the sinking ship and contacted rescue vessels, directing not only \nsome of the rescue effort but the names of survivors, working almost 72 \nhours around the clock.\n  Everyone then got a wireless. There was not any regulation. And by \n1924, when Herbert Hoover was the Secretary of Commerce, all of those \nwireless operators came rushing to the Secretary of Commerce and said, \n``For heaven's sake, we have nothing but jamming.'' The radio \nbroadcasters, who have a tremendous interest in this S. 652, went \nbegging to be regulated. So they were in the act of 1927 and brought \ninto that age then with the 1934 act.\n  So those who are now talking about getting rid of the Government and, \nincidentally, by the way, we can save money by getting rid of the FCC, \nought to stop, look and listen. They have to have a sense of history. \nWe can get rid of total deregulation, jamming each other and all that \nsort of thing, but, after all, the public airways belong to the public, \non the one hand, and they need a modicum of administration, on the \nother hand, for this finest, finest of communications systems in the \nentire world.\n  Let us not talk about the FCC costing money. They are the entity this \nyear that already by auction has brought in $7 billion to the Federal \nGovernment. If you can find any other bureau, commission, \nadministration, department of Government or otherwise that has reaped 7 \nbillion bucks, I would like to find it.\n  We have the money to administer all of these things and bring it into \na deregulatory, competitive position, but it has to be done in an \norderly fashion, and everyone connected and working on this understands \nthat. So let us not start talking about getting rid of the FCC and act \nlike you are doing something sensible.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it may well be that the two distinguished \nsouthern managers of this bill, the Senators from South Dakota and \nSouth Carolina, may never have imagined that this day would come. This \nis probably the first occasion on which a thorough philosophical change \nin direction in communications law has been debated on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate since the Communications Act of 1934, some 61 years ago.\n  In 1934, of course, communications was via old-fashioned dial or \noperator-assisted telephone through radio stations and through Western \nUnion telegrams. The technological situation of the time called for \nmonopoly communications systems and the necessity of regulation of \nthose systems in the public interest to see that prices were not too \nhigh.\n  Today, of course, technology is so totally and completely different \nthat an entirely different regime is needed. Perhaps the greatest \ndifficulty in bringing this day on which we start this debate to pass \nhas been the fact that in each long set of hearings in the Senate \nCommerce Committee over a year or more, each tentative set of \nconclusions on the part of these two Senators, and others, by the time \nthose conclusions had been reached, the technology has gone beyond \nthose conclusions.\n  So there seems to be a broad agreement across both parties and many \npolitical philosophies that there should be a large degree of \nderegulation as a part of any bill, based on the proposition that we \ncannot tell how much the technology will change in the next 6 months, \nmuch less the next 10 years, and that we should accommodate it without \nconstantly trying to regulate it through some form of statutory \nlanguage. That is the philosophy of this bill, a philosophy of \ncompetition rather than of regulated monopoly.\n  It has been a difficult process and it is likely to be a difficult \nprocess for the next 3 or 4 days.\n  So rather than repeat anything that the two leaders in this debate \nhave said, I would simply like to say from the perspective of this \nSenator, as a member of the Commerce Committee, there have been three \nguiding principles in dealing with the many conflicts among groups who \nwould like to provide communication services, and those three guiding \nprinciples are, of course, deregulation, competition and the interests \nof the consumers, the users of these various services.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of areas covered by this bill in \nwhich those three interests lead to the same conclusion: Deregulation \nwill promote competition, competition will promote the consumer \ninterest.\n  Those parts of the bill probably will not be the subject of much \ndiscussion during the course of this debate. They have been worked out. \nBut the three considerations are at least slightly different and move \nin slightly different [[Page S7897]] directions. Because of the nature \nof the communications industry, which still includes huge regulated \nmonopolies, a total and complete deregulation at least carries with it \nthe risk not of competition but of an unregulated monopoly substituting \nitself for a regulated monopoly. So there must be a degree of caution \nin the speed and the completeness of any kind of deregulation.\n  Almost always, it seems to me, Mr. President, that competition is in \nthe consumer interest, though ironically many of the so-called \norganized consumer groups have little faith in competition and in the \nfree market and believe in various forms of state socialism and want in \nmany respects more regulation. I believe, Mr. President, that those so-\ncalled consumer representatives rarely represent the actual consumer \ninterest.\n  So as we go through this debate over particular proposed amendments \nduring the course of the next week, it seems to me we all have to \nattempt to judge them on the basis of those three principles: Are they \nderegulatory in nature in a constructive fashion that is consistent \nwith the march of new technologies? Do they promote competition? And \nare they in the consumer interest?\n  Mr. President, there is only one other major point that I want to \nmake at this time, and that is that of all of the proposals with which \nI have had to deal in my career in the Senate, this is perhaps the most \nimportant for the future of our economy. Perhaps as much as 20 percent \nof our economy is connected with communications in some respect or \nanother. And, of course, the lobbying, the attempt to influence all of \nus on the part of people who are in the communications business or wish \nto be in the communications business is fierce, is overwhelming in \nnature. At the same time, the actual consumers of these goods, our \nconstituents, who are not in the business, are almost totally silent.\n  I have hardly gotten a handful of telephone calls or letters from \nordinary citizens about this bill. It is too big. It is too \ncomplicated. It is about the future. It is very difficult to come up \nwith an intelligent opinion off the top of one's head on some of the \nparticular controversial areas in it. And so it is up to us to weigh \nthe consumer interest as we work our way through this legislation, \nalong with those features that will lead to competition, generally \nspeaking, through deregulation.\n  My observation is that the large companies and groups which are \nalready in the communications business do sincerely favor competition. \nBut, generally speaking, they would like to create a competitive \natmosphere in which they are at least even, and perhaps have a little \nbit of an advantage. And so the mythical even playing field is \nsomething to which all give lipservice but each defines in a different \nfashion.\n  Now, the new companies, the entrepreneurs, those who are just \nbeginning in the field, or wish to get in the field, simply want it \nopened up. They want to be able to compete, where today they cannot. \nFew of them are large enough to demand some kind of special privileges \nor another. And we need to encourage both.\n  We need to encourage the continued investment in this new technology \non the part of those companies that have been in the business literally \nforever. We cannot lose their expertise and that tremendous investment. \nWe need to see to it that those large companies are able to compete \nagainst one another in the consumer interest. At the same time, we also \nneed to see to it that the niche companies, the new companies, the \npeople with bright new ideas, are able to get into this business and if \nthey are tremendously successful, become large companies as well.\n  So, Mr. President, we search for deregulation, we search for \ncompetition, and we search for the consumer interests. I think we all \ndo so sincerely, determined that we need to make major changes, and \nperhaps with a degree of humility, that we do not know what is going to \nhappen tomorrow, and we wish to craft an outline which will allow \ntomorrow to take place without our having crushed it by unanticipated \nconsequences to the actions we take here.\n  I want to close by congratulating both of my colleagues, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and also the Senator from South Carolina, who has \nspent a major part of his career in this field and who now has, I \nthink, the enviable task of attempting to manage this legislation \nwisely and successfully to a conclusion that will benefit all of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. First, I thank and congratulate the chairman and the \nranking member of the committee, Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings. \nWe have been promising week after week that this bill was coming to the \nfloor. I do not believe it now that it is on the floor and pending. I \nhave every expectation, with their management skills, that we can \nprobably finish this bill by Friday noon. If that is the case, we \nprobably would not have any votes on Monday--if that is an incentive \nfor anybody. We might have debate on some other bill but no votes on \nMonday. So if we can consider those incentive programs as we go along, \nit will be helpful. But it is a very important piece of legislation. It \nis probably the most important bill we have considered all year, no \ndoubt about it. It will create jobs, opportunity, all of the things we \nhave talked about. I have listened to both managers' opening \nstatements.\n  Mr. President, some may consider S. 652 to be the end of a long, \nlong, process. And no doubt about it, telecommunications deregulation \nlegislation has been an idea debated around here for nearly a decade. \nIn fact, I first introduced telecommunications deregulation legislation \nin 1986.\n  But rather than seeing this bill as an end to the process, I see it \nas a beginning: A beginning of a new era of leadership for the \ntelecommunications industry and for America.\n  And one person who deserves a good deal of credit for making this new \nera a reality is Senator Pressler. As all Members know, this is a \ntough, complex, and often contentious issue. And Senator Pressler and \nSenator Hollings have done an outstanding job at bringing the competing \ninterests together--or as close together as possible.\n  Senator Hollings was the chairman and came very close last year to \ngetting a bill. This year, under the chairmanship of Senator Pressler, \nwe are on the floor with the bill. We have not passed it yet, but my \nunderstanding is that there is a lot of bipartisan support. It is not a \npartisan measure, a Democrat or Republican partisan fight. So we ought \nto be able to complete it quickly, because they have done an \noutstanding job of bringing the competing interests as close together \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, leadership in telecommunications, whether it was \ninventing the telegraph or the microchip, has been an American \ntradition. And we will continue that tradition with passage of this \nbill.\n  As I have said before, telecom reform will be the real jobs stimulus \npackage of this decade.\n  Building the necessary infrastructure will require thousands of \nprivate sector jobs. And that is just the beginning. Millions more will \nbe created because information will become more accessible. Jobs that \nwill make America more efficient, more productive, and ultimately more \npowerful.\n  Looking back on Congress' track record, a casual observer would think \nthat we have a grudge against the communications industry. Fortunately, \nthis image is changing and Republicans are glad to see that traditional \n``pro-regulators'' are finally coming around to our competitive way of \nthinking.\n  We must develop a flexible policy that will accommodate the explosion \nof new technology. That policy, of course, is promoting competition. It \nis irresponsible to think we can do anything more.\n  No one knows the benefits of free and open competition better than \nthe computer and semi-conductor industries. Just take a look at a few \nof the players in the U.S. communications industry.\n  Last year, the computer industry earned revenues close to $360 \nbillion. Two things are amazing about that figure. First, it is twice \nthe telephone industry's revenues. And second, revenues from the \npersonal computer industry, which for all intents and purposes was non-\nexistent in 1980, account for almost half of that figure. In other \nwords, revenues in personal computers [[Page S7898]] have grown as much \nin 14 years as the entire telephone industry did in 100.\n  It is not too difficult to figure out that the computer industry \nbenefitted from fierce competition and minimal government regulation. \nPhone companies did not.\n  Cable TV also exploded after it was de-regulated in 1984. At that \ntime, its revenues were $7.8 billion and it employed 67,381 persons. \nFast-forward to 1992. Revenues tripled and employment numbers jumped to \n108,280. While these numbers are also good, I would suggest that the \ncable TV industry would have done much better if it had faced \ncompetition. More importantly, I would also suggest that there would \nnot have been the abuses which prompted Congress to enact re-regulation \nin 1992.\n  My point is simple: competition, not regulation, has the best record \nfor creating new jobs, spurring new innovation, and creating new \nwealth.\n  Mr. President, America is at the cross roads, and Congress must make \na choice. A touch choice, as we all know. But I believe that if we ask \nthe right question, we will get the right\n Answer. As I see it, we must ask ourselves, ``who will decide the \ncommunications industry's future.''\n\n  I say we allow the real technical experts to decide. And I am not \ntalking about government bureaucrats. Instead, we should look to the \nexperts in the field, the entrepreneurs, the engineers, and the \ninnovators. It seems to me that they will do a far better job for our \ncountry if big government leaves them alone.\n  I, for one, cannot allow government to become the biggest player in \nthe telecommunications industry. Too much is at stake. It is nonsense \nto gamble away millions of new jobs. It is nonsense to gamble away \nAmerica's ability to compete, and win, around the world. And it is \nnonsense to gamble away the spoils that the information age will bring.\n  To get there, I have worked with the committee to develop a \ncomprehensive deregulatory amendment that touches all sectors of the \ncommunications industry. It is my understanding that the managers are \nnot quite ready to accept it now.\n  I have a list describing each provision that I will insert in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks, but for now, I will just highlight a \nfew of the provisions.\n  First, deregulate small cable TV systems. This has bipartisan \nsupport. Although views differ on deregulating the entire cable TV \nindustry, most of us can agree that rural and small systems need rate \nrelief in order to survive. This provision gets it done.\n  Second, force the Federal Communications Commission to eliminate \noutdated regulations, and do so in a timely manner. Currently, there is \nno guarantee that the Commission will ever act on requests that it \nforbear on regulations. Under this amendment, the Commission must \nrespond within 90-days--60 more can be added if the issue requires \nadditional scrutiny. Most importantly, it must provide a written \ndetermination to justify its actions.\n  Third, eliminate the number of TV stations that any one entity can \nown. Currently, the limit is capped at 12. This amendment removes that \ncap. I want to point out, however, that this amendment does not, I \nrepeat, does not increase the percentage of national viewership beyond \nthe 35 percent that is included in the chairman's mark.\n  The amendment also eliminates the number of radio stations one can \nown, unless the Commission finds that issuing or transferring a license \nwill harm competition.\n  The measure also privatizes or eliminates a number of FCC functions. \nThe Commission deserves credit for making these suggestions that \ncomprise this provision. In other words they came from the FCC.\n  I could go on at length, but I believe I have given my colleagues a \nflavor of what this amendment is about.\n I know the managers and members of their staffs are well acquainted \nwith it.\n\n  This amendment does represent the hard work of many Members, \nobviously Members on both sides of the aisle. Senator Burns has been \nworking on this for a couple years, Senator Craig, Senator Packwood, \nSenator McCain on our side, just to name a few, and, of course, Senator \nPressler and Senator Hollings.\n  It does not matter how long we work on it, if we cannot get it \naccepted, it does not make any difference. We hope at the appropriate \ntime that it can be accepted. I hope that we will continue on the \nprocompetitive, deregulatory course that we have taken in a bipartisan \nway, and in only that way will we ensure that today is beginning a new \nrenaissance for America.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary of the deregulation package be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Summary of Deregulation Package\n\n       Transfers Judge Green's MFJ (consent decree) to the FCC.\n       Eliminates GTE's consent decree.\n       Adopts definition to restrict expansion of universal \n     service so that it does not spiral out of control.\n       Greater deregulation for small cable TV. As the bill stands \n     now, small cable can't take advantage of any rate \n     deregulation because of the way their systems are set-up. To \n     take care of them, the deregulatory amendment would \n     completely eliminate rate regulation for cable operators who \n     serve less than 35,000 in one franchise area, and do not \n     serve more than 1% of all subscribers nationwide (650,000 \n     subscribers). Obviously, this is a pretty broad definition of \n     a ``small'' cable company.\n       Increase the Commission's ability to forbear on regulation.\n       Establish a petition driven process to force the commission \n     to forbear on regulation within a 90-day period. If the \n     Commission does not act, or extend period by an additional 60 \n     days, the petition shall be deemed granted. If petition is \n     rejected, it must be with a written explanation. In short, it \n     will force the commission to justify any and all of its \n     regulations.\n       Eliminate the number of TV stations any one entity can own.\n       Force the Commission to change its rules so that any entity \n     can reach up to 35% of Americans with TV broadcast systems \n     (the current cap is at 25%).\n       Eliminate the number of radio stations any one entity can \n     own, unless it would harm competition.\n       Have FCC consider eliminating rate regulation in long \n     distance market.\n       Regulatory relief. Speed up FCC action for phone companies \n     by making any revised charge that reduces rates effective 7 \n     days after it is filed with commission. Rate increases will \n     be effective 15 days after submission. To block such changes, \n     FCC must justify its actions.\n       Eliminate arcane requirement that phone companies must File \n     any line extension with Commission. As it stands now, \n     companies have to get the commission to approve any line \n     extension which often takes more than a year.\n       Phone companies will only have to file cost allocation \n     manuals on a yearly basis.\n       Eliminate the following FCC functions: Repeal setting of \n     Depreciation rates; Have Commission subcontract out its audit \n     functions; Simplify coordination between Feds and States; \n     Privatize Ship radio inspections; Permit Commission to waive \n     construction permits for broadcast stations as long as \n     license application is submitted 10 days after construction \n     is completed.\n       Also terminate broadcast licenses if a station is silent \n     for more that 12 consecutive months. Subcontract out testing \n     and certification of equipment. Permit operation of domestic \n     ship and aircraft radios without license. Eliminate FCC \n     jurisdiction over government owned radio stations. Eliminate \n     burdensome paperwork involved in Amateur Radio examination. \n     Streamline non-broadcast radio licenses renewals.\n                           Amendment No. 1255\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am not \nobjecting to having it laid aside. I am here to inquire what the \nprocedure is going to be. The Senator is offering an amendment and is \nnot going do debate it here this evening? It will be laid aside?\n  I have not seen this copy. The Senator is not proposing it be \naccepted at this moment?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the managers may be ready to accept it by tomorrow \nmorning.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield. That is correct. In fact, \nabout 2 hours ago we had it worked out, but there is some further \ninterest on our side that we have yet to clear. The distinguished \nminority leader has another amendment that he wanted to present at the \nsame time, and I think we can work that out.\n  That is the idea, to temporarily lay it aside and move on.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will not object, but I will inform the manager of this \nbill that I will not give unanimous consent to this being accepted \nuntil I have read it and signed off on it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have obviously no problem with that. In fact, I can give \nthe Senator from Nebraska a summary of it, too. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thought we had this agreed to this afternoon, but I \nguess the minority leader has something he would like to add or change. \nBut I would like to inquire of the majority leader if we cannot get \nagreement tonight.\n  Shall we make this one of the votes at 8:30 or 9 o'clock in the \nmorning?\n  Mr. DOLE. If it is acceptable, I do not need a vote. I do not want to \npenalize anybody.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is the Senator asking to set a time for a vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not on this amendment. I will wait until the Senator from \nNebraska indicates he has had a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do think that everyone should be aware \nthat the bill we are considering is larger in its impact on the \nnational economy than the health care reform measure we considered last \nyear.\n  This bill, in a conservative way, will impact more than one-third of \nthe economy of the United States.\n  It is a bill that is designed to transition from the 1934 \nCommunications Act to a period sometime, hopefully, around the turn of \nthe century when we will have deregulated telecommunications because of \nthe competition that we this bill will instill and guarantee.\n  Now, the bill will put the communications policy of the United States \nback where it belongs, in the hands of the elected representatives and \nthe President, and will take it out of the courts. By setting rules for \nentry into long distance by the Bell operating companies, I think we \nbring to a close an over-10-year policy-making period by the U.S. \ncourts.\n  This bill will open the local telephone market to competition. It \nwill bring competition and new services to all parts of the United \nStates.\n  It is not a permanent piece of legislation, in my judgment. This is \nnot a bill that will replace, totally, the 1934 act. It does, however, \nby deregulating the industry with appropriate safeguards, set the \nstages for a new era in the United States.\n  I want to call the attention of the Senate to a provision that is \nvery meaningful to my area, the universal service provision. This is a \nconcept that, through the existing interstate rate pool, has brought \ntelephone service to all parts of this Nation, including remote \nvillages in Alaska and throughout the Nation wherever you are.\n  The concept is preserved in this bill in a new manner. It opens up \nthe local market to competition while still preserving the concept of \nuniversal service. It does so by taking advantage of new technologies \nwhich are intended to reduce the cost of all services, including \nuniversal service.\n  In fact, I find it interesting that the Congressional Budget Office \nhas said that this bill will reduce the cost of universal service from \nthe existing system by at least $3 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Now, tumbling technology, as I call it, makes terrestrial distances \nirrelevant. By using modern technologies, the people in Egiagik and \nUnalakleet and Shishmaref, places many people have never heard of, can \nbe involved in stock markets in New York, explore the Library of \nCongress, and be connected with overseas sources of information. \nAllowing cable companies to provide phones and phone companies to \nprovide cable, this bill will spur competition and reduce costs to the \nNation.\n  There are so many new technologies coming along, Mr. President, it is \nmind-boggling. There are many provisions in this bill that are aimed at \nderegulating the industry so those new technologies may compete.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will recognize this bill for what it \nis. It is a credit, as the distinguished leader has said, to Senator \nPressler, the chairman of our committee, and to Senator Hollings, the \nformer chairman of our committee. It is a bill of monstrous scope that \nhas substantial bipartisan support.\n  Had we had a similar approach to the problems of health care reform \nin the last Congress, we would have had that problem at least partially \nsolved.\n  To the credit of these two Senators, this is not a bill that attempts \nto solve all of the problems of the telecommunications industry for the \nfuture. It is a bill that opens the door to the future and, in my \njudgment, it is one that it is absolutely essential be passed.\n  I am told that George Gilder of the Discovery Institute in Seattle, \nwhom I consider to be one of the real thinkers of this country, has \ntold us that not passing this bill will cost the United States $2 \ntrillion in lost opportunities in the next 5 years alone.\n  I happen to pay attention to Mr. Gilder because he wrote an article \nthe \n[[Page S7901]] other day which answered some remarks that I made about \nuniversal service. I do feel in the days ahead the thinking that this \nman is doing will have a great deal to do with guiding the Nation into \nthat ultimate system that I foresee coming on after the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Just in terms of the broad band radio concept that is coming along \nand how it will replace substantial portions of telecommunications now \ncarried by wire or fiber optic cable or through satellites, that \nconcept alone is going to catch us by surprise if we do not know what \nis happening. But at least we know it will happen. We are not trying to \nregulate that by this bill. We are not trying to prevent it by this \nbill. We are opening the door so new competitive aspects will come into \nour communications policy in the United States.\n  This morning I introduced a bill that I said I would offer as an \namendment to this bill if the opportunity presented itself. I have \ndiscussed it now with the two managers of the bill. I would like to \noffer now an amendment.\n  First let me describe what it is. It is an amendment that will expand \nthe FCC's authority to use auctions to assign licenses for the use of \nradio spectrum. The members of our committee will know that for two \nCongresses I argued that we should implement auctions to replace the \nold lottery system that was giving windfall profits to many and denying \nothers access to opportunities that would start new businesses.\n  Under the old system, the lotteries, there was no commitment to use \nthis spectrum but it was held as sort of an item that other people \nmight bid on when they were willing to pay enough money to the person \nwho was lucky enough to win the lottery. The person who got the license \nhad no intent to use it. Now, with a bidding process, competitive \nbidding, we have brought the use of the spectrum to the point where \npeople who want it pay what is necessary to get its use.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, as I said before, has estimated that \nthe amendment I offer will raise $4.5 billion in the next 5 years. That \nis necessary for a strange reason. The Congressional Budget Office also \nestimated that the universal service provisions in this bill will \nrequire private industry and private purchasers to pay $7.1 billion \nover the next 5 years into this system, which was the interstate rate \npool and now will become the fund for the payment of the universal \nservice provisions of this bill.\n  I remind the Senate that the universal service system contained in \nthis bill would result in a reduction of $3 billion from what \ncontinuation of the existing system will cost in the next 5 years. But \nnotwithstanding that this bill will reduce the costs of the existing \nsystem we know, in order to avoid a Budget Act point of order on \ntechnical grounds, must offset the finding of the Congressional Budget \nOffice that this requirement of the private sector to pay $7.1 billion \ninto the pool--less than before but they still must pay it in--that \nthis private payment must be offset under our congressional budget \nprocess.\n  That sort of boggles my mind too, Mr. President, but it is a \nrequirement and I respect the Budget Act concept. Therefore I offer \nthis amendment. It will extend the auction authority until the year \n2000. That is all that is necessary to comply with the Budget Act, 5 \nyears. It will bring in a minimum estimate, as I said, of $4.5 billion.\n  We have already received, under the auction amendment that I offered \n2 years ago, almost $10 billion. It was new money, the kind of money \nthat was never received by the Government before.\n  Under my amendment tonight, the FCC would have the authority to use \nspectrum auctions for all mutually exclusive applications for initial \nlicenses or construction permits except for licenses for public safety \nradio services or for advanced television services, if the advanced \ntelevision licenses are given to existing broadcast licensees as a \nreplacement for their existing broadcast licenses.\n  This means that market mechanisms will help determine who can make \nthe most efficient use of spectrum that will become available. I \nbelieve, again, that is the best way to deal with the future.\n  My amendment does not change the basic safeguards Congress put in the \noriginal spectrum auction legislation after I offered it several years \nago. The expanded authority will apply only to new license \napplications. It will not apply to renewals. And the FCC may still not \nconsider potential revenue in making the decision as to which type of \nservice new spectrum should be used for. The revenue only becomes a \nfactor in determining who gets the license to use the spectrum for any \nparticular purpose.\n  The bill I introduced this morning, which is the same as this \namendment, would also provide authority for Federal agencies to accept \nreimbursement from private parties for the cost of relocating to a new \nfrequency. This will allow private industry to pay to move Government \nusers off valuable frequencies by relocating the Government station to \na less valuable frequency at no cost to the taxpayer, but an increase \nto the Treasury.\n  The amendment builds on what has been a very successful beginning. \nSince the existing spectrum auction authority was enacted in 1993, as I \nhave said, the FCC has raised in excess of $9 billion, almost $10 \nbillion now, for the Federal Treasury in just four auctions.\n  I do hope the Senate will support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dole's amendment be set aside \nfor the time being and I be allowed to submit the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Senator Dole's amendment has \nbeen set aside. The Senator does have a right to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. But I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator sending his amendment to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Did the Senator object to my request to set aside \nSenator Dole's amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Dole's amendment has been set aside. \nThere is no need for a unanimous-consent request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1256\n\n    (Purpose: To extend the authority of the Federal Communications \n    Commission to use auctions for the allocation of radio spectrum \n     frequencies for commercial use, to provide for private sector \nreimbursement of Federal governmental user costs to vacate commercially \n               valuable spectrum, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1256.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration of the Department of Commerce recently \n     submitted to the Congress a report entitled ``U.S. National \n     Spectrum Requirements'' as required by section 113 of the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923);\n       (2) based on the best available information the report \n     concludes that an additional 179 megahertz of spectrum will \n     be needed within the next ten years to meet the expected \n     demand for land mobile and mobile satellite radio services \n     such as cellular telephone service, paging services, personal \n     communication services, and low earth orbiting satellite \n     communications systems;\n       (3) a further 85 megahertz of additional spectrum, for a \n     total of 264 megahertz, is needed if the United States is to \n     fully implement the Intelligent Transportation System \n     currently under development by the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (4) as required by Part B of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 921 et seq.) the Federal \n     Government will transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum from \n     exclusive government use to non-governmental or mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use between 1994 and 2004;\n       (5) the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report submitted to \n     Congress under section 113 of the National Telecommunications \n     and Information Administration Organization Act by the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     states that, of the 235 megahertz of spectrum identified for \n     reallocation from governmental to non-governmental or mixed \n     use-- [[Page S7902]] \n       (A) 50 megahertz has already been reallocated for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (B) 45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use,\n       (C) 25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (D) 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use, and\n       (E) the final 45 megahertz will be reallocated for mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use by 2004;\n       (6) the 165 megahertz of spectrum that are not yet \n     reallocated, combined with 80 megahertz that the Federal \n     Communications Commission is currently holding in reserve for \n     emerging technologies, are less than the best estimates of \n     projected spectrum needs in the United States;\n       (7) the authority of the Federal Communications Commission \n     to assign radio spectrum frequencies using an auction process \n     expires on September 30, 1998;\n       (8) a significant portion of the reallocated spectrum will \n     not yet be assigned to non-governmental users before that \n     authority expires;\n       (9) the transfer of Federal governmental users from certain \n     valuable radio frequencies to other reserved frequencies \n     could be expedited if Federal governmental users are \n     permitted to accept reimbursement for relocation costs from \n     non-governmental users; and\n       (10) non-governmental reimbursement of Federal governmental \n     users relocation costs would allow the market to determine \n     the most efficient use of the available spectrum.\n       (b) Extension and Expansion of Auction Authority.--Section \n     309(j) (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``(1) General authority.--If mutually exclusive \n     applications or requests are accepted for any initial license \n     or construction permit which will involve a use of the \n     electromagnetic spectrum, then the Commission shall grant \n     such license or permit to a qualified applicant through a \n     system of competitive bidding that meets the requirements of \n     this subsection. The competitive bidding authority granted by \n     this subsection shall not apply to licenses or construction \n     permits issued by the Commission for public safety radio \n     services or for licenses or construction permits for new \n     terrestrial digital television services assigned by the \n     Commission to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to \n     replace their current television licenses.'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2) and renumbering paragraphs \n     (3) through (13) as (2) through (12), respectively; and\n       (3) by striking ``1998'' in paragraph (10), as renumbered, \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``2000''.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Federal Relocation Costs.--Section 113 \n     of the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration Act (47 U.S.C. 923) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(f) Relocation of Federal Government Stations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In order to expedite the efficient use \n     of the electromagnetic spectrum and notwithstanding section \n     3302(b) of title 31, United States Code, any Federal entity \n     which operates a Federal Government station may accept \n     reimbursement from any person for the costs incurred by such \n     Federal entity for any modification, replacement, or \n     reissuance of equipment, facilities, operating manuals, \n     regulations, or other expenses incurred by that entity in \n     relocating the operations of its Federal Government station \n     or stations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to \n     any other frequency or frequencies. Any such reimbursement \n     shall be deposited in the account of such Federal entity in \n     the Treasury of the United States. Funds deposited according \n     to this section shall be available, without appropriation or \n     fiscal year limitation, only for the operations of the \n     Federal entity for which such funds were deposited under this \n     section.\n       ``(2) Process for relocation.--Any person seeking to \n     relocate a Federal Government station that has been assigned \n     a frequency within a band allocated for mixed Federal and \n     non-Federal use may submit a petition for such relocation to \n     NTIA. The NTIA shall limit the Federal Government station's \n     operating license to secondary status when the following \n     requirements are met--\n       ``(A) the person seeking relocation of the Federal \n     Government station has guaranteed reimbursement through money \n     or in-kind payment of all relocation costs incurred by the \n     Federal entity, including all engineering, equipment, site \n     acquisition and construction, and regulatory fee costs;\n       ``(B) the person seeking relocation completes all \n     activities necessary for implementing the relocation, \n     including construction of replacement facilities (if \n     necessary and appropriate) and identifying and obtaining on \n     the Federal entity's behalf new frequencies for use by the \n     relocated Federal Government station (where such station is \n     not relocating to spectrum reserved exclusively for Federal \n     use); and\n       ``(C) any necessary replacement facilities, equipment \n     modifications, or other changes have been implemented and \n     tested to ensure that the Federal Government station is able \n     to successfully accomplish its purposes.\n       ``(3) Right to reclaim.--If within one year after the \n     relocation the Federal Government station demonstrates to the \n     Commission that the new facilities or spectrum are not \n     comparable to the facilities or spectrum from which the \n     Federal Government station was relocated, the person seeking \n     such relocation must take reasonable steps to remedy any \n     defects or reimburse the Federal entity for the costs of \n     returning the Federal Government station to the spectrum from \n     which such station was relocated.\n       ``(g) Federal Action to Expedite Spectrum Transfer.--Any \n     Federal Government station which operates on electromagnetic \n     spectrum that has been identified for reallocation for mixed \n     Federal and non-Federal use in the Spectrum Reallocation \n     Final Report shall, to the maximum extent practicable through \n     the use of the authority granted under subsection (f) and any \n     other applicable provision of law, take action to relocate \n     its spectrum use to other frequencies that are reserved for \n     Federal use or to consolidate its spectrum use with other \n     Federal Government stations in a manner that maximizes the \n     spectrum available for non-Federal use. Notwithstanding the \n     timetable contained in the Spectrum Reallocation Final \n     Report, the President shall seek to implement the \n     reallocation of the 1710 to 1755 megahertz frequency band by \n     January 1, 2000.

Mr. President, I understand the Senator from South \nDakota, the distinguished chairman, wishes to offer an amendment to \nthis. I understand that suggestion came in after we originally drafted \nthe amendment I have offered.\n  I yield to him at this time if he wants to offer an amendment to my \namendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1257 to Amendment No. 1256\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for broadcast auxiliary spectrum relocation)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Alaska to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1257 to Amendment No. 1256.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert \n     the following:\n       (e) Boardcast Auxiliary Spectrum Relocation.--\n       (1) Allocation of spectrum for broadcast auxiliary uses.--\n     Within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Commission shall allocate the 4635-4685 megahertz band \n     transferred to the Commission under section 113(b) of the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(b)) for broadcast auxiliary \n     uses.\n       (2) Mandatory relocation of broadcast auxiliary uses.--\n     Within 7 years after the date of enactment of this Act, all \n     licensees of broadcast auxiliary spectrum in the 2025-2075 \n     megahertz band shall relocate into spectrum allocated by the \n     Commission under paragraph (1). The Commission shall assign \n     and grant licenses for use of the spectrum allocated under \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (A) in a manner sufficient to permit timely completion of \n     relocation; and\n       (B) without using a competitive bidding process.\n       (3) Assigning recovered spectrum.--Within 5 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall allocate \n     the spectrum recovered in the 2025-2075 megahertz band under \n     paragraph (2) for use by new licensees for commercial mobile \n     services or [[Page S7903]] other similar services after the \n     relocation of broadcast auxiliary licensees, and shall assign \n     such licenses by competitive bidding.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this second-degree amendment would add a \nnew subsection to the underlying amendment. The new subsection would \ndirect the FCC to allocate a 50 megahertz block of spectrum in the 4 \ngigahertz band for use by broadcast auxiliary services within 1 year of \nthe enactment of the bill. In addition, this amendment would require \nthat all broadcast auxiliary service licensees currently using a 50 \nmegahertz block of spectrum in the 2 gigahertz band relocate their \nactivities to the 4 gigahertz band within 7 years of the date this bill \nis enacted.\n  Finally, this amendment requires the FCC to auction the vacated \nspectrum in the 2 gigahertz band for use by commercial mobile services \nlike cellular PCS within 5 years of the date of enactment.\n  By moving broadcast auxiliary service licensees, who do not pay the \nspectrum they are using, to another less valuable frequency, we will \nmake available some very valuable spectrum for auction.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the auction of the 50 \nmegahertz block of 2 gigahertz spectrum will bring at least $3.8 \nbillion to the Federal Treasury.\n  Combined with the underlying amendment by the Senator from Alaska, \nthis would raise more than $7.1 billion that is needed to offset the \nuniversal services provisions of this bill.\n  As the Senator from Alaska last pointed out--I commend him--this is a \ntechnical budget problem. The universal service provisions in this bill \nactually saves $3 billion over what would be paid if the existing \nsystem is left unchanged. However, with these amendments we meet the \nletter of the Budget Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of my amendment and the \nunderlying amendment by the Senator from Alaska.\n  If it is appropriate, I would urge the adoption----\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we could go into a quorum call or yield \nto our colleague from Montana who has been waiting to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I do not wish to speak on this amendment. Might I ask a \npoint of order? Could it be set aside, and I proceed with my opening \nstatement because no time was given for opening statements?\n  Mr. President, I will continue on as if speaking on this amendment.\n  This is sort of a special day to me because the former chairman of \nthe full committee, Senator Inouye, and I, when I first came here 6 \nyears ago, had quite a time as we started I think to react to some of \nthe things happening in the industry. We thought probably we were ahead \nof the curve in setting some kind of policy that would reflect the \nfuture. We thought we were ahead of the curve. Now we are behind the \ncurve because technology as it is being developed in this area is far \noutpacing the regulatory environment in which it finds itself.\n  I can remember that day when we started to make amendments and the \nformer chairman was very gracious that day. There were some people \naround, and I was just a freshman Senator offering some ideas that I \nthought were important in the telecommunications industry, \nunderstanding that there have been three inventions which have happened \nin my lifetime that have changed this world forever. It has changed it \nso that we cannot go back and do things the old way anymore. Those \nthree inventions were the transistor, the silicon chip and the jet \nengine. Think what they have done to our life and our world. We can be \nanywhere else in the world, from Washington, DC, in 12 hours. We can \ntalk and receive and interact both in video and in voice with anybody \nanywhere else in the world in 5 seconds. Sadly, we can destroy any \nother society on this Earth within 20 minutes. That is what these three \ninventions have done. They have tightened down our world where \ncomparatively speaking it has been the size of this building in which \nwe stand down to the size of a basketball. Now we are in a global \nsociety, a global economy, and we just cannot go back.\n  We will amend the Communications Act of 1934. That is some 60 years \nago before any of these inventions were made. So basically what we are \ndoing is we are driving digital, compressed digital, vehicles now \nwithin a law that regulates a horse-and-buggy type of situation. So we \nare here and starting out this great debate on changing an issue that \nwill affect each and every one of us.\n  Make no mistake about it. This is a very, very important piece of \nlegislation. I want to give kudos to our chairman and ranking member \nand their staffs because they have spent many hours in developing this \nbill with strong bipartisan support.\n  This bill was not drafted to satisfy business plans of major \ncommunications providers. It was drafted to benefit communications \nusers, and communications users are solidly behind this bill for a \nnumber of reasons. Number one, they think it will bring down rates. So \ndo I. They know it will bring advanced services. So do I. Perhaps more \nimportantly, they know it will bring them more choices in \ntelecommunications.\n  I recently saw a survey that illustrates why one important group--\nsmall American business owners--want and need communications reform. In \nMontana, over 98 percent of all businesses are classified as small \nbusinesses. The survey of 4,600 small business owners, which was \nsponsored by the National Federation of Independent Business, found \nthat almost two-thirds of the small business owners surveyed want to be \nable to get long-distance telephone service from their local telephone \ncompany; and, 54 percent want to be able to choose local service from \ntheir long-distance company.\n  A full 86 percent of these small business owners want one-stop \nshopping for telecommunications services. Two-thirds of them want to be \nable to choose one provider that can give them both local and long-\ndistance telephone service presented in either way.\n  Of course, lower rates are very important to business owners. We all \nlook for a way to do things more economically, to make our business \nmore profitable, to open more economic opportunities and job \nopportunities for those folks who live in our local neighborhoods. But \nbreaking down outdated barriers to competition that are preventing some \nlocal telephone companies from providing long-distance service and \nlong-distance companies from providing local service will also bring \nsomething else that small businesses want--that is called convenience. \nSmall businesses do not have the time nor the resources to juggle \nseparate vendors with separate marketing arrangements and separate \nbilling for long-distance and local services, cable TV teleconferencing \nand, yes, even internet. They want to be able to choose one reliable \nand affordable company that can bring them all of these services; and \nwhen they have the telecommunications problem they want to be able to \nget on the phone and call one company that is qualified to handle every \naspect of their communications needs and their networks.\n  At first, deregulation will create competition by allowing companies \nto cross over and compete in new business areas. If we do this right, \nhowever, very soon the gray lines that now separate telecommunications \nbusinesses will be gone. There will be seamless networks of vertically \nintegrated communications providers competing head to head, tooth and \nnail to win the consumers' communications dollar. Those dollars are \nvery big dollars. As a result, small businesses will be able to choose \none company that can provide all their communications services--or they \nwill be able to continue buying their telecommunications services \npiecemeal from multiple providers if they so choose. Either way, their \ndecision will be based on who has the most affordable and most advanced \nservices.\n  A full 92 percent of the small businesses owners questioned in this \nsmall business survey said that the telephone is central to their \nbusiness. I do not doubt this. I know plenty of small businesses \nthroughout my home state of Montana that rely heavily on the telephone \nto keep their business--mom and pop catalog shops that sell Montana \nbuckskin jackets to the rest of the country or small cattle ranches \nthat [[Page S7904]] use cable TV and telecommunications to get future \nprices and negotiate with the slaughterhouses. And I do not know many \nsmall businesses today that function well without a personal computer \nand a fax machine.\n  How many people looked at a fax machine 10 years ago and said, ``Who \nin the world would ever want to use one of those things?'' I will bet \nyou cannot walk into an office and many homes that do not have a fax \nmachine today.\n  Technology is truly a thrilling thing as it propels us towards the \nnext century. This bill will give small business that one-stop shopping \nthat they want.\n  So we have a chance to bury outdated restrictions that were created \nfor another era more than 60 years ago, restrictions that draw \narbitrary lines between telecommunications providers that just do not \nmake sense anymore. A lot of these anticompetitive, bureaucratic rules \nare only good to preserve market share for established providers. But \nprotecting markets and maintaining the status quo is not going to help \nbring lower rates and advanced services to small businesses and \nconsumers in Montana or anywhere else.\n  I fought very hard to ensure that small business participated in the \ninformation age. Whether it is small newspapers, small cable operators \nwe have in Montana, or the small business of radio, these businesses \nare the backbone of communications in Montana.\n  I have sought to include nondiscrimination safeguards for small \nnewspapers so that small information providers, especially in rural \nareas, will be able to purchase certain elements of a common carrier \nservice offering on the smallest per unit basis that is technically \nfeasible.\n  In addition, small cable operators, when freed from regulatory \nrestraints in past legislation, will provide perhaps our best \nopportunity for telecommunications services in many of our Nation's \nrural areas.\n  They all the time talk about the information highway, that glass \nhighway. Everybody says: When are you going to build it? I am not real \nsure that it is not already there.\n  It is already there. All we have to do is take off some restrictions \nso that it can be used. And there is a ramp on it and there is a ramp \noff of it. That is what we have to make sure of in this legislation.\n  Finally, I had deep concerns that one of the Nation's most important \ntelecommunications small business industries, radio--I am familiar with \nradio--was being passed over in the effort to deregulate information \nproviders. Radio ownership decisions need to be made by operators and \ninvestors, not the Federal Government. That is why we need to eliminate \nthe remaining caps on national and local radio ownership.\n  Nationally, there are more than 11,000 radio stations providing \nservice to every city, town, and rural community in the United States. \nPresently, no one can control more than 40 stations, 20 AM and 20 FM \nstations. Clearly, the radio market is so incredibly vast and diverse \nthat there will be no possibility that any one entity could control \nenough stations to be able to exert any market power over either \nadvertisers or radio programmers.\n  At the local level, while the Federal Communications Commission \nseveral years ago modified its duopoly rules to permit limited \ncombinations of stations in the same service, in the same market, there \nare still stringent limits on the ability of radio operators to grow in \ntheir markets. Further, FCC rules permit only very restricted or no \ncombinations in smaller markets. These restrictions handcuff \nbroadcasters and prevent them from providing the best possible service \nto listeners in all of our States.\n  So, Mr. President, this will be landmark legislation. It is \nlegislation that we worked on ever since the first day we stepped into \nthe Senate, because I happen to believe it is key to distance learning; \nit is the key to telemedicine; it is key to the future of those States \nthat are remote and must be in contact with the rest of the world.\n  I appreciate the work of my good friend, the Senator from Alaska, and \nhow he fights very hard because no one has cities and towns and \nvillages that are more remote from the rest of the world than he has. \nAnd he understands that. Nobody understands that in this body more than \nhe does. Now, we have some vastness in Montana but it does not compare \nin any way with the State of Alaska.\n  So as we move this debate forward, I hope that we will keep an open \nmind and really keep our eye on the ball because we have within our \ngrasp the ability now to turn loose a giant in our economic world and \nprovide services to people who have never had those services before.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand momentarily my \ndistinguished colleague from Nebraska wants to be heard on the \namendment.\n  I would be prepared, at the conclusion of his remarks, to urge \nadoption of the Pressler amendment to the Stevens amendment and \nthereupon urge adoption of the Stevens amendment itself.\n  The Senator from Montana, who is a professional auctioneer, should \nunderstand that the daddy rabbit of auctioneering is the Senator from \nAlaska. He has already made $7 billion for us, and this amendment here \nis going to make up another $7 billion to get us by a budget point of \norder.\n  But let me, in saying that, acknowledge the hard work and leadership \nthat the Senator from Montana has given. Since his very initiation on \nthe Commerce Committee itself, he has been a leader; he has been \ninterested; he has been contributing; and he has been a tremendous help \nin bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator for those \nkind words. And if I can possibly get the job of auctioneering the \nspectrum, I probably would vacate this chair which I am standing in \nfront of.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am going to lead on that one myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have reviewed the amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska is offering, and as I understand it, \nwhat it does is it offsets an adverse score that this bill has received \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. CBO has said this bill, in \nparticular the universal service fund, is going to cost $7 billion over \nthe next 5 years. Even though that is $3 billion less than what the \ncurrent universal service fund does, there is the need to come up with \n$7 billion to avoid a budget point of order.\n  Now, I point out that under the budget resolution that was passed, \nwhen was that, 1\\1/2\\ weeks, 2 weeks ago, I believe that the Commerce \nCommittee is going to be looking at having to reconcile $20 billion, \n$30 billion anyway, so you are going to have your hands full. The \ncommittee will be trying to come up with money to try to get within the \nrecommendations of that budget resolution.\n  What this amendment does, it comes up with that $7.1 billion in the \nfollowing fashion. It extends the spectrum actions that are scheduled \nto expire in 1998 for another 2 years, generating $4.5 billion \naccording to CBO, and then it does something that is of particular \ninterest, I believe, Mr. President--and many people would ordinarily \noppose this but they are not--and that is the broadcasters have today \nassigned a 2-gigahertz spectrum in order to do auxiliary services. When \nthey are going out in the field and they are doing some broadcasting \nout in the field, they use that 2-gigahertz spectrum.\n  This amendment would transfer that over a 7-year period from 2 \ngigahertz to 4 gigahertz, and then that 2-gigahertz spectrum would be \nauctioned off, generating an estimated $3.8 billion over the 5-year \nperiod.\n  Under normal circumstances, the National Association of Broadcasters \nwould probably oppose this, but there are other things in this bill \nthat they like, so they are not going to oppose it. I believe that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska has made a good amendment that will \nin fact cover the $7.1 billion. And so, therefore, Mr. President, I \nwill not object to this being accepted by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Nebraska has demonstrated how he is a \n[[Page S7905]] quick study. He is right. I would add one thing. I think \nthe National Association of Broadcasters are going to want some \nadditional spectrum beyond what is in this bill. We will work that out. \nBut this has been scored, and we will work that out with them as we go \nforward to make sure that we understand the problem.\n  The simple problem is that this bill could not go forward unless we \nwithin its terms meet the scoring problem that the Senator from \nNebraska has outlined.\n  Again, I point out we are not, however, by this bill spending money \nfor universal service. But the budget process now makes us account for \nthose moneys we must be paid by the private sector pursuant to a \nmandate, and since we are continuing a mandate, partially reducing it \nsomewhat for universal service, it will cost less than the old \nuniversal service, we now must offset it.\n  I think it is responsible on the part of the Government to do that \nbecause there is always the possibility some future Congress might \ndecide not to mandate that service but require the Government to pay \nit.\n  So we have, in effect, met the challenge of the Budget Act and, in \ndoing so, we will actually, within this period, raise the additional \nmoneys which I believe will be utilized in offsetting other budget \nproblems as we go along. I do not believe that will be required by any \naction of the Congress in the future to charge the cost of universal \nservice to the taxpayers.\n  Again, in my judgment, universal service is required so someone who \ncomes up to my State who wants to call home literally can do it, or \nwants to bring up a computer and be attached to data services can make \nthat intersection with the telecommunications system of our country.\n  I believe sincerely in universal services because without the \nuniversal services, the villages and towns of our rural areas would be \nstill in probably the early part of the 20th if not the 19th century \nwhile we all go into the 21st. If they are not to be left in the \nposition where they are without employment because they cannot attach \nthemselves to this new telecommunications miracle of the United States, \nthen I think they will be a burden on the rest of the country.\n  My friend George Gilder believes that in the future, the computer \nwill replace, in effect, the networks because the networks will become, \nin effect, a gigantic computer network rather than just a television \nnetwork. He tells us that what is going to happen is that we are going \nto have access through the computer industry to interconnect America's \nschools and colleges in truly a new worldwide web of glass and air.\n  If people want to think about it, there is no way we can afford to \nhave this bill stopped by a budget point of order. That is the reason \nfor our amendments. I join in urging adoption of these amendments.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. First, adoption of the Pressler amendment. If there is \nno further debate, I urge the adoption of the Pressler amendment.\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 1257 as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question \noccurs on agreeing to the second-degree amendment No. 1257 offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler.\n  The amendment (No. 1257) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I urge adoption of the Stevens amendment, as amended by \nthe Pressler amendment.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1256\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the Stevens \namendment No. 1256, as amended, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1256), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the managers of the bill \nand those patient with us. I thought it was essential first to proceed \nwith these amendments. Otherwise, we would be wasting our time if a \nbudget point of order had the effect of pulling the bill down. I thank \nall concerned.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire what the parliamentary situation \nis? Are we back now to making opening statements at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Opening statements are appropriate at this \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to rise in support of this \nlegislation and make an opening statement. I would like to begin, as \nothers have already done, by congratulating and commending the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota for the hard work that he has \nput into this legislation. Of course, many members of the committee \nhave been working on this legislation for several months. As the \ndistinguished former chairman said earlier, way back in 1993 there was \na lot of work going on on legislation that led to this moment.\n  But I know from personal experience and observation that the chairman \nof the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Senator \nPressler, said immediately after the election in 1994 that this is an \nissue that is going to be given high priority, a great deal of his \nattention and we were going to work together to find solutions to the \nproblems that had prevented its consideration last year and earlier. He \nmade a commitment also to make it a bipartisan effort. So that is why \nwe are here, because the chairman of the committee gave this such high \npriority and he has worked diligently to resolve problems that had been \ndelaying this legislation.\n  I just want to acknowledge that fact at the very beginning of this \ndebate. We have a long way to go, but I know now we have started down \nthe path toward passing this legislation. I think it is a tremendous \nundertaking.\n  This is big legislation. It is important legislation. It involves a \nsignificant part of the overall economy in this country. It is going to \ncreate jobs. It is going to raise revenue because it is going to be \nsuch a dynamic explosive field. We are fixing to unleash the bounds \nthat have been holding back this competition and advancements and this \ndevelopment. I think that no other segment of the economy in the next \n10 years will be more dynamic and more exciting than that of \ntelecommunications.\n  I also want to commend the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nwho is working at this very moment to resolve potential problems on \nthis legislation, but Senator Hollings worked so hard last year to \nbring about the passage of the bill through the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee. It did not come to consideration, partially \nbecause we just ran out of time.\n  But Senator Hollings again this year has shown a commitment to get \nlegislation developed that we can pass. He is the major reason we are \ngoing to have bipartisan legislation. We should have more legislation \nlike this in the Senate. This is really the first bill of the year of \nmajor import that I believe will pass by an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote. So many of our issues have been considered in a partisan way, \nhave been delayed with amendments. We have had filibusters; 50 \namendments on the budget resolution. But in this case, we will have a \nchance to develop a bill that can be bipartisan and also a bill that \nwill pass this body first instead of the other body of Congress. That \nis no insignificant accomplishment.\n  Senator Inouye certainly has also been very interested in \ntelecommunications. He worked on it last year and has been helpful this \nyear.\n  The indomitable Senator Stevens from Alaska is always there. When the \ndebate gets hot and heavy, Senator Stevens from Alaska will always rise \nto the occasion, as he has on this bill.\n  I have one other recognition before I get into my comments. I want to \nrecognize the staff members who have done great work, hard work. It has \nbeen laborious, tedious, and they have solved so many problems through \nthe great efforts of Paddy Link, and my own staff assistant Chip \nPickering, clearly one of the brightest young men I have known in my \nlife. We would not be here without their help.\n  Let me begin with a quote from testimony before the committee \nearlier. It begins with a quote from a Senator from Washington State, \nSenator Magnuson, who served with great distinction on the Commerce, \nScience, and [[Page S7906]] Transportation Committee. He put it very \naptly when he said in this particular area of legislation ``each \nindustry seeks a fair advantage over its rivals.''\n  And then quoting the witness that was before the committee:\n\n       Each industry wants prompt relief so that it can enter the \n     others' fields, but at the same time wants to avoid the pain \n     of new competition in its own field by tactics that will \n     delay that competition as long as possible. It is, therefore, \n     up to the Congress to make the tough calls and, in effect, \n     cut the Gordian knot.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do with this legislation, cut the \nGordian knot that has held this dynamic field of the economy back now \nfor several years.\n  As unbelievable as it sounds, the Communications Act of 1934 passed \nin the era of the Edsel, and it is still the current law of the land. \nThat act now governs, in fact, constrains the most dynamic sector of \nthe U.S. economy--telecommunications. Just as the Edsel became a symbol \nof all that is outdated, so is the 1934 Communications Act. That act is \nbased on old technology and, consequently, on an outdated, rigid-\nmonopoly-based-regulatory model. Boy, that sounds bad, but that is what \nwe have today. It is time we changed that.\n  That system cannot accommodate the rapidly developing capabilities of \nnew technologies and advanced networks. Instead, it acts to restrict \ncompetition, innovation, and investment.\n  Under that framework, markets are allocated, not won, by the sweat of \ncompetition. Currently monopolies, oligopolies or, at best, limited \ncompetition exist in local long distance and cable markets.\n More than 40 of our 50 States prohibit any entrepreneur or competitor \nfrom offering--even offering--local telephone service.\n\n  The 1984 consent decree which broke up AT continues to restrict the \nBell operating companies from offering long distance or manufacturing.\n  We should have fixed that long ago. It would have created jobs and \nwould have been positive for the economy.\n  Current law prohibits cable companies and telephone companies from \ncompeting in each other's markets. They are willing to do that. They \nwant to do that. Why should we not let them do that?\n  Another 1934 law, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, PUHCA, \nprevents registered electric utilities from using their infrastructure \nand networks to offer telecommunication services to the 49 million \nAmerican homes that they serve. All of these restrictions and \nregulations and allocations are truly the equivalent of an ``Edsel'' in \nthe space and information age. In the case of utilities, they are \nalready wired, hooked up. They have the capability to offer all kinds \nof services. Yet, they are told, no, you cannot do that. Why? There is \nno good explanation or justification for it--especially if we do this \nlegislation in a way that is fair, open, and allows competition for \nall.\n  In stark contrast, the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act of 1995--this bill--will move telecommunications into \nthe 21st century and will finally leave the era of the Edsel behind. S. \n652 will achieve this through full competition, open networks, and \nderegulation. That is what this bill is all about. That is what we say \nwe we want. Senators stand up and say it day in and day out, about all \nkinds of situations. Well, in this bill, in this area, that is what we \nwould do.\n  This bill provides a framework where entrepreneurs and free \nenterprise will make the information superhighway a reality, not just a \nconversation piece. As a result, tremendous benefits and applications \nwill flow to our economy, to education, and health care. Industries \nwill benefit from expanding markets and opportunities, and consumers \nwill benefit from lower prices in their local, long distance, \nmanufacturing, and cable services.\n  If one hears the protest of the various industries, it is not because \nthe bill is too regulatory; no, just the opposite is true. It is \nbecause this bill removes all of the protection and market allocations \nthat made their respective businesses safe and secure from the rigors \nof vigorous competition.\n  Under S. 652, all State and local barriers to local competition are \nremoved upon enactment. An immediate process for removing line of \nbusiness restrictions on the Bells is put in place. Moreover, the Bell \ncompanies are given the freedom to immediately compete out of region \nand provide a broad range of services and applications known as \nincidentals. These include lucrative markets in audio, video, cable, \ncellular, wireless, information services, and signaling.\n  The 1934 PUHCA is amended to allow registered electric utilities to \njoin with all other utilities in providing telecommunication services, \nproviding the consumer with smart homes, as well as smart highways.\n  Upon enactment, telephone and cable companies are allowed to compete. \nCurrent restrictions barring telephone cable entry are eliminated.\n  As the telephone/cable restriction is removed, S. 652, rightfully, \nloosens and removes cable regulation. For cable to convert and compete \nin the telephone area, it will be freed from the regulatory burdens \nthat limit investment and capital capability, which has been a problem \nin recent years for the cable industry.\n  The restrictions placed on broadcasters, also during a bygone era, \nbefore cable, wireless cable, and advanced networks, would be reformed.\n  Ownership restrictions on broadcast TV are raised. An amendment \nremoving restrictions on radio ownership will be adopted, and this is \none we have worked hard on, and we have broad support now for. The FCC \nis granted the authority to allow broadcasters to move toward advanced, \ndigital TV and to use excess spectrum, created by technological \nadvance, for broad commercial purposes. Broadcast license procedures \nare reformed and streamlined.\n  S. 652, again, moving in from the communications policy of the past, \ngoes from a protectionist policy to one appropriate for the global \neconomy and technology of the 21st century. The bill promotes \ninvestment and growth by opening U.S. telecommunications markets on a \nfair and reciprocal basis.\n  In short, S. 652 constructs a framework where everybody can compete \neverywhere in everything. It limits the role of Government and \nincreases the role of the market. It moves from the monopoly policies \nof the 1930s to the market policy of the future.\n  Toward that end, the removal of all barriers to and restrictions from \ncompetition is extremely important, and it is the primary objective, \nand I believe, the accomplishment of this legislation, thanks to the \nefforts of Chairman Pressler and the former chairman, Senator Hollings \nof South Carolina.\n  In addressing the local and long distance issues, creating an open \naccess and sound interconnection policy was the key objective, and it \nwas not easy to come up with a solution that we could get most people \nto be comfortable with. It is critical to recognize the reason why all \nof these barriers, restrictions, and regulations exist in the first \nplace--the so-called bottleneck. Opening the local network removes the \nbottleneck and ensures that all competitors will have equal and \nuniversal access to all consumers. Such access guarantees full and, I \nbelieve, fair competition.\n  The open access policy makes it possible for us to move to full, \nfree-market competition in local and long distance services, avoid \nantitrust dangers, and dismantle old regulatory framework.\n  In fact, the Heritage Foundation makes the following statement and \npoints to the open access interconnection policy:\n\n       Policymakers of a more conservative or free market \n     orientation should not fear this open access \n     policy. In fact, they should favor it for three \n     reasons:\n       First, there is a rich, common law history that supports \n     the open access philosophy.\n\n  They cite railroad and telegraph policy in America and common law \ntradition dating all the way back to the Roman Empire.\n\n       Second, open access works to eliminate any unfair \n     competitive advantages accrued by companies that have \n     benefited from Government-provided monopolies.\n       Third, open access removes the need for other regulations \n     because the market becomes more competitive if everyone is on \n     equal footing.\n\n  It is the only way to address economic deregulation where a \nbottleneck distribution system exists. It is the same policy which \nallows market forces, instead of regulation, to work in the case of \nlong distance, railroads, and in the oil and natural gas pipeline \ndistribution system. [[Page S7907]] \n  It is those examples of deregulation to which we should look, not to \nmodels of deregulation where no bottleneck exists, such as airline or \ntrucking.\n  Open networks will provide small and mid-sized competitors the \nopportunity to flourish alongside telecommunication giants. In the long \ndistance industry, similar requirements made it possible for over 400 \nsmall and medium-sized companies to develop and compete with AT over \nthe past 10 years.\n  One of the better examples of this is a former high school basketball \ncoach from a small town in Mississippi by the name of Bernie Ebbers. \nOpening requirements such as interconnection, equal access, and resale \nmade it possible for this entrepreneur to build a small long distance \ncompany into the fourth largest in the country--LDDS. It is incredible \nwhat has been accomplished by this smalltown man by giving him an \nopportunity to get in there and compete, and boy did he ever and is he \nhaving an impact.\n  Having used the example of a small long distance entrepreneur, it is \nalso important to point out what happened over the past 10 years to the \nformer monopolist, AT Although AT lost significant market share, \nit has seen the long distance market that it has greatly expand, and \nits revenues continue with strong, healthy growth.\n  AT's current revenues, with 60 percent share in the long distance \nmarket, as opposed to what was 100 percent, are now higher than in \n1984. The same dynamic will occur in the local and other markets. \nOpportunities and markets will expand for all participants, as long as \nthey are effective and efficient in the competitive environment.\n  It is this free market model which led me to conclude that all of the \ncompanies in my State and region and, in fact, in the country, will \nbenefit from this legislation. I believe that markets and opportunities \nwill expand for Bell South and LDDS, both of which are very important \nin my State of Mississippi, and other long distance companies, \nincluding electric utilities--Southern Company and Entergy in my part \nof the United States, and cable companies and broadcasters will have \nnew opportunities to grow and expand.\n  A competitive model will create a bigger pie for all the providers, \nbut more importantly, it is the consumers and the overall economy of my \nregion, and I believe the whole country, that will benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  For consumers and competitors, the open access requirements will do \nfor telecommunications what the Interstate Highway System has done for \nthe shipment of tangible goods and the movement of people and ensure \nthat all competitors will have a way to deliver goods and services to \nanyone anywhere on the information superhighway.\n  Other requirements, such as number of portability and dialing parity \nare just common sense, procompetitive, and fair. A consumer does not \nwant to have to dial more digits or access codes, and if required to do \nso, they will be less likely and probably not switch to the competitive \nprovider. History shows that dialing parity in long distance services \nand 1-800 service greatly enhanced competition--or the lack of dialing \nparity serves as an effective barrier to that competition.\n  Likewise, a small business or residential consumer will not switch to \nthe competitor if it meant the loss of his or her current number. They \nwill not do it. The disruption to a business or individual or family is \ntoo great. That is why we had to deal with this issue in this \nlegislation, although there was a lot of opposition to it.\n  Another key element of S. 652 is eliminating monopoly-based \nregulations and putting in place a mechanism to remove those \nregulations.\n  The bill eliminates rate-of-return regulation, a regulatory model \nwhich cannot logically exist in a competitive environment created by \nthis legislation. States are encouraged to move to more flexible and \ncompetitive models.\n  S. 652 requires the FCC to forbear or to eliminate any past or \ncurrent regulation requirement which would no longer make sense in this \nmarket base of competition. There will be a biannual regulatory review \nin this legislation that would recommend the elimination, modification, \nor other needed regulatory reform in the future.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I think it is time to adopt this \ncommunications policy for the future. It provides the right framework, \nit removes all barriers and restrictions to free market competition, \ninnovation, and increased investment.\n  With the passage of this legislation our economy will grow a lot \nfaster. We have had tremendous estimates of the kind of economic impact \nthis legislation will have in the billions of dollars. More jobs will \nbe created, applications in education and health care will expand more \nquickly, and the quality of life will improve in both rural and urban \nareas.\n  It is time to move beyond the culture of timidity where the companies \nand political leaders, regulators, and the courts resist needed reform, \nfear competition, and opt for the security and inferiority of the \nstatus quo.\n  We know that is what the election was about last year, change in the \nstatus quo. Boy, this bill will do that. It is time to trade in the \nEdsel and pass telecommunications legislation that will move us truly \ninto the future.\n  I do want to note that I think that the center that holds this \nlegislation together is the part that deals with the entry test. When \nthe local Bell companies get into long distance and they get into the \nlocal unbundled market, we have a delicate balance there.\n  Are they totally happy? No, they would like a fair advantage in each \ncase, but we have been able to cobble together this important balance, \nand I think it is one that we should support. I believe that we will be \nable to get this legislation through.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record information specifically citing the impact that this \nlegislation can have in my home State of Mississippi.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   What Does it Mean for Mississippi?\n\n       Mississippi is home to some of the Nation's new leaders in \n     every segment of telecommunications.\n       Mississippi is prospering and benefitting from the \n     contributions made by the largest and fastest growing \n     regional company, Bell South.\n       LDDS, a Jackson, MS company, is the fourth largest long \n     distance company in the Nation and an expanding international \n     force. It is a true American success story.\n       M-TEL, another Jackson based company, is a dynamic \n     entrepreneurial and leading national company in wireless \n     paging service.\n       A dynamic culture of young entrepreneurs in cellular \n     services is thriving throughout the State.\n       Parent companies to Mississippi Power and Mississippi Power \n     and Light, Entergy and Southern Company, are pioneer \n     companies promoting utility participation in \n     telecommunications and advanced networks. They will pave the \n     way for smart homes and highways in our State.\n       Cable companies of all sizes have deployed throughout \n     Mississippi into virtually every small town.\n       Wireless cable services have exploded in both rural and \n     urban areas of my State.\n       Mississippi, in cooperation with National Aeronautical and \n     Space Administration, our leading educational institutions \n     and South Central Bell, has deployed an advanced network \n     which connects schools, universities, Federal facilities, \n     super computers and national data bases. It is an educational \n     and high tech model for the future and the Nation.\n       It is in my home State of Mississippi that I have seen and \n     experienced the benefits of the communications revolution. I \n     know what it means to the economy and quality of life for my \n     State. It means the creation of high tech jobs, attracting \n     new industry, and promoting and connecting Mississippi to the \n     Nation's best educational opportunities.\n       As a Senator from a State which has become a leading \n     telecommunications center, I come to this debate with the \n     conviction that this legislation will serve Mississippi's, \n     the Nation's, consumers' and competitors' best interest.\n       S. 652 promotes and accelerates the communication \n     revolution by tearing down all barriers and restrictions \n     preventing the benefits of free market competition.\n       Mississippi's economy, with telecommunications serving as a \n     key catalyst, is growing and expanding. This legislation will \n     further fuel its growth.\n       Under S. 652, Mississippi companies will have new \n     opportunities and expanded markets as well as the challenges \n     of competition. South central Bell will be able to expand \n     into long distance, cable, manufacturing and other services.\n       LDDS, cable companies, Southern Company, Entergy, and \n     numerous other companies will be able, for the first time, to \n     begin competing for local service and combining local, long \n     distance and cable services.\n       With S. 652, Mississippi's TV and radio broadcasters will \n     see old restrictions removed or raised which have stifled \n     growth and new business. [[Page S7908]] \n       Small cable operators in Mississippi who have struggled \n     under the regulatory burden of the 1992 Cable Act, will see \n     regulatory relief. Once again, Mississippi cable operators \n     will be able to expand and deploy new services, regain \n     financial stability and prepare to compete in new markets.\n       The competition among all participants will spur \n     innovation, products, advanced networks and lower prices for \n     the benefit of Mississippi's consumers and industries.\n       I want Mississippi to continue as a national leader in \n     telecommunications. S. 652 will help achieve that objective.\n       For the Nation's future, S. 652 is one of the most \n     significant pieces of economic legislation we will consider.\n       The President's Council of Economic Advisors estimates the \n     telecommunications deregulation will create 1.4 million new \n     jobs by the year 2003.\n       A study by the WEFA group, funded by the Bell Companies, \n     projects 3.4 million jobs by the year 2005 and 0.5 percent \n     greater annual economic growth over the next 10 years.\n       In addition, the committee heard testimony that the \n     Pressler bill will lead to an additional $2 trillion in \n     economic activity.\n       The communications sector, more than any other, will shape \n     our future economy as well as our civic and community life. \n     This bill is the right policy to maximize the benefits this \n     sector of our economy can deliver.\n       I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is \n     time for Congress, not the courts or bureaucracies, to \n     establish the communications policy for the 21st century.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his terrific \ncontribution. Chip Pickering has been in every step of the way. This \nwould not be happening without your great leadership. I personally \nthank you very, very much.\n  Mr. President, I am sending to the desk a managers' amendment which I \nam cosponsoring with Senator Hollings. This amendment, which has been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle, makes a number of technical and \nminor changes in the bill that have been worked out since the bill was \nreported by the Commerce Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when adopted, the text be treated as \noriginal text for purposes of further amendment.\n  At this point I would like to send the managers' amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \ncommend the managers of the bill thus far. I know they are anxious to \nconclude a period of a lot of hard work and having struggled through \nmany discussions and agreements to get this behind.\n  The reason that I raise the possibility of an objection is because, \nin the process of developing the managers' amendment, it was determined \nthat a major research company based in New Jersey but doing work \nthroughout this country, a company that has offered many innovative \nideas in this period of new technology in communication, would be \nprohibited as a result of the present managers' statement from engaging \nin manufacture, even though it is the public declaration that they \nintend to be free of the regional Bell companies ownership. There they \nare, a company trying to engage in a competitive practice.\n  I had a discussion with two good friends, Senator Hollings on the \nDemocratic side and Senator Pressler on the Republican side, to see if \nthere was any way that we could defer action on this tonight so we \nmight discuss the competitive environment tomorrow morning.\n  Apparently, it is the belief of the managers that this bill has gone \nthrough so much labor and so many delicate steps that to further delay \nthat might be injurious to the success, ultimately, of passing this \nbill.\n  So while I will not object, I would ask the managers whether or not I \ncan have their support for a discussion of a proposal to enable the \ncompetitive character of the field to be expanded although it is \nlacking in the statement of the managers.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I want to commend my friend from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg. I know he is an experienced businessman, and I know there \nis some controversy about Bellcore. It is my belief that if Bellcore is \nsold and out there competing, it should be able to compete without \nrestriction.\n  That is based on the information I have at this moment. I know there \nis a great controversy about manufacturing, because about 99 percent of \nmanufacturing many new devises is research.\n  It seems to me that the Senator has raised a very good point. As I \nunderstand it, in the managers' amendment, we have taken this section \nout so we will be able to entertain a colloquy, or indeed an amendment.\n  I have begged several Senators to come tonight to offer amendments. \nWe have all these strong feelings and we would like to get a vote on \nsomething tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. As I gaze about, I do not see \nany amendments cropping forth. We welcome amendments.\n  I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey for raising this, because \nbased on the information I have, I tend to agree with what I think his \nposition is. I think he has raised a good point. If we could still \nadopt the managers' amendment, that is not, as I understand it, in \nthere. We have taken out anything that there is controversy about.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, first let me thank, as our chairman has \nvery dutifully done, the distinguished presiding officer, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Lott, for the 2 years that we worked on S. \n1822. The Senator has been an outstanding leader on S. 652 and his \nstaff Chip Pickering has done exceptional bipartisan work. We never \nwould have gotten this far, this balance that has been emphasized, had \nit not been for Senator Lott's leadership.\n I want to thank my distinguished colleague from New Jersey for his \nattitude and approach to this. What happens, I have two lists in my \nhands. The list of possible amendments in my left hand are those \namendments that are not agreed to, that we could not get consent on \nfrom the colleagues and the staffs on all sides. Objections have been \nheard. We had a list of those things that we thought were peripheral \nmatters like ``Replace subsidiary with affiliate where it appears,'' \nnumber 2, ``The FCC may modify the modified final judgment with decrees \nonce they are transferred to the FCC,'' and on down the list. These are \nthings that both sides have agreed to.\n\n  Unfortunately, other distinguished Members of the Senate, and \nparticularly on our committee of Commerce, have objected to the \nprovision dealing with Bellcore. As I understand it, as the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey points out--they are very \ncompetitive. Heavens knows, they produced the technology. If you had to \nmeasure in percentage of communications, I would say 90 percent of it \nhas been produced in the Senator from New Jersey's home State there at \nBellcore.\n  So I am disposed to help in any way I can the Senator from New \nJersey. It is not within my power to do so because I have, like I say, \nin my left hand those amendments that are not agreed to. And the \nBellcore amendment would have to be on that particular list.\n  They are not agreed to. There are at least three Senators on the \ncommittee who have so notified us. And if any Senator notified me right \nnow on any of the other items in the managers' amendment I would object \nfor them if they could not even be here. That would be my duty as a \nmanager of the bill, because every Senator has to be respected.\n  I have the highest respect for the Senator from New Jersey. I will do \neverything possible I can to help him with his amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With that statement, if the Senator will yield, Mr. \nPresident, I have no objection to going forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the several unanimous \nconsent requests are agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, is this just a unanimous \nconsent to read the amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have to read the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1258\n\n (Purpose: To make minor, technical, and other changes in the reported \n                                 bill)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler] for himself \n     and Mr. Hollings proposes an amendment numbered 1258.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n[[Page S7909]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, what are we \ndoing here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota just asked the \namendments be considered as read.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am asking unanimous consent to adopt the managers' \namendments, which I have sent to the desk, and which have been cleared \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is that cleared with the distinguished Senator?\n  Mr. KERREY. I have great respect for the Senators from South Carolina \nand South Dakota, but I have not read the amendment. It was just \nbrought to me. It is 40-some pages long and I understand there is lots \nin it. I cannot. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withhold the \nrequest for the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nebraska seeks recognition? The Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I know there is some confusion. I see my \nfriend from South Carolina and South Dakota as well. I have a great \ndeal of respect for them. I take a great deal of interest in this \nlegislation. They have been kind to allow a member of my staff to sit \nin on lots of the deliberation.\n  But I want my colleagues to understand there is a lot in this bill \nthat is not very well understood. I declare straight out I will not \nvote for this bill in its current form. I am here because I see great \npromise in telecommunications. I see great promise, in fact, in \nderegulating the telecommunications industry and using competition to \nregulate as opposed to having Government mandates and so forth do the \njob.\n  But in 1986 I signed a deregulation bill. I may be, for all I know, \nthe only Member of Congress who can come to the floor and say ``I \nsigned a deregulation bill for telecommunications.'' And I know that \nderegulation does not mean competition. You can have deregulation and \nhave no competition.\n  I call upon my colleagues who wonder about the impact of their votes. \nThere is a great deal of concern about, for example, the budget \nresolution we took up. ``Gee, what is this going to do to me? Is it \ngoing to be difficult to explain at home? There are lots of things in \nthere that might become unpopular and am I going to pay for voting yes \non the budget resolution?\"\n  We have lots of issues that are extremely controversial. This is a \nlot more controversial than meets the eye. I ask my colleagues who are \nconsidering voting yes for this and want to move it through quickly to \nrecall what life was like in 1984 when Mr. Baxter, from the Department \nof Justice, signed a consent decree divesting AT of the Bell \noperating companies, filing that decree with the Federal court here in \nWashington, DC.\n  I remember I was Governor of Nebraska at the time and I can tell you, \nyou could have selected a thousand people at random and asked them this \nquestion: Would you like Congress to put the Bell companies back \ntogether? Do you like what Baxter and Judge Greene did?\n  And of the thousand people I will bet 998 people would have said \n``Reverse it. Put it back together. We do not like the confusion that \nwe have. We do not like trying to figure out all this stuff.'' It was \nnot popular. Do not let anybody be misled by this. This is going to \ncreate considerable confusion in the early years. You are not likely to \nbe greeted by a round of applause by households, consumers, who have \nnot been consulted about this legislation.\n  This is not a Contract With America. Most of the things that we have \ntaken up in this Senate have been carefully polled and researched to \ndetermine whether or not they are popular. I have heard, whether it is \nthe balanced budget amendment or the budget resolution or term limits, \nall sorts of other things, people come down to the floor and say, ``In \nNovember the people of the United States of America spoke and here is \nwhat they meant.'' I have heard speaker after speaker say that. And in \nmany cases I agreed with them, because I ran in November of 1994.\n  But I did not have a single citizen, when I was out campaigning, come \nup to me and say: ``Boy, make sure when you go back, if you get \nreelected, if you go back and represent us, make sure you go back there \nand deregulate the phone companies. Make sure you go back there and \nderegulate the cable industry. Make sure. Bob, make sure, if you get \nback there, get rid of the ownership restrictions on television \nstations, on radio stations. Because that is what I want. I am really \nexcited about all this stuff. I really think there is a lot in this for \nme. That is what I want. That is the sort of thing I would like to have \nyou go back there and do.''\n  The American people have not been polled on this one. The \ndistinguished majority leader came down and said there is bipartisan \nsupport. It is not a Democratic issue. It is not a Republican issue. He \nis quite right. It is not. This is an issue that has been discussed at \nlength and I discussed it at length with many corporations that want to \nbe deregulated. They want to be deregulated. In many cases they are \nright.\n  But if you listen to the rhetoric, just this far, you would think \nthat the current regulation is holding back the telecommunications \nindustry to such an extent that we have lousy telephone service, that \nwe have noncompetitive industries. You would think America was somehow \nbackwards compared to all the rest of the world. That is not true.\n  If you look at the OECD examinations of our industries, \ntelecommunications, including the telephone companies, are among the \nmost competitive in the world and among the most productive in the \nworld.\n  It does not mean, because a company is regulated, that it is not \nproductive or that it is not competitive or that somehow it is going to \nproduce an unsatisfactory thing for the American people.\n  I am telling my colleagues a lot of people will come down here and \nsay, ``It must be good. There is a lot of bipartisan support for it.'' \nWalk up to the desk, check out a lot of these amendments, see which way \npeople are voting--this one is going to be remembered. This vote is a \nbig vote. In my State I have about a million households. If you talk \ntelecommunications to those households they do not talk faxes. They are \nnot thinking about enhanced digital processing and all that stuff. They \nare saying, ``What is my dial tone going to cost me? What is my cable \ngoing to cost me?'' That is what they talk about.\n  I think we need to come down to this floor and ask ourselves a \nquestion. What is this bill going to do for those households? What is \nit going to do for the consumer? I hear people say it is going to \ncreate lots of new jobs. In the course of this debate we are going to \ncome down and examine the question: Who has been creating the jobs?\n  (Mr. LOTT assumed the chair).\n  Mr. KERREY. Where are the jobs going? One of the things I hear from \npeople, an awful lot of telecommunications industry people working for \nthe telecommunications company, is substantial downsizing. I say, ``Do \nyou want to deregulate? Are you going do get more jobs?'' They say, ``I \ndo not know. You know. It has not been working too good thus far.''\n  I am down here to talk about what this is going to do for the many \nhouseholds, and for the American consumers. I look forward to the \ndebate. There is much in this legislation that I support. I believe in \nmany cases deregulation will produce a competitive environment that \nwill benefit the American consumer, and that will benefit the American \nhousehold. But let no one be mistaken. When we pass this piece of \nlegislation in the Senate and go to conference with the House, and get \nfinal passage in the early days, do not expect to have the people who \nvote for you say you were right. ``Boy, this thing has really worked.'' \nIt may take 9 or 10 years, which is what happened with divestiture. It \ntook us a good 10 years before people began to say, ``Wait a minute. \nThis is working. Competition is bringing the price down. The quality is \ngoing up. This appears to be in fact generating something beneficial to \nme.''\n  So I would like to get a little fundamental here. I very often, as I \nam sure the distinguished Presiding Officer does and other Members do, \nget [[Page S7910]] asked, ``What is it that you do? What do you in \nWashington, DC?'' Do I just come down to the floor and give speeches? \nDo I just answer my telephone and answer letters and do constituent \nservice for the people are having trouble with the IRS, the EPA, or \nvarious other agencies of the government? Yes. I try to explain to them \nI am involved with writing laws. That is what we do here. We write \nlaws; and that the laws matter. I am not a lawyer.\n  I very often wonder whether or not one of the most important things \nlawyers do is write the laws that are so darned confusing we have to \nhire them in order to tell us what is in them. But the longer I am on \nthe job, the longer I am on the job of being in politics and being a \npolitician, the law is becoming more important to me. I see that they \nare alive. They have an impact on people, and they make a difference.\n  This bill has about 144 pages in it. Every single word is important. \nEvery single phrase here is going to affect something. We all know it. \nWe have them coming into the office saying we are concerned about this \nparticular phrase, we are concerned about this particular paragraph. I \nhave heard it already referenced--some of the agreements have been \ndifficult to get. They have been difficult to get because every time \nyou do something somebody says, ``Gee. That is going to affect me in an \nadverse way.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska had an amendment earlier that \npaid for the cost of the universal service, and one of the things that \nhe did--I believe he is quite right--the National Association of \nBroadcasters is going to object. There are going to be people who say, \n``I do not like where you got the money.'' Everything we do in this \nlegislation we know affects one interest group or another. But it is \nalso going to affect more than almost anything we have discussed thus \nfar this year; Indeed, perhaps for a long, long time, every single \nAmerican household.\n  If you have a telephone in your home, it is going to affect you. If \nyou have a cable line running into your household, this bill is going \nto affect you.\n  I just said to citizens out there who are wondering about what the \nmumbo jumbo is about, you are going to hear a lot. You had better pay \nattention because, if you have a telephone, and you if you have a cable \nline coming into your household, you had better pay attention to this \nlegislation because it is going to have a big impact upon you. You are \ngoing to hear a lot of people coming down saying this is going to be \ngood for you. You did not ask for it. You did not say, ``By gosh. Let \nus change this law.'' You did not ask for this thing. But we have \nfigured out this is going to be good for you. And make no mistake about \nit. We have really paid careful attention to this legislation. We know \nexactly what it is going to do.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the American people deserve as a \nconsequence of the impact of this legislation a good and healthy and \nlengthy debate.\n  I heard the distinguished occupant of the Chair earlier say he hopes \nthis thing does not degenerate into a filibuster. I do not intend to \nfilibuster this thing. I point out with great respect to the Senator \nfrom Mississippi that 1822 would have passed last year if it had not \nbeen filibustered and slowed up and tied up by people who said we do \nnot want this thing to go. This would have been law last year I \nbelieve. I do not know if the Senator from South Carolina can confirm \nthat.\n  I do not want to tie this thing up with filibusters and delays. I \nintend, when there is a manager's amendment or incidental amendment, to \nexamine the language because the language is important. It is going to \nhave an effect on people.\n  I say, again for emphasis, that I believe this vote is going to be a \nlot more controversial the further away you get from it than people \nsuspect today. One of the things about laws that citizens need to \nunderstand is that very often it is about power. That is to say, who \nhas the power?\n  I joined with, again the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nin voting against tort reform bill a little earlier because in my \njudgment that was about power. That was about saying to the citizens of \nthis country you are getting swept away saying the trial lawyers are \nmaking life miserable for you. Just ask yourself this question: You get \nhurt out there, you have a problem out there. Who is going to help you? \nIs congress going to help you? Are you going to call up your \nCongressmen and say, ``I am getting abused by the phone and cable \ncompanies. I do not like what is going on out there. Do you think \nCongress is going to rush to your defense? Do you think it will be \npossible for you to get the agencies of the Federal Government to rally \nto your cause? And you probably do not even have enough money to buy an \nairplane ticket to come back here, and if you came back here you will \nnot know where to go.\n  This is about power. And regulations are in place to protect the \ninterests of the people. That is what they are there for. Let us \nderegulate.\n  I have a little case going on right now in Omaha, NE, that \nillustrates what I am talking about. We have a plant in Nebraska which \nemployees a couple of hundred people. Unfortunately, the company \nprocesses lead, and they put a lot of lead in the air and water. And it \nhas been determined--and no one disputes it--that lead damages newborn \nbabies without dispute. We do not have leaded gasoline any longer \nbecause we have decided that is the case. We have a Clean Air Act, we \nhave a Clean Water Act. This company has been out of compliance for \nover 15 years.\n  Guess how we are going to resolve it? Do you think we resolved it \nbecause a U.S. Senator intervened on their behalf? Do you think the \nCongress came to the rescue? Do you think it was the administrative \nbranch? No, sir. A couple of citizens filed a suit in court. It was the \njudiciary. It was the right of a citizen to go to court and say, ``This \ncompany is not obeying the law of the land. I am going to insist that \nthey obey the law of the land.''\n  Mr. President, make no mistake about it. This piece of legislation is \nabout who controls the airways, who controls your telephone, who \ncontrols the information? It is about power.\n  I hear a lot of people say, ``Well, we ought to get the government \nout of that.'' Let us have a debate about what the government should or \nshould not do on behalf of the citizens. I am prepared to do that. I \nthink it is a healthy debate. Let us not presume it is quite so easy as \njust saying competition is the best regulator, which I heard three or \nfour or five times. Competition does not give us clean air. Competition \ndoes not give us clean water. Competition would not likely make every \nsingle factory in the workplace in America safe. Maybe somebody wants \nto come down here and say that is the case.\n  I get 1,000 Americans who say, ``You tell me.'' Do you trust the \ncorporation? You have a corporation out there that is desperately \nworried about their quarterly profits. They are worried about bottom \nline. They have the shareholders out there to perform for, and they \nhave to make a decision. They have 1,000 people working for them, and \nhave been working for them let us say 30 years; 30,000 man and woman \nhours in that corporation. They have to make a decision to lay all \nthousand of them off, and give them no fringe benefits, no severance \npay, no retirement. All of those things add cost to the corporation.\n  I ask my Americans. Do you trust that corporation? Do you think that \ncorporation is going do say ``No. I think it is right and decent; I do \nnot care what the stock holders say, what Wall Street says; I am going \nto ignore all of those people up in New York City; I do not care what \nthey say; I am going to do the right thing; I am going to give you \nseverance pay; I am going to provide you with your health care, and \ntake care of that retirement benefit because I care about you; you are \na human being; I am not going to treat you like trash?''\n  I do not believe many Americans are going to say that is likely to be \nthe case. If a company is a mom and pop shop, owned by an individual \nwhich owns 100 percent of the stock, that might be different. But when \nthat company CEO worries about the value of its share, that companies \nCEO does things differently. They have to. I do not say they are doing \nthe wrong thing. I do not blame them for doing that. But please do not \ncome and say that the market is going to get the job \n[[Page S7911]] done. The market rewards people that produce. The market \nrewards a much different set of values than the values that I have just \ndescribed with these thousand families.\n  So again, the next thing I say to citizens who are wondering about \nthese 144 pages and all of the amendments that will be offered, it is \nabout power and power over your lives, power to deliver you \ninformation, power to give you a phone service, power to give you video \ninformation, power to give you the things that you say that you want.\n  For your information, a lot of people who are coming down here saying \nget the government out of that are very strongly supportive of \nunfortunately a title offered by the senior Senator from Nebraska, \ntitle 4, which said we need to have a lot more government involvement \nwhen it comes to regulating.\n  I understand there is going to be some amendment to make even tougher \npenalties. That is popular. That one we all know. People are fed up \nwith obscenity and they are fed up with the stuff they see on \ntelevision and they want us to do something about it. And title IV \nattempts to do that. I hope we are a bit careful, to say the least, \nwith title IV, but title IV is more Government, it is not less. Title \nIV is the statement by Members of Congress that says the market does \nnot work when it comes to obscenity.\n  Do some people want to come here and tell me it does? Does somebody \nwant to come down here and say the market is the best regulator of \nobscenity? I do not think so. I do not think there is going to be a \nsingle Member come down here and say just let the market take care of \nit; we do not care what kids are getting over the Internet. We do not \ncare what is coming into homes.\n  No. In that instance the market goes out the window. In that instance \nwe say Time/Warner is putting out slime. We have to regulate them in \nsome fashion.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I have a great deal of respect and \nappreciation for the managers of this bill. They have done an awful lot \nof work on it. I do intend to carefully examine the amendments that are \noffered. I do believe that increased competition can be enormously \nbeneficial. I believe that it can, properly done, result in lower \nprices, higher quality service, particularly, as I said, if it is done \nin a fashion that lets everybody compete.\n  Again, I do not underestimate the difficulty of this. I am going to \nhave a lot of explaining to do to my citizens to tell them why this is \ngood for them because in the early days when they get competition they \nare going to get confused. And in the early days they may even get some \nprice increases. They may find themselves paying higher telephone \nservice. They may find themselves paying higher cable. We do not know. \nWe are saying let the market set the price, in general, once you get to \nthe final end of this thing. Let the cost determine what people are \ngoing to pay. We have a very small amount of subsidy in the universal \nservice fund. We have an education provision that some people are going \nto come down here and try to strike, saying the market ought to have \ntaken care of that. After having given speeches saying this is good for \nhealth care, this is good for education, they do not even want to have \nthat provision in this piece of legislation.\n  I have many problems with this bill, Mr. President. I do believe the \nDepartment of Justice needs a role in this. I do not think consultation \nis enough. I would cite as case No. 1 why consultation is not enough, \nthe very thing that Members will use when they are saying that \ncompetition works, and that is Mr. Baxter and Judge Greene getting \ntogether, the Department of Justice getting together with a Federal \njudge and putting together a consent decree.\n  It was the Department of Justice. It was the Department of Justice \nthat gave us the competitive environment. It was not the Federal \nCommuncations Commission. I am not calling for increased authority, \nincreased power, but I want them to do more than consult. They \nunderstand competition. The Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice understands where and when competition is, and they are about \nthe only ones in this town that, at least by my measurement, are out \nthere fighting to make sure that that marketplace in fact is working.\n  I have serious problems saying that telephone companies can acquire \ncable companies inside of their area immediately.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have to have two lines coming into the \nhome. I believe you have to have--if it is going to be fiber or some \nkind of combination of coax and fiber, I do not know what it is going \nto be, but I want two lines coming into my home.\n  I have heard people talk an awful lot about competition, and I have \nheard all the companies coming in saying they want a competitive \nenvironment. This is one thing I know. Competition to me means I have \nchoice. Again, this idea of choice is a two-edged sword. You are going \nto have a lot of households out there that are not going to be terribly \npleased with this new choice they have, and they are not going to be \nterribly happy when they see what that choice might do.\n  We have to be prepared to stay with this thing. To my mind, choice \nmeans if a company does not give me what I want, I can take my business \nsomeplace else. Competition means to me I can go wherever I want and \nget the service I want. And I believe in many ways this bill does just \nthat.\n  The requirements of unbundling, of dialing parity, the requirements \nthat are in this legislation in title I, in my judgment, provide a good \nbasis for us to have a competitive environment. Allowing the phone \ncompanies to go out and buy cable inside their own area, Mr. President, \nis going to restrict competition immediately. We are not going to have \nthe local cable company and the phone company competing because the \nphone company is going to have an incentive to buy them. If they buy \nthem, it ends that competition.\n  I am prepared to hear arguments about that, but I think allowing this \ncable-Bellcore ownership in the local area does precisely the opposite \nof what this bill intends to do.\n  The other objections and problems that I have with the bill I will \ncome later to the floor and try to address. I see the Senator from \nPennsylvania is down here. I suspect that he wants to make a statement. \nI just wanted to stand up at this point in time and say to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from South Carolina I do not intend \nto stand down here and stop this piece of legislation from being \nenacted. But I do intend to stand down here and examine every amendment \nthat is proposed and make sure it is an amendment that I agree to for \nall the reasons I cited earlier.\n  The consumers of this country, the households of this country have \nnot been consulted. We are presuming that it is going to be good for \nthem because we have talked to American corporations and they are \nsaying it is going to be good for them. They are saying this is going \nto be good for consumers. The corporations are saying it is going to be \ngood for those households. They are saying it is good because they are \ngetting more jobs, higher service, better quality, and lower prices.\n  That is what they are saying. It is not coming from households. This \nis not coming from the people of the United States of America, whether \nit is the people of South Dakota, the people of Nebraska, South \nCarolina, Mississippi, or Pennsylvania. We believe that we have \nsomething here that is going to be good for them, but they have not \ncome to us and said: Please do this because we think this needs to be \ndone.\n  So I again will have many opportunities to stand and talk, and I look \nforward to what I hope will be a straightforward and healthy and honest \ndebate, something that I hope does produce a final change in the 1934 \nCommunications Act which I think does need to be changed. But at the \nend of the day I wish to be able to say to the consumers of Nebraska \nthat this is going to be good for you. I wish to able to say to every \nhousehold in Nebraska you are going to get benefits from it and these \nare the benefits that I believe are going to occur.\n  At this stage of the game, Mr. President, I cannot support this \nlegislation for the reasons cited, and I look forward to engaging in \nwhat I said I hope will be a constructive debate.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his statement. In \n[[Page S7912]] fact, the other day I cited him, when I was on a \nnational program of State legislators and they asked, in terms of a \nmodel of a State to deregulate, what might it be. And I suggested the \nwork of Bob Kerrey of Nebraska when he was Governor. I observed his \nwork in deregulating telecommunications in that State, and I certainly \nlook forward to his insights.\n  We have worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill. In fact, all the \nDemocrats on the Commerce Committee voted for the bill. Senator \nHollings did a good job. I visited with and delivered a copy of the \noriginal draft bill to each of the Democrats on the Commerce Committee.\n  Two Republicans on the committee voted against the bill. Eight \nRepublicans on the committee voted for it. This is a bipartisan bill. \nAll the Democrats on the committee voted for it. I think that is a very \nimportant point.\n           the public utility holding company act provisions\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about certain \nprovisions in S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act of 1995.\n  This bill contains provisions that would significantly alter the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). The PUHCA was \noriginally enacted 60 years ago to simplify the utility holding company \nstructure and ensure that consumers were protected from unfair rate \nincreases. At that time, there were many industry abuses involving the \npyramidal corporate structures of holding companies which greatly \nincreased the speculative nature of securities issuances, led to market \nmanipulation, and inflated the capital structure. The abuses in the \nindustry made it nearly impossible for the States to adequately protect \nutility ratepayers.\n  The PUHCA limited the types of businesses that holding companies \ncould acquire to utility related services. As reported out of the \nCommerce Committee, Sections 102 and 206 of the ``Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act'' would permit diversification of \nregistered holding companies into the telecommunications business--\nwithout SEC approval or any other conditions. Allowing holding \ncompanies to diversify away from their traditional core utility \noperations is a departure from the basis principles underlying the 1935 \nAct.\n  Mr. President, my primary concern with these sections of the \n``Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act'' is that losses \nresulting from the subsidiaries telecommunications activities could be \npassed on to public utility customers in the form of higher utility \nrates.\n  I would like to commend Senator Pressler and Senator Lott for \nincluding my provision--which addresses these concerns--in the \nmanager's amendment. My provision puts in place the proper consumer \nsafeguards to protect electric utility ratepayers and stockholders from \nbearing the costs of diversification by registered holding companies \ninto telecommunications activities.\n  It requires the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and the State regulators to monitor the \nactivities and practices of both the subsidiaries and the parent \nholding companies that engage in telecommunications activities in order \nto ensure that utility consumers pay only what they get.\n  For example, my provision would ensure that telecommunications-\nrelated activities are conducted in a separate subsidiary of the \nholding company. It would also provide the States with the appropriate \nregulatory, investigatory, and enforcement authority to protect utility \nconsumers. To this effect, it would require the States to approve any \nrate increases by those utility companies that have a \ntelecommunications subsidiary. As a result, the States can examine the \nproposed rate increase to make sure it is justified and that utility \ncustomers are not subsidizing the holding company's telecommunications-\nrelated costs.\n  The Banking Committee has consulted the SEC as well as industry and \nconsumer representatives in crafting this provision to make sure \nappropriate safeguards will allow the holding companies to diversify \nwithout negative consequences to utility customers. We have struck a \nreasonable balance. As a conferee on the Telecommunications Competition \nand Deregulation Act of 1995, I will be in a position to make certain \nthat this balance is preserved.\n  At the same time, I would add that the Banking Committee intends to \nexamine the continuing need for the PUHCA once the Securities and \nExchange Commission releases its report and recommendations on repeal \nor reform of the Act.\n  I would like to thank Senator Pressler, Senator Lott, Senator \nBumpers, Senator Sarbanes, and their staffs for their cooperation on \nthis issue.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7881-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7912-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/07/senate-section/article/S7912-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7912-S7918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-146.

We, the legislature of the State of Arizona, hereby \n     reaffirm the sovereignty of the states and of the \n     people. [[Page S7913]] \n       ``B. More than two centuries ago, the sovereign states, \n     representing the sovereign people did, of their own volition, \n     ratify the Constitution of the United States. In so doing, \n     the states, in concerted action, established the federal \n     government to perform certain limited and enumerated \n     functions. Under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of \n     the United States, the powers not delegated to the federal \n     government were ``reserved to the states respectively, or to \n     the people.''\n       ``Section II:\n       ``A. Throughout the history of the United States, and \n     especially in recent decades, the federal government has, \n     without right, blatantly disregarded state sovereignty by \n     arrogating unto itself powers that were to have been reserved \n     to the states and to the people.\n       ``(1.) It has conscripted states and their subordinate \n     levels of government to implement its programs through \n     federal mandates, funded and unfunded;\n       ``(2.) It has requisitioned officers of states and their \n     subordinate levels of government to perform duties on its \n     behalf, bypassing state constitutional and legislative \n     processes;\n       ``(3.) It has, as a result of expanding power, imprudently \n     increased spending, increased taxation and increased \n     regulation, which have, in consequence, reduced economic \n     growth by unnecessarily discouraging investment and job \n     creation;\n       ``(4.) It has, through deficit spending and other actions, \n     created massive federal obligations that threaten the living \n     standards of the people, the solvency of the states and the \n     future of generations yet unborn;\n       ``(5.) It has, by centralizing power in Washington, D.C., \n     created a ``democratic deficit,'' a condition under which the \n     federal government has assumed control over functions of \n     government that should have been reserved to state and local \n     governments, making effective control of government more \n     difficult for the people;\n       ``(6.) It has, through unwarranted judicial intervention, \n     interposed itself between the states and the people on \n     matters not of federal jurisdiction;\n       ``(7.) It has, through imprudent judicial review, \n     systematically expanded the power of Congress and the \n     Executive by usurping powers that were not intended under the \n     Constitution of the United States;\n       ``(8.) It has evaded the restraints of the nation's \n     fundamental law, the Constitution of the United States, and \n     has in so doing engaged in the imposition of arbitrary laws, \n     administrative actions and judicial decisions.\n       ``B. Through these actions, the federal government has \n     usurped the sovereignty of the states. And, through these \n     actions, the federal government has usurped the sovereignty \n     of the people.\n       ``Section III:\n       ``A. We declare that the federal government cannot, on its \n     own, legitimately diminish the sovereignty of the states and \n     of the people as intended under the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       ``B. The fundamental law of the nation may only be altered \n     in the manners prescribed by that fundamental law. We are \n     convinced that the policy failures that have accompanied \n     expanded central authority provide, in themselves, powerful \n     testimony to the importance of limiting the federal \n     government to those powers enumerated in the Constitution of \n     the United States. To correct these failures and to secure a \n     more favorable future for the nation, it is necessary that \n     the powers expropriated by the federal government be returned \n     to the states and to the people.\n       ``Section IV:\n       ``We therefore declare the following principles as \n     necessary to the restoration of the sovereignty of the states \n     and of the people, as required under the 10th Amendment of \n     the Constitution of the United States:\n       ``(1.) The federal government should be restored to the \n     role assigned to it under the Constitution of the United \n     States. The powers usurped from the states and from the \n     people by the federal government should be returned in an \n     expeditious and orderly manner. Mechanisms exist for \n     interstate cooperation where necessary, such as interstate \n     compacts and voluntary uniform standards.\n       ``(2.) Constitutional clauses that have been the source of \n     illegitimate federal expansion should be restored to their \n     original meaning. Federal expansion has often been based upon \n     unreasonably permissive interpretations of enumerated powers \n     under the Constitution of the United States, especially the \n     ``commerce'' clause.\n       ``(3.) The federal government should not impose mandates, \n     unfunded or funded, on the states or on their subordinate \n     governments. The Constitution of the United States delineates \n     federal responsibilities and reserves all other \n     responsibilities to the states or to the people. Federal \n     mandates on state or local governments are unnecessary and \n     inappropriate.\n       ``(4.) The federal government should be the exclusive \n     financier of its programs. By partially funding federal \n     programs, such as through matching grants, the federal \n     government distorts the priorities of state and local \n     governments, and establishes a democratic deficit that \n     virtually disenfranchises state and local voters. The federal \n     government has a legal obligation to fully fund its programs, \n     and should neither require nor entice state or local \n     governments to participate in the funding of federal \n     programs.\n       ``(5.) All federal government relationships with local \n     governments should be through the states. All governments in \n     the United States are the creation of the states, which are \n     the creation of the people. One government, the federal \n     government, was created in concert by the states. All other \n     governments are the creation of, and subordinate to the \n     states respectively. Direct federal government-local \n     government relationships are inappropriate, except to the \n     extent specifically authorized by the constitution or laws of \n     a particular state.\n       ``(6.) The federal government should not assign federal \n     responsibilities to officers of state or local governments. \n     Various federal laws designate state or local government \n     officers to perform federal functions. The federal government \n     should enlist state offices or departments to assist it in \n     the performance of its duties only when specifically \n     authorized by the constitution or laws of a particular state.\n       ``(7.) The federal government's treaty making power should \n     be limited to powers that are clearly within the federal \n     scope of responsibility. The states have delegated treaty \n     making powers only with respect to those areas of authority \n     that have been delegated to the federal government.\n       ``(8.) Congress should not act to displace state and local \n     police power--and the courts should not permit such \n     displacement--except where the Constitution authorizes. \n     Congress has preempted entire areas of regulation that have \n     traditionally been matters of state and local police power. \n     In addition, the federal courts have improperly condoned \n     these congressional assaults on local governance, under the \n     doctrine of implied preemption, the so-called ``dormant'' \n     commerce clause and other constitutional provisions.\n       ``Section V:\n       ``In support of these principles, we commit ourselves to \n     the pursuit of such remedies as may be necessary to restore \n     the sovereignty of the states and of the people, by:\n       ``(1.) Legal actions to challenge the illegitimate exercise \n     of federal power;\n       ``(2.) Repeals of laws by which federal power has been \n     illegitimately expanded;\n       ``(3.)

A bill to extend the authority of the Federal Communications \nCommission to use auctions for the allocation of radio spectrum \nfrequencies for commercial use, to provide for private sector \nreimbursement of Federal governmental user costs to vacate commercially \nvaluable spectrum, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    THE SPECTRUM AUCTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to send to the desk this morning a \nbill to extend the Federal Communications Commission's authority to use \nauctions to award radio spectrum licenses. I want to state to the \nSenate that for several Congresses, I had suggested spectrum auctions \nto deal with the problem of allocating this very valuable space in our \nairways. Congress did not pass those bills, but finally, in the last \nCongress, Congress did accept the amendment that I had offered. Since \nthat time, the Federal Government has received over $9 billion in money \nthat has been bid for the use of this spectrum which is allocated by \nthe FCC.\n  I am introducing this bill now so that the Senate will be aware of \nit, because I intend to offer it as an amendment to the \ntelecommunications bill when it is presented to the Senate. This bill \nwill raise an estimated minimum amount of $4.5 billion over a 5-year \nperiod. It will be used to partially offset the cost of the \ntelecommunications bill as computed by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I might say on the bright side, the Congressional Budget Office has \nstated that enactment of the telecommunications bill will result in a \n$3 billion reduction in the payments, that are made by the private \nsector I might add, for universal service in this country. But there is \nstill a remaining expenditure that will be made in the 7-year period of \nthe budget that is before the Congress, and in order that that budget \nmay remain in balance and still have us be able to enact the \ntelecommunications bill, we are presenting amendments that will provide \noffsetting revenues on the Federal side.\n  It is a strange thing about this, Mr. President, because it is the \nprivate sector that makes the support payments under existing law and \nwill continue to make smaller payments under the telecommunications \nbill as the Commerce Committee will present it. But there is no \nquestion that the CBO has decided it still has a budgetary impact as \nfar as the economy is concerned, and, therefore, an offset is required.\n  I urge Senators to review this proposed bill, which, as I said, will \nbecome an amendment to be offered by me to the telecommunications bill \nwhen it is on the floor.\n  This bill has five sections. Section 1 is the short title, which is \nthe ``Spectrum Auction Act of 1995.'' Section 2 contains findings drawn \nfrom two NTIA reports, which state that the U.S. will need at least 180 \nmegahertz of additional spectrum for cellular, PCS, and satellite \nservices over the next 10 years, and that less than that amount will be \navailable without the bill. Section 3 extends the FCC's auction \nauthority from 1998 until 2002, and would allow the FCC to use auctions \nfor all licenses except public safety radio services and new digital TV \nlicenses. Section 4 of the bill allows federal agencies to accept \nreimbursement from private parties for the costs of relocating to new \nspectrum frequencies, so that the private sector can pay to move \ngovernment stations off valuable frequencies; it also requires NTIA to \nmove government stations if all costs are paid and the new frequency \nand facilities are comparable. Section 5 requires the Secretary of \nCommerce to submit a plan to reallocate three additional frequency \nbands that NTIA has identified for transfer from government to private \nuse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spectrum Auction Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration of the Department of Commerce recently \n     submitted to the Congress a report entitled ``U.S. National \n     Spectrum Requirements'' as required by section 113 of the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923);\n       (2) based on the best available information the report \n     concludes that an additional 179 megahertz of spectrum will \n     be needed within the next ten years to meet the expected \n     demand for land mobile and mobile satellite radio services \n     such as cellular telephone service, paging services, personal \n     communication services, and low earth orbiting satellite \n     communications systems;\n       (3) a further 85 megahertz of additional spectrum, for a \n     total of 264 megahertz, is needed if the United States is to \n     fully implement the Intelligent Transportation System \n     currently under development by the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (4) as required by Part B of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 921 et seq.) the Federal \n     Government will transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum\n      from exclusive government use to non-governmental or mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use between 1994 and \n     2004;\n       (5) the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report submitted to \n     Congress by the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration states that, of the 235 megahertz of spectrum \n     identified for reallocation from governmental to non-\n     governmental or mixed use--\n       (A) 50 megahertz has already been reallocated for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (B) 45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use,\n       (C) 25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (D) 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use, and\n       (E) the final 45 megahertz will be reallocated for mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use by 2004;\n       (6) the 165 megahertz of spectrum that are not yet \n     reallocated, combined with 80 megahertz that the Federal \n     Communications Commission is currently holding in reserve for \n     emerging technologies, are less than the best estimates of \n     projected spectrum needs in the United States;\n       (7) the authority of the Federal Communications Commission \n     to assign radio spectrum frequencies using an auction process \n     expires on September 30, 1998;\n       [[Page S7919]] (8) a significant portion of the reallocated \n     spectrum will not yet be assigned to non-governmental users \n     before that authority expires;\n       (9) the transfer of Federal governmental users from certain \n     valuable radio frequencies to other reserved frequencies \n     could be expedited if Federal governmental users are \n     permitted to accept reimbursement for reallocation costs from \n     non-governmental users; and\n       (10) extension of the authority to use auctions and non-\n     governmental reimbursement of Federal governmental users \n     relocation costs would allow the market to determine the most \n     efficient use of the available spectrum.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION AND EXPANSION OF AUCTION AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     309(j)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       (``1) General authority.--If mutually exclusive \n     applications or requests are accepted for any initial license \n     or construction permit which will involve a use of the \n     electromagnetic spectrum, then the Commission shall grant \n     such license or permit to a qualified applicant through a \n     system of competitive bidding that meets the requirements of \n     this subsection. The competitive bidding authority granted by \n     this subsection shall not apply to licenses or construction \n     permits issued by the Commission for public safety radio \n     services or for licenses or construction permits for new \n     terrestrial digital television services assigned by the \n     Commission to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to \n     replace their current television licenses.'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2) and renumbering paragraphs \n     (3) through (13) as (2) through (12), respectively; and\n       (3) by striking ``1998'' in paragraph (10), as renumbered, \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``2002''.\n       (3) by striking `1998'' in paragraph (10), as renumbered, \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``2002''.\n\n     SEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL RELOCATION COSTS.\n\n       Section 113 of the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration Act (47 U.S.C. 923) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(f) Relocation of Federal Government Stations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In order to expedite the efficient use \n     of the electromagnetic spectrum and notwithstanding section \n     3302(b) of title 31, United States Code, any Federal entity \n     which operates a Federal Government station may accept \n     reimbursement from any person for the costs incurred by such \n     Federal entity for any modification, replacement, or \n     reissuance of equipment, facilities, operating manuals, \n     regulations, or other expenses incurred by that entity in \n     relocating the operations of its Federal Government station \n     or stations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to \n     any other frequency or frequencies. Any such reimbursement \n     shall be deposited in the account of such Federal entity in \n     the Treasury of the United States. Funds deposited according \n     to this section shall be available, without appropriation or \n     fiscal year limitation, only for the\n      operations of the Federal entity for which such funds were \n     deposited under this section.\n       ``(2) Process for relocation.--Any person seeking to \n     relocate a Federal Government station that has been assigned \n     a frequently within a band allocated for mixed Federal and \n     non-Federal use may submit a petition for such relocation to \n     NTIA.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Wolf Gang II, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 jones act waiver for ``wolf gang ii''\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \ngrants a Jones Act waiver to the vessel Wolf Gang II. This vessel is \nowned by Robert L. Wolf, a Washington State resident who, after 30 \nyears of service, retired in 1992 as a colonel in the U.S. Army.\n  After his retirement, Wolf decided to operate a charter boat business \non Puget Sound and bought Wolf Gang II, a 1985 Bayliner 4518 \nmotoryacht. Although Wolf can document the boat was built in the United \nStates, he cannot verify all of the boat's previous owners were U.S. \ncitizens. As a result, Wolf's boat fails to meet all of the \nrequirements in the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and he is unable to gain \ncertification for coastwise trade.\n  I understand how frustrating this situation is for Mr. Wolf. He \nsimply wants to run a charter boat business in the beautiful waters of \nPuget Sound, and he has waited 3 years for an exemption from the \nunintended consequences of the Jones Act. My bill addresses this \ncomplication and waives the Jones Act requirements so that Mr. Wolf can \nbegin operating his charter business this year. I look forward to swift \npassage of this legislation, and I expect to see Barnacle Bob's Cruises \noperating soon.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Simon, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        Mr. Bradley, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 890. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \ngun free schools, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the gun-free school zones act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, with my colleagues Senators Specter, Simon, \nFeinstein, Bradley, Lautenberg, Chafee, and Kerrey, we rise today to \nintroduce the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995. This common-sense \nmeasure, which replaces the original Gun Free School Zones Act, is \nneeded to send a strong message to teachers, State law enforcement \nofficers and State prosecutors: the Federal Government stands behind \nyou and will support you in getting guns out of our school grounds.\n  Let me begin by reminding you that the original version of this bill \npassed by unanimous consent in 1990. The measure was kept in conference \nwhere any one member's objection could have struck the bill. That \nconference was attended by the senior members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, among them Senators Biden, Hatch, Thurmond, Simpson, and \nKennedy. It was signed into law by then-President Bush. It is a \n[[Page S7920]] measure that was supported by all of us. And we should \ncontinue to support it.\n  But in April, a sharply divided Supreme Court struck down the \noriginal Gun-Free School Zones Act in the case of United States versus \nLopez. It did so on the grounds that the commerce clause of the \nConstitution did not support the act. As long as we can address the \nSupreme Court's concerns, there is no reason why the decision should \nalter the support this bill had in 1990.\n  The original act made it a Federal crime to knowingly bring a gun \nwithin 1,000 feet of a school or to fire a gun in these zones, with \ncarefully crafted exceptions. The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995 \ndoes exactly what the old act did. However, it adds a requirement that \nthe prosecutor prove as part of each prosecution that the gun moved in \nor affected interstate or foreign commerce.\n  That is the only change to the legislative language of the original \nbill. The only change. We place only a minor burden on prosecutors \nwhile simply and plainly assuring the constitutionality of the act.\n  The goal of this bill is simple: to heed the Supreme Court's decision \nregarding Federal power and yet to continue the fight against school \nviolence. The Lopez decision cannot be used as an excuse for \ncomplacency.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a practical approach to the national \nepidemic of gun violence plaguing our education system. In 1990, the \nCenters For Disease Control found that 1 in 20 students carried a gun \nin a 30-day period. Three years later, it was 1 in 12. Even worse, the \nNational Education Association estimates that 100,000 kids bring guns \nto school every day. How can Congress turn its back on our children \nwhen their safety is being threatened on a daily basis?\n  My home State, Wisconsin, is not immune to this wave of violence. \nAccording to Gerald Mourning, the former director of school safety for \nMilwaukee, ``[K]ids who did their fighting with their fists, and \nperhaps knives, are now settling their arguments with guns.'' In the \n1993-94 school year half of the students expelled from the Milwaukee \nPublic Schools were thrown out for bringing a gun to school. In Dane \nCounty, WI, the number of juvenile weapons offenses tripled--from 75 in \n1989 to 220 in 1993.\n  The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995 is a simple, straightforward, \neffective and construction approach to this problem. In the Lopez \ndecision, the Supreme Court held that the original act exceeded \nCongress' commerce clause power because it did not adequately tie guns \nfound in school zones to interstate commerce. Much as I disagree with \nthe 5 to 4 decision and strongly agree with the dissenters--Justices \nSouter, Stevens, Breyer, and Ginsburg--our new legislation will clearly \npass muster under the majority's Lopez test. By requiring that the \nprosecutor prove that the gun brought to school ``moved in or affected \ninterstate commerce,'' the act is a clear exercise of Congress' \nunquestioned power to regulate interstate activities. In fact, the \nLopez decision itself suggested that requiring an explicit connection \nbetween the gun and interstate commerce in each prosecution would \nassure the constitutionality of the act.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that the guns brought to schools are \npart of a interstate problem. After all, almost every gun is made with \nraw material from one State, assembled in a second State, and \ntransported to the school yards of yet another State. One 14-year-old \nin a Madison, WI, gang told the Wisconsin State Journal that the older \nleaders of his gang brought carloads of guns from Chicago to Madison to \npass out to the younger gang members to take to school. In short, this \nact regulates a national, interstate problem. Numerous Supreme Court \ncases have upheld similar regulations.\n  When the act was first passed, less than a dozen States had laws \ndealing with guns on school grounds. Now, more than 40 have such \nlegislation. Our original Federal law served as an example and a spur \nto these State laws, and all of us in Congress should be proud of that. \nTheir presence, however, does not eradicate the need for a Federal law.\n  In light of these State laws, a few of my colleagues have asked me \nwhy we need a Federal statute. The answer is simple. Some States still \ndo not have State Gun-Free School Zones Acts; others simply have laws \nthat supplement the Federal statute; still more have laws that are \nweaker than the Federal law. Alabama, for example, only prohibits \nbringing a gun to a public school with the intent to cause bodily harm. \nThat means you can bring a gun to school, frighten and disrupt \neveryone, but still get off because you did not intend to cause injury. \nAnd in Alabama you can bring a gun to private school without any \nworries. That is unacceptable. With a Federal law, we can fill in these \nloopholes. And where there are not State laws, we can fill in the even \nlarger gaps. In short, the Gun-Free School Zones Act gives prosecutors \nthe flexibility to bring violators to justice under either State or \nFederal statutes, whichever is appropriate--or tougher.\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot ignore the epidemic of school \nviolence. The epidemic is undermining our educational system and \nthreatens to cripple our Nation's competitiveness. It is turning our \nschoolyards into sanctuaries for armed criminals and drug gangs. We \nhave repeatedly recognized that our Nation's classrooms deserve special \nprotection and attention from the Federal Government. Gun-Free school \nzones are not a panacea, to be sure, but they are an important step \ntoward fighting gun violence and keeping our teachers and children \nsafe.\n  Five years ago we all agreed unanimously on this bill. It was \nsensible then, and it is sensible now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Gun-Free School Zones Act \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nof the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1995.\n  This bill makes it a criminal offense to knowingly bring a gun or \nfire a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. The penalty for violating the \nlaw would be up to 5 years in prison or a fine of $5,000.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill is critical to protect the \nsanctity of our schools and the safety of our students.\n  In 1993, the Centers for Disease Control found that 1 in 12 students \ncarried a gun to school within a 30-day period.\n  Each day, an estimated 135,000 pack a gun with their books on their \nway to school.\n  At a time when guns are becoming more and more prevalent on \nneighborhood streets, we cannot simply stand by and allow our \nplaygrounds to become battlegrounds. We cannot expect our students to \nthrive in an atmosphere where they must fear for their lives and for \ntheir safety.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the original Gun Free Schools Act with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. As many of you know, a sharply divided \nSupreme Court recently invalidated that bill, saying that it exceeded \ncongressional power.\n  I personally disagreed with the Supreme Court decision, and signed an \namicus brief supporting its validity. But that is not the issue before \nus today. Today, the issue is the safety of our children.\n  The 1995 act ensures the constitutionality of the Gun Free Schools \nAct by requiring the prosecutor to prove as part of each prosecution \nthat the gun moved in, or affected, interstate commerce. That provision \nwill place only a small burden on prosecutors and will ensure our power \nto keep America's schools safe.\n  Mr. President, this bill has the support of the law enforcement and \neducation communities.\n  It has been endorsed by the National Education Association, the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators, the National School \nBoards Association, the National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  Certainly this bill is not a panacea, but it is a worthwhile attempt \nto keep our children away from the dangers of guns and violence.\n  Mr. President, the National Rifle Association likes to say that guns \ndon't kill; people do. But the gun statistics I've seen belie their \ncontentions.\n  Just consider these numbers.\n  In 1992, handguns killed 33 people in Great Britain, 36 in Sweden, 97 \nin Switzerland, 60 in Japan, 13 in Australia, 128 in Canada, and 13,220 \nin the United States.\n  The problem, Mr. President, isn't that we have more people. It's that \nwe have more guns.\n  We need to fight back the wave of gun violence that's overtaking our \nstreets and neighborhoods once and for all. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support this worthy bill and to help protect \nour children and our teachers from the dangers of violence.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 891. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to convey certain \nreal property at Fort Ord, CA, to the city of Seaside, CA, in order to \nfoster the economic development of the city, which has been adversely \nimpacted by the closure of Fort Ord; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                THE FORT ORD CLOSURE IMPACT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduce important legislation \nto convey surplus real property at the former Fort Ord Army reservation \nto the city of Seaside, CA. The sale of this property, which includes \ntwo golf courses and surrounding property, is in accordance with the \nreuse plan prepared by the Fort Ord Reuse Authority. This legislation \nenjoys strong community support. An identical bill has been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Sam Farr.\n  This legislation would help implement the 1993 recommendation of the \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. In the Commission's \n1993 report to the President, it made specific recommendations for the \ndisposal of Army property. These recommendations balanced the need for \nproperty reuse with the Army's legitimate need to support the military \npersonnel remaining on the Monterey Peninsula.\n  Specifically, the Commission directed the Department to dispose of \nall property, including the golf courses, not required to support the \nPresidio of Monterey and the Naval Postgraduate School. Accordingly, in \n1993, the Acting Secretary of the Army decided to sell the two Fort Ord \ngolf courses to the city of Seaside, CA.\n  Unfortunately, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act does not \npermit the Commission to consider the nonappropriated fund revenue \nneeds which are supported by the golf course revenues. This legislation \naddresses this problem by allowing funds received by the Army from the \nsale of golf courses to be deposited into the Army's morale, welfare, \nand recreation account.\n  This legislation conveys approximately 477 acres, which consist of \nthe two Fort Ord golf courses, Black Horse and Bayonet, and neighboring \nthe surplus housing facilities. This property has been screened through \nthe Pryor process established in the fiscal year 1994 Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Importantly, this legislation requires the city of Seaside to pay \nfair market value for the property. I want to repeat that point: this \nis not a giveaway program; the city of Seaside is required to pay full \nmarket value. The proceeds from the sale of the golf course will be \ndeposited in the Department of the Army's morale, welfare, and \nrecreation fund, and the proceeds from the housing sale will be \ndeposited in the BRAC account.\n  This legislation is another important step in implementing the highly \nsuccessful Fort Ord Reuse Plan. By enacting this legislation, the \nCongress will help implement the BRAC Commission's 1993 recommendations \nand simultaneously foster economic development in the city of Seaside.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The cost of the survey shall be borne by the City.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Coats, Mr. McConnell, \n        Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 892. A bill to amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, \nto punish transmission by computer of indecent material to minors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    the protection of children from computer pornography act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Protection \nof Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995. I believe this bill \nwould provide children with the strongest possible protection from \ncomputer pornography. I would like to thank the majority leader for his \ncrucial support of this important piece of legislation. Currently, \nchild molesters and sexual predators use computer networks to locate \nchildren and try to entice them into illicit sexual relationships. \nAccordingly, my bill would make it a crime to knowingly or recklessly \ntransmit indecent pornographic materials to children over computer \nnetworks. Some so-called access providers facilitate this by refusing \nto take action against child molesters, even after other computer users \nhave complained. So, my bill would make it a crime for access providers \nwho are aware of this sort of activity to permit it to continue.\n  Mr. President, I have carefully drafted this bill so that it will \nwithstand the inevitable court challenge. This bill focuses only on \nprotecting children from material which the Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly stated is harmful to children. The Protection of Children \nfrom Computer Pornography Act of 1995 would not tell any adult what \ntype of computerized material they may view or obtain.\n  Finally, Mr. President, due to time constraints, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the remainder of my remarks be printed into the Record.\n\nAnalysis of the Protection of Children From Indecent Pornography Act of \n                                  1995\n\n       At the outset, this initiative, which amends 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1464 (1984), defines several technical terms. For \n     ``remote computer facility'' and ``electronic communications \n     service,'' the definitions used in the ``Protection of \n     Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995'' are taken \n     from existing sections of the criminal code. Because it was \n     unclear whether the terms ``remote computer service'' and/or \n     ``electronic communications service'' would include an \n     electronic bulletin board, the Grassley initiative creates a \n     specific definition for electronic bulletin board systems. \n     This was done to avoid the possibility that electronic \n     bulletin boards, some of which specialize in providing \n     pornographic materials, would be exempt from the bill.\n       Substantively, this creates two distinct criminal offenses. \n     First, it is a crime to knowingly or recklessly transmit \n     indecent pornography to minors. The Grassley bill deals \n     exclusively with indecent pornography provided to children \n     because there are already federal laws against providing \n     obscene material and child pornography to anyone, including \n     children. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252 (Supp. 1994); 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1465 (Supp. 1995). The definition of indecent material \n     has been established by the Supreme Court and is discussed \n     below.\n       Second, the bill would make it a crime for an on-line \n     service which permits users to access the Internet or \n     electronic bulletin board to willfully permit an audit to \n     transmit indecent pornography to a minor. In the criminal \n     law, ``willful'' has a specific meaning which is uniquely \n     suited to on-line access providers. See ``Manual of Modern \n     Criminal Jury Instructions for the Ninth Circuit'' Sec. 5.05 \n     (West 1989). A willfulness standard is more appropriate for \n     on-line service providers because those services can only \n     monitor customer communications in narrow circumstances, or \n     face criminal prosecution for invasion of privacy. See 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2510 (Supp. 1995).\n       To prove a violation under the bill for permitting adults \n     to transmit indecent material to children, the Justice \n     Department would have to show that the access provider was \n     actually aware that a particular recipient was a child and \n     that the access provider's customers were using the on-line \n     service to transmit indecent material to minors. Importantly, \n     although this burden of proof appears to be high, it could \n     easily be met by prosecutors, given the current practice.\n\n\n               legal background: the concept of indecency\n\n       Basically, there are three categories of sexually explicit \n     expression which are subject to congressional regulation \n     notwithstanding the First Amendment. See New York v. Ferber, \n     458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 \n     (1973). The Grassley initiative focuses exclusively on \n     indecent material because existing federal laws largely cover \n     the transmission of obscene and child pornographic material \n     in interstate commerce. See U.S.C. Sec. 2252 (Supp. 1995); \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1465 (Supp. 1995); U.S.C. Sec. 1462 (Supp. 1995).\n       For present purposes, indecent material can be defined as \n     depictions of sexual activity or sexual organs which are \n     patently offensive according to contemporary community \n     standards. See FCC v. Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726, 732 (1978); \n     Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 10 F.3d 812 (D.C. Cir. \n     1993), rehearing en banc granted, 15 F.3d 186 (D.C. Cir. \n     1994); Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1991). This test is basically the second prong of \n     the ``Miller Test.'' 413 U.S. 24-25. It is important to note \n     that while indecent material is not constitutionally \n     protected for children, indecency is protested for and among \n     adults. Thus, laws intended to protect children must not \n     ``reduce the adult population . . . [to viewing] . . . only \n     what is acceptable to children.'' Butler v. Michigan, 352 \n     U.S. 380, 383 (1957). While some court have applied the \n     indecency in slightly different ways depending on the medium, \n     (see Pacifica, supra; Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492 \n     U.S. 115 (1989)), the central purpose of the indecency \n     standard is to prohibit or to regulate the display of \n     patently offensive representations of sexually explicit \n     material which is openly available to the public. As the \n     Court stated in Pacifica, see 438 U.S. at 748-49, this means \n     a medium, like computers, which has ``a uniquely pervasive \n     presence in the lives of all Americans'' and is ``uniquely \n     accessible to children'' can be regulated to protect \n     children.\n       That is precisely what the ``Protection of Children from \n     Computer Pornography'' initiative would do--prohibit \n     transmission of computerized indecent pornography to children \n     while permitting adults to access otherwise constutitionally \n     protected material.\n       In some respects indecency is similar, though not \n     identical, to the concept of ``harmful to juveniles'' laws, \n     which exist in nearly every state. These laws prohibit the \n     sale (and sometimes the display) of certain sexually explicit \n     material to minors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 \n     (1968). In order to determine whether material is harmful to \n     juveniles, the material must be found to satisfy a three-part \n     test. One part of this test involves a showing that the \n     material depicts or describes sexual activity in terms \n     patently offensive according to contemporary community \n     standards for what is acceptable for children. In a sense, \n     the federal indecency standard is designed to protect \n     children from harmful depictions of sexual activity, similar \n     to the goal of the harmful to juveniles test.\n       Traditionally, the federal government has not regulated \n     extensively to protect children from inappropriate exposure \n     to pornography because it is primarily a matter of local \n     concern. With the rise of global, international computer \n     networks, however, it has become clear that Congress has a \n     more extensive role to play in protecting children. The \n     Grassley initiative responds to this changed environment by \n     ``filing in the gaps'' created by new technology.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement \nfrom the Family Research Council and the bill be printed in the Record.\n  It has the coauthorship of Senators Dole, Coats, McConnell, Shelby, \nand Nickles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 892\n\n           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is our \n     opinion that the Act is fully consistent with the Supreme \n     Court's indecency precedents.\n       Before providing more extensive analysis, it is prudent \n     that I state my qualifications to render this opinion. I have \n     practiced in the area of pornography law and have \n     participated in extensive litigation before the Supreme \n     Court, federal courts of appeal, and state courts on \n     pornography-related controversies. I am thus very familiar \n     with the manner in which courts have treated statutes aimed \n     at regulating pornographic materials.\n       The seminal cases applicable to the Act are FCC v. \n     Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable Communications, Inc. \n     v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989). Taken together, these cases \n     clearly and unambiguously establish the principle that \n     society may prohibit the transmission of indecent material to \n     children.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for charitable contributions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE CHOICE IN WELFARE TAX CREDIT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing the choice \nin welfare tax credit bill.\n  The goal of our welfare reforms should be to continue to focus \nantipoverty efforts not just to the States but to local, private \ncharities as well. With the choice in welfare tax credit, taxpayers \nwould be allowed a 100 percent tax credit up to $100 per wage earner \neach year for contributions to charities engaged in antipoverty \nefforts. This would go a long way toward transferring antipoverty \nefforts from the inefficient and ineffective Federal Government to \nnonprofit charities who are more efficient and have a much better sense \nfor what their local population needs.\n  I have faith in the ability of people living in the communities to \nknow what works best and to provide prompt, temporary assistance to \nthose who need it most. The emphasis here is on temporary. Private \ncharities view antipoverty assistance not as a right or a way of life \nbut as a tool by which to change behavior and encourage personal \nresponsibility for one's own life.\n  I want to give the people that pay the bills and provide the services \nin the local community a much larger role in how poverty relief efforts \nare structured. This bill would also empower taxpayers to have some \ndirect influence on how their tax dollars are spent. In fact, it will \nexpand the number of people donating to charities. Currently, about 28 \npercent of taxpayers take the tax deduction for charitable \ncontributions. This bill will allow all taxpayers, whether they itemize \nor not, to receive a credit for contributing. Inspiring more taxpayers \nto contribute to local charities will make people more aware of \nantipoverty efforts in their community, and may inspire them to \nvolunteer their time as well.\n  So I want to encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this \nbill, and lend their support to an idea that truly returns power to the \nindividual taxpayer and the community in which they live.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.
