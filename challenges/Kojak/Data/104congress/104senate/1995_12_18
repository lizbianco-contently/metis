Today, we join in the celebration of Hanukkah, the Feast of \nDedication. We join with our Jewish Senators, the Jewish people \nthroughout our land, and the State of Israel. We remember 165 B.C. and \nthe victory of the Maccabees over tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes and his \ntroops who had occupied Jerusalem, desecrated the temple, and sought to \ndestroy forever the Hebrew religion. We celebrate the Maccabean victory \nthat enabled the Jews to rededicate the temple and once again to \nworship You freely. It is with gratitude we remember that there was one \nremaining flask of pure olive oil left in the temple that miraculously \nkept the eternal light on the altar burning for 8 days and 8 nights \nuntil the supply could be replenished.\n  We claim the meaning of the word Hanukkah, dedication, as we \nrededicate ourselves to our duty to uphold religious freedom for all \npeople today. We also reaffirm our commitment to battle against the \nforces of evil in our society. Lord, we seek to be temples of Your holy \nspirit. Help us to shine in the spiritual darkness of our time. Keep us \naflame with Your spirit of truth. May the verse from Zechariah 4:6, so \noften repeated during the 8 days of Hanukkah, be our source of strength \ntoday: ``Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord.'' \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18791-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have been asked by a number of my \ncolleagues if I could give some idea when we might be leaving here for \nthe holidays, and I cannot. But I will lay out some of the items we \nwould like to take up before Christmas or New Year's Eve, whichever.\n  They are the nominations on the Executive Calendar and other calendar \nitems; the Whitewater subpoena controversy, which may or may not be on \nthe Senate floor. If so, we would like to do that on Wednesday. If \nthere is a budget negotiated agreement, we would like to complete that, \nof course. There are three appropriations bills remaining; DOD \nauthorization conference report, which we hope to have a vote on \ntomorrow. There will be a cloture vote on the Labor-HHS bill after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader probably tomorrow.\n  There are other available conference reports. The ICC sunset, I think \nthat is a conference report, and then welfare reform conference report, \nwhich should come to the Senate Wednesday or Thursday.\n  I will also say, and I think I have indicated this publicly, that \nthere will be no votes today. We hope to receive the D.C. \nappropriations bill from the House late afternoon or early evening. I \nthink we are trying to work out some agreement, because of the urgency \nof the matter, that we can deem that to have passed when it reaches the \nSenate. As soon as we have the language on the bill, we will give that \nto all the interested parties. What they have done is take out, as I \nunderstand, all the education provisions and, on that basis, I think \nthe House is prepared to act.\n  If anything develops between now--well, any time anything develops--\nif there is any development and the President should call and say he \nwould like to discuss the budget, I will certainly convey that to my \ncolleagues.\n  So there will be a period of morning business until 11:30, with no \nvotes today. I hope to be able to have the D.C. appropriations \nconference report deemed agreed to when it arrives. There will be a \ncloture vote, as I have said, tomorrow.\n  Also, last evening, there was an effort by Senator Dorgan by \nunanimous consent to pass a Senate continuing resolution. Normally \nappropriations originate in the House. I suggested that we might be \nable to accommodate them to do that until the 22d of December if they \nlet us take the Labor-HHS bill, which has been tied up on the calendar \nsince September 15 because of objections on the other side to one \nlittle provision in that whole bill.\n  Today, if they are prepared to do that, I think we can work that out. \nThe Speaker told me he would be very anxious to receive the Labor-HHS \nbill with the CR attached. So we will be working with the Democrats. If \nthat can happen, that will at least keep everything open until the 22d. \nIt is up to my colleagues on the other side. We are prepared to move on \nthat at any time during the day.\n  I know that my distinguished colleague, Senator Lott from \nMississippi, will discuss in some detail some of the relief that could \nhappen very quickly. I am very pleased to yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before the Senator does that, will the \ndistinguished majority leader yield for a comment from me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Vermont. \n  \n[[Page S18792]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader had \nmentioned the Defense authorization bill, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from South \nCarolina, is also here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I realize this would have to probably be hotlined from \nboth Cloakrooms, but I certainly am willing to agree to a vote at a \ntime certain. But I mention two provisos: First, at some point prior to \nthe vote, and if the vote is going to be tomorrow, at that time \ntomorrow, that I be recognized for 20 minutes to speak--of course, with \nequal time on the other side, naturally--to speak on the subject of \nlandmines.\n  I will do that with the understanding of the distinguished chairman \nthat on the subsequent Defense authorization bill, there not be \nlanguage on landmines, certainly not the language that I have stated my \nobjection to and have given on the floor to him and to the \ndistinguished Republican leader. I mention that for the sake of our \ndistinguished majority leader, because I know he has to try to put \ntogether a schedule. I just want him to know, with the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina here on the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I thank also the \nchairman of the committee. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I think that is satisfactory to have a \ndefinite time to vote, and the distinguished Senator from Vermont will \nhave 20 minutes before the vote and I will have 20 minutes before the \nvote to speak on the bill and have a definite time to vote. If we can \nagree on that time, I suggest maybe 12 o'clock tomorrow, if that suits \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would leave it to the leaders to set the time. But I \ncertainly would agree to whatever time the two leaders were able to \nset. I understand there are both Republican and Democratic Senators who \nwish to speak on it, on the bill. I do not want to preclude that. \nCertainly, within the normal course of things, my understanding was \nthat the leadership wanted to have a vote sometime tomorrow. I would \nhope to accommodate whatever that is.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. That seems like a very reasonable proposal. I hope we can \nget that locked in as soon as possible. Why don't we check with both \nsides, our leaders, and see if we cannot get that cleared momentarily. \nWe will work on it, and we hope the Senator from Vermont will do the \nsame on his side. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I assure the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina that, with the understanding that I have with the \ndistinguished chairman regarding the issue of landmines, I will be \nwilling to accommodate whatever time the joint leadership wants to have \nthis vote. I ask only that the leadership, in setting that vote, \nprovide 20 minutes each for the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina and myself prior to the vote.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Mississippi has some other \nscheduling and housekeeping to do. Once he is finished, at some \nappropriate point, I am going to retain the floor in my own right for a \nfew minutes of morning business.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, that would give today for those who wish \nto speak on the bill, for or against it, to make their speeches, and \nthen tomorrow we can have the vote. The leaders can agree on a time \ntomorrow. Senator Lott is now representing the leadership on the \nRepublican side, and he can get in touch with the Democratic leadership \nand agree on a time for the vote. But as I understand it, it will \ndefinitely be tomorrow. I ask unanimous consent that it will be \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I think we need to have \nrepresentation from both sides of the aisle before we enter an \nagreement on unanimous consent. Can I ask the chairman to withhold \nmomentarily and we will check with the leaders?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from South Carolina withdraw \nthat unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. THURMOND. If that is the desire of the Senator from Mississippi, \nI will do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reemphasize to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee that we will be working on both sides of the aisle \nto see if we cannot get an agreed-to time to have a vote tomorrow on \nthe Defense authorization bill. I think we can get that worked out. I \nthought the comments of the Senator from Vermont were very helpful. We \nwill work on that in the next few minutes.\n  Mr. President, if I can clarify the parliamentary circumstances, we \nhave a period of morning business now that will go for how long? Is it \nfor a time certain or for a period of time?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18791-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We thank Dr. Ogilvie for his help, \ncounsel, and prayers in this institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18792-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18792-S18793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MR. PRESIDENT, SIGN THE BILLS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to switch to the matter of the \nappropriations bills and conference reports. Mr. President, the ball is \nin the President's court. It is in his hands. It seems to be missed in \nthe news media that the Congress has been completing its work and \nsending bills to the President. He has bills on his desk that would, in \nfact, guarantee that approximately 621,000 Federal employees could be \nat work today or tomorrow. We do not need a continuing resolution for \nthe Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary offices, the \nInterior Department, and VA-HUD Departments to be opened and operating.\n  So I say to the President of the United States, Mr. President, sign \nthe bills. That is all you need to do. Sign the conference reports that \nyou have before you and cut this problem down to almost nothing.\n  There are two remaining appropriations conference reports that are \nnow ready to move and should also be in the President's hands in the \nnext 2 days or so. That would be the D.C. appropriations conference \nreport. I believe we were able to reach an agreement on Saturday that \nthe House will act on sometime, hopefully today, and the Senate will \nfollow suit. It was not a perfect agreement or solution, but it was one \nthat we should be able to live with. So we should have the D.C. \nappropriations bill done sometime tomorrow for sure.\n  We also have broken loose again the foreign operations appropriations \nbill. We will try to move it through once again, and, hopefully, we \nwill get both of those conference reports on to the President's desk. \nThat will then be five of the remaining appropriations bills that will \nbe with the President, leaving only the Department of Labor, Health, \nand Human Services appropriations conference report to be acted on.\n  That resides in this body's hands. We have tried repeatedly, frankly, \nsometimes on both sides of the aisle, to get this bill up for \nconsideration. But it is being objected to because of some issues that \nare very small in terms of the big impact of Labor, Health and Human \nServices. The way it has been held up--listen to this--it is being held \nup by filibuster on the motion to proceed. The Democratic leader has \nsaid that we cannot even proceed to take this bill up. I say to the \nSenate, let us just go with the regular order, bring up the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, regular order, amendments are in order, the \nDemocrats can offer amendments, Republicans can offer amendments, we \nwill vote and somebody will win and somebody will lose. It will not \nalways \n\n[[Page S18793]]\nbe partisan; it will be bipartisan, the way the votes are recorded. And \nwe will act on it.\n  But, no, repeatedly the Democratic leadership has said, ``You cannot \nbring this bill up unless you take out in advance provisions we object \nto.'' Let me tell you what one of those provisions is--in fact, the key \none. The conference has language that reverses the President's, in my \nopinion unconstitutional, act to reverse the Court's decisions on \nstriker replacement. I believe most of the American people agree with \nthe Republicans on this issue. But I say, let us bring it up, offer the \namendment and let us vote. But we are being told, no, you cannot even \nvote on it. So that one strictly resides in the hands of the Senate \nbecause they will not allow the bill to be brought up and voted on.\n  Let me talk about the bills that the President can sign. They include \nCommerce, and within the Department of Commerce, you have the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Maritime Administration, \nFederal Communications Commission, the Small Business Administration, \nand the National Weather Service.\n  Sign the bill, Mr. President, and all those agencies will be back at \nwork in the morning.\n  The Justice Department. This includes the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and \nNaturalization, and Federal prisons. Sign the bill, Mr. President, and \nput those agencies back to work.\n  The State Department. We all know what that does.\n  Veterans Department. If the President will sign the bill on his desk, \nthe veterans' activities will go forward full steam.\n  Interior Department, including the Forest Service, Indian Health \nServices, and the Smithsonian. All the President has to do is sign the \nbill on his desk.\n  In all of these agencies that I have just been listing, the President \nhas no problem with what is in these bills. He probably wants more \nspending in each category because that is the construction of the \nproblem. He wants more money spent. Never before in the years I have \nbeen in the Senate, or in the Congress, for that matter, have I seen a \nsituation where the President wants to veto appropriations bills \nbecause they do not spend enough money.\n  In the past, Presidents have vetoed appropriations bills because the \nCongress' insatiable appetite to spend more of the taxpayers' money \ncould not be controlled. Now we have one where the President says, \n``Send me bills with more spending.'' It is a unique experience we are \nhaving.\n  Independent agencies: Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, National Aeronautics and Space, and the National \nScience Foundation. All of these independent agencies have funding. We \nhave agreed to language. It is on the President's desk.\n  Sign the bills, Mr. President, and all of these agencies will be put \nright to work. What are we talking about in terms of the number of \nemployees?\n  I have here a chart that shows the number of employees we are talking \nabout. Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary involves this number of \nemployees: 194,000 Federal employees; almost 200,000 people. Mr. \nPresident, 102,000 at Justice, 25,000 at Commerce, 28,000 that run \nJudiciary, 25,000 at State Department, 5,800 at SBA, and 8,000 at USIA, \nfor a total of 194,000 Federal employees just affected by Commerce, \nJustice, State, and Judiciary.\n  VA-HUD. NASA has 20,000; National Science Foundation, 2,000; \nVeterans, 240,000; HUD, 11,000. By the way, I understand about 98 \npercent of the employees at HUD are considered nonessential--\nnonessential, 98 percent. There are not a whole lot of the employees \nthat are actually affected by this bill. It would get those back to \nwork, anyway. The Environmental Protection Agency and others, 20,000, \nfor a total of 293,000 affected by the VA-HUD appropriations bill now \non President's desk.\n  The Interior Department, 76,000 employees--seems like an awful lot to \nme; Indian Health Care, 15,500; Forest Administration, 38,000; Energy \nDepartment, 2,300, and 2,000 others, for a total of 133,800. You see \npart of the problem with the Federal Government: Look how many people \nyou are talking about working for the Federal Government--almost \n621,000 just affected by these departments.\n  Interestingly, too, is, why is the President objecting to the \nInterior appropriations bill? One, I am sure he wants more money. He \nwants more money for everything, of course. The thing they point to \nthat they object to--get this--the big fight has been over how much \ntimber footage would be allowed to be cut in Alaska in the Tongass \narea. There has been a long battle over what the agreement should be, \nbut both sides have worked very diligently and reasonable people came \nup with an agreement between the Senators from Alaska and those in the \nHouse that might have some concerns about the number of board feet that \nis being cut.\n  Then there is some problem with the Columbia River basin. I do not \nknow exactly what it is, but I emphasize it involves how much timber \ncan be cut in Alaska. Does the President want to shut down the \nWashington Monument and Carlsbad Caverns because he wants a few hundred \nthousand less board feet of timber cut in Alaska? Give me a break. The \nnews media are running around and saying, ``Oh, the parks are closed \ndown.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues in the Senate, talking about a \nmonument being shut down so terribly trivializes what is at stake here. \nWhat we are talking about is trying to control the size of spending of \nthe Federal Government. We are talking about trying to balance the \nFederal budget. We all know it needs to happen. This is important. You \nare talking about the Federal Government--what it does, how much to \nspend, taxes on the people--for the next 7 years. So it is important \nthat we get control of the Federal budget and do it in such a way that \nmore jobs will be created, inflation will stay under control, so that \ninterest rates will fall. We are talking about future generations. We \nare talking about the future of my son and daughter and the sons and \ndaughters of all of us. Yes, we are talking about my mother, but we are \nalso talking about what will be the situation 7 years from now.\n  This is big. This is really important. The news media runs around \nsaying, ``Oh, the monument is closed.'' We are talking about billions \nof dollars. We have those saying, ``I cannot get in to the monument.'' \nI think that we should be focusing on what we are really trying to \naccomplish here. This is serious. It is important. It is big. Do not \nmiss the point. The President, with three strokes of the pen today with \nbills on his desk, can put almost 621,000 Federal employees to work. \nShould they be working if they are going to get paid? Absolutely, they \nshould.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize again that the people need to look at what \nis really happening here. I see the latest wire service story says the \nPresident plans to veto today three bills covering Natural Resources, \nVeterans Affairs, Housing, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \nState. He says the spending cuts are too large. Yet, if you look at \nthese bills over the next several years or 7 years, they will all go \nup. They will all go up. Only in Washington when you control the rate \nof increase is it called a cut.\n  The President can solve this problem, ladies and gentlemen. It is not \nthe fault of the Congress. Just sign the bills, Mr. President. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is conducting morning business \nuntil 11:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ncontinue as in morning business for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18792-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18793-S18795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VETO PROTECTS OVERTURNING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the statement of my \nfriend from Mississippi, and I appreciate his rhetoric and his ability \nto state his position. I think of the expression oft used in summations \nbefore the jury, taken in a light most favorable in favor of the \nopponent. One has to take his statement in the light most favorable to \nthe opponent. The fact of the matter is that the President is right to \nveto a number of the pieces of legislation before him, not because of a \nquestion of \n\n[[Page S18794]]\nspending, but because of a question of legislation being overturned, \nlegislation that was put together by bipartisan majorities over the \nyears.\n  I use one example. In EPA, one of the bills, basically what the so-\ncalled Republican Contract With America has done is cut out the \nenforcement arm of EPA. They know that they cannot stand up here and \npass legislation to repeal our clean water laws. They cannot pass \nlegislation to repeal our clean air laws. Those were laws put together \nby a majority of Republicans and Democrats working together over the \nyears.\n  So what do they do? Instead of repealing them, which they cannot do, \nthey simply say we will not enforce them. What they are saying is, ``Go \nahead and pollute; we don't give a hoot.'' They have changed the whole \nidea around. What they are saying, it is the same thing as if they said \nwe will not do away with the law against burglary, but we will not \nallow you to put any locks on your doors; we will not let you put any \nguards at your warehouses; we will have no police officers patrol the \nstreets; and we will not answer a call when somebody sees a moving van \nin the back of your warehouse at 3 o'clock in the morning unloading the \nwarehouse. We will say we have not done away with the laws of burglary, \nwe will just not enforce them.\n  Back just a few years ago, the Cuyahoga River was on fire because of \npollution. That does not occur today. What they are saying, however, is \nwe will not enforce those laws because some of our largest contributors \ndo not like them. We will not enforce the laws that keep the Cuyahoga \nRiver or the Winooski River in Vermont, to keep them clean.\n  We talk about our children. Our children deserve clean water. Our \nchildren deserve clean air. It is certainly going to keep down our \nhealth costs. We should not, in the guise of budgetary things, do away \nwith this.\n  It makes me think, for example, of some of the same--in this new \nbreed, especially in the House, new breed of Republicans, when they \nspoke of patriotism and honor and flag and everything else, but they \npassed quickly and quietly in the dark of the night a tax bill which \nsaid that if you are one of these billionaires who is willing to stand \nup and renounce your country, renounce the United States of America, \nrenounce the greatest democracy on Earth, we will give you one hell of \na tax break.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is those things. Somebody once said the Devil \nis in the details. The Devil is at work in the details of some of these \nbills. These bills should be talking about our spending priorities. \nEverybody on this side of the aisle, and I suspect everybody on that \nside of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, agree that we want to \nbalance the budget in as short a time as possible. But, in doing it, \nlet us not repeal laws that the vast majority of Americans, Republicans \nor Democrats, agree on. Let us not repeal our commitment to good \neducation for our children. Let us not repeal our commitment to clean \nair and clean water under the guise of this. And let us not give away \nthese special tax breaks which say if you stand up and renounce your \ncountry we are going to give you a special tax break. That is \nridiculous.\n\n  We see an example, one person took advantage of this to move down to \nBelize, because he always liked Belize. However, he said, he gave them \nsome money so they would establish a consulate in his home town in \nFlorida, with the idea he could then still live in Florida and not have \nto go to Belize, but he would get this multibillion-dollar tax break. \nFortunately, the State Department stopped that.\n  What I suggest is it is time to go back to basics on this. I see \npeople talking across each other. I have said over and over again--I \nsaid this this summer--we are not going to pass a Gingrich budget, we \nare not going to pass a Dole budget, a Daschle budget, a Leahy budget \nor a Clinton budget. But working together we might pass one. It is \ngoing to require the Speaker of the House to stand up to his new \nfreshman class and tell them that we certainly value the experience \nthey have gained in 11 months in office but that there are a lot of \nothers in Government, too, in both parties, who also have experience. \nSome have even more than 11 months.\n  It is time to get together. I suggest to them, they may want to look \nat the dictionary. This is a dictionary and I will read what it says \nabout negotiating. It says to negotiate means:\n\n       To arrange for or bring about through conference, \n     discussion and compromise.\n\n  If they do not understand the word ``compromise,'' I have that here, \ntoo. Compromise means:\n\n       A settlement of differences by arbitration or by consent \n     reached by mutual concessions.\n\n  Compromise and negotiation does not mean that one side simply says we \nwill walk away from the table unless you agree to everything before we \neven start our negotiation. Unfortunately that happened last week.\n  The President of the United States is not going to be ordered by a \ngroup of freshman House Republicans--is not going to be ordered to just \ncome in here and give up everything that he believes in and everything \nhe was elected for. The President of the United States, as well as the \nDemocratic leadership in the House and the Senate, have said they will \nsit down and they are willing to negotiate on every single item. But \nthey are not willing to give away all their points before the \nnegotiation even starts.\n  When I was in private practice of law I negotiated many, many a case. \nYou come in, each with all your positions intact. Then when you sit \ndown you start dealing out and saying I can give up on this but you can \ngive up on that. There is an art of compromise involved.\n  I have served here, twice in the majority, twice in the minority. I \nhave been chairman or ranking member of significant committees and \nsubcommittees. I have gone through a number of committees of \nconference. Of course you start out with differences. But you sit down. \nYou do not walk away from the table. You sit down to work them out. \nMost recently in the foreign operations bill we started out with 193 \ndifferences with the other body. We negotiated agreements on 192. We \nhave been held up on one, which has become more a difference of \npolemics and not of substance; of symbols and not substance; of \nrhetoric and not reality.\n\n  What have we come to? This is not the way to run the Government. This \nis not what people want to see. They want to see our Government run, \nthey want to see our tax dollars well spent, they want to see the \nbudget deficit come down. They would like to see us stop acting like \nchildren. They would like to see us get together as men and women \nelected to run this great country. It is the greatest democracy on \nEarth. It is the largest economy on Earth, the most powerful nation on \nEarth, one with worldwide responsibilities as well as responsibilities \nto our people. Let us come back and make it work.\n  The President has helped in the way he can, over the weekend, on \nLIHEAP, emergency heating aid to those in the northern parts of our \ncountry like my own State of Vermont, where it is extremely cold. But \nthese are little things. What we need to do is bring together the big \nthings that make it possible so the President does not have to. Why \nemergency help on something we had all agreed should be done under the \nregular routine? Let us come together, let us come together on the big \nissues of Medicare and Medicaid, on nutrition, on education, on \ndefense. We can do it. But we are going to do it only when we learn, \nwhen we go back to the dictionary and say compromise is a ``settlement \nof differences * * * by consent reached by mutual concessions.'' \nConcessions by Republicans, concessions by Democrats; concessions by \nthe Congress, concessions by the President. It can be done. It is not \ngoing to be done if we want to make rhetorical debating points. It can \nbe done if we really believe in upholding our oath of office and \nhelping this country.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S18795]]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Dr. \nRichard Halverson. To many in this body, he was a spiritual leader. To \nothers, he was a counselor. To me, he was both of those and he was also \na friend.\n  I got to know Dick Halverson when he responded to my pleas for help \nwith the Missouri Prayer Breakfast. Despite his hectic schedule, he \nhelped and encouraged me in developing the Missouri Governor's Student \nLeadership Conference on Faith and Values in Leadership. His display of \nkindness and love was remarkable. Even more remarkable, however, was \nthat this was not remarkable--it was just the way Dick was.\n  Dick's legacy will be a lasting one. Words written during his life \nendure and will serve as inspirational challenges not only to us, but \nto those yet to be born. A family nurtured by this father, husband, and \ngrandfather will bear a continuing witness to his love. And the \ncountless lives that he touched and influenced and saved help make this \nworld a better place and heaven a more crowded place.\n  What is the measure of man's life? Richard Halverson knew the answer. \nA man's life is measured by how much he loves God and how deeply he \ncares for those that God has put around him. Dick's life was a full \none--measured great by any standard of earthly success--counted great \nby the one opinion that counts. For Dick lived life and lived it \nabundantly, knowing what was important and what was not. I will miss \nDick, but I will also rejoice at all God did through him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18793-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 1530, an act to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe \n     military personnel strengths for fiscal year 1996, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the conference \nreport on the Department of Defense authorization bill, I want to make \njust a few opening comments.\n  As I indicated earlier, it has been long and arduous process, but we \nhave a sound bill that supports our national security and the \nobjectives we set early in the year.\n  As in every conference there had to be some give and take. I have no \ndoubt that there are provisions in this bill that may be objectionable \nto some. There are provisions that I would rather not have in a defense \nbill. However, we must judge this bill as a whole, not by individual \nprovisions. If you make an objective evaluation of the bill, I am \nconfident you will come to the conclusion that all our efforts paid \noff. We provided for the readiness of the force both for the near term \nand in the out years. We provided for the welfare of our soldiers and \ntheir families. We provided the Department of Defense with the tools to \neffectively manage and streamline the acquisition of weapons systems \nand equipment.\n  Despite our efforts to reach accommodation on all issues with the \nadministration, they have indicated they will oppose the bill. \nThroughout the day we will address many of the objections and I believe \nwe have a strong case to refute these objections.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and participate in this \ndebate. The Senate and the Nation have a great stake in this bill, \nespecially now that our forces are deploying to Bosnia. Mr. President, \nthe House passed this conference report by an overwhelming vote of 269 \nto 149, I urge the Senate to do no less.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, although we have reached agreement with \nSenator Leahy on the landmine provision, I would like to respond to \nremarks made by the Senator from Vermont regarding a provision that \nwould impose a moratorium on landmines that was included in the Senate \nDefense authorization bill.\n  When the Senator from Vermont introduced his provision in the \nChamber, I, along with Senators Nunn and Warner, raised objections to \nhis provision. The provision would express the sense of the Congress \nwith regard to a treaty review conference on conventional weapons, \nsanction foreign governments that export antipersonnel landmines, and \nit would impose a moratorium on the defensive use of antipersonnel \nlandmines by U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, the portion of the provision that caused us such grave \nconcern was that portion that would place a moratorium on U.S. Armed \nForces use of antipersonnel landmines for defensive purposes.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand the Department of Justice raised objections to this provision and \nspecifically the portion of the provision that would place a moratorium \non the use of antipersonnel landmines by the U.S. Armed Forces for \ndefensive purposes.\n  Specifically, DOD and the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly opposed the \nprovision because it would have a detrimental impact on the ability of \nthe military forces to protect themselves and require the removal of \nmine fields emplaced in demilitarized zones. The Department of Justice \nopposed the inclusion of this provision because it is their view that \nit is a serious infringement on the President's authority as Commander \nin Chief, stating, ``* * * the Congress may decide upon the weapons \navailable to the President, it may not dictate how those weapons are to \nbe used in military operations.''\n  Throughout the conference the House objected to this provision. The \nSenate defended the provision of the Senator from Vermont. At the same \ntime, there were discussions with the House of the need to obtain a \nreport from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the impact of a moratorium on \nthe defensive use of antipersonnel and antitank mines. Additionally, \nthe House asked that prior to the implementation of a moratorium, that \nthe Secretary of Defense certify that the moratorium would not \nadversely affect U.S. military capabilities, and that there were \nadequate substitutes.\n  Mr. President, I would point out that the Senator's provision is in \nthe fiscal year 1996 foreign operations appropriations conference \nreport. After the foreign operations appropriations conference report \nwas agreed to, with this provision in it, the Senator from Vermont came \nto me and asked that the committee drop his provision from the Defense \nbill. Based on his request, the Senate conferees dropped the landmine \nmoratorium provision from the bill. However, the committee retained the \nreport requirement. I do not understand why the Senator from Vermont \n\n[[Page S18796]]\nwould not want to have a report submitted to the Congress about the \nimpact of his provision, or, for that matter, why he would not want \nassurances from the Secretary of Defense, that his provision would not \ndetrimentally impact on the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to defend \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, in his remarks on the Senate floor on the deployment \nof United States Armed Forces to Bosnia, the Senator from Vermont \nraised concerns about the great number of landmines that are in and \naround Bosnia. I might point out that this conference report contains \n$20 million for humanitarian demining activities, and $20 million that \nwould provide for advanced detection systems to find mines, so they do \nnot pose such a great threat to our Armed Forces, and the forces of our \nallies, as well as innocent women and children. These provisions would \nbe lost if the conference report is not adopted.\n  Mr. President, I hope common sense will prevail in this matter and \nthat the Senate will approve this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I know the chairman is on the floor and \nprepared to enter into debate or discussion, whatever. There may be \nMembers opposed to the conference report. If they would like to speak, \nwe would like to have them come to the floor and do that. As I \nunderstand, we are not able to get a consent agreement on when the vote \nwill come. We hope it will be tomorrow morning.\n  I know today is a holiday, so there will be no votes today, and I \nknow that tends to increase the absentee rolls.\n  In any event, I am going to recess subject to the call of the Chair, \nand we will stay in touch with the chairman of the committee. If there \nare those who desire to speak on this matter, they can certainly be \nable to come back into session very quickly.\n  Before I do that, I will say the President has now vetoed this \nmorning the Interior appropriations bill and the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill. What he said to the 133,000 Federal workers who are covered by \nthe Interior appropriations bill is, ``You can't come to work.''\n  What he said to the 293,000 Federal employees that are covered by the \nVA-HUD bill is that ``You can't come to work.'' And later today, I \nunderstand he will say to 194,000 Federal workers who are covered by \nJustice, State, Commerce, that, ``You can't come to work.''\n\n  With the stroke of a pen, all of these Federal employees could have \nbeen back to work today. They could have been back to work yesterday or \nthe day before and we would not have had a shutdown for that many, \nbecause he has had the bills on his desk.\n  I always said until the Congress sent him the bills, we had to share \nthe blame. But he has had these bills and he has vetoed them with some \nof the usual rhetoric coming from the White House these days, \nsurrounded by little children saying we were about to endanger the \nlives of millions of children with the toxic waste dumps and all the \nexaggerated rhetoric they can think of in the White House. The result \nis that people, Federal employees, right before the holidays, are not \ngoing to be able to go back to their work because of President \nClinton's veto. That is all it is. He had the bills. He could have \nsigned the bills and the people would have been working and assured \nnothing would happen until the end of the fiscal year next October.\n  So I am disappointed that President Clinton is again playing politics \ninstead of looking at the policy. It seems to me that he is making \nmatters more and more difficult. He refuses to talk seriously about a \n7-year balanced budget which most Americans would like to accomplish, \nand now he is vetoing appropriations bills which would put Federal \nworkers back on the job because he said the cuts are too deep.\n  Again, it is the same old deception: Scare the American people, scare \nthe children, scare the senior citizens, scare the veterans, tell \neverybody the sky is falling in, do not talk about the balanced budget, \ndo not talk about the fact we would lower interest rates 2 percent. It \nmeans you would pay less for a student loan, a car loan, farm loan, \nmachinery loan, whatever.\n  These are the advantages of a balanced budget over 7 years. That is \nwhy Republicans are insisting, because we believe most Americans, \nregardless of party, want us to balance the budget. In fact, most do \nnot understand why it is going to take 7 years. They would rather do it \nin 3, 4, 1, or 2 or 5 or 6. But we have agreed on 7 years. The \nPresident has agreed on 7 years.\n  But ever since he agreed on that some 27 days ago, he has been \nbacking away from it, confusing the American people with different \nnumbers and different scenarios. I really believe unless we can \naccomplish something serious by Friday, it is probably not going to \nhappen this year.\n  I am not in a position to announce the schedule for the balance of \nthe year, but the balance of the year is about here.\n  New Year's Eve is not far off. I assume we will be here because we \nhave a number of items we would like to take up. We do want to get to \nthe budget agreement yet this year. I do not believe it will ever \nhappen unless the President--who is the President--exerts the \nleadership and calls the majority leader of the Senate and the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives and asks us to come to the White House \nand sit down, without staff, without press, and say, OK, let us work \nthis out, let us agree to some parameters, the three of us, and let us \nhave other people come in and put the details together. If he would do \nthat, I think we can probably make some progress.\n  We have waited now for several days. The President certainly could \nfind a telephone when he had a problem with Bosnia. He knew how to \nreach a lot of us. I wish he could use the same determination when it \ncomes to balancing the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18796-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I will reluctantly be voting against the \nDefense authorization bill--reluctant, because I know of the hard work \nwhich many Members, particularly the majority side, put in on this \nbill, the fact that this is the first Defense bill under the leadership \nand the guidance of our chairman, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  I will vote against the bill for reasons which I will set forth this \nafternoon. A few months ago when I voted against the Senate version of \nthe bill, I said that the bill was out of step with our real security \nrequirements. The conference report is even worse in that regard, and \nit is worse in a number of ways which I will illuminate in the next few \nminutes.\n  It is not a good-government bill. It is not a responsible bill. It is \nnot arrived at in the bipartisan fashion that has long characterized \nlegislation in this area. The Senate should reject it, and if it goes \nto the President he should veto it. As a matter of fact, I have been \ninformed that he will veto it.\n  The conference report is out of step with the priorities of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, the President, and I believe \nthe Nation. It is as fiscally irresponsible as the Senate bill was, and \nthe conference made \n\n[[Page S18797]]\nit worse, authorizing more weapons not requested by the Pentagon and \nadding provisions that I believe are bad-government provisions.\n  The Senate version of this bill, at least, did not contain funding \nfor more B-2 bombers; it did not contain funding for F-16's and F-15 \nfighters because the Pentagon did not request them, does not need them, \nand cannot afford them, but the conference report funds these three \nitems alone for a total of more than $1 billion. There is no plan to \npay for the bow wave that these programs would create in future years, \nand there is no money to pay for them. That does not even count the \nover $2 billion added for just two ships not requested by the Defense \nDepartment, nor does it include numerous other examples of excessive \nand unrequested spending.\n  One area I will highlight a little later is ballistic missile \ndefense. This was the most contentious effort in the conference and one \nwhich I believe has the most profound security consequences for our \nNation. I am sorry that this conference report contains an outcome that \nis unwarranted, unwise, and unacceptable. It would require, if adopted \nand if it became law, the United States to deploy a national defense \nsystem--I emphasize the word ``deploy''--by the year 2003, without \nconsideration of the threat, without consideration of what the military \neffectiveness of such a system would be after it is developed, without \nconsideration of what it might cost after its development, without \nconsideration of what its impact might be on United States-Russian \nrelations at the time of a deployment decision.\n  This conference report requires us, now, to commit ourselves to \ndeploy an ABM system. Now, that decision is going to jeopardize our \nrelationship with Russia. It is going to jeopardize the nuclear weapons \nreductions which are required in the START II Treaty.\n  First, however, let me spend a few minutes on the B-2 bomber. The \noriginal Senate position, which was based on a strong bipartisan vote, \nwas to provide no additional funds for more B-2 bombers. There were no \nadditional funds for the B-2's, and the appropriations bills in the \nSenate had no additional authorization for the B-2's.\n\n  Does that mean there was overwhelming House support for adding B-2 \nbombers? Not really. The House barely had a majority in separate votes \nfor more money for the B-2's, but there it is in the conference \nreport--more money for B-2 bombers.\n  The $500 million in the conference report for additional B-2 money is \njust the downpayment on a program which will eventually cost more than \n$30 billion. That money will have to come out of other programs that \nare of a higher priority to our Defense Department. Both Secretary \nPerry and General Shalikashvili have been very clear on that point.\n  The ill-advised conference item on the B-2's is in spite of the fact \nthat the Pentagon issued two separate and comprehensive reports, both \nof which demonstrated that we do not need more than 20 B-2's, and our \nlimited funds would be more wisely spent on precision-guided munitions \nfor our planned fleet of bombers and our tactical aircraft.\n  The industrial base study made it clear that even if we stop \nproducing B-2's now, we would be able to produce them again in the \nfuture if it were deemed necessary at some future time, but that is \ndeemed unlikely. There is no need to keep a production line warm. We \ncan reinstate production in the future, we were told by the study, \nshould the need arise. We put a downpayment of $500 million on a $30 \nbillion program that the Pentagon has not asked for, does not need, and \ncannot afford.\n  In the area of ships and submarines, the conference report actions in \nthose areas are also objectionable. For reasons that are unknown to any \nDemocrats, as far as I know, on the Armed Services Committee, the \nmajority decided to create a special congressional panel just to \nconsider submarine issues. That strikes me as being unwise and almost \nbizarre.\n  The Armed Services Committee already considers all areas of the \ndefense budget, weapon systems, including submarines, in its normal \noversight process. There is no need to establish a new congressional \npanel to look at submarines. If we can work on a bipartisan and \ncooperative manner, we will get the job done in the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have done it in the past, and there is no reason we \ncannot do it on submarines. We do not need a new panel to take a look \njust at submarines the way the conference report provides.\n  The conference report earmarks the shipbuilding and ship maintenance \nwork in a totally unacceptable way. We are throwing out standards of \ncompetition, cost effectiveness, and good government when we do this \nkind of earmarking. We will be wasting taxpayers' money because we \ndispense with standard safeguards for fiscal responsibility and \nprocurement. There is no excuse for us to do that other than it is \npolitically easier to do that, to divide it up here, but in terms of \nthe competition which gets us the better price, what we have done is \nbypassed the usual procurement rules and earmarked money in this area.\n\n  The conference report also represents a setback when it earmarked the \nNational Guard and Reserve equipment procurement money. This year, in \nmarked contrast to previous years, the conference report specified \nexactly what equipment the Guard and the Reserve shall buy. This was \nthe opposite of what the committee originally voted to do, but it \nreversed itself during the committee deliberations.\n  Our committee led a good-government initiative over the last several \nyears to move away from the earmarking of Guard and Reserve equipment \nby using generic categories of equipment that would ensure that the \nPentagon and the Guard could buy the items that best fit their \npriorities and requirements rather than having to accept the equipment \nshown, often on the basis of home State interest of the Members of \nCongress.\n  Last year, our Armed Services Committee was totally generic when it \ncame to buying equipment for the Reserve and the Guard. This year, we \nmarked the equipment. Now, in the past this was an area of tension \nbetween the authorization committee, which was trying to stay generic, \nand the Appropriations Committee, which was specifying its preferences. \nThis year the roles were reversed. The Appropriations Committee did the \nright thing this year, used generic categories, while the authorizer, \nour committee, reverted to earmarking equipment.\n  I hope the Armed Services Committee will reconsider this approach and \nbe persuaded to return to the good-government approach, which is the \ngeneric approach, which will avoid the temptation which we all face of \nearmarking these purchases in ways that benefit our own home state \nGuard and Reserve or our home State industrial base.\n  Now, it was a curious issue in our committee deliberations because a \nbipartisan majority of the committee Members originally favored going \nthe generic route, and we voted to do so. But on a party-line vote, the \nmajority decided to choose specific equipment items, and that was done \ndespite the fact that the National Guard bureau made it clear that it \nprefers the generic approach so it can meet its most pressing needs.\n  I met with General Baca, chief of the National Guard Bureau, to make \nsure that I was clear on this point, and he reinforced the point that \ntheir preference is to have these authorizations and appropriations \nmade on a generic basis.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor that we stay with the generic \napproach of the last few years, and I think that before the vote came \nup, we were very close to a bipartisan agreement that we do this on a \ngeneric basis. But, at the last minute, that approach was not adopted. \nI hope the Armed Services Committee does return to the generic \napproach, despite the temptations of doing earmarking which, again, I \nthink all of us--or most of us--can understand.\n  Now, on ballistic missile defense, I want to focus on these \nprovisions just a little longer because they are so significant to our \nsecurity and because the provisions in the conference report are such a \ndeparture from what the Senate has already adopted by a wide margin. \nThe ballistic missile defense provisions alone warrant a veto, and the \nPresident has said that he will veto this bill, in part because of the \nballistic missile defense provisions. The conference report before us \ncontains the \n\n[[Page S18798]]\nfollowing provisions that are unacceptable. These are some of the \nunacceptable provisions.\n  First, ``It is the policy of the United States * * * to deploy a \nNational Missile Defense System.''\n  Second, the conference report mandates that the national missile \ndefense system ``shall achieve an initial operational capability by the \nend of 2003.''\n  Those are the words in the conference report. So it would commit us \nto deploy a system and to do so by the year 2003, and both of those \ncommitments are significantly different from what we decided to do in \nthe Senate and what we did in the Senate on a very strong, bipartisan \nvote. In the Senate bill, which was the result of literally weeks of \neffort, discussions and negotiations, what we said we would do would be \nto develop, so that later on we could determine whether or not to \ndeploy, a national missile defense system. We did not set the date for \nthe initial operating capability, the IOC. What we said is that \nCongress would, prior to any decision to deploy, participate in the \ndecision as to whether or not we would deploy that system.\n  In the making the decision, we could take many things into \nconsideration which we now do not know. What would be the cost of such \na system? How militarily effective would it be? What would the threat \nbe at that time? What would the impact be on United States-Russian \nrelations, including the impact on the ABM Treaty? And what would the \nprospects be at the deployment decision point after this were developed \nfor that purpose--what would the impact be on the antiballistic missile \nagreement?\n  All those things, critical security issues involving relationships \nwith the other country that has a larger number of nuclear weapons, \nincluding the military effectiveness, including what the cost would be, \nincluding what the threat would be, all of those critical items of \ninformation not now available would be available at the time a decision \nwere made later whether or not to deploy the missile defense system.\n  In order to put ourselves in a position where we could make that \ndecision on an intelligent basis, we would develop a national missile \ndefense system. What this conference report does is it makes it the \npolicy of the United States to deploy and to deploy by a particular \nyear, regardless of what the threat might be at the time when we are in \na position to deploy, regardless of how much it costs us at that point, \nregardless what the impact is on United States-Russian relations, \nregardless of whether or not it destroys the START II agreement under \nwhich thousands of nuclear warheads are being dismantled.\n\n  This conference report, in that regard, it seems to me, not only \njeopardizes our security but violates some basic common sense.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee just reported out by a unanimous vote \na strong resolution on ratification of the START II agreement. That \nSTART II agreement, which we are going to be voting on in the Senate in \nthe next few days, can achieve the reduction of thousands of nuclear \nwarheads that otherwise do provide a horrific threat to the United \nStates. It is clearly in our security interests to secure those \nreductions in nuclear weapons which for decades threatened our \nsecurity. It is clearly in our interest to eliminate some of the most \ndangerous nuclear systems from the cold war era.\n  About 4,000 Russian nuclear warheads would be eliminated so they will \nnever become a threat to us again. Then, we will not have to rely on a \nballistic missile defense system to shoot down that number of Russian \nwarheads in flight, but, rather, those warheads would be eliminated, \nremoved from their weapons systems, dismantled, and the nuclear \nmaterial disposed of. They will never be part of an arsenal which can \nthreaten us. That is a security guarantee that no ballistic missile \ndefense system could ever achieve at any cost.\n  So, eliminating nuclear weapons, thousands of nuclear warheads under \narms control treaties like START II is cost effective, it is certain, \nit guarantees an enhancement to our security, unlike the effort to \nbuild a defensive shield against those missiles, particularly if the \ncommitment to build such a defense would violate a treaty that is \nessential for the passage of the START II Treaty in Russia.\n  We have been told directly by Russian parliamentarians, we have been \ntold by the Russian Government, that if we jeopardize the ABM Treaty, \nif we threaten to deploy a system in violation of an agreement which \nhas provided security to both sides and which they feel is significant \nto them, that it is unlikely they will ratify the START II agreement in \ntheir legislative body, their Duma.\n  We have been told that. We read about it, but we also have been told \npersonally by Russian parliamentarians that if we jeopardize the ABM \nTreaty, we cannot expect them to ratify the START II agreement which \nwill reduce the number of nuclear weapons if they are going to have to \nface defenses, if they ever were in a position where they were attacked \nand felt they had to use these weapons. That is what the ABM Treaty is \nall about. Whether you like the ABM Treaty or you do not like the ABM \nTreaty, or whether we should modify it through negotiations or not \nmodify it through negotiations in order to permit the deployment of a \ndefensive system, what seems very likely--and I will say factual, or \nalmost certainly factual--is that that Russian Duma is not going to \nreduce the number of their weapons and not ratify START II if we commit \nourselves to deploy a defensive system.\n  We have been trying to get the START II Treaty voted on in this body \nprior to the time the Senate adjourns for the year. Many of us have \nactively sought to get the START II Treaty on the floor of this Senate \nfor a vote this week. I think we are going to succeed. The majority \nleader has made a commitment that we will vote on the ratification of \nSTART II. I believe that commitment is that he will bring that \nagreement, that treaty to the floor this week, prior to adjournment, if \nmy memory serves me correctly.\n  This was after a long delay where the treaty languished in the \nForeign Relations Committee for a number of unrelated reasons. This is \na Christmas gift to this Nation, if we can ratify START II.\n  We could reduce by thousands the weapons in the inventory of each \nside if we could just get START II ratified here and if we can get it \nratified there. I am confident that the Senate is going to give its \nadvice and consent to ratify the START II Treaty because it is so \nclearly in our national interest to do so. But if we ratify here and \nthe Russians do not ratify it because at the same time we are ratifying \nSTART II, we are threatening the ABM Treaty's existence through this \nconference report language which says we will deploy--and it is the \npolicy of the United States to deploy--a system which violates the \ntreaty which they believe is essential in order for them to reduce the \nnumber of weapons in their inventory, we are doing two inconsistent \nthings in the same week: We would be ratifying START II here but \njeopardizing the ratification of START II over in Russia.\n  As Senator Nunn has pointed out, the provisions on the National \nMissile Defense that are in this conference report were beyond the \nscope of any legislation that was passed by the House or the Senate. \nBoth the House and the Senate in their defense authorization bill \npassed language which contains ballistic missile defense provisions, \nbut they are not the provisions in the conference report.\n  The Senate bill had provisions that were carefully crafted after a \ngreat deal of hard work by a bipartisan group of negotiators. Again, \nthe Senate bill said that we would develop a system--we would develop a \nsystem with emphasis on the word ``develop''--for deployment and that \nCongress would have a chance to review the program prior to a decision \nto deploy it--emphasis on the words ``prior to'' and ``decision to \ndeploy.''\n  In that review by Congress, we would look at cost, operational \neffectiveness, the threat on the implications of the ABM Treaty and on \nUnited States-Russian relations. Our Senate bill also said that the \nprogram should be conducted in conformance with the ABM Treaty. That \npackage was accepted by the Senate by a vote of 85 to 13. Only one \nRepublican voted against it. The majority leader voted for it. The \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee voted for it. Every Republican \nbut one, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, voted for that \nconference report. We \n\n[[Page S18799]]\ngot a product that was supported by a large majority of this body and \nby the President.\n  I was one of the four negotiators. We reviewed every word in that \nnegotiated product very, very carefully. It took, as I mentioned, \nweeks--offers, counter offers, debate, and exchanges of documents. We \nfinally came up with a compromise. Eighty-five Senators voted for it.\n  What happened in conference is that, first, the majority leader wrote \na letter saying that he supported language which would require us to \ndeploy. That certainly was, I think, almost unprecedented--that the \nmajority leader who picked the negotiators, or, at least, if he did not \npick each negotiator, was the one that urged we go down that road to \nnegotiations, and then voted for the negotiated product, but then after \nthe negotiated product was adopted by the Senate wrote a letter to the \nconferees saying, do not support the product of the U.S. Senate and \ninstead require the deployment of a missile system.\n  I was very disappointed, and not just about the authority view on the \nconferees in deciding that they were going to commit themselves to \ndeploy, but I was frankly disappointed in our majority leader in \nwriting that letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nstating that the conference must result in a commitment to deploy the \nballistic missile defense system and to mandate a deployment of a \nmultisite BMD system by the year 2003.\n  Many times during these negotiations and discussions in conference, \nSenator Nunn urged that the best basis for reaching an agreement with \nthe House would be to start with a Senate-passed bipartisan compromise, \nbut those suggestions were not accepted.\n  That is how we ended up where we are with this bill. It contains some \nprovisions that are totally unacceptable to, I think, almost all of the \nDemocrats and I believe also to some Republicans about the ballistic \nmissile defense requiring deployment of a system of unknown cost, \nunknown impact on United States-Russian relations, unknown military \neffectiveness, and requiring deployment of that kind of a system by the \nyear 2003 against the threat which our intelligence community does not \neven believe will materialize at least in this decade.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time that the full statement of \nadministration policy dated December 15 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Statement of Administration Policy.\n       (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the \n     concerned agencies.) December 15, 1995 (Senate)\n       H.R. 1530--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1996 Conference Report.\n       Senators Thurmond (R) SC and Nunn (D) GA.\n       If the Conference Report on H.R. 1530 were presented to the \n     President in its current form, the President would veto the \n     bill.\n       The Conference Report on H.R. 1530, filed on December 15, \n     1995, would restrict the Administration's ability to carry \n     out our national security objectives and implement key \n     Administration programs. Certain provisions also raise \n     serious constitutional issues by restricting the President's \n     powers as Commander-in-Chief and foreign policy powers.\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) deployment decision now, the bill would \n     needlessly incur tens of billions of dollars in missile \n     defense costs and force the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     prematurely to lock into a specific technological option. In \n     addition, by directing that the NMD be ``operationally \n     effective'' in defending all 50 states (including Hawaii and \n     Alaska), the bill would likely require a multiple-site NMD \n     architecture that cannot be accommodated within the terms of \n     the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting U.S. policy on a \n     collision course with the ABM Treaty, the bill puts at risk \n     continued Russian implementation of the START I Treaty and \n     Russian ratification of START II, two treaties which \n     together will reduce the number of U.S. and Russian \n     strategic nuclear warheads by two-thirds from Cold War \n     levels, significantly lowering the threat to U.S. national \n     security.\n       The bill also imposes restrictions on the President's \n     ability to conduct contingency operations that are essential \n     to the national interest. The restrictions on funding to \n     commence a contingency operations and the requirement to \n     submit a supplemental request within a certain time period to \n     continue an operation are unwarranted restrictions on the \n     authority of the President. Moreover, by requiring a \n     Presidential certification to assign U.S. Armed Forces under \n     United Nations (UN) operational or tactical control, the bill \n     infringes on the President's constitutional authority.\n       In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about \n     the following: onerous certification requirements for the use \n     of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, as well as \n     subcaps on specified activities and elimination of funding \n     for the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrictions on the \n     Technology Reinvestment Program; restrictions on retirement \n     of U.S. strategic delivery systems; restrictions on DOD's \n     ability to executive disaster relief, demining, and military-\n     to-military contract programs; directed procurement of \n     specific ships at specific shipyards without a valid \n     industrial base rationale; provisions requiring the discharge \n     of military personnel who are HIV-positive; restrictions on \n     the ability of the Secretary of Defense to manage DOD \n     effectively, including the abolition of the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \n     Conflict and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation; \n     and finally the Administration continues to object to the \n     restrictions on the ability of female service members or \n     dependents from obtaining privately funded abortions in U.S. \n     military hospitals abroad.\n       While the bill is unacceptable to the Administration, there \n     are elements of the authorization bill which are beneficial \n     to the Department, including important changes in acquisition \n     law, new authorities to improve military housing, and \n     essential pay raises for military personnel. The \n     Administration calls on the Congress to correct the \n     unacceptable flaws in H.R. 1530 so that these beneficial \n     provisions may be enacted. The President especially calls on \n     the Congress to provide for pay raises and cost of living \n     adjustments for military personnel prior to departure for the \n     Christmas recess.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a portion of that statement of \nadministration policy says the following in opposition to the \nconference report:\n\n       The bill would require deployment by 2003 of a costly \n     missile defense system to defend the U.S. from a long-range \n     missile threat which the Intelligence Community does not \n     believe will ever materialize in the coming decade. By \n     forcing an unwarranted and unnecessary National Missile \n     Defense deployment decision now, the bill would needlessly \n     incur tens of billions of dollars in missile defense costs \n     and force the Department of Defense prematurely to lock into \n     a specific technological option. In addition, by directing \n     that the National Missile Defense be ``operationally \n     effective'' in defending all 50 States, the bill would likely \n     require a multi-site National Missile Defense architecture \n     that cannot be accommodated within the terms of the ABM \n     Treaty as now written. By setting U.S. policy on a collision \n     course with the ABM Treaty, the bill puts at risk continued \n     Russian implementation of the START I Treaty and Russian \n     ratification of START II, two treaties which together will \n     reduce the number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear \n     warheads by two-thirds from Cold War levels, significantly \n     lowering the threat to U.S. national security.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, on no set of issues is bipartisan cooperation more \nimportant than in the area of national security. We need not all agree \non every issue, but we must strive to work together in a bipartisan \nspirit. We have a broad spectrum of views on the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees, but we have a long history of working together, \nacross party lines to try to put together the best bill we can. \nRegrettably, the conference this year fell short of that objective both \nin process and in spirit. Too many of these contentious issues were \nleft to only majority staff of the two committees to hash out, and \nmonths passed without resolution. By that time, the defense, military \nconstruction, and energy and water appropriations bills had been passed \nand enacted. I urge the leadership of both the House and Senate \ncommittees to reexamine what transpired and accelerate the learning \nprocess so that next year, and I stand ready to work with them to try \nto restore the tradition of cooperation on the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted \n\n[[Page S18800]]\nto speak for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not on the Finance Committee. I am \nnot on the Budget Committee. Through Democratic caucuses and studying \nthe budget documents, I have been trying to follow this budget process. \nI have been an avid student of what is going on.\n  I have been in the U.S. Senate 21 years. I am absolutely incredulous. \nI cannot believe what Congress is doing with charge, countercharge. \nMembers of Congress are worrying about who is winning in the polls and \nwho is losing in the polls. But I must say I am amazed that the \nRepublicans absolutely refuse to provide a continuing resolution while \nwe try to work this out. I cannot understand this steady objection to \nkeeping the Government going while we fight about how we are going to \nbalance the budget. How do you explain to the people back home that you \nare trying to balance the budget when you send 250,000 employees home \nand say, ``Not to worry, you are going to be paid anyway''? Can you \nbelieve that we told 250,000 Federal employees this morning not to show \nup for work and ``you will be paid anyway''?\n  The only reason the people on my staff are going to be paid now, \nwhich they were not in the first Government shutdown, is because we \npassed and the President signed the legislative branch appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we are also seeing what is almost tantamount to a \nconstitutional amendment without voting on it. The Constitution says, \nessentially, that a bill passed by the Congress shall be presented to \nthe President and if the President approves it, he shall sign it. And \nif he disapproves, he will not sign it or he will veto it. For 205 \nyears in this country, the President has signed or vetoed bills that \nwere sent to him by the Congress, and the Congress either overrode the \nveto or they did not. If they did not have the votes to override the \nveto, then Congress went back to the drawing board trying to meet the \nPresident's objections in order to get a bill to him that he would \nsign.\n  That has been the procedure under the Constitution for over 200 \nyears, and now we have a totally new procedure. And that procedure is \nthat if the President vetoes a bill and there is a majority of one \nparty in the Congress that takes exception to that veto, but not a big \nenough majority to override the President's veto, Congress shuts the \nGovernment down. Teach that President a lesson. How dare he veto a bill \nwhen the opposing party is in control of the Congress. President \nClinton has correctly characterized this as a gun to his head.\n  Republicans are not trying to override the veto. Nobody has brought \nthe reconciliation bill back here for revision after the President \nvetoed it. We shut the Government down--twice. Twice within 2 months we \nbring the Government to a halt in such a needless, irresponsible way. \nThe budget does not have to be approved tonight. It does not have to be \napproved between now and January 15, although it almost certainly would \nbe approved by January 15.\n  There are a lot of people across the land who are saying ``a pox on \nboth your houses.'' Lord knows, I understand that. As I read this \nmorning's account of this woman in Vermont who has a part-time job \nmaking $85 a month and trying to stay off welfare because she deplores \nit, but who, in the past, has received a little Federal help under what \nwe call LIHEAP, low-income energy assistance program. This woman said \nshe wore four sweaters to try to stay warm so she could keep the heat \nas low as possible, but I think she said she is going to run out of \nfuel next week and she does not have one farthing to buy new fuel. The \nfuel supplier--and I certainly understand his position--says, ``We \ncannot afford to extend credit to these people. We are not rich. We are \njust out there selling fuel trying to make a living.''\n  Would you believe that 10,000 people in the city of Chicago alone \nhave been refused and shut off from any additional gas because they \ncannot pay their bills? That is 10,000 homes in the city of Chicago \nalone. Last year there was $1.3 billion in this program, Mr. President. \nThe people of the Northern States are running out of money and fuel.\n  Why? So we can preserve a $245 billion tax cut for the wealthiest \npeople in America. It makes Marie Antoinette look positively \ncompassionate.\n  There is the great novel James Baldwin wrote entitled ``Go Tell It On \nThe Mountain,'' a young black man growing up in the South during the \nDepression, and he talks about a big dinner on the ground. He said \nthese preachers would get up after their stomachs were full and talk \nabout how many people they had saved, and the central character in this \nbook was saying they talked about saved souls in the way you would talk \nabout ears of corn being lopped off the stalk. And he took a vow, \nbecause he wanted to be a minister, that he would never take the gift \nof God so lightly.\n  Do you know what happened in the book? As time went on, the central \ncharacter became a preacher, very good at his trade, and the first \nthing you know he, too, was talking about saving souls like so many \nears of corn being lopped off the stalk.\n  There are two morals in that. One is that we all have a tendency to \ntake ourselves too seriously and get to believing that somehow or other \nwe have all the solutions. But the other moral is that people who are \ncold are like lost souls. They are real human beings.\n  In this case, they are real human beings who are suffering. Why are \nthey suffering? Because of us. All so we can have a $245 billion tax \ncut. That includes a capital gains tax cut, which would be good for me \nand just about every other Senator in this body, each of whom makes in \nexcess of $133,000 a year. We will get a tax cut. People making less \nthan $30,000 a year will see their taxes go up.\n  The interesting thing is we are always standing on the floor of the \nSenate pontificating about what the American people want, especially \nwhen we think the American people want what we want. I heard people \ntime and time again saying that people want a tax cut. The truth of the \nmatter is, they do not. Look at this chart. This shows 10 polls asking \nwhether Americans prefer tax cuts or deficit reduction: USA Today/CNN/\nGallup in December 1994; New York Times/CBS in January 1995; Wall \nStreet Journal/NBC in January 1995; Washington Post/ABC in February \n1995; Times/Mirror, February 1995; Wall Street Journal/NBC, March 1995; \nLos Angeles Times, March 1995; USA Today/CNN/Gallup, April 1995; the \nNew York Times/CBS, April 1995; New York Times/CBS, October 1995.\n  In every single one of them, a majority of people said, ``Do not cut \ntaxes until you balance the budget.'' Congress is supposed to at least \nbe mildly responsive to what the American people believe.\n  Mr. President, let me add something interesting about this last New \nYork Times/CBS poll taken in October 1995. I hope all my Republican \nfriends are listening. The national polls showed that overall, 60 \npercent of those surveyed did not want a tax cut until after the budget \nwas balanced, 35 percent did. But among Republicans surveyed, the \nfigure was 68 to 30. Well over 2 to 1 of Republicans said do not cut \ntaxes until you balance the budget.\n  So how did this huge tax cut proposal come to be? Well, the Budget \nCommittee asked CBO to make a study and say, if we get a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, how much will we save in interest costs and \nother dividends from a balanced budget?\n  CBO said, ``$170 billion.'' So how did we decide to use that fiscal \ndividend? Use it to soften Medicare cuts? No. Medicaid, our health care \nsystem for the poorest of the poor, one-half of which are children? No. \nEducation? No. Environment? No. Earned income tax credit? No. The \nBudget and Finance Committees said, ``Oh, $170 billion dividend for \nbalancing the budget. Let's give that and another $75 billion to the \nrichest people in America in the form of tax cuts.''\n  If you have not seen Kevin Phillips' recent article, I recommend it \nto everybody. He is no bleeding heart liberal. He points out what \nhappened in 1981. If we followed the Reagan prescription of cutting \ntaxes, we were told, we would generate so much economic activity we \nwould balance the \n\n[[Page S18801]]\nbudget by 1984. So 1984 came around and the deficit was up to almost \n$200 billion. It was $58 billion his first year as President, and after \nwe passed everything he asked for, the deficit in 1984 was not \nbalanced, it was $200 billion out of balance.\n  Then we went to Gramm-Rudman. Gramm-Rudman was going to balance the \nbudget in 3 or 4 years. And the rest of the story is painfully known to \neverybody in America. The budget deficit soared once again.\n  Then we had that fiasco at Andrews Air Force Base. We were going to \nbalance the budget by 1993. What happened? The budget was headed for \nalmost $300 billion in deficit.\n  Forgo the tax cut, Mr. President, and take two-tenths of a percent \noff the Consumer Price Index, and we will be 90 percent of the way home \ntoward a balanced budget. We will not have to tell the nursing home \npatients of this country that their children are going to have to start \npicking up the tab for their care in the nursing home. You do not have \nto tell the elderly when they go to bed at night they might be \ndestitute the next morning because of a catastrophic illness.\n  Mr. President, I came here to vent my frustration and, hopefully, \nmake a little sense about what is going on and what is not going on. \nWhat is not going on is the people's business. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Chair if we are in \nmorning business or if we are on the Defense authorization bill at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, although it could be properly conducted on \nthe authorization bill, under the Pastore rule I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized as if in morning business for not to exceed 10 \nminutes. And it will probably be considerably less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Virginia may proceed.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I just want to address the question that is \nbothering just about everyone who serves in Congress today and most of \nthe people who live in this area and many of the rest of the people \naround the country. And that question has to do with the current \nimpasse over the budget negotiations and the shutdown of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, I understand the deep feelings and convictions held on \nboth sides of this argument. It goes to some very fundamental choices \nthat are important to this Government today and in the future.\n  I think it is very unlikely, given the deep-seated convictions that \nare involved on both sides of the question, that the budget impasse \nwill be resolved in the near term. Indeed, if both sides were to agree \ntoday on how we could solve the budget problem--and I'm not simply \ntalking about a continuing resolution, but the budget problem--we could \nnot craft, draft, pass, and send to the President a responsible \ncompromise budget in the time remaining before Christmas and the \nholiday period. I say this with the understanding that we are already \nin the first day of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah as I speak.\n  Mr. President, while I have never been an advocate for tax cuts \nbefore we balance our budget, I have consistently supported a balanced \nbudget. I have consistently supported a 7-year balanced budget. I have \nconsistently supported using Congressional Budget Office figures. And, \nindeed, both sides have come to an essential agreement on these \nparameters for any compromise.\n  But, in light of the difficulty in forging an overall budget \nagreement, I suggest and appeal to the leaders on both sides of the \nCapitol to do what they can today to extend the continuing resolution \nthat will allow the processes of Government to continue. This partial \nshutdown is simply irresponsible and, frankly, one that none of us can \nadequately explain to anyone who is affected by it.\n  Admittedly, I represent a State that has a disproportionate number of \nthose most directly affected, but the pervasive effect of the partial \nshutdown goes far beyond the people who are actually the professionals \nof Government and who make Government run. It goes to the local \neconomies in which these individuals live. It goes to the confidence of \nthe international and national financial markets.\n  Indeed, with respect to the first shutdown, the original projections \nwere very significant in terms of the dollars that were directly lost. \nWe had some 800,000 Federal employees sent home and then ultimately \npaid for the time they were sent home. And we had a complete loss of \nconfidence in our Federal Government for failing to do what we have \nbeen sent here to do.\n  As I have said, the differences between the two sides are clearly \nvery difficult to reconcile. And, indeed, it is entirely possible that \nthe question of whether or not we have block grants or entitlements may \nnot be resolved until after the next general election when we will \nelect a President of the United States and all of the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives and a third of the Members of this body--\nbecause that question is fundamental to our system of values.\n  But nothing for either side will be accomplished by continuing the \npartial shutdown of the Federal Government. While it is only within the \npower of this body to end it, there has been resistance to passing a \ncontinuing resolution that does not affect, in part, the arguments that \nare embraced as part of the larger budget debate that is taking place.\n  But, Mr. President, both sides have made their points on the larger \nissues of balancing our budget. Now is the time to approve a continuing \nresolution that would allow our Government to function and not drain \ntaxpayer resources and public confidence. Then the larger questions, \nwhere the views are so deeply held and the rhetoric to date has been so \nirreconcilable, can be addressed in due course.\n  So, Mr. President, to the leaders of Congress and the President, I \nsay publicly, as I have done privately, continue to work on the great \nissues that are the subject of the debate that we are engaged in today, \nbut also give the Government an opportunity to move forward at this \ntime by allowing Congress to pass and the President to sign an \nextension of the continuing resolution. We can then continue to see \nwhether or not we can resolve the larger questions.\n  I will close by thanking the Chair and thanking other Members who \nhave been very patient while I have made this particular plea. The \nplight of many of those directly affected and many others indirectly \naffected at this time of year is serious, one that should not and, as \nfar as I am concerned, cannot be ignored.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from \nArkansas is on the Senate floor and I heard part of his comments in \nregard to the budget impasse. I say as a person who has been in on many \nof these negotiations, I have been very frustrated that the \nadministration has not kept its commitment to come up with a balanced \nbudget in 7 years using honest economics. We have had 4 weeks since \npassage of the continuing resolution. That was 4 weeks of time almost \ntotally wasted, and we have not had a fruitful or real productive \neffort by the administration. Their last budget submission did not use \nCongressional Budget Office economics which, because they have been \nrevised, include $135 billion of savings, enabling it to be easier to \nbalance the budget.\n  They did come up with a back door Gramm-Rudman to raise taxes if you \n\n[[Page S18802]]\n  do not meet the deficit targets. That is not what we have done in the \npast. In the past if you did not meet the deficit targets we had an \nautomatic sequester, or across the board cut, of spending. This \nadministration did the opposite. They say if you do not meet the \ndeficit targets--and they did not give us the specific language--but \nthey said if you do not meet deficit reduction targets we will have tax \nincreases or postpone tax reductions. In other words, taxpayers, you \ncome out short if we are incorrect. If our spending exceeds our limits \nor if the deficit continues higher, instead of cutting off the money \ncoming out of Washington, DC, we will take more money from taxpayers. \nTaxpayers beware--that is a bad deal.\n  I hope the administration will step back and say, ``Wait a minute we \ncommitted to do this. We will do what we say.'' I tell my friend from \nArkansas that I think it is in President Clinton's interest to do it. \nSome say we have to have Republican winners or Democrat winners. We \nshould not be doing that. Mr. President, we should be doing what is \nright for this country: Balance the budget. Can we balance the budget? \nYes. Can we balance the budget and give modest tax relief? Yes. Have we \nsaid it is negotiable? Yes, but we need to negotiate. You cannot \nnegotiate apples and oranges. This administration has yet to put down a \nreal budget so we can compare figures.\n  They have engaged in a lot of demagoguery. It was very frustrating to \nme to hear the President of the United States on his radio program a \nweek ago Saturday say, ``I cannot support that budget because it \ndevastates Medicare, devastates Medicare. Unacceptable cuts in \nMedicare.'' The facts are we are spending $178 billion in Medicare \ntoday. The facts are in the year 2002 we will spend $293 billion in \nMedicare. That is not a cut. That is an increase of over 50 percent.\n  Mrs. Clinton when testifying before Congress in the summer of 1993 \nsaid, ``We want to not cut Medicare. We want to reduce the rate of \ngrowth in Medicare to 6 percent or 7 percent.'' That is not a cut. It \nis reducing the rate of growth to twice the rate of inflation. Mr. \nPresident, under our proposal Medicare grows by over 7 percent per \nyear--more than what Mrs. Clinton called for 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Yet this \nPresident and many in Congress have tried to say play political \nMediscare and see how many senior citizens they can scare into \nbelieving we have a bad budget and score political points instead of \ndoing what needs to be done.\n  I was on the conference to help write the Medicare provisions and I \nthink those provisions make sense. They offer senior citizens options \nand choices and medical savings accounts. They keep the premium at 31.5 \npercent for part B beneficiaries. To me that makes sense. Originally it \nwas at 50 percent.\n  Some people believe it is better to score political points. Maybe \nthey have been successful in scoring points, but certainly they have \nnot been successful in doing what is right. What is right is balancing \nthe budget and being fair and being honest. This administration has not \nbeen honest. That probably bothers me more than anything.\n  It bothers me when you have an administration that says ``Yes, we \nsigned a continuing resolution''--it became law--``that says we will \nbalance the budget in 7 years using updated Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers,'' and they have not done so. Not in their first budget, their \nsecond budget, their third budget after the continuing resolution was \nsigned, and last Friday on the fourth budget. They did not do it then, \neither. To me, that bothers me as much as anything else.\n  I would like to say we have an honest administration. I would like to \nsay they are dealing in good faith, but that has not been the case. \nThat has not been the case. It should be. We should have the President \nof the United States, when he signs something, does it. If he says he \nwill submit a balanced budget in 7 years, he should do it. We did not \nuse hocus-pocus numbers. We used revised Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, and they have yet to do it. To me that is very, very \nunfortunate.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the President of the United States \nvetoed the Interior bill. I regret that he vetoed the Department of \nVeterans and HUD and other agencies bills and the Commerce, State, \nJustice bill. That means there are hundreds of thousands of people that \nare furloughed. I will not say they are out of work. They may not be \nworking today but most everyone assumes they will be paid. The \nPresident should have, in my opinion, signed those bills, and should be \ncontacting the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Dole, and the \nSpeaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, and saying, ``Let's work out a deal \nand balance the budget.''\n  The numbers are not that far apart. I tell my colleagues under our \nproposal we were saying, according to Congressional Budget Office \nfigures, our proposal would spend about $12 trillion in the next 7 \nyears. The President's proposal in his June budget said they would \nspend about $12.8 trillion over the next 7 years. Since then, we have \ncome up and said we are willing to spend a little more, and went to \n$12.1 trillion.\n  The President has never given us their outlay figures for the next 7 \nyears. I asked for that weeks ago. They said they had a budget but they \nnever told us, ``Here is how much money we want to spend in Medicare \nthe next 7 years.'' They never said, ``Here is what we want to spend in \nMedicaid for the next 7 years.'' They never said, ``Here is what we \nwant to spend for defense and other categories.'' They worked in broad \ncategories and never gave us specifics on a year-by-year basis. So we \nhave to say, where are their figures? They did not give them to us. How \nare we supposed to negotiate with them? We have figures. We can tell \nyou what dollar amount we are going to spend in every single category \nin the Government for the next 7 years. How can we negotiate with an \nadministration that will not give us the same thing?\n\n  That maybe voices a little of the frustration that I have working \nwith this administration. I hope they will change. I hope they will get \non the phone. I hope President Clinton will contact the congressional \nleaders and say: Let us work it out. Let us balance the budget. Let us \ndo it and let us do it now, because it is the right thing to do. It \nshould be done. It is irresponsible not to do it.\n  We have a chance to make history. We have a chance to do what is \nright. We have a chance to balance the budget. We have a chance to stop \nthis process of $200 billion deficits forever, and that is what \nPresident Clinton's budget is. His June budget had $200 billion \ndeficits forever, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is \nnot acceptable. That is totally not acceptable.\n  So, I think it is awfully important for us not to continue this kind \nof irresponsibility, in my opinion, by the administration. It cannot \ncontinue. We need to change it. I hope the President will contact the \nleaders and say: Let us sit down, let us talk, let us use real numbers, \nlet us use the same numbers, let us work out our differences and come \nup with a package that will benefit all Americans--not really be a \nbenefit for the Republicans or Democrats but be a real benefit for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in a moment I want to make a few remarks \nabout the defense bill. Before the Senator from Oklahoma, my good \nfriend, Senator Nickles, leaves the floor, I would like to pose these \nquestions.\n  First, why is it that we have to shut the Government down in order to \ncontinue negotiating? Second, who do you think benefits from that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I will say, the President had \nthe opportunity today to sign three bills--there are six bills that are \nstill outstanding. In my opinion five of those six bills could be \nsigned by tomorrow. The only bill that is left outstanding is the \nLabor-HHS bill, which is not being held up by Republicans; it is being \nheld up by Senate Democrats. I think that is very unfortunate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But, Mr. President, would the Senator not agree that, \nunder the Constitution, if the President does not like a bill he not \nonly has the right, but the solemn duty, to veto it? And Congress has \nthe right and the solemn duty to try to override it. \n\n[[Page S18803]]\n\n  Yet, while we have operated that way for 206 years, all of a sudden \nwe have a new deal, that if you do not have the votes to override a \nveto, you shut the Government down, and, in addition to that, send \n250,000 people home this morning, saying do not come to work but we \nwill pay you for it anyway. Who benefits from that?\n  Mr. MACK. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Florida in \na moment. The President of the United States is the one who sent most \nof these individuals home because of his vetoes today and tomorrow. \nThose bills affected hundreds of thousands of people. The President had \nthe right; he could veto the bill. But the President is the one who \nsent those individuals home. If he were to sign those bills, my \ncolleague, I am sure, would concur, there would be no furloughs. Those \nemployees would work. He had that option. He chose to veto bills. So he \nis directly responsible for sending those hundreds of thousands of \npeople home today.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may say so, I have only been here 21 \nyears; not as long as the Senator from North Carolina who I see here on \nthe floor, but pretty near. I have never--I have never--witnessed \nanything like this and hope to goodness I never witness it again, \nwhere, instead of passing a continuing resolution to allow people to \noperate at even a severely constrained level, even much less than they \ngot last year, we shut down the Government instead. Actually, if I were \nthe President I would be a little ambivalent about this, because, if we \ncontinue operating on a continuing resolution, we might get a balanced \nbudget faster because a lot of these people are operating on a severely \nconstrained budget.\n  But my point is this. We have never--we have never--taken the option \nof shutting down the Government simply because we disagree with the \nPresident. It seems to me we might wind up having to have a \nconstitutional amendment one of these days to say that is absolutely \nprohibited. Congress would be solemnly bound to pass a continuing \nresolution or something.\n  I must tell you, I am at an absolute, abject, total loss as to how \nanybody can possibly believe that the country's business is being well \nserved by shutting the Government down. I do not care how much you \ndisagree with the President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I hope you will contact the \nPresident and tell him to sign those bills, and those individuals would \ngo to work.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Even if I did, he would not because he disagrees with \nthem. And that is his prerogative as President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Oklahoma and I, \nif we sat down and talked about this for a couple of weeks, we might \nwork something out even though we have very serious disagreements. I \nknow the Senator was euphoric, and I was depressed, in November 1994 \nwhen the American people took away the long, long, 40-year Democratic \nmajority in the House and, I guess, about a 10-year majority in the \nSenate. They were voting for a whole host of reasons. Some of them were \nmad about gays in the military. Some of them were mad because we had \nnot passed a constitutional amendment on prayer in school. Maybe some \nof them wanted a flag desecration amendment to the Constitution, or \nterm limits. Maybe some of them missed a Social Security check that \nmonth. I do not know. I do not think there was one single thing, one \nsingle thread that ran through the election of 1994 that caused people \nto vote the way they did.\n  But I will tell you one thing. They did not vote for chaos, and that \nis all they have had.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18801-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18803-S18804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. On the defense authorization bill, I was very pleased to \nlisten last week to a man whom I believe is probably the most respected \nman in the United States on defense issues. He and I have had very \nserious disagreements, particularly about the size of defense spending. \nBut I have never really questioned his motives, his intellect, or his \nunderstanding of the defense issues. Yet he stood on the floor last \nFriday and said he fully intended to vote against this defense \nauthorization bill. That was Sam Nunn, the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  He gave a lot of reasons, not the least of which was this so-called \nnational missile defense system.\n  Somehow or other, the people in this body simply cannot give up on \nthe Soviet Union. Our defense policies and our State Department \npolicies for as long as the memory of man runneth not, has been keyed \nto that terrible evil empire of the Soviet Union. We have spent tens \nand hundreds of billions--trillions, really, because we were so \nfrightened of the military might of the Soviet Union.\n  Interestingly, 2 weeks ago we learned that a lot of our defense \nspending and a lot of our policies were based on misinformation given \nto us by spies for the Soviet Union who were feeding us disinformation \nabout how powerful the Soviet Union was, and it played right into the \nhands of the defense industries and the hawks of this country, and we \nspent trillions of dollars. That is one of the reasons we are in the \npickle we are in with a $5 trillion debt we are trying to do something \nabout.\n  Now we come back, because we still cannot give up on that anti-Soviet \nmentality, and we say we want a national ballistic missile defense \nsystem in place by the year 2003 that will protect all 50 States. There \nis not any doubt, and neither the chairman nor the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee would refute, that that is going to \nrequire multiple antiballistic missile sites.\n  And when you start talking about multiple sites, you are talking \nabout a direct abrogation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, one of \nthe very few treaties we still have in existence with the Soviet Union, \nnow Russia. It says that neither country will deploy a strategic \nantiballistic missile system at more than one site in its own \nterritory.\n  I engaged Senator Nunn in a colloquy on this subject Friday \nafternoon, and asked him if this is not a legislative abrogation of the \nAntiballistic Missile Treaty. Senator Nunn very wisely answered in \nlanguage that all lawyers understand. He said it constitutes an \nanticipatory breach. What that means is, once we deploy more than one \nsite, we have in fact abrogated the treaty.\n  Colleagues, let me ask you a question. How would we react if the \nRussians were to announce today, as we sit here debating this bill, \nthat they are going to deploy a national missile defense system that \nwill have many sites? I promise you that all 100 Senators would be on \nthe floor squealing like a pig under a gate. And you would hear, \n``There they go again. You cannot trust them.'' Yet, here we cavalierly \nget ready to spend billions on a national missile defense system which \nwill abrogate a treaty that is in the interest of the Russians, the \nUnited States, and all the people of the world.\n  I ask you this: To add to the question, what if the Russians were \ndoing this, what would our response be? It would be to start deploying \none as quickly as we could. And you tell me when the ABM Treaty is gone \nand the Russians and the United States both have national missile \ndefense systems, who do you think is better off? I can tell you nobody \nis better off, and the world becomes again a very dangerous place \nliving with a hair trigger.\n  The Russians are right now in the process of complying with START I. \nAnd they are complying with it by dismantling nuclear weapons. They, \nlike the United States, are prepared to consider the ratification of \nSTART II which will cut nuclear weapons still further. Do you think if \nwe go ahead with this national missile defense system the Russians are \ngoing to ratify START II? Of course, they are not. If we are going to \ndeploy a system that will shoot down their missiles, they are not going \nto keep dismantling missiles. They are not stupid. They know exactly \nwhat is going on.\n  So I am going to vote against this bill because it costs too much \nmoney, because the national missile defense plan envisioned in it is \ndangerous in the extreme, and because we are putting $493 million more \ninto the B-2 program. And I defy anybody in the U.S. \n\n[[Page S18804]]\nSenate to read the committee report and tell me what we are going to do \nwith the money for the B-2. Is it for advanced procurement for more \nbombers? Or is it to take care of the flaws in the present bombers?\n  The committee report had one line that was the most curious line I \nhave ever seen in a conference committee report. It said the Senate \nconferees believe so and so. Who cares what the Senate conferees \nbelieve? It is what the conference of the House and the Senate both \nbelieve that we are supposed to be voting on.\n  It reminds me of a story about a little boy. The teacher said, ``What \ndo you believe?'' The boy said, ``I believe what the Methodists \nbelieve.'' She says, ``And what do the Methodists believe?'' He says, \n``They believe what I believe.'' ``And what do both you and the \nMethodists believe?'' ``We both believe in the same thing.''\n  Mr. President, I invite all of my colleagues to read the committee \nreport and tell me where the $493 million is going.\n  Finally, I can remember all the years I have been here and posing the \nquestion about things in our defense budget: Why are we doing this and \nwhy are we doing that? And the answer has been, well, the President \nwants it, the chiefs want it, and the Secretary of Defense wants it. So \nwe went merrily on our way spending tens of billions of dollars because \nthey wanted it.\n  Now you ask the powers that be in the U.S. Senate. Why are we doing \nit when the Secretary does not want it, the President does not want it, \nand the chiefs do not want it? The answer is, what do they know?\n  Mr. President, at a time when everybody is groaning and straining to \ndeal with the balanced budget and trying to accomplish a balanced \nbudget, we have a defense appropriations bill which the President has \nalready signed. I disagreed with the President on that because, as I \nhave said before, my good friend, the President, has a right to be \nwrong just like I have. There is $7 billion more in that bill than \nanybody asked for--ships being built that they did not ask for, and in \nplaces where there was no bidding.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not know how much longer this bill will be \ndebated, but I can truthfully say that I think it is a terrible \nmistake. I think the world will be less safe once we pass this \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, during this second shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, I am reminded of the old saying that two wrongs do not make \na right.\n  I believe it is wrong to tell 300,000 Federal workers that because \nthe Government considers them nonessential, they cannot come into work \ntoday.\n  But Mr. President, it is even more wrong to then turn to the American \ntaxpayer and tell them to pay these workers for not working.\n  That's right. For the second time this year, Washington is requiring \ntaxpayers to pay with their hard-earned dollars for services that will \nnever be given.\n  While we may have honest differences about the amount of government \npeople should pay for, I think we can all agree that taxpayers should \nnot be forced to give something for nothing. But that is exactly what \nthey are getting for their tax dollars: nothing.\n  What is worse is that this whole situation has arisen because \nPresident Clinton has refused to carry through on his promise to \ndeliver a 7-year balanced budget using real numbers.\n  One month ago, when the first Government shutdown occurred, the \ndebate was over whether or not to balance the budget in 7 years. It \ntook a week, 800,000 furloughed employees, and a lot of complaints from \nthe American taxpayers, but the President finally got the message.\n  We came to an agreement by both Congress and the White House that the \nAmerican people would finally get what they have been calling for--a \nreal 7-year balanced budget.

Mr. President, during this second shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, I am reminded of the old saying that two wrongs do not make \na right.\n  I believe it is wrong to tell 300,000 Federal workers that because \nthe Government considers them nonessential, they cannot come into work \ntoday.\n  But Mr. President, it is even more wrong to then turn to the American \ntaxpayer and tell them to pay these workers for not working.\n  That's right. For the second time this year, Washington is requiring \ntaxpayers to pay with their hard-earned dollars for services that will \nnever be given.\n  While we may have honest differences about the amount of government \npeople should pay for, I think we can all agree that taxpayers should \nnot be forced to give something for nothing. But that is exactly what \nthey are getting for their tax dollars: nothing.\n  What is worse is that this whole situation has arisen because \nPresident Clinton has refused to carry through on his promise to \ndeliver a 7-year balanced budget using real numbers.\n  One month ago, when the first Government shutdown occurred, the \ndebate was over whether or not to balance the budget in 7 years. It \ntook a week, 800,000 furloughed employees, and a lot of complaints from \nthe American taxpayers, but the President finally got the message.\n  We came to an agreement by both Congress and the White House that the \nAmerican people would finally get what they have been calling for--a \nreal 7-year balanced budget. Gridlock was over. Or so we thought.\n  Instead of following through on his promise, President Clinton has \ndeliberated, deferred and delayed his balanced budget proposal.

Mr. President, in this morning's Washington Post, there \nwas a very interesting op-ed piece that I cannot refrain from \ncommenting on. It is written by Terry Deibel, and it is entitled, ``A \nLiberal Deficit Hawk's Dilemma.''\n  Mr. Deibel describes himself as a liberal who believes in Government, \nbelieves that the Federal Government can and does do wonderful things, \nbut that the Government should not ``spend more money to do these \nthings than it collects.''\n  He then offers us this fascinating solution to our present dilemma \nfrom his position as a self-styled liberal deficit hawk. And I am \nquoting, Mr. President.\n\n       To be sure, a good deal of budget balancing could be done \n     in a policy-neutral fashion. A simple freeze on outlays at \n     current levels or a small across-the-board cut in \n     everything--all spending, all entitlements, including Social \n     Security--prolonged over several years of economic and \n     revenue growth eventually would do the trick without any \n     allocation decisions.\n\n  I was stunned when I read this. Here is a man who is a liberal, \ndescribes himself as a liberal deficit hawk who is proposing a program \nfar more draconian than anything the Republicans have ever \ncontemplated, a freeze, Mr. President, in all spending across the \nboard, or even a small across-the-board cut in everything--\nentitlements, including Social Security.\n  No Republican has dared offer anything that drastic or that \ndraconian. What this says to me, Mr. President, is that Mr. Deibel has \nfallen victim to the rhetoric of this Chamber and, if you will, of the \nWhite House. He has come to believe, as do many of my constituents, \nthat the Republicans are calling for drastic cuts in everything, and he \nsays let us solve the problem with a simple freeze.\n  Let me give you a few numbers, Mr. President. Total Medicare spending \nin 1995 was $178 billion. If this proposal were put in place, that \nmeans years from now Medicare spending would be frozen at $178 billion \nin contrast to the draconian Republican call for spending of $301 \nbillion in the year 2002. He is calling for a commonsense, neutral \nposition that would freeze the budget at $178 billion but, no, those \nstingy Republicans want to increase it from 178 to 301--a 69 percent \nincrease.\n\n  I say to you, Mr. President, he, like too many people, has fallen \nvictim to the rhetoric of this debate without looking at the facts.\n  On Medicaid--another area where we are being told the Republicans are \ncalling for heartless slashes--this man, a liberal, says, no, let us \ntake care of Medicaid by simply freezing it at its present level. Its \npresent level is $83 billion. Under the Republican proposal, by the \nyear 2002, it will reach $143 billion, a 58-percent increase. But we \nare being pilloried for being heartless when common sense tells this \nman we can solve the problem if we just freeze it.\n  Again, he is a victim of the rhetoric. He does not realize, as, \nunfortunately, too many people do not realize, the Republicans are not \nsaying let us slash these programs. The Republicans are saying the \nprograms are legitimate, the programs need to grow, as the needs of our \npeople need to grow, but let us let them grow at some kind of \nintelligent rate. But with the rhetoric, even a man of his knowledge \nand understanding--and he is identified in the Washington Post as \nchairman of the Department of National Security Policy at the National \nWar College--even a man of his position and understanding has fallen \nvictim to this rhetoric. I hope he will understand now that the freeze \nhe is calling for as the logical solution is so much more draconian \nthan what the Republicans have suggested that if we were to in fact \nembrace his proposal, we would be crucified --I think justly--by both \nthe press and, of course, the members of the opposite party.\n  Now, I cannot conclude without referring to one specific that he \ntalks about which is a further demonstration of the way the rhetoric \nhas distorted the reality. He says:\n\n       It is quite possible, after all, to cut corporate welfare \n     or end the great-western-lands-grazing-and-mining free-lunch \n     program, for example, rather than cut poor people's welfare \n     and the school lunch program.\n\n  Once again, if you listen to the rhetoric on this floor, you would \nthink that the reason the budget is out of balance is because of the \ntremendous spending in the West on grazing and the reason we are \nheartless is because of our cuts in school lunches.\n  I participated in the filibuster that was mounted on this floor to \nprevent the Secretary of the Interior from implementing his increase in \ngrazing fees, which we were told would be the way to make everything \nfair.\n  The total amount of money that would have come to the Federal \nGovernment if the Secretary of Interior had been successful in his \neffort to increase those grazing fees is $19 million per year. That is \nmillion, ``m'' as in ``minuscule,'' Mr. President, $19 million. That is \nless than we spent to put the new subway between the Capitol and the \nSenate office buildings.\n  By comparison, his implication is you could pay for school lunches if \nonly you did away with the grazing program in the Midwest. In 1995 we \nwill spend $7.9 billion on child nutrition, ``b'' as in ``big.'' And in \n7 years, under the draconian Republican budget, spending on child \nnutrition will increase to $9.2 billion a year, a 16.4-percent \nincrease.\n  I challenge anybody to try to pay for the present program, let alone \nthe increased program, by doing something about a grazing plan in the \nUnited States that is currently, by the Secretary of the Interior's own \nanalysis, costing the taxpayers $19 million.\n  Before I leave that, however, because $19 million is, after all, $19 \nmillion, I would refer you to the study that demonstrated that had the \nSecretary's proposal gone through, instead of receiving $19 million in \nadditional revenue, in fact it would have driven enough marginal \noperators off the range that the actual income to the Federal \nGovernment would probably not only have been less than $19 million, but \nin fact might have endangered the money that they were receiving from \nthe present grazing fees. The revenues could have gone down rather than \nup.\n  I will not pursue this any further, Mr. President. I think this is an \nexample of what is wrong with our political dialog. The Republicans are \nproposing increases, in many cases very substantial increases, in some \nof our most fundamental programs, and yet the rhetoric around it has \nbeen so extreme that even a man of Mr. Deibel's position and \nunderstanding thinks he can improve on the Republican's proposals by \nfreezing everything at the present level.\n  If there was ever a demonstration of the excess and inaccuracy of the \nrhetoric of this debate, it is Mr. Deibel's op-ed piece in this \nmorning's Washington Post.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18805-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18805-S18806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE BUDGET AND OUR COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this past Friday I made some pretty strong \ncomments with respect to President Clinton's--maybe it was Mr. \nPanetta's--proposal which we saw. There was great anticipation, if the \nPresident will recall, that last Friday there was going to be a new, \nserious proposal to balance the budget that President Clinton was going \nto bring to the table.\n  I felt, and I think expressed in pretty strong language, that it was \na phony attempt. In fact, I thought it was an insult to the Congress, \nfrankly, that the President would come forward with that proposal.\n  But something significant has happened since Friday. We may in fact \nhave a new player in this budget debate. We may in fact have a new \nplayer to the debate which over the last 30 days or so has been between \nthe White House, the President, on one hand and the Congress on the \nother. The third party who I think has now come to the debate is the \nfinancial markets of our country.\n  For those who have not been observing what has occurred today in the \n\n[[Page S18806]]\n  stock markets and the bond markets, you may be surprised to learn that \nthe stock market fell just over 100 points today. And interest rates \nbegin to climb, the long-term bond went from just over 6 percent to \nabout 6.2 percent. This is the first shot across the bow that the \nfinancial markets have fired, which I think are really directed at the \nPresident. The markets have had the opportunity over the weekend to \nanalyze the President's proposal. And they have concluded that there \nreally is no truth to the President's statement that he wants to \nbalance the budget.\n  It has been 1 month or it will be 1 month tomorrow since the \nPresident signed the statute saying that ``I will commit myself to \nbalancing the budget over 7 years using real numbers.'' I concluded \nlast Friday that he absolutely failed to do that; that, in fact, his \nproposal was an insult. There was absolutely no value to what he did \nlast week except political.\n  Mr. President, I would claim that the markets have in fact reacted \nthe same way. They analyzed the President's proposal over the weekend \nand they also concluded that it is a phony proposal. It will not get us \nto a balanced budget. In fact, it really pretty much leaves us where \nthe Congressional Budget Office said we were prior to this last \nproposal put forward by the President; and that is, in the seventh year \nthere would be a deficit of $116 billion. I believe this is the fourth \nplan that the President has put forward, maybe the third. There have \nbeen so many different ideas the President has come up with to avoid \noffering a balanced budget proposal that I have forgotten which one \nthis is. The President has just completely attempted to stay away from \nbalancing the budget. He says he wants to do it, but when you look at \nthe actions of the President of the United States he has failed.\n  So, Mr. President, again I think one thing that my colleagues in the \nSenate on the other side of the aisle ought to understand is that there \nis a new player now. And that is the financial markets of this country. \nAnd that should be no surprise.\n  On November 8, 1994, the day of the last election for the U.S. House \nof Representatives, the day the Republicans took control of both the \nHouse and the Senate, was the specific day that interest rates in this \nNation peaked, at a little bit over 8 percent. Since November 8, 1994, \nthose interest rates have been steadily coming down, down to the point \nof just barely above 6 percent.\n  We had some analysts from the Wall Street area come down to \nWashington several weeks ago when we got into a debate about just how \nstrongly the Congress should position itself with respect to the debt \nceiling and other means of leverage to try and get the President to \nmove to a balanced budget. And during that discussion I remember one of \nthe analysts commenting that if there is a failure to balance the \nbudget, if no agreement is reached, the markets will crash.\n  I also recognize that my friend, the Speaker of the House, made \nreference to that point, and was chastised, I believe, for using harsh \nrhetoric. Some said the Speaker of the House should not use that kind \nof language.\n  I must say to you that when I heard the analyst make this comment \nwith respect a crash, I think most of us have this tendency to think of \nwhat occurred in 1929 as being the definition of a market crash. So I \nasked them what did they mean, to them what would be a crash in the \nmarket? Their response was that interest rates would go back up, about \n2 points, and we would probably see the stock market fall somewhere \nbetween 200 and 300 points, if I recall.\n  The interesting thing, again, is that in 1 day we have seen a decline \nof 100 points in the stock market. And I believe that that has occurred \nbecause of the President's failure to come forward with a balanced \nbudget alternative and the markets are beginning to get nervous about \nwhether we will make it or not.\n  Moreover, I also think the President's failure to submit a serious \nbudget may affect the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board \nwill be making the decision tomorrow about what to do about interest \nrates. I suspect that they were extremely disappointed in the \nPresident's proposal as well, and the markets are concluding that since \nthe President is not serious about balancing the budget that it would \nbe a mistake for them tomorrow to lower interest rates any further. \nThat is a decision they will have to make, but I think that is a fair \nscenario to place on the table.\n  So, again, the reaction that we have seen in the last day with \nrespect to the President's proposal has already had an effect on the \nstock market and the bond market, and I am suggesting another impact \nvery well could be on the decision by the Federal Reserve tomorrow.\n  I talked to those financial experts about the benefits of balancing \nthe budget. I talked to them about the importance of bringing down \ninterest rates, and during those same meetings, they told us the \ninterest rate probably could come down even further; that if we were to \ncome to an agreement over balancing the budget, we could see long-term \ninterest rates in this country decline to the 5\\1/4\\ range.\n  I must say to you, Mr. President, having been a former banker, I can \nremember making those first loans on a single piece of paper--but that \nis another story of what has happened to our country as a result of the \nbureaucracy and the redtape which has been created. It was on a single \npiece of paper, and the interest rate was at 6 percent. I must say to \nyou that over the years I had lost hope that we would see long-term \ninterest rates return to a level of below 6 percent. But, frankly, I \nbelieve that this is within our grasp today.\n  If the President were serious about coming forward and giving us at \nleast his alternative--we are not telling him he has to agree with \nours, but at least put his alternative on the table telling us how he \nwould balance the budget in 7 years with CBO numbers--then we could sit \ndown and negotiate. If he would do that and we could reach an \nagreement, and I believe that we would see long-term interest rates \ncome down to the 5\\1/2\\ and 5\\1/4\\ range.\n  What does that mean? To the families of America, to those young \nfamilies who are trying to get a start, let me tell you something, \nthere is a big, big difference in obtaining a mortgage at 5\\1/4\\ \npercent versus 8\\1/4\\ percent. It not only will affect the mortgage \npayments that they will make, it will affect the cost of the automobile \nloan, it will affect and reduce the cost of a student loan. There are \nlots of things that the average American is going to feel as a result \nof what happens with interest rates.\n  The shot today which the markets have fired is basically one that \nsaid, if you don't come to an agreement, the reduction of interest \nrates you have seen in this last year are going to disappear and the \nrates are going to go back up and America's future will not be as \nbright.\n  The other day on the floor of the Senate, I said, and I am going to \nrepeat it again today, that the President ought to come forward with \nhis alternative. He made the commitment to do that almost 30 days ago. \nIt was in legislation that he signed. It was negotiated by \nrepresentatives from his White House. I am going to say it once again, \nbut I am going to read it to make sure I am very clear: This President \nhas proven once again that his commitment to principle is nonexistent. \nHe gave his word. He broke his word. It is a habit he does not seem \nable to break.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18805-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18806-S18808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nFlorida for a very clear-cut statement about why we are where we are \nand how we can get out of it. Basically, it is the President of the \nUnited States doing what he said he would do.\n  We are where we are today, Mr. President, because on November 20, the \nPresident signed an agreement with Congress. This is the wording of \nthat agreement:\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced \n     budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office * * *\n\n  We have said several times that the President himself on November 20 \n\n[[Page S18807]]\n  signed legislation that said he agreed to three things: One, that he \nwould send a budget to the Hill that was balanced. That budget he was \ngoing to send to the Hill would be the third one, because remember, he \nsent one in February, he sent one again in June and this would be the \nthird one. It would be balanced by the year 2002, the same as when \nCongress said that we would balance the budget.\n  What is magic about 2002? It could be 2001, it could be 2003, but \nreally what is magic about 2002 is that in February of this year, we \nhad 66 Senators--that is Republicans and Democrats, because there are \nnot 66 Republican Senators--a bipartisan vote that the budget should be \nbalanced by the year 2002. The House of Representatives had a vote \nabout a week or two earlier with 301 votes. That is Republicans and \nDemocrats. That is a bipartisan vote that said we should do it by 2002.\n  There is nothing revolutionary about 2002. That is an evolution to a \nbalanced budget. That is a Republican evolution to a balanced budget.\n  For a lot of people, it is too, too slow. We probably got more people \nin this country mad at us because we are taking until the year 2002 to \nbalance the budget than by 2002. The President says that is extreme. \nWell, it cannot be extreme if he signed the agreement that he was going \nto be in favor of balancing the budget by 2002, because if that is \nextreme, the President is extreme. I do not think anybody in this town \nis extreme.\n  The most difficult process in this town is just making the tough \ndecisions. For our constituents, taking 7 years to balance the budget \nis not a tough decision. That is too evolutionary of a process for \nbalancing a budget. They would like us to be more extreme than that. \nThey would like us to do it sooner.\n  Do you know why they think we should do it sooner? Because each month \nthey have to balance their checkbook, live within their income or, if \nthey are a small business or small farmer, they have to live within \ntheir income. They cannot be like Government, borrowing money all the \ntime.\n  But the President signed that he would submit by December 15 a \nbalanced budget and that it would be scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Those three things are pretty key to the President keeping his \nword when he signed this.\n  The first budget that they sent up here about 2 weeks ago was not in \nbalance, $400 billion out of balance, as scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office; $115 billion deficit even the last year.\n  We are here today because we are still waiting for the President to \ndeliver on what he signed into law on November 20. Where I come from, \nthat means you sit down to make a deal, you put some numbers on the \ntable, and those numbers should be within the guidelines of the debate. \nThe debate is to have it balanced and scored by CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office. By the way, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nnot scored by the Office of Management and Budget which is part of the \nWhite House which is headed by a Presidential appointee. The \nCongressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, people who do things based \nupon their study of forecasting the future and what programs are going \nto cost in the outyears, not what some Republican or Democrat says it \nis. Their reputation of being a true judge of what things are going to \ncost when they score it is at stake.\n  Last Friday, they made another attempt to come up here. I suppose \nthat would be the fourth budget this year. It was still off. But what \ndid they do about the Congressional Budget Office scoring? They said, \n``Well, we don't agree with it.'' This does not say anything about \nagreeing with it. You just simply present your numbers and let the \nnonpartisan budget office score it. Let the chips fall where they may.\n  ``Mr. President, if you come up short someplace, we understand. Just \ngo back to the table and submit a new number, but get something that \nthe Congressional Budget Office can say is in balance.''\n  The only thing we Republicans--maybe I should not speak so \ndefinitively--the only thing we Republicans care about is that the \nbudget is balanced by 2002, because I suppose each one of us has an \nopinion on that. But I have heard enough of the people who do the \nnegotiating for the Republicans--and for a few days I was one of the \neight doing the negotiating--that when the President puts a budget that \nis balanced, as scored by the CBO, on the table, then within the \nparameters, anything is on the table, including what to do about \nWashington spending, which we call discretionary spending, where we let \nthe Washington bureaucrats spend it, those programs. Entitlements like \nMedicare and Medicaid, and even defense and taxes, are all on the \ntable.\n\n  All we want the President to do is to play in the same boundary. If \nyou want to keep the cows within the pasture, that means you build a \nfence around the pasture. Then you operate within that. And what you do \nwithin that fence is all in the ball game. Everybody negotiating with \nthe White House and the Congress can reach an agreement. But what is so \nimportant about the fence, what is so important that is scored by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is simply that it is an end to \nbusiness as usual here in Washington, that the big black hole of \nGovernment borrowing can go on and you can spend any amount of money. \nFor the first time in 27 years, we are saying, once again, there is \nsome limit on what you can spend--just some limit.\n  Now, I came to the floor to speak about another point because we \nalways talk about the budget deficit. But there are two deficits that \nwe can defeat in the process of balancing the budget deficit. The \nSenator from Florida spoke very well about what good is going to come \nto the economy. There was an economist quoted in a USA Today article, \n``What Life Would Be in the Year 2002 With a Balanced Budget.'' Some of \nthe things they spoke to have been referred to by my colleagues on the \nfloor. A larger economy by $150 billion--this is by the year 2002--a \n$150 billion bigger economy, more in goods and services, and lower \ninterest rates. We would see 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 5 \npercent. The last time I remember mortgages for under 5 percent was \nwhen I purchased a house in 1960. I think it was 4\\3/4\\ percent. Half a \npercent was for FHA insurance for the 4\\1/4\\ percent. You have to go \nback a long way to see the good that can come to the pocketbooks of the \nAmerican people, such as $2,300 per person--that is a figure for my \nState of Iowa--$2,300 less per mortgage that families will be paying. \nIf they have student loans, they will be paying $608 less in interest \non that student loan. Our economy will grow dramatically. So we are \ngoing to have lower inflation besides lower interest, we are going to \nhave higher incomes, and we are going to have a stronger dollar.\n  Then the second deficit that will be eliminated besides the budget \ndeficit is the trade deficit. Now, since, I think, 1982, 1983, or 1984 \nat the latest, we have been worried and scared to death about the trade \ndeficit--that we import more than we sell and that we need to do \nsomething about it. This article quotes an economist at Meyers & \nAssociates, who said that when we do away with the budget deficit by \nthe year 2002, we will also be doing away with the trade deficit, as \nwell.\n  So here we have a chance to accomplish this and kill two birds with \none stone--get rid of the budget deficit, if we make the tough \ndecisions that must be made on the budget deficit, and get lower \ninterest rates, a stronger dollar, and reduce the trade deficit as \nwell. As chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee of the U.S. \nSenate, there is nothing I would rather have happen than to get rid of \nthe trade deficit at the same time we get rid of the budget deficit.\n  Another reason we are here is that we have been hearing for a long \ntime, Mr. President, about how the President wants to protect Medicare. \nWell, my friend who is still here, the Senator from Utah, Senator \nBennett, spoke a half hour ago about how we are very dramatically \nincreasing Medicare spending. But do not forget why we are dealing with \nthe Medicare issue at all. It is because the President's trustees--\nthree members of the President's Cabinet, the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity and two private citizens, appointed by the President of the \nUnited States last year--studied the problems with Medicare funding and \nthe fact that there was a potential bankruptcy of Medicare. A potential \nbankruptcy of \n\n[[Page S18808]]\nMedicare means that at some time Medicare is going to run out of money. \nWith the insolvency of Medicare, it will run out of money. There is no \nauthority in the law to borrow money for Medicare, so no bills would be \npaid after a date stated by the trustees.\n  These trustees are Robert Rubin, Secretary of the Treasury; Robert \nReich, Secretary of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of HHS; Shirley \nChater, Commissioner of Social Security, and two trustees are private \ncitizens who are expert in this area of economic forecasting, Sanford \nG. Ross and David M. Walker. They unanimously, on April 2, asked the \nCongress of the United States to take very drastic action to end the \npending insolvency of Medicare by the year 2002.\n  As shown on this chart, you can go back to 1985, and this is what you \nsee--money coming in, money being paid out. Next year is the first year \nthat there is more money being paid out of Medicare than is being paid \nin in taxes to the Medicare trust fund. And then it spends down very \ndramatically to the year 2002 when it goes into deficit. You do not pay \nanything on the deficit because there is no authority there to borrow.\n  So we responded to the appointees of the President of the United \nStates, the trustees of the Medicare system, in their report to us. We \nmade the commitment earlier this year to respond to that need, to save \nMedicare, but not only to save Medicare, but to strengthen Medicare, \nand not only strengthen it, but go beyond strengthening it to give \npeople, for the first time in 30 years, some choice in the type of \nmedicine that they want applied to them by giving them the opportunity \nof keeping what they have had for 30 years if they want to do so, or \ntaking the $4,900 this year that we paid for each beneficiary per year \nand let that be used by that individual, by their own free choice, to \nbuy a managed care plan if they want to do that; let them roll their \nown dollars by giving them the $4,900 to put in a medical savings \naccount; or, lastly, that they could keep a plan that they had where \nthey last worked, like a union or association plan. That would be a \nchoice that the individual Medicare enrollee could choose to do. You \ncould choose to do that once a year. You could choose to leave the \ntraditional Medicare plan and go into a managed care plan for a year. \nIf you did not like that, come back to Medicare, or go over to a \nmedical savings account, or go over to an association plan that you \nmight want to have.\n\n  We responded to that. It was in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that \nwe sent to the President a month ago, the same one that the President \nvetoed.\n  Mr. President, the Senate majority leader would like to have me \nyield. I yield as long as I do not lose my right to the floor.\n\n\n                     A Step in the Right Direction\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate that the President did call both myself and \nSpeaker Gingrich this afternoon about 3 o'clock. Without getting into \nthe details of what the conversation was, I am pleased that the \nPresident indicates a willingness now to accept our invitation to get \nserious about the budget and balance the budget in 7 years.\n  I will be meeting with Speaker Gingrich a little later this evening. \nI think the President's call does demonstrate that he has at least \nheard our pleas over the weekend and indicates a willingness to talk \nabout a balanced budget in 7 years, using CBO figures. Of course, he \nhas certain concerns that he feels are a priority, and we have concerns \nwe feel are a priority. I will not get into what we discussed about \nthose but to say I think it is a step in the right direction.\n  I want to thank the President for agreeing to sit down with the \nprincipals because I think it is time the principals become involved. \nIt is time for adult leadership. It is time for us to start making \ndecisions.\n  The American people want a balanced budget. They know the benefits of \na balanced budget, what it means in interest rates, what it means when \nyou buy a car, borrow money for a student loan, buy farm machinery, a \nhome, whatever. That is the purpose for this struggle for a balanced \nbudget and why we feel so determined it should be done.\n  Hopefully, there will be discussions yet today, but if not tonight, \nat least tomorrow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe I will yield the floor. Based \nupon what the Senate majority leader has said, if the President is \ngoing to start to sit down and negotiate the way he signed into law \nNovember 20 from the point of view of submitting a balanced budget, \nscored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--at least that is \nthe first good news we have had of reaching an agreement--there is no \npoint of my taking any more time to point out the shortcomings of the \nWhite House in not living up to the November 20 agreement that they \nsaid, albeit today, the 18th of December, November 20 until now, would \nbe 28 days. This was all supposed to be done by September 15. I am \nhappy to know the President would take that initiative and that we will \navoid the rhetoric and get down to real negotiating within that \nboundary of a balanced budget, scored by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  I do want to complete one point. I started the point on Medicare \nbecause I wanted to point out where the President had been condemning \nus, as cutting Medicare. This chart, again, is just illustrative of \nwhat the Senator from Utah has already said about 45 minutes ago. We \nare right now spending $178 billion on Medicare; we are going to \ngradually increase that expenditure up to $290 billion or thereabouts, \nmaybe a little over $300 billion by the end of this period that it \ntakes to balance a budget.\n  There is no way that in the Midwest where I come from any taxpayers \nthat I am ever going to talk to are ever going to consider that to be a \ncut. Just in case, for people who are cynical about those of us in \nCongress--and there is plenty of reason to be cynical, I know--I want \nto quote what President Clinton had to say about cuts versus increases \nlike this. He was referring to increases like this, but he was \nevidently having somebody say you are cutting Medicare. This is what \nthe President said on October 5, 1993, when he was commenting about the \nopposition of his saying he was cutting Medicare.\n\n       Medicare is going up at three times the rate of inflation. \n     We propose to let it go up two times the rate of inflation. \n     This is not a Medicare cut. So when you hear all this \n     business about cuts, lets me caution you this is not what is \n     going on. We are going to have increases in Medicare and \n     Medicaid, and a reduction in the rate of growth will be more \n     than overtaken by new investments that we are going to make.\n\n  That is the President as reported on ``MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour,'' \nOctober 5, 1993.\n  Nobody who is intellectually honest, if you are increasing things \ntwice the rate of inflation--Republicans are doing that, the President \nproposed to do that--if it was not a cut in 1993, it is not a cut in \n1995. If we are going to be sitting across the table from each other \nnegotiating, we ought to be able to do it in an intellectually honest \nway.\n  This is what the facts are, Mr. President. The facts are that we are \nvery dramatically increasing Medicare. It is not being cut. It is often \nbeing increased at the rate of inflation. If anyone wants to know how \nbillions of dollars affect them, they are getting $4,000 a year now, \nper beneficiary, per year, of Medicare recipients. This year, it will \nbe $7,100.\n  I hesitate to say that because there are a lot of constituents out \nthere like the one that the Senator from Utah read to us about who are \ngoing to be mad because we are not even freezing this. There are very \ndramatic increases.\n  I thank the President for coming forth. I hope this time we see real \nnegotiations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at one point in my business career I was \ncalled upon to act as a consultant to a firm that was having \ndifficulties. In Washington language, it had a deficit. In the language \nof the business world, it was losing money.\n  I sat down with the CEO of this company and we looked at the coming \nyear \n\n[[Page S18809]]\nand he had, as is always the case in an accounting circumstance, the \nfigure of what it was going to cost to keep the company doors open \nthroughout the year. The cost was going to be x number of dollars every \nmonth to meet the payroll, pay the overhead, the gas bill, the light \nbill, the rent, et cetera.\n  I knew what the margins were. For those who are not acquainted with \naccounting, ``margin'' means that portion of the sale price of your \ngoods that is not covered by the cost of goods. If you are selling a \nwidget for a dollar and you buy the widget for 60 cents from the widget \nmanufacturer, your margin is 40 cents, or 40 percent. This was a \nmanufacturer, so he had a pretty good handle on what his costs were for \nhis particular widget. He knew what the sales price was.\n  I looked at the size of his margin, as I recall it was around 30 \npercent, and then multiplied the number of widgets he was going to sell \nover the year by 30 percent and said to him, ``The total margin that \nyou have for the year is not enough to cover the monthly expenses that \nyou have in overhead to keep this place open. That is your problem.'' \nIt did not take an MBA from Harvard to figure that one out, but that is \nthe problem.\n  He came back a little while later and he had new projections. I \nlooked at his numbers and I noticed that he had done nothing to cut the \nmonthly expenses but he had raised the estimate of his sales. Now, 30 \npercent of that sales number was a number big enough to cover the \nmonthly expenses.\n  I said to him, ``How did you get there? This is wonderful. You now \nhave a projection that shows you are going to make a little money this \nyear.''\n  He said, ``Well, I went back to all the salespeople and I told them \nthat they were being too pessimistic and that they needed to take \nanother look at what they might be able to sell. And every one of them \nresponded wonderfully to my pep talk and everyone said, `We are going \nto sell this much more, we are going to sell this much more, we are \ngoing to sell this much more.' And now, you see, my company is \nprojected to make a profit.''\n  I said, ``That's terrific.''\n  And he said, ``Oh, I did something else. I raised the prices on some \nof my products. So a product that costs me 70 cents to make and I sell \nfor $1 and I have 30 cents of margin, now I am going to sell for $1.10, \nso I have 40 cents of margin. So, the combination of increased prices \nand increased projections brings my proposal for the coming year into \nbalance and we are going to make a profit this year.''\n  The first month passed. I looked at the reactions for the first \nmonth. His costs were right where they said they would be. But his \nsales were a little low.\n  ``Well,'' he said, ``we had bad weather in January. You cannot expect \nJanuary to be the real test. Wait, we are going to do just fine.''\n  February came in. His costs were right where they said they were \ngoing to be, but his sales were a little low.\n  ``Well,'' he said, ``we had a little trouble in February. We had \ndifficulty with suppliers and so on.''\n  I went out to talk to some of the people who were actually selling \nthe product and I said, ``What is happening?\"\n  They said, ``For one thing, we cannot get the increased prices. The \ncustomer won't pay $1.10 for these widgets. The customer is used to \npaying $1, and furthermore, the widget seller down the street only gets \n$1 for these widgets, so in order to get any sales at all we have to \ngive back this price increase. It is there in the projections but it's \nnot there in reality. Furthermore, the increased optimism in sales did \nnot come to pass either. We are selling at the same rate we sold last \nyear.''\n  I sat down with the CEO and I said, ``You now have 3 months in for \nthe year. If you take the sales pattern for those 3 months and \nextrapolate it over the whole year you are going to lose $1 million \nthis year, if you do not take $1 million out of your monthly costs.''\n  Well, taking $1 million out of his monthly costs meant firing some \npeople. He said to me, ``Some of these people have worked at this \ncompany for 20 years.'' He said to me, ``Some of these people are my \nbest friends. I have worked at this company for 20 years along with \nthem. We socialize together. Our wives know each other. I cannot do \nthat. They will lose their jobs.''\n  Mr. President, the year went on. At the end of the year the company \nlost $1 million. And I said, ``What are you going to do next year?''\n  ``Oh,'' he said, ``we are going to tighten down. Oh, boy, we are \ngoing to solve this problem.'' And the next year the company lost $3 \nmillion. Because they tried the same solution. Change projections and \nraise the prices but do not deal with your structural problem.\n\n  Does this sound familiar, Mr. President? I believe it is the \ndescription of what we are seeing with our Government right now. They \nlook at the structural costs and they say: We cannot do anything about \nthese structural costs. Let us change the forecasts to be more \noptimistic, like the forecasts of the sales force, and let us raise our \nprices, only in Government the way you raise prices is to raise tax \nrates.\n  The reason I harp on that is because--I gave a speech on this earlier \nbut I think it is worth repeating--Marty Feldstein, the economist, did \na study and an analysis of the President's tax increase passed in 1993. \nI put the analysis in the Congressional Record. People can find it. He \nanalyzed the revenue derived from that tax increase and found that it \nwas one-third the amount projected. Just as in the case of my business \nfriend, the people would not pay the extra price that he put on his \nproduct, so the people in the economy, when faced with increased tax \nrates, changed their behavior, changed their investment pattern, and \ndid not pay the taxes that it was projected that they would. And, \naccording to Dr. Feldstein, the revenue coming in to the Government was \none-third the revenue projected at the time all of this was made.\n  Why is all of this important? Because right now one of the things we \nare arguing about is who gets to make the projections? We are saying it \nought to be the Congressional Budget Office. The President is saying \nno, he wants to be like my businessman friend and have his own sales \nforce make the projections because it will make it look better.\n  People say to me, how can you be sure that the Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers will be right? I can be absolutely sure that the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers will be wrong, because nobody on \nthis planet has the capacity to look 7 years ahead and tell us what is \ngoing to happen to the economy with any degree of absolute certainty. \nThe best we can do is guess. And the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers are better guesses than the Office of Management and Budget \nnumbers, but they are guesses nonetheless. So, we must recognize that \ngoing in. But guesses are made and then people go ahead and do the best \nthey can.\n  In the case of the business I have talked about, investors took one \nlook at the accuracy of the guesses that were being made and they made \nan investment decision. They sold the stock. And the price of the stock \nwent down.\n\n  That is the key to this whole debate, Mr. President, because up until \nnow the market--that is, the people that do the trading on the bond \nmarket, the people that do the trading on the stock market referred to \ncollectively as the market--has looked at the numbers and the \nprojections, and the suggestions that have all come out of this \nCongress. They have bet that it is all going to work, that the \nRepublican proposal is going to pass, that we are going to get a \nbalanced budget, that we are going to get the benefits that the Senator \nfrom Iowa was talking about, and the stock market is up 40 percent year \nover year, and the bond market has seen interest rates drop 2 full \npoints since the Republicans were elected in November of 1994.\n  Over the weekend when the President did not come forward with a \nproposal, and when the congressional leadership responded by saying \nthere is no point in talking anymore, for the first time the signal was \nsent to the market that the fix might not occur. And today the stock \nmarket dropped 100 points--just as the investors could not tell with \nany exactness how much money the company I was talking about was going \nto lose but they could sure tell the trend, and sold the stock on the \ntrend.\n  The market today cannot tell us with exactness what is going to \nhappen in 7 years. But they are worried about the trend. And the trend \nis signs of business as usual around here, signs of solving the budget \nbalance issue by \n\n[[Page S18810]]\nchanging the forecasts around here, signs of talking about the thing \nbeing taken care of in the outyears, and no action being taken right \nnow around here. And they do not like it, and they are selling the \nstock. They are selling their investment in America because they \nbelieve for the first time that we may not be successful in our effort \nto get a balanced budget.\n  I learned in private business that the market can be ruthless. The \nmarket can be unfair. But long term the market is the best barometer of \nall of what is finally going to happen.\n  We had a serious signal today, Mr. President. The market is telling \nus to get our act together, and make this happen--not with phony \nestimates, and not with price increases that do not ever come to pass \nin terms of actual revenue but with firm resolve to deal with the \nstructural costs built into our balance.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, with this analogy that illustrates what it \nis we must do. I was watching television about a week ago. There was a \ntribute on television to the memory of the late Jack Benny. I remember \nlaughing at Jack Benny when I was a preteenager. Some people may not \nremember Jack Benny. But I remember him very, very fondly. In this \ntribute to Jack Benny they told a classic Jack Benny joke. Jack Benny, \nas you will recall, Mr. President, built his persona around his \nstinginess and his unwillingness to spend money.\n  So here is the joke. Jack Benny went in to see his doctor. And the \ndoctor looked at the x rays and said, ``Mr. Benny, you need an \noperation, and it is going to cost you $400.'' And Jack Benny responded \nby saying, ``Doctor, for $25 can't you just touch up the x ray?''\n  Mr. President, that is what we are being told now. ``Can't we just \ntouch up the estimates? Can't we just touch up the forecasts, and avoid \nthe pain of actually having to deal with the balanced budget? After \nall, we have been doing that for 35 years.''\n  You can find Presidents, Republican and Democrat, all the way back to \nHarry Truman who have promised balanced budgets sometime, promised \nbalanced budgets in the outyears, promised balanced budgets down the \nroad, far enough away that, if you just touch up the estimates a \nlittle, we can convince ourselves that we do not have to do anything \nnow.\n  Well, Mr. President, we do. And it is wonderful to say touch up the x \nray for 25 bucks. But the underlying problem that the x ray tells us \nabout is still there, and the operation dealing with it is still \nrequired. And if ever there was a signal coming to us as strong as \nanything that the retribution for our failure to act will be severe, it \nwas in today's 100-point drop in value in the Dow as the market says \nfor the first time we are beginning to get nervous about your \nwillingness to do what you have said you will do.\n  If it is necessary for us to be here on New Year's Eve, this Senator \nwill be here on New Year's Eve. My wife is not going to be happy to \nhear me say that because she is in Utah, and I am not too happy about \nher being there alone because she has the credit cards, and she is \ndoing all of the shopping. But if that is what it takes, that is what \nwe will do because the stakes are too high, and the eventual \nresponsibility is too great for us today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened with a great deal of \ninterest to my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah, and my \nfriend from Iowa as well, talk about the challenges that we are facing \non the balanced budget.\n  I am always mindful of the fact that under the recommendations of \nPresident Clinton in 1993 we saw an $800 billion reduction in our \ndeficit. So we have someone who has been serious about trying to do \nsomething and has a record of achievement.\n  Still out there--in terms of the proposals that are advanced by our \ngood friends and colleagues--I was listening carefully to see if they \nwould talk about their tax cut of $245 billion and the additional kinds \nof costs that are going to be out there for our elderly people of $275 \nbillion. That is still out there, and still on the table. It is a \ncentral part of the differences which are out there. The fact that \nthere are those on the other side of the aisle that want to use those \nMedicare savings for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals has been \ntalked about. It is an issue. We do not hear a great deal of discussion \nabout it on the Senate floor today, or this afternoon, or even by the \nnegotiators, and the benefits that will go to the wealthiest \nindividuals.\n  Also, there is a significant tax increase. We do not hear very much \nabout that. Who is the tax increase on? It is on those workers who are \nmaking $28,000 a year or less. We hear often expressed here on the \nfloor of the Senate by our good Republican friends saying let us get \nmore money and put it in the pockets of the people at home who know \nbetter how to spend it than the Federal Government. I do not understand \nwhy that argument does not go for working families in this country, \nthose that want to work and provide for their families. They have some \nEITC, the earned income tax credit, basically trying to help working \nfamilies who are moving out of the challenges of the economic \nstagnation which is taking place today to help offset some of the \nincreases in Social Security and Medicare figures--some $32 billion to \n$34 billion tax increase on those working families. We do not hear very \nmuch about that.\n\n  That really gets to the heart of the difference. That is, can we have \na program--and I believe that we can--that will balance the budget in 7 \nyears, and also meet the fundamental test of fairness.\n  As the President has pointed out, and any one of us can point out, \nanyone can reach a balanced budget just by slashing and cutting--\ncutting Medicare, cutting Social Security. Oh, yes. That is what we are \ndoing in cutting Social Security when we talk about collapsing the COLA \nfor our senior citizens. That is what we are talking about. We are \ntalking about real cuts in Social Security--cutting back on the \nprotection for children, cutting back on the nutrition program, cutting \nback in immunization programs, cutting back on day care programs for \nworking families that are trying to make ends meet. This is about \npriorities. I think that the President has stated not just his \npriorities but the American people's priorities in terms of placing \nhigh on that list of priorities the interest of our seniors who receive \nMedicare.\n  Let us not forget about the average person that receives Medicare is \n73 years old, more likely than not a widow, is receiving about $10,000 \na year of which their health care costs are about 20 percent of that \nout of pocket, living alone with diabetes or arthritis and probably \nvery cold alone over these past few weeks, when we were trying to find \nsome release and opportunity if they are living in the colder parts of \nthis country because of the drop in temperature and the failure of \nfunding the fuel assistance program. Eighty percent of that fuel \nassistance goes to families with $10,000 a year or less in income.\n\n  That is who we are talking about. Those are real families. Those are \nreal people. I am worried about the stock market, but, quite frankly, I \nam worried about the senior citizens. I am worried about the children. \nI am worried about the young people who want to try to go on and \nreceive an education. I am concerned about that worker, to make sure \nthat work is going to be respected and recognized and rewarded here in \nthe United States. We have done that under Republicans and Democrats in \nthe past.\n  Yet, we are seeing all of those interests challenged under the \nproposal basically, what I consider a scorched-Earth policy in terms of \nthe Republican balanced budget amendment. I think all of us welcome the \nnew opportunities and the new advances that the President is making. I \nwas listening to the importance of maybe staying here New Year's Eve. \nMany of us were meeting all afternoon on Sunday and Saturday as well in \ntrying to find some common ground. That is certainly what the President \nis interested in. We joined \n\n[[Page S18811]]\nwith him in trying to find that ground, and I think important progress \nhas been made.\n  But it will be useful to find out, quite frankly, in the various \nactions that are taken by the majority in this Congress about how they \nare holding the 250,000 workers, Federal workers hostage to these \nnegotiations. They are innocent bystanders trying to do a good day's \nwork in servicing people in this country and yet they are the ones who \nare left out and left behind through no fault of their own, many of \nthem with long and distinguished careers and a commitment to public \nservice. They effectively are being told, no, we are going to hold them \nhostage until they are going to finally yield to our position.\n  That I think is one that the country does not find to be \nsatisfactory. What they want is action; that is what is needed at this \ntime, but action that is going to preserve the best of our values and \npriorities. And those priorities are expressed in respecting the \nelderly people who have made this country the great country it is.\n  And the principal reason for that is very simple. It is a recognition \nthat when people get on into their golden years, their incomes are \ngoing to go down and their health needs are going to go up. It is true \ntoday. It was true in 1965 and 1964 when Democratic administrations \nbattled for it. It is true today.\n  To put those seniors at risk is not in the interest of this Nation, \nand the budget can be balanced without doing that. We do not have to \nsacrifice the interests of working families by escalating their tax \nobligations through increased taxes in the EITC. We do not have to put \nat risk further the children of this Nation with the cutbacks in \nsupport programs for Head Start, the programs that reach out to the \nschools, that help with math and science. We do not have to cut back \nfor the sons and daughters of working families that want to go on to \ntheir universities and schools across this country. We should not kill \ntheir hopes and dreams. We know that every dollar that is cut in \neducation will be repaid three or four times with additional kinds of \nsocial service. We know that the best investment that this country made \nwas in the cold war GI bill. For every dollar invested in the education \nof those veterans that came from all parts of the country, men and \nwomen alike, was $8 returned to the Treasury--a pretty sound \ninvestment. Nonetheless, the budget of the other side cuts those \nprograms.\n\n  All we are saying is, sure, we can reach the common ground, but we \nalso have to reach it in preserving the kind of priorities that the \nAmerican family holds dear.\n  We have in the Chamber this evening, I see my friend and colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, who was really the leader in the Senate in making \nsure that scarce resources were advanced out to the senior citizens and \nneedy families all over this country. I can say to him and to President \nClinton that New Englanders, whether they are in Maine, New Hampshire, \nVermont, Massachusetts, throughout New England, so many families \ntonight know they are going to have a better, warmer Christmas because \nof the release by the President, letting forth the low-income fuel \nassistance, which is of such desperate importance.\n  How tragic it was to be reminded just the other day, once again, in \nour forums that we have held on some of these cutbacks of the children. \nThe schoolteachers testified a noticeable body-weight reduction in \nchildren happens every single year as the temperature decreases. You \ncan almost measure the impact on children in many of the schools in the \nneediest parts of the country, in rural and urban areas. The weight \ngoes down. The children are not being fed. The choice is being made at \nhome between food on the table and heat for those children.\n  In the testimony by some of those wonderful teachers in a number of \ndifferent schools they talked about how at this time of the year, when \nthe cold comes, they are followed up and down the corridors, small \nchildren grabbing their hands and asking whether they have something to \neat and if that individual teacher has more. They say, can you give us \nsomething more because I have a brother or sister home.\n  That is happening. That is happening. And we went to briefings today \nin terms of where the nutrition program is going. It is going down, not \nup. It is going to make the problem more intense, not less.\n  So for those who have slick, easy, quick answers for these issues, I \nhope they will think hard and long about these judgments and these \ndecisions.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as one, like 99 others, who cares deeply \nabout this arrangement, I am troubled by the fact that we are not \nhaving really the fair allocation of belt tightening across this \ncountry as we will see over the period of the 7 years--$400 million \nwhich is in there today, in the budget in terms of tax expenditures. \nOthers call that corporate welfare. That will go up $4.4 trillion over \nthe next 7 years--$4.4 trillion--and the various proposals that are \ngoing to be advanced before us are going to index that so that every \nsingle tax loophole can be preserved over that period of time.\n\n  Sure, we are going to try to find $30 or $40 billion, and that is \ncertainly a worthwhile effort, but we are talking about $4.4 trillion. \nWe are quite prepared to index all those tax revenues, including the \nbillionaire's tax loophole. Those are the billionaires that renounce \ntheir citizenship so they can avoid paying taxes.\n  We voted on that on two different occasions with over 90 Democrats \nand Republicans. Pull that out of the balance. Pull that out of the \nbudget. The door is hardly closed in that conference when they put it \nright back in. You wonder how we are going to do the public's business \non some of this. There is no indication that they are prepared to drop \nthat provision, no suggestion that they are prepared to try to do \nsomething about Medicare; that they are trying to do something about \nchildren; that they are trying to do something about these priorities.\n  So we understand the complexities and the difficulties that the \nPresident has, and he is working through those and doing it with the \ninterests and the needs of the American people in mind. But it is one \nthat bears careful watching and defies an easy and simple solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18810-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18811-S18812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment that I \noppose the conference report on the Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996. There are many good provisions in this bill that \ndeserve the support of the Senate. But they are outweighed by other \nprovisions which, if enacted, would damage American security, waste \ntaxpayers dollars, and treat our servicemen and women unfairly.\n  I voted against this bill when it passed the Senate in September. We \nthen began a conference with the House that I hoped would produce a \nbetter bill. The conference lasted over 3 months, and now it has \nproduced an even worse bill.\n  One of the most serious defects in the bill is its provisions on \nballistic missile defense, which would call upon the United States to \nviolate the ABM Treaty.\n  A compromise on this issue was painstakingly worked out by Senators \nWarner, Cohen, Nunn, and Levin, with broad Senate support and the \napproval of the administration. This was a carefully crafted \ncompromise, and as we began the conference, Secretary Perry made clear \nthat any substantial deviation which violates U.S. commitments under \nthe ABM Treaty would be unacceptable. Yet the conference provision \nabandons that compromise.\n  It threatens United States security because it undermines the ABM \nTreaty, and because it is also likely to prevent Russian implementation \nof the START I Treaty, and ratification of the START II Treaty.\n  These treaties would reduce the number of Russian strategic nuclear \nweapons threatening the United States from 10,000 to 3,500. This \nreduction would increase U.S. security from nuclear attack to a much \ngreater degree than the illusory security offered by the multibillion-\ndollar missile defense system mandated by this legislation.\n  I am also concerned about several additional issues related to the \nshipbuilding provisions in the bill. We have examined these provisions \nin detail in \n\n[[Page S18812]]\nour Seapower Subcommittee, and I believe they will cause uncertainty, \ninefficiency, and unnecessary expenditures in the Department's \nshipbuilding program.\n  The provisions on the development and procurement of submarines \nreject a sensible submarine program formulated by the Senate for the \nnext generation new attack submarine. Instead, the bill requires the \nNavy to submit a new plan for submarine development and construction to \nbuild four submarines. Each one, according to the bill, is to be ``more \ncapable and more affordable'' than its predecessor without further \ndefinition.\n  Our experience on the Seapower Subcommittee makes clear that it is a \ndifficult feat to build a new system that is both more capable and more \naffordable than the preceding system. This bill calls for a plan to do \nthat four times in 4 years with attack submarines, a very mature \ntechnology.\n  The bill language does not call for the Navy's report to consider the \ncosts and risks associated with such a plan. We gain nothing if we end \nup with a plan for cheaper and more capable submarines, if they involve \nrisky technologies that fail to work or, even worse, endanger the lives \nof our submarine personnel by reducing safety standards.\n  This provision also establishes a new, independent congressional \npanel on submarine development. On the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nthe Seapower Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Cohen, oversees submarine \ndevelopment. There is no need for another panel, for more bureaucracy, \nfor further review of an issue that is already handled very well by the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  In addition, this bill contains language that earmarks contracts for \nthe construction of Aegis destroyers and sealift ships at specified \nshipyards. These provisions force the Navy to award contracts without \nthe benefit of competition, without the ability to decide the merits of \neach case at the time of the award.\n  If there are good reasons, such as industrial base concerns for \ndesignating particular ship contracts for particular shipyards, the \nNavy will come to Congress and tell us what they are. But Congress \nshould not take this action on its own without clear and compelling \njustification.\n  Mr. President, also included in this bill is the authorization of $20 \nmillion for Cyclone patrol boats. These craft were not authorized in \neither the House or the Senate bill. The Special Operations Forces, \nwhich use these ships, did not request them either. There is no need \nfor them, and this authorization should not have been included.\n  Further, the bill prohibits the Defense Department from buying \nforeign produced roll-on/roll-off ships for the Ready Reserve Force. \nMeeting the force's requirement of five ships using upgraded foreign-\nbuilt hulls will cost a total of $150 million. The cost of using \ndomestically produced hulls will be between $1 and $1.5 billion, well \nbeyond the amount budgeted for this purpose.\n  Given this massive cost differential, the choice is not merely \nbetween buying used, foreign-built ships and new, U.S.-built ships. It \nis also likely to be a choice between meeting our well-established lift \nrequirements and accepting a continuing strategic sealift shortfall.\n  I am also concerned about the provision in this bill that relates to \nthe health and well being of our men and women in uniform. One \nobjectionable provision in this bill calls for the mandatory separation \nof service members found to be HIV-positive. This provision is an \nespecially flagrant example of discrimination against a group of loyal \nservice members.\n  The Defense Department has made clear its opposition to this \nrequirement. It has repeatedly expressed support for its current \npolicy, which allows service members with any disease or disability to \ncontinue to serve as long as they can fulfill their duties and pose no \ndanger to themselves or their fellow service work members. The military \nhas full authority to separate or retire individuals who are unfit for \nduty.\n  Individuals with other debilitating diseases, such as hepatitis, \ncancer, diabetes, asthma, or acute heart disease, are not automatically \ndischarged from the service. This bill singles out only those who are \nHIV-positive, and there is no justification for that discrimination.\n  We raised this issue with the Senate conferees and asked for a vote \non whether to insist on the Senate position opposing this provision but \nwe were denied that opportunity to do so on this and many other issues.\n  This bill is supposed to address the defense needs of the United \nStates. Discharging qualified service men and women from our Armed \nForces simply because they are HIV-positive serves no national defense \nneed. The Defense Department has certified this point. This blatantly \ndiscriminatory provision has no place in this bill.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that prohibits \nservice women based overseas from obtaining abortions with their own \nprivate funds in U.S. military medical facilities. We have always \nprovided this access to our service women to ensure that they have the \nsame quality health care available to those on duty in the United \nStates.\n  This prohibition discriminates against women serving their country by \npreventing them from exercising their constitutionally protected right \nto choose when they are stationed overseas. This added restriction \nendangers their health, since alternative local facilities in other \nnations are often inadequate or unavailable.\n  Under the bill's provision, a woman stationed overseas facing an \nunintended pregnancy may be forced to delay the procedure for several \nweeks, until she can travel to a location where adequate care is \navailable. For each month an abortion is delayed, the risk to health \nincreases.\n  As we continue to struggle over balancing the budget and meeting \nimportant national priorities, this bill provides $7 billion more for \ndefense spending than requested by the administration for the current \nfiscal year.\n  At a time when families are going without heat in the winter because \nof cuts in the LIHEAP program, when aid to education is being cut, when \nMedicaid and Medicare are being cut in order to provide a tax break for \nwealthy Americans, it makes no sense to force billions of dollars more \non the Pentagon than it wants or needs.\n  It is a bad bill. I urge the Senate to defeat it, send it back to \nconference, and ask the conferees to remedy these numerous and serious \ndefects.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I shall only speak for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18811-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18812-S18814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE BUDGET AND ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR THE POOR AND ELDERLY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wanted to respond to some of my colleagues that had \nspoken earlier, and I will try to do this in a very substantive way. \nWhen colleagues speak and then they have to leave because they have \nother engagements, I think what you need to do is respond but in a very \ncivil way, because you do not really have an opportunity for the debate \nwhen we are not all on the floor at the same time.\n  Let me first of all thank Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts for his \nkind remarks about the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I \nwould like to thank the administration as well for releasing these \nfunds on Sunday.\n  Many people called from Minnesota today. Mr. President, this is a \ngood example of a program that really affects people's lives. It is not \na lot of money nationwide for the whole country. It is about $1 \nbillion. And for Minnesota--it is a cold weather State, I say to my \ncolleague who is presiding from North Carolina, a little colder than \nNorth Carolina right now, though I think the Presiding Officer has some \npretty chilly weather.\n  The problem is that for all too many people in my State, elderly, \nfamilies with children, there were people who just could not afford the \nheat. And \n\n[[Page S18813]]\nthey have relied upon this small grant, which really was more of a \nsurvival supplement than an income supplement. It is called a cold \nweather lifeline program. We had situations that were being reported by \nthe newspapers and by television, and I met with some of the families \nwhere people were trying to heat their homes by turning on their oven \nor people were just living in one room. It is very cold. It is about 8 \ndegrees above zero, actually warmer today, but had been around 8 \ndegrees above zero last weekend. Two weekends ago it was a 50-below \nwind chill.\n  So it is extremely important to get some assistance out to people. We \ndo not want people to go cold in America. None of us does. I thank the \nPresident for releasing that money. It makes a huge difference.\n\n  Mr. President, my disagreement--and I think it is a profound \ndisagreement--with some of my colleagues about where we are at this \nmoment in Washington is two or threefold. First of all, the Government \nshutdown, I do not think it is necessary. I think it is quite \nindependent of what decisions we make about what kind of a budget we \nhave over the next 7 years and how we balance that budget. I mean these \nare big decisions. They are choices we make.\n  We have some real sharp differences among us. I think we should \ncontinue to negotiate. I hope we can reach agreement. But I do not \nthink the Government should be shut down. I think that is just sort of \nexerting leverage at its worst, and I think a lot of innocent people \nare being asked to pay the price. It is inappropriate, and I hope that \nno later than tomorrow we will go forward with a continuing resolution \nand we will continue to go forward with the negotiations on how it is \nyou balance the budget.\n  My second point is priorities. Talking about the energy assistance \nprogram, on the House side for the future it has been eliminated. This \nis the other debate. The total cost of this program to make sure people \ndo not go cold in America is less than one B-2 bomber. The Pentagon is \ntelling us they do not need all the B-2 bombers that have been funded \nover the next number of years in the Pentagon budget.\n  So, Mr. President, I really believe that the debate is about \nbalancing the budget, not so much whether we should or not. I think \nthat all of us--and there is plenty of blame to pass around if you look \nat how this massive debt was built up. We are not even paying the debt \noff, we are trying to pay the interest off on the debt. That is what we \nare really talking about when we talk about balancing the budget. But \nthe real question is how do we do it and whether or not it is based \nupon what I would call a Minnesota standard of fairness.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you, I would agree with the commentator \nKevin Phillips, who two mornings ago essentially said, as I remember, \nthat he thought that this balanced budget proposal on the part of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle actually was not a serious \neffort to balance the budget. It was more about tax cuts or tax \ngiveaways for wealthy people in the main and, in addition, \neviscerating, ending safety net programs in this country for the most \nvulnerable citizens and very good for the bondholders.\n  I think he is right. The reason I think Kevin Phillips is right--and \nI paraphrased his analysis, it is not a direct quote--is because there \nare all sorts of ways in which we can balance the budget, but it is \ninteresting how much has been taken off the table. I say to people in \nthe country who might be listening to this debate right now that when \nmy colleagues talk about balancing the budget, one piece they leave out \nis the whole Pentagon budget.\n  Here we are in a post-cold-war period, there is no longer a Soviet \nUnion, and we are talking about $245 billion plus for the Pentagon \nbudget--star wars, Stealth bomber, Trident submarine, lots of money \nspent on military forces to protect many countries in Western Europe \nand in Asia.\n  I think that can be changed and scaled down with no threat to our \nnational security, and it should be. As a matter of fact, the real \nnational security of our country is not more Stealth bombers, more star \nwars; the real national security is jobs and adequate housing and \naffordable child care and decent transportation for people who live in \nour communities. The national security of the United States of America \nis the security of our local communities where people do not have to \nworry so much about the violence and the crime, where they have some \nconfidence their children are going to good schools, where they can \nbelieve their children will do well economically, where they have \ndecent jobs at decent wages, where they can look forward to a pension \nand, yes, where they do not have to worry about health care costs as \nthey become elderly. That is the real national security.\n  There is all this money on bombers and missiles and all of the rest, \nno reductions in the Pentagon budget, at the same time you have these \ndeep reductions in nutrition programs for children, for God's sake. I \nthink the Democrats are doing too much in that area, but it is a huge \ndifference from what I see the Republicans are doing in cuts in \neducation and cuts in health care, whether they be Medicare or whether \nthey be medical assistance or whether they be environmental protection.\n  People in our country, I think, want to see us fiscally responsible. \nThey want to see us get serious about getting our economic act \ntogether. But there is a sense of fairness that people have in the \ncountry, and that is what is so wrong with this budget proposal that we \nhave had before us, and that is why the President of the United States \nis doing exactly what he should do and which the vast majority of \npeople want him to do. I think he commands a tremendous amount of \nrespect for this, because what he is saying is, ``There are ways to \nbalance the budget and there are ways to balance the budget, and I am \ninterested in doing that, and I make a commitment to doing that, but \nI'm not going to do it if it means hurting children; I am not going to \ndo it if it means taking away the quality of health care for elderly \npeople; I'm not going to do it if it means we are moving away from a \ncommitment we made as a national community to make sure there is care \nfor the elderly or disabled or those people in nursing homes; I am not \nmoving away from protection of the environment; and I am not moving \naway from the earned income tax credit which has been so important in \nencouraging families with incomes under $28,000 a year to work and \nprovides people with incentives to work.''\n\n  He is on the mark.\n  I just say to the Chair, and I say to my colleagues, if you want to \nbalance the budget, you have to do it based on some standard of \nfairness. You cannot target so many of the cuts at working families, \nmiddle-income people, low-income people and, at the same time, have so \nmany of these multinational corporations and the most wealthy citizens \nand the military contractors all essentially not asked to tighten their \nbelts. It makes no sense by any standard of fairness, which I think the \nvast majority of people in this country are committed to. That is what \nthis debate is all about.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. I will not. I just simply wanted \nto, as long as we are having some discussion tonight on the floor of \nthe Senate, inject a somewhat different perspective than the ones I \nheard from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle. I guess \nif I had a Hanukkah wish, being an American Jew and Hanukkah started \nlast night, if I had a Hanukkah wish, much less Christmas wish, it \nwould be that we tomorrow reach an agreement that there will be a \ncontinuing resolution, the Government will not be shut down. We should \nnot have people who are really worried about being able to make a \nliving not being able to work.\n  We, of course, are involved in negotiations in good faith. We are not \ngoing to resolve these major questions in the next 3 days, but we will \nresolve these questions, hopefully, over the next month. I think we \nhave to be involved in serious negotiations, substantive negotiations \nand good-faith negotiations, and if the differences are irreconcilable, \nthen I suppose those differences and what people think about the \nposition we take, as opposed to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, the differences between President Clinton and Speaker Newt \nGingrich will be resolved in the election.\n  But I do not think we should continue to hold a lot of people \nhostage. I do not think we should continue to \n\n[[Page S18814]]\nmake a lot of innocent people pay the price.\n  So my hope is that tomorrow there is no more Government shutdown; \nthat tomorrow we look forward to substantive negotiations in good \nfaith, honest debate, not hate, with civility, trying to reach an \nagreement. These are big decisions we are going to make that are going \nto affect our country going into the next century. We ought to do it \nthoughtfully, carefully, and if we can reach an agreement in January, \ngreat, and if we cannot reach an agreement, then maybe, in fact, the \ndifferences are irreconcilable. Then the people of the country can make \nthe decision. That is the way it is supposed to be in a democracy.\n\n  Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas. I hope we soon get home to be with \nour loved ones. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see on the floor the esteemed senior \nSenator from Rhode Island. I will be happy to yield to my senior \ncolleague if he wishes to speak. I am going to take 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my friend very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do not believe there is justification for \nthe partial shutdown of the Federal Government. It is really occurring \nonly because of a widely perceived and grossly exaggerated assumption \nthat the long-term Federal budget must be concluded in the same \ntimeframe as the annual appropriations bills.\n  There is no real basis for a linkage between the two beyond the \nbudget for the current fiscal year. The fact that there is an \nassumption of linkage beyond that point is, at best, an artful strategy \nor, at worst, a hoax on the public and on our democratic Government. \nAppropriations and reconciliation are two completely different \nprocesses.\n  On the one hand, it is notable that significant agreement already has \nbeen reached on a great many major reductions in Government \nexpenditures in the 13 major appropriations bills that have been or are \nbeing processed. But they are all badly behind schedule, through no \nfault of our President, and six of them are heavily burdened by \nextraneous provisions dealing with matters like striker replacement and \nthe abortion issue--matters that should be addressed in separate \nlegislation on their own merits. And now the passage of interim \nspending authority has been arbitrarily made a condition of budget \nreconciliation.\n  But the reconciliation process is an entirely separate matter. Unlike \nthe appropriations process, the failure of which leads to a cutoff of \ncurrent funding, the reconciliation process is not driven by immediate \nneed. Absent passage of a reconciliation bill, current law stands. The \nGovernment continues to operate at existing levels until reasonable \nagreement can be reached about changed priorities and a new level of \ncommitment.\n  That the two processes were declared to be compressed into the same \ntimeframe is simply a transparent device to force acceptance of policy \nchoices that are not in accord with the priorities of the American \npeople or the President.\n  The second continuing resolution passed in November tightened the \ntime frame by specifying that a 7-year balanced budget plan should be \nenacted in the first session of this Congress, which presumably ends \nJanuary 2. But the remaining period of 2 weeks includes the traditional \nholiday season and it seems to me that any comprehensive solution \nforced this week would inevitably be flawed by haste.\n  Mr. President, the time for budgetary hostage-taking is over. The \ncountry will not stand for it and both parties put themselves at risk \nof public rejection because of what appears to be petty and small-\nminded squabbling.\n  As I see it, the solution must come in two separate steps:\n  First, the appropriations process must be concluded without any \nfurther delay. All remaining bills should be sent to the President \nforthwith in whatever form a majority can approve. Vetoed bills should \nbe returned promptly so that revised versions can be enacted. A \nrealistic continuing resolution should be passed providing funding \nauthority at least until January 12 to allow for the process of \nrevising and repassing vetoed legislation.\n  Second, separately, the terms of the second continuing resolution \nmust be modified to provide for an expanded time frame for \nreconciliation extending into the second session. The President is \nentitled to adequate opportunity to secure the best budget he can \nobtain that will reflect his highest priorities, while still honoring \nthose of the congressional majority. As a practical matter, it will be \nnecessary to reach closure on at least the first stages of a long range \nbudget by the statutory date for presentation of the fiscal year 1997 \nbudget by the first Monday in February.\n  Mr. President, I offer these views from a vantage point of some \ndetachment. I have not endorsed the idea of a balanced budget and I do \nnot subscribe to the mantra that it should be achieved in the arbitrary \ntimeframe of 7 years.\n  I do believe we should curb deficit spending, and that includes \nborrowing to pay for a tax cut. And I do not believe the agenda of the \nUnited States should be set by a willful subgroup of the House \nmajority.\n  Clearly, we all are going to have to give ground. We in the minority, \nfor example, must acknowledge more candidly the need for constraints on \nthe Federal medical programs. The majority must relent their drive to \ncurtail great advances we have made in social legislation, particularly \neducation. And both sides, I believe, must acknowledge the patent \nfutility of cutting taxes at the very time we seek to curtail deficits.\n  Tax cuts must be deferred for the present, even if it means a delay \nin more favorable treatment for capital gains, and I support more \nfavorable treatment for capital gains.\n  I think the image that the country has of us is that of children \nsquabbling. I hope the sooner we can get down to business and reach a \ncompromise, the better off we are. Plus the Government only moves when \nthere is compromise. And in this case we are denying it the opportunity \nto work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I was asked by our floor leader, Senator \nDorgan, to come to the floor and offer my views on what is going on \nwith the impasse now facing us.\n  First, I think it is important to recognize how well the country is \ndoing. We tend to hear so much negativism about our country. The fact \nof the matter is that our country is doing remarkably well \neconomically. Why do I say that? We have had the lowest inflation and \nunemployment in some 40 years. Mr. President, we have had corporate \nprofits that have never been higher. They have sometimes been as high, \nbut never higher. We have economic growth that is as good as it has \nbeen since the days of John Kennedy. The stock market has been going up \nsignificantly. There have been some people crying out that it went down \ntoday. Well, there have been adjustments coming. Any stock forecaster \nwould tell you that there would be adjustments. It happens toward the \nend of the year every year. With this remarkable climb we have had in \nthe stock market, it is not unexpected.\n\n  I also say, Mr. President, that we have heard a lot in years gone by \nabout Government being too big. I think those of us in this Chamber \nwould acknowledge that Government has gotten too big. But what has \nhappened in the last 2\\1/2\\ years? We have 175,000 fewer Federal \nemployees today than we had 2\\1/2\\ years ago, excluding the military. I \nthink that is pretty good. I think it speaks well of what has happened \nin this Government and in this country in the last several years. Now, \nwe have not done enough, but let us talk about the good things that are \nhappening in the country.\n  This economy is on fire. It is doing great. What about the so-called \nCR, the continuing resolution? It is something the American public \nhears all the time. Why are we talking about a CR, a continuing \nresolution? We are talking about a continuing resolution because, each \nyear, by the first of October, we \n\n[[Page S18815]]\nhave 13 appropriations bills we are supposed to pass. It takes 13 \nappropriations bills to allow our Government to function during the \nyear. We have a yearly appropriation for those 13 different \nsubcommittees. Well, this year, we did not do our work. I say, \nrespectfully, that it is the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate that has not allowed the bills to pass.\n  The last time we had a Government shutdown, 26 days ago, 850,000 \npeople were out of work. We were able to pass, since then, a number of \nbills, especially the Defense appropriations bill. As a result of that, \nwe have approximately 500,000 fewer employees that are subject to being \nfurloughed now than we did then. I wish the 250,000 did not have to be, \nand they should not be. But it is the result of the appropriations \nbills not passing. It has nothing to do with a balanced budget. It has \nnothing to do with increased taxes or lower taxes. It has to do with \nthe fact that this body and the other body--the House and the Senate--\nhave not done their work. We are at this budget impasse now as a result \nof the appropriations bills not having been passed.\n  Much of the rhetoric, Mr. President, has focused on who gets what and \nwhy do they get it? I think we need to look at what Kevin Phillips \nsaid, who is a Republican political analyst. He said a number of \nthings, but about 6 weeks ago, he said this, and it was at the time \nthis budget fiasco was very heated:\n\n       Spending on Government programs, from Medicare and \n     education to home heating oil assistance, is to be reduced in \n     ways that principally burden the poor and the middle class, \n     while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways that \n     predominantly benefit the top one or two percent of \n     Americans.\n\n  This is not something that some wild-eyed liberal Democrat said. This \nis not something any Democrat said. This is a Republican, who is noted \nin Washington for being hard on Democrats when necessary, and hard on \nRepublicans when he feels it is appropriate. With this budget battle \nthat is going on, he feels it is appropriate to lay the cards out where \nthey exist. Who benefits from the budget proposal the Republicans have \ngiven us? The top 1 or 2 percent of Americans. Who is burdened? The \nmiddle class and the poor.\n  Much of the rhetoric, as I have indicated in the debate over the \nbudget, has focused on numbers: OMB versus CBO. What I would like to \ntalk tonight about is not Medicaid, even though there is certainly room \nto talk about that. I am not going to talk about education and how my \nsenior colleague, who just left the room, has done as much as any \nperson who ever served in the Legislature on a national basis to direct \nattention to education, or how the programs the Republican leadership \nhave given us affects education negatively. I am not going to talk \nabout that at any length tonight. I am going to talk, Mr. President, \nabout Medicare and how important Medicare is.\n  The budget we have been given from the Republican leadership says \nthey want to cut $270 billion. That is the bill the President vetoed--\n$270 billion in Medicare cuts. I think it is interesting to note--and I \ndo not think it is coincidental--that we have $270 billion in Medicare \ncuts and $245 billion approximately in tax cuts. Who do those tax cuts \nbenefit? The top 1 or 2 percent of Americans. We need to eliminate the \ndeficit. There is no question about that. We need to eliminate the \ndeficits and, I think, do something about the debt, the $5 trillion \nthat has accumulated. I do not think we can rest on our laurels, that \nthere has been general agreement to balance the budget in 7 years \nbecause, by then, we will have another $l.5 trillion in debt that we \nare going to have to pass on to my grandchildren and their children. I \nhope, Mr. President, that we will be concerned about not the deficit--\nas we should be--but how about being concerned about the debt, the $5 \ntrillion that we owe?\n  It is easy to debate these numbers, the deficit, which we continually \ntalk about, and ignore the debt. I would rather, instead of having $245 \nbillion in tax cuts, which help the top 1 or 2 percent of Americans, we \ntake that money and apply it toward the debt, the accumulated $5 \ntrillion. That would make a significant dent in the debt--$245 billion.\n  What is often missing from the debate when we talk about all these \nnumbers, Mr. President, is the policy argument. What are the policy \nramifications of what each side is attempting to do? Will the decisions \nwe reach today affect all Americans tomorrow? If so, in what way will \nthese decisions be felt by the American public? It is this often \nunspoken question we fail to communicate in our efforts to assemble a \nbalanced budget plan.\n\n  Both sides are in agreement about achieving a balanced budget. You \ncannot debate that now. There are very few who say we should not have a \nbalanced budget. The vast majority of Democrats and Republicans agree \non a balanced budget. They have agreed on a time certain--a date. Great \nstrides have been made in that regard.\n  The budget debate really centers on the priorities that matter in \ngetting the budget to a balance. Again, Mr. President, I was unable to \nput this on a chart, but Kevin Phillips, on public radio, on the 14th \nsaid:\n\n       The Republicans in Congress are back with a foolproof \n     guaranteed deficit elimination scheme in which the deficit \n     will shrink from roughly $200 billion in 1996 to nothing, \n     zero, in 2002. The other zero in this equation, I am sorry to \n     say, is the IQ of anybody who believes it. Since the \n     Republicans started producing deficit elimination charts in \n     the early 1980's, their three real goals have been very \n     different. The first has been to cut taxes for the \n     constituencies and avoid new taxes; the second has been to \n     shrink the role of government and the safety net; and the \n     third has been to help the stock and bond markets.\n       These parts, at least, have worked. The tax rates have come \n     down. The rich have gotten richer and the Dow Jones \n     Industrial Average jumped from under 1,000 to over 5,000. \n     Deficit reduction isn't the real goal. Most of the time it \n     has been a slogan for one of the biggest economic con games \n     of the late 20th century United States.\n\n  I repeat, ``Deficit reduction isn't the real goal. Most of the time \nit has been a slogan for one of the biggest economic con games of the \nlate 20th century United States.''\n  So we will talk a little bit about policy here tonight. We will talk \nabout how we need to be concerned about Medicare. I can defend \nMedicare. The first elected job I had was to represent the then largest \nhospital board in Nevada, Clark County, where Las Vegas is located.\n  During the time I served on the hospital board, Medicare came into \nbeing. The first period of time I served on the hospital board, when \nsomebody came to that county institution and they were brought by their \nson or their daughter or their husband or their wife or a neighbor, \nthey had to sign that they would be responsible for that hospital and \ndoctor bill. When you brought your mother or your father or your \nhusband or your wife to that hospital and you did not pay, we had a \ncollection department that went out after you and sued you. You brought \nyour sick mother or father or husband or wife to that hospital, you \npaid.\n  Prior to 1960, less than 40 percent of the American public, of senior \ncitizens, had any kind of health insurance. Now, 99 percent of senior \ncitizens have health insurance. We made great strides during that \nperiod of time.\n  I feel the program called Medicare should be defended. I know it has \nsome warts on it that we need to have a cosmetologist take care of. I \nam willing to do that. I know thousands and thousands of Nevadans who \nrely almost exclusively on this program as a means of living.\n  Mr. President, 30 years ago when I served on the hospital board and I \nhad just left back here--I worked as a Capitol policeman, went to law \nschool back here--when I left here, almost as soon as I left, Congress \npassed Medicare. The Democrats passed it. The Republicans, Mr. \nPresident, opposed it. They opposed its creation 30 years ago.\n  The idea was simple: Create a program for senior citizens to have \nquality medical care while ensuring that seniors have financial \nstability through their retiring years. Very simple idea, not very \ncomplex. We needed a program that would allow seniors to have good \nmedical care. It sought to avoid the situation where if you brought in \nsomebody and they could not pay then, you sued them. That is not \nappropriate.\n  Yet the fervor with which this simple idea was opposed by certain \npeople was significant, some say unprecedented. It is because of the \nmajority party's historic opposition to Medicare that many in this \ncountry today are skeptical of \n\n[[Page S18816]]\ntheir efforts now to say, ``We want to reform the program.'' If I have \nheard it once I heard it a hundred times, my friends on the other side \nof the aisle saying, ``We are not cutting Medicare; we are only cutting \nthe rate of growth of Medicare.''\n  What they fail to acknowledge is that we have an aging population. \nSignificant numbers of new people come on Medicare every day, and in \naddition to having an aging population we have rapidly increased health \ncare costs.\n  Now, we have a health care crisis in this country today. No question \nabout it. We had it last year. We tried to do something about it last \nyear. We were stopped from doing it principally by the health insurance \nindustry, but we were stopped from doing it.\n  Now we have people saying we have a health care crisis. I acknowledge \nthat. Remember last year when we talked about managed care and people \nwalked in here from the other side of the aisle saying managed care \ntakes away choice. Well, I think some of the suggestions from my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle about doing managed care with \nMedicare is a good idea. It was a good idea last year and is a good \nidea this year. I think we cannot have the sole burden of reducing \nhealth care costs on the backs of senior citizens.\n  I ask rhetorically to my friends on the other side, if you were so \nopposed to Medicare then, why should the American public believe you \nare interested in saving it now? If you look at some of the rhetoric, \nit makes a person wonder. Just last October--that is just a few weeks \nago--the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, was \nquoted as saying:\n\n       Now let me talk about Medicare. We don't get rid of it in \n     round one because we don't think that would be politically \n     smart and we don't think that's the right way to go through a \n     transition, but we believe it's going to wither on the vine \n     because we think people will leave it voluntarily.\n\n  The 24th day of October, 1995, is when he said that.\n  Now, I ask my peers, who is not bargaining in good faith? People who \nthink that Medicare is going to wither on the vine?\n  I think Medicare is worth defending. I think it should be worth \ndefending for lots of people, because it works. Look at the differences \nbetween 1964 and 1965 and now and you will reach the same conclusion. \nIn 1995, it is taken as a given that elderly are more financially \nsecure. They live longer and enjoy greater access to health care in \ntheir golden years. This is not because of tax breaks they earned \nduring their lifetimes or because of market forces. Rather, it is \nattributable to the successful programs such as Medicare that we have \npassed in this and the other body. Since its inception about 30 years \nago, Medicare has extended the life expectancy of senior citizens and \nimproved their quality of life.\n  Remember, all we want to do with Medicare is allow senior citizens to \nhave health care available to them, but quality health care and at a \ncost that would not devastate them. Since its inception Medicare has \nboth extended the life expectancies of seniors and improved their \nquality of life. I will debate that with anyone, any time.\n  What about the specifics? Because of Medicare, and Medicare \nprincipally, we have made significant advances on cataract removal. We \ncan all remember years ago when someone had cataract surgery, they were \nhospitalized. It was serious surgery. Now they do it in outpatient. \nWhy? Because of Medicare. They have done so many cataract surgeries now \nthey have it down to a very specific science, and they do it quickly. \nThey do it with implants and all kinds of things that would not have \nbeen thought of 10 or 20 years ago. Joint replacement, cardiac bypass, \nheart surgery, these are some of the advances made principally because \nof Medicare. Because of the funding of Medicare, seniors do not have to \nbreak the bank to pay for these procedures.\n  In 1965, 28\\1/2\\ percent of senior citizens lived below the poverty \nline. In 1995, just less than half that, 12.9 percent live below the \npoverty line.\n  We must in this country be doing something right. Why do we have all \nthe doomsayers, all the people talking about how bad we are? The \neconomy is doing well. Seniors are not as much in poverty as they used \nto be. Does this mean that Medicare is untouchable? Of course, not. We \nneed to address the problems in a responsible manner. But let us \naddress them keeping in mind this truth. This Federal initiative--\nMedicare was a Federal initiative--is accomplishing the simple goal it \nwas designed to achieve, improving the lives of old people in America, \nof senior citizens in America.\n  It is true that Medicare costs more today than it did in 1965. But it \nis true of all health insurance. Mr. President, maybe we in this world \nof political correctness develop terms of art that do not focus on the \nproblem. My grandmother lived alone. Her husband died, my grandfather \nwho I never knew. But I knew my grandmother. She was so proud of the \nfact that she got an old age pension check every month--that is what \nshe called it, ``old age pension check''--because it gave her dignity \nand independence.\n  That is why seniors are better off than they used to be--because they \nhave the ability to be independent and have dignity through Medicare, \nthrough the Social Security check that my grandmother referred to as an \n``old age pension check.'' Those kinds of things have made it better \nfor people who are in their golden years in America today.\n  Medicare costs more today than it did in 1965. I repeat that is true \nof all health insurance. Increasing knowledge of diseases and causes, \nand the technological advances have transformed the care that all \ninsurers provide. Health care today is much more effective and, of \ncourse, more expensive. I acknowledge that. Health care today is a very \ntechnical procedure that affects all Americans. I remind everyone that \nprivatization is something we need to look to. But Medicare costs have \nnot increased as much as health care costs in the private sector.\n  So those that push privatization--which we all do--should understand \nthat Medicare costs are behind the costs of medicine in the private \nsector.\n  I do not see how you can say that taking an arbitrary figure like \n$270 billion is going to protect the Medicare from bankruptcy.\n  I have also heard so many times that trustees say if we do not put \nsome more money into Medicare it is going to go broke. Twenty-five out \nof 27 years Medicare has been in existence they have said the same \nthing. Medicare is a program that has been a pay-as-you-go program. Of \ncourse, the trustees have acknowledged the fact that we have to figure \nout better ways to fund and figure out ways to cut expenses in \nMedicare. But to have the statement made on and on and continually and \nover and over that the trustees say it is going to go broke as if it is \nsome new revelation--they have been saying this from the very \nbeginning, and what do we do? We fix it every time as we will this \ntime.\n  We also hear a lot, Mr. President, that $270 billion is going to \nprotect it. It is not. That is an arbitrary figure, in my opinion made \nonly to take care of the tax breaks for the 1 or 2 percent of Americans \nwho will get most of the benefit. About two-thirds of the projected \nsavings would come from reduced payments to hospitals, nursing homes, \nand physicians without any basic change in the system responsible for \nrising costs.\n\n  That does not sound to me that we are reforming Medicare and \nstrengthening Medicare. This does not sound like reform. It sounds \nlike, if anything, that it would improve the delivery of health care \nfor the elderly; that is, cut payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and \nphysicians without any basic change in the system. Indeed, the policy \nramifications of this proposal might well undermine the quality of \nservices, threaten the economic stability of providers, and reduce the \navailability of services.\n  Another 20 to 25 percent of the proposed savings to the Government \nfrom the program which the President vetoed would come from increased \npayments by beneficiaries. Having beneficiaries pay more can hardly be \ncalled a strengthening of Medicare. This is particularly true since \naverage out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries have been steadily \nrising, and would grow even more with this plan. It is important to \nread beyond the rhetoric, over the numbers, and beyond the smoke and \nmirrors. The proposal that was vetoed by the President had real life \nconsequences for lots of people.\n  So, Mr. President, when we hear a lot of rhetoric about returning to \nthe good \n\n[[Page S18817]]\nold days, I am not sure senior citizens want a return to the good old \ndays. I think they are happier with Medicare, and with a Social \nSecurity check coming in on a monthly basis. Remember: The Social \nSecurity checks they get are not welfare. That is money that is paid \ninto a fund by employers and employees.\n  So I suggest that we have experienced a lot of good since the \ncreation of some of these programs, and since they were initially \ndebated. By most measures, the United States in 1995 is a dramatically \nbetter place to live than it was in 1965 if you are a senior citizen.\n  Of course, we have to do something about the crime that ravages \nsenior citizens--violent crime, crimes involving telemarketing, and \nother things like that. We have to do a better job there. But as far as \neconomic safety, security, 1995 for senior citizens is much better than \n1965. The economy is more than twice as large in terms of real dollar. \nPoverty has declined in the senior population despite a larger \npopulation.\n  There are other good things that have happened. Twenty-five years ago \nthe Cuyahoga River caught fire. A river in Ohio started burning. It was \nthen determined that maybe we should do something about cleaning up our \nrivers and streams. The Clean Water Act was passed 25 years ago. What \ndo we have now? We have greatly improved water. At the time the \nCuyahoga River caught fire about 80 percent of the rivers and streams \nin this country were polluted. Now those figures have almost reversed. \nWe do not have 80 percent of our rivers and streams polluted now. We \nhave a little over 20 percent. We have made dramatic strides in clean \nwater.\n  Clean air--even though we have millions of more cars on the road \ntoday than we had 25 years ago, because of the Clean Air Act our air is \ncleaner than it was 25 years ago. Scientific advances have allowed us \nto do that. Most people are healthier, living longer, and most jobs are \nless dangerous. Most discrimination has ended, especially formal \ndiscrimination. Education levels are at an all-time high even though \nour education system needs a lot more work done on it. I acknowledge \nthat. But, Mr. President, out of the 141 top universities in the world, \nthe United States has 129 out of 141. Our higher education is not \ntouched by any other country. We need a lot of work with our elementary \nand secondary schools. Of course, we do. That is why we need to be \nputting more money in instead of less.\n\n  Personal freedom has been improved in modern-day America more than it \nwas in the past. In fact, personal freedom has never been greater than \nit is today. Once reserved for the very rich, air travel have become \ncommonplace.\n  I believe we are overlooking the reasons why the final decision of \nbalancing the budget has to be thought out and thought out well. There \nare programs and laws that improve lives, and they are worthy of \ndefending as a matter of principle. It is not just about policy and \nnumbers. It is about people. That is what this debate is about. The \ndecisions we reach in the next few days, the next few weeks, and the \nnext few months will have lasting consequence on all of us.\n  I close by referring to a Republican who said, ``Spending on \ngovernment programs, from Medicare and education, to home heating oil \nassistance, is to be reduced in ways that is principally a burden to \nthe poor and the middle class--``talking about the bill the President \nvetoed''--while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways that \npredominantly benefit the top one or two percent of Americans.''\n  So I say to those within the sound of my voice, the debate, Mr. \nPresident, is a debate on the difference between right and wrong. We \nfeel we are on the right side of the issue and that we have to stand up \nfor principle.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Madam President, expectations and reality are rarely one \nand the same. So when our colleague from the State of Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, says she never expected to be here in the U.S. Senate, it is \nnot surprising that this is where she ended up. But very true to all \nexpectations, Madam President, Senator Kassebaum has distinguished \nherself as one of this institution's best and brightest. So it is with \nreluctance that I rise to bid farewell to my dear friend and respected \ncolleague.\n  Senator Kassebaum has graced the Halls of the U.S. Senate every \nsingle day of the almost 18 years she has spent here. Never partisan \nand always fair, her leadership of the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources is exemplary, and it is a joy to serve with her on that body \nas well as on the Committee on Foreign Relations. Indeed, she has \nhelped to keep the Senate's spirit of civility alive.\n  A leader, independent thinker, and mediator, Senator Kassebaum's \nrecord of accomplishment is lengthy and impressive. Aside from being \nthe first female chair of a major committee in 40 years, she has \nmanaged to write a health insurance reform bill that has drawn Labor \nand Human Resources Committee consensus around this difficult and often \ncontroversial issue. She has been indispensable in reauthorizing the \nRyan White Care Act, a program of great importance to the State of \nConnecticut, and has been a valuable supporter of the Head Start \nProgram.\n  But Senator Kassebaum's accomplishments have improved the lives of \nthose well beyond United States shores. As a member of the Committee on \nForeign Relations, she was invaluable in facilitating Central American \npeace initiatives and in finding political solutions to the conflict in \nEl Salvador. And as chairwoman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, \nshe fought to bring an end to South African apartheid by supporting \nsanctions against that nation; she then facilitated their repeal upon \nthe election of President Nelson Mandela.\n  And at home in Kansas, Madam President, Senator Kassebaum's \nconstituents love her just as much as her Senate colleagues. Her \noverwhelming support at the polls--76 percent in 1984, and 74 percent \nin 1990--reflects Kansans' deep appreciation of her commitment to them. \nShe has never wavered from the value her father instilled in her: that \nher roots were always in Kansas.\n  Madam President, both Senator Kassebaum and I are the children of \npublic servants whose interest in politics and government service was \nnourished throughout our childhoods. To walk alongside Senator \nKassebaum as both of us follow in our fathers' footsteps has fostered a \nspecial bond between us. We have served together on two committees, and \nhave worked as trusted partners on many important issues. And I realize \nhow fulfilling it must be for her, as she leaves this body, to know \nthat she has made her father proud.\n  Senator Kassebaum is a noble servant of Kansans and all Americans, a \ncherished friend, and a beloved colleague whom I greatly admire. I will \nbe sorry to see her leave the Senate, but I am confident that her \nspirit will endure. I wish her the very best as she approaches her \nretirement, and look forward to serving this last year with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18817-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18817-S18818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO A MAN OF GREAT CONSCIENCE, RETIRING SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, Senator Hatfield's recent announcement \nthat he would be leaving the U.S. Senate left me disappointed, for his \ndeparture from this body will mean the loss of yet another of the \nSenate's most honorable Members. For five terms, \n\n[[Page S18818]]\nSenator Hatfield has elevated the caliber of this Chamber's debate, \nfrequently taking lonely stands in the process.\n  Voting one's conscience often requires courage. Senator Hatfield has \nnever wavered in his devotion to what he believes is just, and he has \nalways done right by the good people of Oregon.\n  Madam President, no one in this body has been a greater crusader for \npeace than Mark Hatfield. A devout pacifist since the beginning of his \npolitical career, Senator Hatfield opposed President Johnson's Vietnam \npolicy, and more than 20 years later was one of only two Republicans to \nvote against United States military involvement in the Persian Gulf. He \nopposes nuclear testing and an extensive military buildup, and authored \nthe 1992 nuclear test ban law that is now regarded as an important \nstandard for U.S. conduct on nuclear issues.\n  More recently, Senator Hatfield was the sole Republican to vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment, and he would have paid dearly \nfor that stand had the concept of respect for one's conscience not \nprevailed.\n  Senator Hatfield's constituents respect his principles just as much \nas his colleagues, which is perhaps why Governor Kitzhaber said Senator \nHatfield has achieved ``what may be the single greatest public career \nin Oregon's history.'' Senator Hatfield has never lost an election. \nOregonians have continually returned their Senator to office not only \nbecause of his righteousness, but also because of his commitment to \nthem and their values. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Hatfield has seen to it that Oregon's pristine parks and clean \ncoastlines have the means to stay that way, while other public projects \nsuch as hospitals, research centers, and roads help to ensure health of \nthe State's citizens and the vibrancy of the State's economy. And as \none of this body's true moderates, Senator Hatfield has also supported \ngun control and motor-voter initiatives, while opposing President \nReagan's unwise tax cuts.\n  Madam President, Senator Hatfield is an outstanding Member of this \nbody whose sincerity and strength of character should be emulated by \nall Americans. Widely respected for his independence and well-liked for \nhis loyal friendship, Senator Hatfield will be sorely missed. I wish \nhim all the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18817-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING AN ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, amidst a very busy, occasionally frantic \nsession, as we struggle for sometimes small, perhaps fleeting \nvictories, it is important that we not ignore those losses that are \npermanent and personal. A close friend and a fine legislator announced \nlast month that he will be leaving us at the end of this Congress, and \nI would like to take this opportunity to pay him part of the tribute \nthat he deserves.\n  Madam President, I know something about following in the footsteps of \none's own father in this Chamber. The U.S. Congress held not only a set \nof expectations for Senator Simpson, but also a legacy. It was a legacy \nthat came not just from former Senator Milward Simpson, but from a long \nlineage of Simpsons dating back to the 19th century. Senator Simpson's \nancestors were among the pioneers of the State of Wyoming, and were \npart of the effort that turned a beautiful stretch of American frontier \ninto a great American State. This spirit--one of perseverance, \nintegrity, and hard work--was the legacy that was left to Senator \nSimpson. It was a legacy that he embraced and nurtured, while \nsimultaneously carving for himself an identity and a presence in the \nSenate all his own.\n  It is easy to stand up here and honor a colleague by listing a litany \nof legislative achievements. It is much harder to try to pay tribute by \nattempting to evoke the humor and the wit that were the hallmark of \nSenator Simpson's career. I am afraid I am not up to the task, Madam \nPresident. But those who know the Senator remember the humor that he \nbrought to a too often humorless place. Indeed, many of us were the \nvictims of his good-natured joshing on numerous occasions. He was \ndisarming with his charm, and his quick wit won him many small battles, \nwhile averting many larger ones. Suffice it to say, on the subject of \nSenator Simpson's humor, that many of us, before we came to Washington \nand encountered the acerbic tongue of the 6'7\" Senator from Wyoming, \nhad no idea what or where a gazoo was.\n  It must have been that pioneering spirit that made Senator Simpson \ngravitate toward some of the toughest legislative assignments in this \nbody. He quickly took on one of our Nation's thorniest policy areas, \nimmigration reform, and, through dogged perseverance, determination, \nand a keen sense of when and how to compromise, he pushed through the \nlegislation that has become the foundation of our Nation's immigration \npolicy ever since.\n  The bill that eventually passed was a tribute to our policymaking \nprocess here in Congress. It marked a strengthening of U.S. immigration \npolicy, but also showed sensitivity to the serious concerns of some \nvery thoughtful people. It tempered a toughening of border patrols with \namnesty for illegal aliens who arrived in this country through the \nearly 1980's. It balanced sanctions against employers who hired illegal \naliens with provisions to protect legal aliens and citizens from unfair \ndiscrimination. It took him 6 years to do it, and I know that it was at \ntimes a frustrating march. It was an effort that other legislators \nmight have given up, and left to another leader, or another time. But \nhe persisted, and the bill that was passed in 1986, after 6 years of \nhard work and compromise, stands as a heartening example of how a \npolitical system too often accused of gridlock and obstruction can \nsucceed when the right leader tempers determination with cooperation.\n  He hardly slowed down from there, however, continuing to take on some \nof the most sensitive issues, impressing even his opponents with his \nhonesty and courage. He spoke to a group of Vietnam veterans, and \nfrankly told them of his reservations about compensation for veterans \nwho claimed to have been injured due to their exposure to chemicals \nduring the war. He simply had not seen adequate proof that their \ninjuries were caused by their wartime experiences, he explained. The \naudience disagreed with him, but they respected his honesty and \nforthrightness in explaining his views. At the conclusion of his \nspeech, he received a standing ovation.\n  In announcing his retirement, Senator Simpson said that, when he \nbegan his work in the Senate, he promised the voters two things, and \ntwo things only. First, that he would work very hard, and second, that \nhe would try to make them very proud. Madam President, it takes honesty \nand courage to be so frank in what one promises, and it takes hard work \nand perseverance to make good on those promises. Senator Simpson \nexhibited all of those qualities, and he will be long remembered for \nthem.\n  Senator Simpson also told us that he is leaving this Chamber because \nhe no longer feels the same ``fire in the belly.'' I am disappointed to \nhear that, but I have very little doubt that whatever he chooses to do \nupon leaving us, the fire in his belly will soon be rekindled, and the \nflames will fuel his passion, and we will all be touched by his energy. \nI thank him, and I wish him the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18818-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18818-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18818-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18818-S18819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 33.

A bill to enforce the public debt limit and to protect the \nsocial security trust funds and other federal trust funds and accounts \ninvested in public debt obligations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the federal trust fund beneficiary protection act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, 4 weeks ago tomorrow, the President \nsigned a bill into law, the continuing resolution, that stated he would \nagree to a balanced budget in 7 years using Congressional Budget Office \nfigures, which protected his priorities. That bill passed both Houses \nof Congress and was signed by the President of the United States.\n\n  Unfortunately, that happened 4 weeks ago, but the President has not \ncomplied with the law. He has not done what he said he was going to do. \nI find that to be particularly upsetting, and frustrating because the \nPresident has not done what he said he was going to do.\n  I have been one of the budget negotiators. I sat in on very long \nmeetings, very unfruitful meetings where we asked time and time again \nfor the President's representatives to submit a budget that would \ncomply with the law.\n  Last Friday, President Clinton's negotiators submitted their fourth \nbudget of the year, the second since signing the continuing resolution \n4 weeks ago. The fourth budget did not come close to balancing using \nCongressional Budget Office numbers. As a matter of fact, it has a \ndeficit in the $100 billion range, as far as the eye can see. Now, that \nis not a balanced budget. That is not what the President said he was \ngoing to do.\n  That bothers me. The President of the United States said in a \nstatement to a joint session of Congress in January 1993, that he would \nuse the Congressional Budget Office figures so that we would not be \narguing about baselines and different sets of numbers, so \n\n[[Page S18820]]\nwe would be comparing apples to apples.\n  The President said we would do that. Unfortunately, he has not done \nwhat he said he would do. That was in his State of the Union Address \nalmost 3 years ago, and he has not done what he said he would do a \nmonth ago in signing the continuing resolution. He said he would submit \na balanced budget. He has not done that yet.\n  Then earlier today, the President vetoed three appropriations bills. \nI think he made a mistake. I am looking for the reasons that he gave in \nvetoing those bills. I have been on the Appropriations Committee. I am \nfamiliar with all three bills, and I do not think he had any \njustification for vetoing those bills. All the employees that work in \nthe Departments of Commerce, State and Justice, or the Interior \nDepartment, or the Veterans Department, or the Department of Housing--\nand we are talking about hundreds of thousands of employees--could have \ngone back to work tomorrow if President Clinton had signed those bills. \nBut, unfortunately, he did not. I will look at his veto message and \nreview that with my colleagues as soon as we get it, but my guess is he \nvetoed those bills because we are not spending enough money. My guess \nis he wants to spend more money in all of those bills.\n\n  I note, also, Mr. President, that today the stock market is falling \nrather significantly--almost a 100-point drop in the Dow Jones market \ntoday. Maybe it is because the markets are starting to question whether \nor not Congress will come to a balanced budget. I think the markets are \ninterpreting it correctly. It is going to be difficult for us to get a \ndeal together if the President of the United States will not comply \nwith his commitment to submit a balanced budget in 7 years, using \nhonest economics. So the market is probably interpreting that \ncorrectly.\n  What else has happened in the last 4 weeks? Well, the President and \nthe Secretary of Treasury stated repeatedly that they needed an \nincrease in the debt limit. They said that Congress has to pass the \ndebt limit increase or else the United States of America is going to be \ndefaulting on its obligations for the first time in history. We heard \nthat time and time again from the President and the Secretary of \nTreasury. However, on the deadline of November 15, we did not default. \nWhat happened on November 15 is that the Secretary of Treasury--I am \nassuming with the guidance of the President of the United States--began \nraiding trust funds, pension funds.\n  Mr. President, I used to be in the private sector. I used to be \nfiduciary and trustee of a private pension plan. Being a fiduciary and \ntrustee of a private pension plan means you have certain \nresponsibilities to the employees. You cannot dip into employee pension \nfunds for other purposes. You cannot raid those pension funds to help \nmeet other obligations--maybe even unforeseen obligations. You have to \nfind other sources of income, or you have to cut expenditures, or you \njust have to make do. But those pension funds are off limits.\n  Unfortunately, they have not been off limits to Secretary Rubin and \nPresident Clinton, because they used those trust funds to get around \nthe debt limit. The debt limit, I might mention to my colleagues, is \nstatutory; that is a law. It is passed by Congress. Congress has the \npower to borrow. That power is not vested in the executive branch. The \nPresident is taking that power upon himself by borrowing from the \npension funds. They have come up with, maybe, very shaky legal guidance \nthat says they can do it. Granted, a previous administration did it for \na couple of days. But this administration looks like they want to do it \nfor a year or more, and not just a few billion dollars to get through a \nweekend; it looks like maybe it is for months and months. We have a lot \nof trust funds, and it appears that this administration is prepared to \nraid all of them.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to protect our \nNation's elderly, disabled, poor, and unemployed from recent \nunprecedented activities by President Clinton's administration. This \nlegislation became necessary, Mr. President, when the Secretary of \nTreasury, Robert Rubin, undertook an aggressive campaign last month to \ndeliberately avoid the public debt limit.\n  The Secretary's actions have endangered some of the Government's most \nimportant programs which provide retirement benefits, health benefits, \nseparation payments, life and disability insurance benefits, and \ndependents and survivors' benefits. Specifically, on November 15, 1995, \nSecretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin circumvented the $4.9 trillion \nlimit on public debt by authorizing the conversion to cash of the \nentire $21.5 billion of Federal Employees Thrift Saving Plan, G Fund, \nand the disinvestment of $39.8 billion of the $375 billion Civil \nService Retirement and Disability Fund, commonly called CSRDF.\n  Just last week, Secretary Rubin announced he would further side-step \nthe limit by withholding a deposit of $14.5 billion in interest \npayments to the CSRDF. These unprecedented actions were ordered to \ndeliberately avoid the legal limit on public debt enacted by Congress. \nThrough processes known as disinvesting, converting to cash and \nunderinvesting, this administration is raiding the Federal pension \nassets of almost 3 million Federal employees to keep on borrowing, \ndespite the debt limit. If this type of creative accounting happened in \nprivate business, it could land the employer in jail for up to a year. \nThat is because, in the real world, raiding your employees' pension \nfunds is a serious crime.\n  Where will the trust fund raids stop? Well, as of September 30, 1995, \n$1.32 trillion in Federal securities were held by Federal trust funds \nor other special accounts, compromising more than one quarter of all \noutstanding Federal debt. Almost half of this amount is held by Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds--$483 billion by Social Security and \n$143 billion by Medicare. The remainder is held by the Federal civil \nservice and military retirement funds--$375 by the Federal Civil \nService Retirement Fund and $113 by the Military Retirement Fund. \nTheoretically, all these funds are in danger of being disinvested by \nthis administration to fuel more Government spending.\n  Mr. President, this administration has long tried to have it both \nways when it comes to controlling this deficit spending. A case in \npoint is the contradictory rhetoric and actions regarding the \ndisinvestment of Federal employee pension funds and its policy of the \nsame practice in the private sector. At the same time Secretary Rubin \nwas disinvesting Federal employee pension funds, Robert Reich, \nSecretary of Labor, was warning about the danger of private pension \nfunds being raided by unscrupulous employers. Here is what Secretary \nReich had to say about private sector pensions:\n\n       Labor Department investigators, in recent months, have \n     discovered a growing number of companies that have been \n     raiding their employees' 401(k) pension plans. We have reason \n     to believe that some companies are simply taking \n     contributions from employees and using the money for their \n     own purposes. They have regarded this 401(k) pool of money \n     coming from employees almost like an interest-free loan. Some \n     of them have every intention of paying the money back, but \n     are using this for their own purposes to pay bills and pay \n     other costs of doing business. All of these employers are \n     acting illegally. I want to send a very clear and unambiguous \n     message to employers, and my message is: Hands off, this is \n     not your money. This money belongs to employees.\n\n  That warning was given by Labor Secretary Robert Reich in a news \nconference on November 27, 1995. These words ought to strike a chord \nover at Treasury because the Federal retirement trust funds that \nSecretary Rubin has been manipulating are the Federal equivalence of \nthe private pension plans that Secretary Reich is describing. The \nbottom line for private business is that these funds cannot be used for \nany other purpose than the benefits for which they are intended. The \ncivil and criminal penalties for doing so are clear. The tax penalties \ninclude a fine of 5 percent of the amount involved, and up to 100 \npercent if the plan is not promptly made whole. The labor penalties \ninclude a 20-percent penalty of the amount involved, and a minimum fine \nof $5,000, and up to 1 year in jail for a willful violator.\n  If this is not the height of ``do what I say, not what I do,'' then I \ndo not know what is.\n  Mr. President, it is because of the administration's unscrupulous \nactions that I am introducing the Federal Trust Fund Beneficiary \nProtection Act. My legislation, which is a companion measure to H.R. \n2621, introduced by the Ways and Means Chairman Bill \n\n[[Page S18821]]\nArcher, which recently passed the House of Representatives, precludes \nthe Secretary of Treasury and other officials from refraining to \nproperly credit trust funds and special accounts with securities for \nthe purpose of avoiding public debt limit. Further, during any period \nwhich the Secretary is unable to issue new debt limit obligations due \nto a limitation on public debt, they may not sell or redeem securities \nobligations or other assets of these trust funds and special accounts, \nexcept when necessary to provide for the payment of benefits and \nadministrative expenses of the various cash benefit programs.\n  Trust funds whose benefit payments are specifically protected \ninclude, first, the Federal old age and survivors insurance trust fund, \nSocial Security; second, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund; \nthird, Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; fourth, the Federal \nSupplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, all of which are Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Fifth, the civil service retirement and \ndisability fund; sixth, the Government securities and investment fund; \nseventh, the Department of Defense military retirement fund; eighth, \nthe unemployment trust fund; ninth, each of the railroad retirement \nfunds and accounts; tenth, the Department of Defense education benefits \nfund and; eleventh, the black lung disability trust fund.\n\n  Finally, my legislation includes conforming amendments which repeal \nthe authority Secretary Rubin relied upon last month to disinvest Civil \nService retirement and disability funds. Mr. President, I believe it is \ncritical Congress enact this legislation as soon as possible before \nSecretary Rubin further confiscates trust fund assets intended for our \nelderly, disabled, poor, and unemployed. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in this initiative.\n  Mr. President, I cannot imagine the outcry that would happen if we \nhad a Republican administration raiding Federal employees' trust funds. \nIn the private sector if you do this you can be fined significantly and \nyou can be put in jail. Yet the Secretary of the Treasury, under the \nguidance and I assume the direction of President Clinton, is raiding \nthese funds at will and quite possibly plans on doing so for the rest \nof the year.\n  If they can raid the civil service trust fund, evidently they can \nraid the Social Security trust fund or the Medicare trust fund. We need \nto protect these funds. They were created and paid for by employees. We \nneed to protect them. I wish that was not necessary. Evidently it seems \nto be the case.\n  Again, Congress has the authority to set the debt limit. This \nadministration, with the Secretary's actions, is saying they can avoid \nthe debt limit by raiding these funds. This legislation would stop \nthat. It would prohibit that. I hope my colleagues would concur. \nSimilar legislation has already passed the House. It is my hope we will \npass this legislation before we leave. I think it is important to pass \nbefore we leave for Christmas.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this legislation became necessary when the \nSecretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, undertook an aggressive \ncampaign last month to deliberately avoid the public debt limit. The \nSecretary's actions have endangered some of the Government's most \nimportant programs which provide retirement benefits, health benefits, \nseparation payments, life and disability insurance benefits, and \ndependent's and survivor's benefits.\n  Specifically, on November 15, 1995, Secretary of Treasury Robert \nRubin circumvented the $4.9 trillion limit on the public debt by \nauthorizing the conversion to cash of the entire $21.5 billion Federal \nemployees' thrift savings plan ``G'' fund and the ``disinvestment'' of \n$39.8 billion of the $375 billion Civil Service Retirement and \nDisability Fund [CSRDF]. And just last week, Secretary Rubin announced \nthat he would further sidestep the borrowing limit by withholding the \ndeposit of a $14.5 billion interest payment to the CSRDF. These \nunprecedented actions were ordered to deliberately avoid the legal \nlimit on the public debt enacted by Congress.\n  Through processes known as disinvesting, converting to cash, and \nunderinvesting, this administration is raiding the Federal employee \nassets of almost 3 million Federal employees to keep on borrowing \ndespite the debt limit. If this type of creative accounting happened in \na business, it could land the employer in jail for up to 1 year. That \nis, in the real world, raiding your employees' pension funds is a \nserious crime.\n  Where will the trust fund raid stop? Well, as of September 30, 1995, \n$1.32 trillion in Federal securities were held by Federal trust funds \nor other special accounts, comprising more than one quarter of all \noutstanding Federal debt. Almost half of this amount is held by the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds--$483 billion by Social \nSecurity and $143 billion by Medicare. The remainder is held by the \nFederal Civil Service and Military Retirement Funds--$374 billion by \nthe Federal Civil Service Retirement Fund and $113 billion by the \nMilitary Retirement Fund. Theoretically, all of these funds are in \ndanger being disinvested by this administration to fuel more Government \nspending.\n  Mr. President, this administration has long tried to have it both \nways when it comes to controlling its deficit spending. Case in point \nis their contradictory rhetoric and action with regard to its \ndisinvestment of Federal employee pension funds and its policy on the \nsame practice in the private sector. At the same time Secretary Rubin \nwas disinvesting Federal employee pension funds, the Secretary of \nLabor, Robert Reich, was warning about the danger to private pension \nfunds from raids by unscrupulous employers.

Baker, Jr., Louis Gerstner and \n     Anne d'Harnoncourt as citizen Regents, filling current \n     vacancies on the Board.\n       Regents and the manner of appointment and terms of office \n     of those other than Members of Congress are set forth in 20 \n     U.S.C. 42 and 43. At its meeting in January, the Board of \n     Regents voted unanimously to request the Congressional \n     members of the Board to introduce legislation to provide for \n     the reappointment of Dr. Neal. Likewise, in May, following a \n     unanimous vote, the Congressional Regents were asked to \n     sponsor legislation providing for the appointment of Messers. \n     Baker and Gerstner and Ms. d'Harnoncourt. Each resolution \n     provides for a statutory term of six years, becoming \n     effective upon enactment.\n       As their respective biographies attest, the candidates have \n     distinguished themselves in careers of science and education, \n     public service, corporate management, and museum \n     administration and scholarship. The appointment of each of \n     these accomplished individuals presents the opportunity for \n     the Institution to enrich the experience and perspective of \n     its governing board.\n       Enactment of the joint resolution would have no regulatory \n     impact and entails no cost to the Government. I shall, of \n     course, be happy to furnish any additional information you \n     may require for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                I.

Mr. President, as we are all well aware, the \ncountry is experiencing the second partial shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment this year. Last November, 800,000 very dedicated men and \nwomen were prohibited from coming to work, were called nonessential and \nhad to endure 6 long days full of stress and uncertainty. Now, with \nChristmas just a week away, I regret we find ourselves in the same \nsituation.\n  While the current shutdown affects fewer Federal employees, some \n280,000, their concerns and fears are no less real than they were 4 \nweeks ago. It is outrageous that Federal employees, many of whom are \nMarylanders, continue to be the unwilling victims of the ongoing budget \nbattle between the congressional leadership and the administration. How \nare people who live from paycheck to paycheck going to meet their \nmortgage payments or tuition payments for their kids who are in school?\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, the Washington Post published an editorial \nwhich, in my view, clearly articulates the harmful effects of a \nshutdown on our work force. We have a national interest in having a \nfirst-rate Federal service. You do not want a second-rate Federal \nservice. But, if you continue in effect to assault people, keep them in \nthis state of agitation and anxiety and fear and apprehension, you are \nwell on your way to bringing about a second-rate service. People have \nother opportunities. Good people have other opportunities and will \nleave to take them. Good people will not come in because they do not \nwant to live in this environment and for that we will all suffer.\n  At some point I hope people will reach the conclusion that Federal \nemployees have a reasonable role and place in the workings of our \nsystem and they ought to be treated with a measure of dignity. It is \nimportant that we consider seriously the implications of a shutdown, \nnot only on the daily operations of the Federal Government, but on the \nlong-term performance and perception of civil servants and the public \nservice they provide. I ask that the text of the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\n                        A Shutdown's Other Costs\n\n       There is more to the stalemate of the government than the \n     failure of the President and the GOP to agree on a seven-year \n     balanced-budget plan. The furloughing of federal employees \n     exacts a terrible cost from a valuable work force. Nothing \n     can be more demoralizing to the men and women who look out \n     for the nation's veterans, hunt cures to deadly diseases, \n     keep our air and water clean, send out the Social Security \n     checks and otherwise serve the nation in ways most of us \n     don't think about, than to be told that despite their \n     fidelity and contribution, they are really ``nonessential.'' \n     That insult, being added to all the other guff federal \n     workers catch in the halls of Congress, on talk shows and \n     from television comics, comes as an undeserved kick in the \n     teeth from their own government.\n       Federal employees have every right to feel as if they are \n     the real pawns in this sorry mess. One day they are proud and \n     productive \n\n[[Page S18824]]\n     members of the federal government, protecting the health and safety of \n     the nation; the next day they are handed a slip of paper and \n     sent home with no idea when they will be paid. That is no way \n     to motivate a work force, let alone demonstrate respect for \n     it.\n       The daily payroll cost for the furlough of employees is no \n     small matter--even if employees are paid retroactively for \n     their days out of work. But there are consequences of the \n     cavalier treatment of the federal work force that will be \n     felt long after the government is back in business.\n       A government that is in gridlock--worse yet, shuttered--\n     does little to bolster a political system already losing the \n     public's confidence. It downright debilitates its own work \n     force. As a furloughed federal economist said during the last \n     interruption, ``Can you imagine a Fortune 500 company \n     operating like this? If they had a dispute between their \n     board of directors and their president, and they sent \n     everybody home?'' And in addition to the effect on morale, \n     can such interruption be supposed to be a help to the work \n     they do?\n       In an open letter to federal employees, President Clinton \n     and Vice President Gore signaled their recognition of the \n     shabby treatment afforded the federal work force: ``you \n     remain good people caught in what Churchill called the `worst \n     system of government devised by the wit of man, except for \n     all the others,' '' they wrote. Good people--and they are--\n     should not be made to pay for the failures of their leaders. \n     Getting federal employees out of the middle and back on the \n     job is the way to respect them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18823-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAYOR STEVE HETTINGER\n\n   Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Huntsville, AL, Mayor Steve \nHettinger, announced in October that he would not seek reelection in \n1996. He has been in Huntsville's top administrative post since 1988. \nPrior to becoming mayor, he was in the State legislature for 6 years, \nserved for 4 years as an aide to former Congressman Ronnie Flippo, and \nworked as an engineer.\n  Huntsville has witnessed dramatic growth and progress under the \ndynamic leadership of Mayor Hettinger. It has continued its long-range \ncapital improvements program. He and other city leaders took an active \nrole in persuading the Base Realignment and Closure Commission to move \n2,600 Army jobs to Huntsville. Early in his tenure, he was instrumental \nin the passage of slope-development controls. Many urged him to mount a \nrace for the Senate next year, but he declined.\n  Other accomplishments include the city's community plan ``Vision \n2000,'' road construction, the establishment of community facilities \nand long-term investments, and improvements in public safety, public \nworks, and government efficiency. In 1989, the city council passed a \nhalf-cent sales tax increase, the revenue from which was used to \nimprove city schools. No other general tax increase has been enacted. \nMayor Hettinger has represented the city of Huntsville well. He is on \ngood terms with corporate executives and is close to key State \nlegislators.\n  In a highly unusual development, Mayor Hettinger and the city council \nwere able to balance the 1995 city budget and carry over nearly $8 \nmillion to the 1996 budget year. He made a promise to do everything in \nhis power to hold down spending while at the same time retain the \nquality and level of service to which residents had come accustomed. \nThe fiscal austerity that resulted from this wise promise was \ndifficult, as is always the case when government programs are affected. \nThe efforts of the mayor and city council paid off in a big way, \nhowever, as the books were balanced and a surplus resulted. In these \ntimes, this is truly an incredible feat. The citizens of Huntsville are \nnow mulling over what to do with the extra money. We can only dream of \nsuch success at the Federal level. Mayor Hettinger should be commended \nfor this budgetary success--success from which we could learn a thing \nor two.\n  Steve Hettinger moved to Huntsville in 1967 after graduating from \nMississippi State University with a degree in engineering. He attended \nthe University of Alabama in Huntsville and worked in the space \nprogram. He earned a master's degree in industrial and systems \nengineering from UAH in 1974. He is currently the president of the \nAlabama League of Municipalities.\n  I know that Mayor Hettinger still has a great deal he wants to \naccomplish before he leaves office, and I am sure that he will \naccomplish much over the next year. He is really the first mayor of \nmodern Huntsville, coming as he does from the ranks of the technocrats, \nand I mean that in the best sense of the term. He has improved \nefficiency dramatically, and Huntsville is a much better city because \nof his leadership and contributions. I wish him all the best for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18824-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18824-S18825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UTAH WILDERNESS BILL\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as you know, I have joined with other \nmembers of the Utah delegation and Governor Leavitt in introducing S. \n884, the Utah Public Lands Management Act, also known as the Utah \nwilderness bill. Since we introduced this bill earlier this summer, we \nhave been criticized up and down by opponents of S. 884 that the \nextensive process we engaged in to study and eventually recommend over \n1.8 million acres in 49 wilderness areas was not extensive enough. \nSince January, over 22,000 public comments have been submitted, over 45 \npublic hearings were held and 600 personal testimonies were accepted. \nHowever, our critics choose to overlook this fact as well as the fact \nthat it is time to bring to closure this 20-year-old debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following document be printed in the \nRecord at the proper place as proof that the public comment process has \nindeed been extensive. This is an excerpt from a publication by the \nCoalition for Utah's Future/Project 2000. It details the extensive \nprocess which the coalition, joined by members of Utah's environmental \ncommunity and county commissioners and citizens of Emery County, \nundertook to discuss and resolve the issue of wilderness. \nUnfortunately, cost and space limitations will prohibit the inclusion \nof the entire text. I would encourage those who are interested in the \nfull report to contact the coalition at the address following the \nexcerpt. I commend these folks for their tremendous efforts to reach \nconsensus on one of the most difficult and contentious public lands \nissues in our State. I believe this report illustrates just how \nextensive the process has been. I wish to express my thanks to the \nCoalition for Utah's Future/Project 2000 for the time and effort they \nhave spent in conceiving and implementing this pilot project.\n  The material follows:\n\n       A Project of The Coalition For Utah's Future/Project 2000\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       In twelve short months, a traditional rural community in \n     Utah moved from what appeared to be a deeply seated, anti-\n     environmental sentiment to a protection oriented public lands \n     agenda. Involved Emery County leaders and citizens alike, are \n     now publicly espousing the desire to work with disparate \n     parties and land managers to solve problems and seek mutually \n     beneficial land protection mechanisms. How did this rather \n     dramatic transformation in the county's approach to public \n     lands issues occur? The answer involves the willingness of \n     several visionary county and environmental leaders to be the \n     ``guinea pig'' in a cooperatively designed Community and Wild \n     Lands Futures Pilot Project sponsored by the Coalition for \n     Utah's Future/Project 2000 (CUF), a non-profit, multi-issue \n     organization comprised of diverse community leaders \n     interested in a quality future for all Utah citizens. It also \n     involves the surfacing of values, long held within the county \n     but unacknowledged, due to the acrimonious nature of \n     environmental disputes throughout Utah and the West over the \n     past fifteen years.\n       The pilot was conceived in the summer of 1993 when CUF's \n     conflict resolution consultant, Susan Carpenter, put a \n     hypothetical question before a group of some 25 disparate \n     stakeholders interested in resolving the conflict over Utah's \n     BLM wilderness designation issue. She asked participants to \n     assume the year is 1999, and that a Utah BLM wilderness bill, \n     which everyone could support, had just been signed into law. \n     ``What'', she asked, ``are the steps beginning in 1999 and \n     then working backwards to 1993, that led to the passage of \n     this bill?'' The group's response to this question became the \n     basis for the conceptualization of the Community and Wild \n     Lands Futures Pilot Project (CWFP). CWFP, they hoped, could \n     become a model for other rural Utah communities and \n     interested parties in the West.\n       The word future is key here. Conservationists in the design \n     group reasoned that helping communities articulate their \n     values, visions, and goals for an ``ideal'' future, would \n     enable citizens to move beyond current problems and \n     contentious issues toward a more pro-active plan based on \n     commonly shared community values and ``sense of place''. \n     This, they also theorized would lay a more productive \n     foundation for subsequent discussions regarding \n     environmentally sensitive, adjacent public lands. Rural \n     leaders in the design group supported this community-based, \n     grassroots approach. They expressed \n\n[[Page S18825]]\n     the need for local empowerment and a seat at the table when making \n     decisions regarding public lands issues affecting their \n     future.\n       The group boiled these ideas down to three community \n     questions, which were to be followed by broad-based wild \n     lands futures deliberations in a focused geographic area. The \n     community questions were: What do we have?, What do we want?, \n     and What can we do?. In short, the hypotheses proved correct. \n     Asking citizens what they valued, how they wanted the future \n     to look, and exploring options to achieve this vision on the \n     front side of a county-wide general planning initiative, led \n     to outcomes such as: 1. the formation of a public lands \n     council, 2. county agreement to enter wild lands futures \n     deliberations with a broad range of interests and affected \n     parties from within and without the county, 3. a county \n     proposal for the protection of over 500,000 acres of BLM land \n     (including 184,000 acres of wilderness), and 4. the \n     conceptualization of a public lands institute involving \n     cooperative partnerships with the BLM and other agencies for \n     the preservation and management of the San Rafael Swell.\n\n\n         Community and Wild Lands Futures Pilot Project (CWFP)\n\n       In the summer of 1993, the broad-based group of stakeholder \n     volunteers known as the Process Advisory Group, including \n     decision-makers and resource representatives, gave birth to \n     the Community and Wild Lands Futures Pilot Project. As \n     described in the opening of this paper, when challenged to \n     consider how a wilderness bill passed Congress by working \n     backwards from 1999, the Process Advisory Group agreed that \n     the first step should be community-based. Out of the \n     discussions came the following project goals:\n\n       1. Address community and wild lands futures in a rational \n     and scientific manner.\n       2. Create a grass roots process for comprehensive local \n     community planning and sustainability.\n       3. Identify resources to enrich the process and generate \n     useful information to share.\n       4. Connect the local visioning/planning process with the \n     issue of public wild land futures and with state and national \n     processes and players.\n       5. Develop a broad based recommendation for the \n     classification of public wild lands in the pilot region.\n       6. Educate the broader general public about rural planning \n     and community self-determination, and ecosystem management of \n     natural systems and wild lands issues.\n       7. Create a replicable model.\n\n       A concept paper was circulated among approximately 300 \n     interested parties at national, regional, state and local \n     levels requesting constructive feedback. The reviews were \n     favorable, which meant the next task was to select from one \n     of several receptive pilot communities. In October of 1993, \n     Emery County became the chosen community for the pilot \n     project, and the newly formed Canyon County Partnership (CCP) \n     received CUF funding to initiate staff support.\n       Today, the seed is germinating and concepts are maturing. \n     County initiated deliberations include ideas to 1. develop a \n     resource area partnership among Emery County, the BLM, the \n     Forest Service, and other public land users, 2. become a \n     nationally supported pilot program, and 3. conceptualize a \n     non-profit San Rafael Swell Institute. Today, Emery County is \n     proposing and exploring a planning/management partnership \n     arrangement with the BLM. The purpose would be to:\n       Incorporate direct local involvement in land management \n     agency planning processes.\n       Incorporate direct local involvement in land management \n     agency decision-making processes.\n       Reconcile differences between the Emery County Master Plan \n     and the planning goals and objective of the land management \n     agencies.\n       Develop consistency between the ordinances and regulations \n     of the federal and county entities.\n       Cooperate in law enforcement activities.\n       Cooperate in the provision of emergency services.\n       Cooperate in the permitting, design, placement, \n     construction, and costs of public facilities (roads, \n     buildings, etc.).\n       Cooperate in the facilitation of allowable uses.\n       Cooperate in the mitigation of impacts from various uses.\n       Cooperatively work to resolve local conflicts between uses, \n     users, and stakeholders.\n       Leverage the limited resources of the local and Federal \n     entities through coordinated efforts.\n       Share in a joint stewardship over the public lands within \n     Emery County.\n       CUF believes it is a major accomplishment that Emery County \n     is now adopting cooperative, problem-solving principles in \n     newly conceived public lands initiatives within the County.\n\n\n                        Application of the Model\n\n       In conclusion, the Community and Wild Lands Futures Pilot \n     Project did advance environmental decision-making through \n     inclusive community and interest group participation. \n     Outcomes are evolving and project participant evaluations \n     were overwhelmingly favorable. OPB's Brad Barber writes, ``It \n     [the project] taught us that this type of thing may work in \n     the future. Once a wilderness bill is done in Utah--we should \n     talk about moving into cooperative management.'' CUF board \n     member and Moab Times Editor, Sam Taylor says, ``In the event \n     the [Utah delegation] bill does not become law, CUF has laid \n     the ground work that will still lead to piece-meal resolution \n     for the BLM wilderness issue. We have given them a road-\n     map,'' he concludes.\n       Many participants believe that the pilot has application \n     value for comprehensive planning efforts in rural areas, and \n     some can see it being applied to growth management, \n     transportation, education and topical problems in urban \n     areas. It clearly is recognized as being superior to the \n     conventional approach of deriving local input from a couple \n     of perfunctory public hearings. Jane Brass suggests that the \n     need for disseminating information regarding the pilot model \n     ``is pervasive as states struggle with public lands issues.'' \n     She cautions that communities should not have consultants \n     dictate a quick way out. Rather, she recommends working \n     through a process to ``find answers that will be more \n     acceptable to your community''. Another participant echoed \n     the concern that it could be dangerous to create a ``cook \n     book approach''. The emphasis from a model should be on need \n     and a few questions to ask in the beginning, he cautioned. \n     Chairman Petersen advises other rural county leaders, who \n     might be considering a similar planning model, ``1. Put \n     together a good steering group, 2. Listen to their input, and \n     3. Listen to people from other areas and take advantage of \n     their successes and failures.''\n\n\n      Community Visions: a Catalyst for Creating Positive Futures\n\n       CWFP demonstrated that engaging local citizens in \n     discussions about their values and visions of the future \n     enabled them to develop solid plans for economic development \n     and empowered them to approach the highly polarized issue of \n     wilderness as an issue which could be resolved with their \n     traditional adversaries, not as a battle to be won.\n       The constructive progress made by the county in the \n     relatively short time will continue to bear fruit for the \n     county on public lands issues and other matters of county \n     interest. In reference to ``Discovering Common Ground'' by \n     Marvin Weisbord, project consultant, Susan Carpenter, \n     summarizes her perspective. She writes, ``Weisbord makes the \n     point that creating the tension between what we have and what \n     we really want is a much more effective way to get what we \n     want than the more traditional methods of problem-solving and \n     conflict management (identify the problem and then develop \n     options to solve it). My experience bear this out. I see the \n     Coalition's Emery County Community/Wild Lands Futures Project \n     as a powerful, effective model which can be applied to a wide \n     range of issues at the county and state level across the \n     West.'' Currently, CUF is moving forward with an initiative \n     focused on quality growth in Utah.

U.S. News & World Report named Stanley \nIsraelite, my friend, counsel, and senior adviser in my State office in \nConnecticut, as 1 of 12 ``indispensable Americans.'' It was an honor \nand a tribute, but not a surprise. Stanley's friends, his colleagues--\nand most certainly the people of Connecticut--have known that for \nyears.\n  The best decision I ever made was hiring Stanley Israelite. He has \nbeen a dedicated public servant in every sense of the term, and I have \ntrusted his counsel and treasured his companionship throughout my 21 \nyears as a Member of Congress. Mr. President, it is with pride, \nadmiration, and deference that I ask that this article from the \nNovember 27, 1995 issue of U.S. News & World Report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        Hounding the Bureaucrats\n\n                           (By James Popkin)\n\n       Lots of people's problems with their government aren't \n     ideological, they're logistical. That's why many rely on the \n     congressional aides like Stanley Israelite to help them fight \n     their battles with government agencies.\n       At age 70, Stanley Israelite is fighting a crusade to prove \n     the cynics wrong. Since 1975, when the gravelly voiced former \n     Brooklynite first went to work for then Rep. Christopher Dodd \n     (now a senator), Israelite has helped thousands of \n     Connecticut citizens replace lost passports, track down late \n     tax refunds, ship dearly departeds to grieving families \n     overseas and even bail the occasional misbehaving Connecticut \n     teenager out of Mexican jails.\n       All successful members of Congress have staffers like \n     Israelite who can goose reluctant bureaucrats into action. \n     Although Dodd happens to be a Democrat, effective constituent \n     service is a congressional specialty that cuts across \n     political lines. It's first and foremost a matter of good \n     politics: Good service results in happy voters. But what \n     distinguishes Israelite is his gusto for the job. And his \n     not-so-artful technique: ``When I call \n\n[[Page S18826]]\n     an agency because somebody is waiting for her Social Security check or \n     a guy is waiting for an FHA loan and the agency gives me some \n     song and dance, I try to let them know I'm not gonna take any \n     of their crap,'' he says. ``At times, I tell them I've \n     discussed this problem with the senator. Sometimes, it isn't \n     true.''\n       A former jewelry store owner and Chamber of Commerce honcho \n     from Norwich, Conn., Israelite is Dodd's pipeline to many of \n     the state's small-business owners. Harry Jackson, a lifelong \n     Republican who is the City Council president in Norwich, \n     recalls how difficult it was to get a meeting with officials \n     from the Environmental Protection Agency when the city wanted \n     to build a new firehouse on federal land. ``Stan got us in \n     there after just one phone call,'' says Jackson, who \n     ultimately built the firehouse.\n\n\n                            things happened.\n\n       Don Daren says Israelite was a lifesaver in 1981, when a \n     state-based paper distributor was trying to secure a $900,000 \n     umbrella loan from the Connecticut Development Authority. \n     Daren, who owns the Arrow Paper Supply and Food Co., says it \n     was going to take forever for the CDA to process his loan \n     papers so he could buy a new warehouse. ``Stanley told them \n     [CDA officials] my problem, and things happened right away,'' \n     says Daren, whose business has grown from 36 workers then to \n     nearly 200 today. ``He has his own constituency. People like \n     Stanley.''\n       Ideally, says veteran Hartford Courant political columnist \n     Don Noel, senators like Dodd would use their clout on Capitol \n     Hill to fix bureaucracies and make them more consumer \n     friendly--eliminating the need for taxpayer-financed \n     ombudsmen like Israelite. But since that goal seems \n     unattainable, Noel figures that Israelite plays a vital role. \n     ``If you have something you need the senator to do for you, \n     if anyone can do it, Stanley can,'' he says.\n       Israelite admits that he is motivated by a desire to help \n     re-elect Dodd. But he adds: ``Part of what drives me is \n     knowing that there's someplace where somebody can go when \n     they are not getting anyplace.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18825-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GENERIC ZANTAC\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, during the debate on an \namendment offered by my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, with \nregard to GATT patent extensions, there were representations made about \nthe availability of a generic form of Zantac. The Senate has expressed \nits support for Judiciary Committee hearings on this important issue. \nThe chairman of that committee has committed to hold a hearing on \nFebruary 27, 1996.\n  Some supporters of the generic drug companies claim that the hearings \nwill delay marketing of generic Zantac. This is not true. In fact, due \nto other outstanding patent issues with regard to Zantac, it is unclear \nwhen a generic form of Zantac will be available, but it will be at \nleast several months and likely to be after September 1996. Therefore, \nhearings held in early 1996 will permit more than sufficient time to \nresolve this question well before September 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a detailed \nbackground paper on the patent issues relating to Zantac.\n  The material follows:\n\n    Background on the Impact of GATT Patent Extensions on Potential \n  Availability of Generic Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride)\n\n       Even if the U.S. had not implemented the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), based on the generic \n     applications submitted to date, no generic form of Zantac \n     could have been legally marketed on December 5, when the \n     basic patent was scheduled to expire prior to the \n     implementation of GATT. Because of other outstanding patent \n     issues with regard to Zantac, it is unclear when a generic \n     form of Zantac will be available, but it will be at least \n     several months and is likely to be after September 1996.\n       Glaxo Wellcome has two product patents with respect to \n     ranitidine hydrochloride, which exists in two form:, referred \n     to as form 1 and Form 2. All of the Zantac sold by Glaxo \n     Wellcome worldwide has been Form 2. The Form 2 product patent \n     expires on June 4, 2002. It bars the marketing of generic \n     versions of Form 2 or any product that contains Form 2. In \n     September 1993, the validity of the Form 2 patent was upheld \n     in federal district court against a challenge by a generic \n     company. That decision was affirmed on appeal.\n       The basic patent was scheduled to expire on December 5, \n     1995, but was changed by the GATT implementing law to July \n     25, 1997. The basic patent bars the marketing of generic \n     versions of both Form 1 and Form 2. For various reasons it \n     may be more difficult to manufacture Form 1 ranitidine in a \n     pure form in commercial quantities over time. Even when the \n     basic patent expires, before a company can market a generic \n     form 1 ranitidine, they must demonstrate that their Form 1 \n     product is bioequivalent to Zantac and does not violate the \n     remaining Form 2 patent.\n       The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act \n     of 1984 (Hatch/Waxman Act) provides expedited procedures for \n     generic drugs to enter the market and for the resolution of \n     outstanding patent issues. Under these procedures, a company \n     seeking approval for a generic drug may file an Abbreviated \n     New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA. The ANDA must \n     contain one of the following certifications with respect to \n     each relevant patent on the pioneer drug: (I) patent \n     information has not been filed with the FDA, (II) the patent \n     has expired, (III) the patent will expire on a date \n     specified, or (IV) the patent is invalid or won't be \n     infringed.\n       If the ANDA contains a paragraph III certification listing \n     the patent expiration date, the FDA is precluded from making \n     the ANDA effective prior to that date. If the generic company \n     seeks to market a drug before the expiration of any relevant \n     patents, the ANDA must contain a paragraph IV certification \n     that the patents are invalid or won't be infringed, and the \n     generic company must notify the patent owner. Unless the \n     patent owner sues for infringement within 45 days of being \n     notified, the FDA can approve the ANDA.\n       If the patent owner does sue within 45 days, FDA cannot \n     make the ANDA effective immediately. To protect generics from \n     undue delay during litigation, the Act provides that the FDA \n     can make the ANDA effective after 30 months from the date the \n     patent holder is notified of the ANDA filing or when there is \n     a final court ruling that the patent is invalid or not \n     infringed, whichever is earlier.\n       All ANDA applicants seeking to market generic ranitidine \n     hydrochloride prior to 2002 have lawsuits pending against \n     them asserting violations of one or more patents. Because of \n     the 30 month provision, the pending litigation affects the \n     earliest date that generic ranitidine hydrochloride could be \n     marketed by any of these companies.\n       Even if the FDA were not precluded by the Hatch/Waxman Act \n     from making ANDAs effective prior to the expiration of the \n     full patent term for brand name drugs, September 1996 is the \n     earliest date under the Hatch/Waxman Act procedures that Form \n     1 generic ranitidine hydrochloride could be marketed by any \n     of these companies unless there is a final court ruling \n     earlier that the basic patent is invalid or that the generic \n     product does not infringe any Glaxo Wellcome patents.\n       Because a trial court decision is not considered final if \n     an appeal is taken, it is unlikely that a final court ruling \n     will occur prior to September 1996. In a prior patent \n     infringement case against Novopharm with respect to the \n     validity of the Form 2 patent, the trial court ruled in Glaxo \n     Wellcome's favor in September 1993. Novopharm appealed the \n     same month, but the appeal was not decided for 19 months, in \n     April 1995. The appeals court upheld the earlier decision in \n     favor of Glaxo Wellcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18826-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18826-S18827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WELFARE 2015\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, since the publication of Michael \nYoung's ``The Rise of Meritocracy'' in 1957, a book written from the \nperspective of Great Britian in the year 2034, there has not been so \nbrilliant an exercise in this format than Jason DeParle's ``Welfare, \nEnd of'' in yesterday's New York Times Magazine, looking back from the \nyear 2015. It foresees a social disaster that will follow the repeal of \ntitle IV-A of the Social Security Act, Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren, in this the 104th Congress. Mr. DeParle speculates that \nPresident Clinton will look back upon this as one of the greatest \nregrets of his Presidency.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\n  Welfare, End of--The Events That Led to its Demise in 1995, and the \n               Striking Consequences in the Years Since.\n\n                           (By Jason DeParle)\n\n       The following interactive encyclopedia entry looks back \n     from the year 2015. References to events before December 1995 \n     are real; subsequent developments may become so all too \n     quickly.\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       For 60 years, until 1995, the United States Government ran \n     a social program technically called Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children, and commonly known as welfare. The \n     program, which provided cash grants to indigent families, was \n     abolished as part of a bipartisan deal that reduced Federal \n     spending and transferred power to state governments. At the \n     time of its demise, welfare was a thoroughly discredited \n     program--often accused of causing long-term poverty rather \n     than helping people survive it.\n       A handful of critics accurately predicted that ending \n     welfare would bring rising numbers of ``street families,'' \n     just as the closing of mental hospitals had produced ``street \n     people'' in the 1970's and 80's. But most welfare \n     abolitionists argued that the poor would be better off \n     without the program. They would have been astonished to learn \n     that today, in 2015, the program they reviled as ``welfare'' \n     is often described nostalgically as \n\n[[Page S18827]]\n     the last thread of the ``Federal safety net.'' This entry summarizes \n     the consequences of abolishing welfare, and the odd political \n     dynamics that led to its end.\n\n\n                               the states\n\n       Though it grew into a potent symbol of social decay, the \n     A.F.D.C. program was established amid little controversy, as \n     a sidelight of the Social Security Act. It was intended to \n     provide small pensions to indigent widows, instead of placing \n     their children in orphanages. But the program changed during \n     a period of explosive growth in the late 1960's, as millions \n     of never-married women joined the rolls. If the program's \n     public face was once that of a West Virginia miner's widow, \n     it then became that of a young black woman in an urban \n     ghetto. There were about 14 million women and children \n     receiving benefits when the program ended, with the average \n     family of three getting about $370 a month.\n       Initially, those who warned of social catastrophe seemed \n     alarmist. In abolishing welfare, Congress gave the states \n     annual lump-sum payments, called block grants, to assist the \n     poor virtually any way they saw fit. The states were barred \n     from aiding families for more than five years, but most set \n     much shorter limits. By later standards, the sizes of the \n     first block grants were generous, and difficult as it is now \n     to imagine, the late 1990's seemed a golden age of state \n     experimentation.\n       In 1997, Mississippi contracted with church groups to run \n     its relief programs; within a few years the teen-age \n     pregnancy rate dropped 10 percent. Vermont placed a two-year \n     limit on benefits but offered subsidized jobs to those who \n     were still unemployed. Tennessee took a tougher tack, \n     imposing a strict 18-month cutoff with no further aid. But in \n     the late 1990's, Tennessee had a 3 percent unemployment rate, \n     and most mothers found at least part-time work. While \n     millions of poor families still led hand-to-mouth existences, \n     they always had; local control, whatever its problems, was \n     not unambiguously worse.\n       Then came the 1999 recession. Faced with declining revenues \n     and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments; the \n     mother of two who had received $370 in 1995 was now getting \n     $180 a month. With families crossing borders in search of \n     aid, the ``race to the bottom'' ensued, with each state \n     trying to be as tough as its neighbors. Just months after \n     Texas barred payments to legal immigrants, for instance, the \n     other border states followed. As an entitlement, the old \n     A.F.D.C. system promised, a check to any qualifying family \n     within 45 days; waiting lists now grew as long as two years. \n     As many as a million families who have received aid under the \n     Federal system now received nothing.\n       Though the economy recovered in subsequent years, state \n     spending did not. As the number of neglected children \n     skyrocketed, the child welfare system snapped. In 1995, there \n     were approximately 460,000 children in foster-care programs; \n     a decade later, the number approached one million. As the \n     numbers grew, the Federal Government began a 10-city \n     experiment to test the performance of orphanages--an idea \n     first broached by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n       The experiment earned high marks, but Congress balked at \n     its cost. A year at the latter-day Boys' Towns cost more than \n     a year at Harvard, and lawmakers refused to keep financing \n     them.\n\n\n                               the people\n\n       The end of welfare was accompanied by major cuts in food, \n     housing and medical programs. And it came when the wages of \n     low-skilled workers were already in a free fall because of \n     global competition. So it is not surprising that poor people \n     have seen their standard of living decline, while their \n     numbers are rapidly increasing. Until 1995, for instance, all \n     poor children in America had health insurance under a program \n     called Medicaid. The successor state programs have largely \n     devoted their resources to the elderly, leaving about half \n     the nation's poor children uninsured.\n       Not all former recipients have fared poorly. As many as a \n     quarter of the five million A.F.D.C. families found and \n     retained full-time work. For them, the end of welfare worked \n     much as it was intended--as a prompt to greater self-\n     reliance. They received considerable publicity in the late \n     1990's as welfare abolitionists tried to rebut charges that \n     the cuts had been cruel. A coalition of conservative groups \n     sponsored the ``Million Mothers March,'' a day of speeches \n     and prayer by former recipients to celebrate their new lives. \n     While their earnings remained quite modest--often little more \n     than they had received on welfare--many mothers praised the \n     psychic rewards of serving as ``positive role models.''\n       Far more numerous are those in a second category: \n     ``cyclers,'' who have alternated between short-term \n     employment and charitable aid. The cycling phenomenon was \n     first identified in the mid-1980's by researchers at Harvard \n     University who hoped to see expanded Government aid. Part of \n     the cyclers' continuing problem has been economic: whether \n     they work as telemarketers, cosmetologists, cashiers or \n     clerks, they are typically the last hired and first fired.\n       But even in good times, the chaos of many low-income homes \n     spills onto the job. Brokendown cars, sick relatives and a \n     lack of child care are perennial problems--indeed, a 2007 \n     study by the Children's Defense Fund found that dozens of \n     mothers were arrested each year for locking their children in \n     cars as they worked. Sociologists estimate that since welfare \n     ended, about half the former population has fallen into this \n     pattern of sporadic work with little hope for advancement.\n       At the same time, about 25 percent of the A.F.D.C. \n     families--that is, more than a million of them--have fallen \n     into utter destitution. The public now sees them lining up at \n     shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on \n     street corners. At the time of abolition, half the welfare \n     mothers lacked a high-school diploma, and in inner cities as \n     many as one in three had histories of some drug or alcohol \n     abuse; a subsequent study by the Rockefeller Foundation \n     emphasized how many remained deeply disturbed. It found that \n     by 2005, three-fourths of the families entering shelters were \n     those of welfare mothers who had exhausted their lifetime \n     eligibility.\n       The Rockefeller study, ``Repeating Mistakes,'' compared the \n     1995 law ending welfare with the 1960's move that \n     deinstitutionalized the mentally ill. Schizophrenics were \n     supposed to find community-based programs; welfare recipients \n     were entrusted to state agencies. In neither case did the \n     local safety net appear. Like the 1980's street people, the \n     homeless families of the early 21st century enjoyed a brief \n     period of Hollywood vogue. Meryl Streep won an Oscar in 2006 \n     for her portrayal of a destitute woman.\n       But one again, charity chic faded.\n       The end of welfare also brought unintended consequences in \n     the area of morality. The abolitionists had hoped to spur a \n     return to work, marriage and responsibility. But for some of \n     the poorest women, the loss of aid had the opposite effect. \n     Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports \n     of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels \n     and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities \n     to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones.\n\n\n                                politics\n\n       Antipathy for the dole is as old as the country itself, but \n     it gained a sudden new potency in the mid-1990's, just before \n     the program's demise. Oddly enough, it was President William \n     Jefferson Clinton, a Democrat, who set the new forces into \n     motion. In his 1992 campaign, he famously promised to ``end \n     welfare as we know it'' by imposing time limits and work \n     requirements. When he later failed to promote his plan, the \n     Republicans pushed his rhetoric to a conclusion he had not \n     envisioned.\n       Clinton's initial plan for ending welfare had included new \n     training, universal health care and job guarantees. But the \n     actual end meant only that. And a President who had pledged \n     to expand the income and medical security of all Americans \n     wound up presiding over an unprecedented contraction of the \n     safety net.\n       In his recent memoirs, the ex-President describes his \n     handling of the issue as ``one of my greatest regrets.'' He \n     acknowledges that his party's defeat in the 1994 elections \n     left him reluctant to spend political capital on the welfare \n     poor. His own plan had included the toughest work \n     requirements any President had ever proposed. But by the fall \n     of 1995 Clinton had joined those dismissing it as weak, \n     apologizing in an interview: ``I wasn't pleased with it \n     either.''\n       At the same time, Clinton argues in his memoirs that he was \n     genuinely surprised that the subsequent state-based system \n     collapsed so quickly. Throughout 1995 he had looked \n     skeptically at his own aides' predictions that poverty would \n     rise sharply. But the memoirs do recount one moment of doubt. \n     On the day before Thanksgiving 1995, Clinton served dinner at \n     a homeless shelter in Washington, where, as he explained at \n     the time, he was distributed to see that ``the fastest \n     growing group of homeless people in our country are young \n     women and their young children.''\n       Looking back 20 years later, Clinton confessed something he \n     did not disclose that day at the shelter. Standing in the \n     serving line, a month before welfare's end, he feared that he \n     had just got a glimpse of America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18826-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18827-S18828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1530\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 280, S. 1228.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1228) to impose sanctions on foreign persons \n     exporting petroleum products, natural gas, or related \n     technology to Iran, which had been reported from the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, with an \n     amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Oil Sanctions Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them and \n     its support of international terrorism endanger the national \n     security and foreign policy interests of the United States \n     and those countries with which it shares common strategic and \n     foreign policy objectives.\n       (2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism \n     through existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives \n     requires additional efforts to deny Iran the financial means \n     to sustain its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile \n     weapons programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United \n     States to deny Iran the ability to support international \n     terrorism and to fund the development and acquisition of \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them by \n     limiting the development of petroleum resources in Iran.\n\n     SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (d), the \n     President shall impose one or more of the sanctions described \n     in section 5 on a person subject to this section (in this Act \n     referred to as a ``sanctioned person''), if the President \n     determines that the person has, with actual knowledge, on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, made an investment \n     of more than $40,000,000 (or any combination of investments \n     of at least $10,000,000 each, which in the aggregate exceeds \n     $40,000,000 in any 12-month period), that significantly and \n     materially contributed to the development of petroleum \n     resources in Iran.\n       (b) Persons Against Which the Sanctions Are To Be \n     Imposed.--The sanctions described in subsection (a) shall be \n     imposed on any person the President determines--\n       (1) has carried out the activities described in subsection \n     (a);\n       (2) is a successor entity to that person;\n       (3) is a person that is a parent or subsidiary of that \n     person if that parent or subsidiary with actual knowledge \n     engaged in the activities which were the basis of that \n     determination; and\n       (4) is a person that is an affiliate of that person if that \n     affiliate with actual knowledge engaged in the activities \n     which were the basis of that determination and if that \n     affiliate is controlled in fact by that person.\n       (c) Publication in Federal Register.--The President shall \n     cause to be published in the Federal Register a current list \n     of persons that are subject to sanctions under subsection \n     (a). The President shall remove or add the names of persons \n     to the list published under this subsection as may be \n     necessary.\n       (d) Exceptions.--The President shall not be required to \n     apply or maintain the sanctions under subsection (a)--\n       (1) to products or services provided under contracts \n     entered into before the date on which the President publishes \n     his intention to impose the sanction; or\n       (2) to medicines, medical supplies, or other humanitarian \n     items.\n\n     SEC. 5. DESCRIPTION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       The sanctions to be imposed on a person under section 4(a) \n     are as follows:\n       (1) Export-import bank assistance for exports to sanctioned \n     persons.--The President may direct the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States not to guarantee, insure, extend credit, or \n     participate in the extension of credit in connection with the \n     export of any goods or services to any sanctioned person.\n       (2) Export sanction.--The President may order the United \n     States Government not to issue any specific license and not \n     to grant any other specific permission or authority to export \n     any goods or technology to a sanctioned person under--\n       (A) the Export Administration Act of 1979;\n       (B) the Arms Export Control Act;\n       (C) the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; or\n       (D) any other statute that requires the prior review and \n     approval of the United States Government as a condition for \n     the exportation of goods and services, or their re-export, to \n     any person designated by the President under section 4(a).\n       (3) Loans from united states financial institutions.--The \n     United States Government may prohibit any United States \n     financial institution from making any loan or providing any \n     credit to any sanctioned person in an amount exceeding \n     $10,000,000 in any 12-month period (or two or more loans of \n     more than $5,000,000 each in such period) unless such person \n     is engaged in activities to relieve human suffering within \n     the meaning of section 203(b)(2) of the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n       (4) Prohibitions on financial institutions.--The following \n     prohibitions may be imposed against financial institutions \n     sanctioned under section 4(a):\n       (A) Designation as primary dealer.--Neither the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor the Federal \n     Reserve Bank of New York may designate, or permit the \n     continuation of any prior designation of, such financial \n     institution as a primary dealer in United States Government \n     debt instruments.\n       (B) Government funds.--Such financial institution shall not \n     serve as agent of the United States Government or serve as \n     repository for United States Government funds.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADVISORY OPINIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of State may, upon the request of any person, \n     issue an advisory opinion, to that person as to whether a \n     proposed activity by that person would subject that person to \n     sanctions under this Act. Any person who relies in good faith \n     on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed \n     activity would not subject a person to such sanctions, and \n     any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not \n     be made subject to such sanctions on account of such \n     activity.\n\n     SEC. 7. DURATION OF SANCTIONS; PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       (a) Delay of Sanctions.--\n       (1) Consultations.--If the President makes a determination \n     described in section 4(a) with respect to a foreign person, \n     the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations \n     immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over that foreign person with respect to the imposition of \n     sanctions pursuant to this Act.\n       (2) Actions by government of jurisdiction.--In order to \n     pursue such consultations with that government, the President \n     may delay imposition of sanctions pursuant to this Act for up \n     to 90 days. Following such consultations, the President shall \n     immediately impose a sanction or sanctions unless the \n     President determines and certifies to the Congress that the \n     government has taken specific and effective actions, \n     including, as appropriate, the imposition of appropriate \n     penalties, to terminate the involvement of the foreign person \n     in the activities that resulted in the determination by the \n     President pursuant to section 4(a) concerning such person.\n       (3) Additional delay in imposition of sanctions.--The \n     President may delay the imposition of sanctions for up to an \n     additional 90 days if the President determines and certifies \n     to the Congress that the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over the foreign person is in the process of taking the \n     actions described in paragraph (2).\n       (4) Report to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     making a determination under section 4(a), the President \n     shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a report which \n     shall include information on the status of consultations with \n     the appropriate foreign government under this subsection, and \n     the basis for any determination under paragraph (3).\n       (b) Duration of Sanctions.--The requirement to impose \n     sanctions pursuant to section 4(a) shall remain in effect \n     until the President determines that the sanctioned person is \n     no longer engaging in the activity that led to the imposition \n     of sanctions.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver.--(1) The President may waive the \n     requirement in section 4(a) to impose a sanction or sanctions \n     on a person in section 4(b), and may waive the continued \n     imposition of a sanction or sanctions under subsection (b) of \n     this section, 15 days after the President determines and so \n     reports to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives that it is \n     important to the national interest of the United States to \n     exercise such waiver authority.\n       (2) Any such report shall provide a specific and detailed \n     rationale for such determination, including--\n       (A) a description of the conduct that resulted in the \n     determination;\n       (B) in the case of a foreign person, an explanation of the \n     efforts to secure the cooperation of the government with \n     primary jurisdiction of the sanctioned person to terminate \n     or, as appropriate, penalize the activities that resulted in \n     the determination;\n       (C) an estimate as to the significance of the investment to \n     Iran's ability to develop its petroleum resources; and\n       (D) a statement as to the response of the United States in \n     the event that such person engages in other activities that \n     would be subject to section 4(a).\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       The sanctions requirement of section 4 shall no longer have \n     force or effect if the President determines and certifies to \n     the appropriate congressional committees that Iran--\n       (1) has ceased its efforts to design, develop, manufacture, \n     or acquire--\n       (A) a nuclear explosive device or related materials and \n     technology;\n       (B) chemical and biological weapons; or\n       (C) ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch \n     technology; and\n       (2) has been removed from the list of state sponsors of \n     international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979.\n\n     SEC. 9. REPORT REQUIRED.\n\n       The President shall ensure the continued transmittal to \n     Congress of reports describing--\n     \n[[Page S18829]]\n\n       (1) the nuclear and other military capabilities of Iran, as \n     required by section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Act of 1978 and section 1607 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1993; and\n       (2) the support provided by Iran for acts of international \n     terrorism, as part of the Department of State's annual report \n     on international terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Madam President, I rise today to comment on the passage \nof S. 1228, the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 1995.\n  Now, we have a bill with teeth, that will say to those companies that \nprovide investment in Iran's oil and natural gas sectors, ``you can \ntrade with us, or trade with them.'' And more importantly the bill is \nextraterritorial. This precedent is important because now for the first \ntime, we will be establishing the concept that the economic development \nof the Iranian regime is a threat to our national security. As I have \nsaid many times, this point is vital to understanding the fact that \nIran uses its hard currency to fund its aggression. This, in fact, is \nthe primary goal, namely to deprive Iran of the hard currency needed to \nobtain weapons of mass destruction and to fund its vast terrorist \nnetwork.\n  The administration has indicated that it will support this version of \nthe bill and that the President will sign it.\n  For far too long the United States had been subsidizing Iranian \nterrorism through our trade with Iran. Following our lead, President \nClinton issued an Executive order on May 6, 1995, banning all trade \nwith Iran. Now, the United States no longer is doing business with \nIran. Unfortunately, the other nations of the world have failed to join \nus in this embargo. While Iran is racing to obtain weapons of mass \ndestruction, many other countries of the world are subsidizing them \nthrough their development of the Iranian oil fields. This kind of \nbusiness gives Iran hard currency to fund terrorism and its quest for \nnuclear weapons.\n  Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff said it best, when at a hearing \nbefore this committee he stated:\n\n       A straight line links Iran's oil income and its ability to \n     sponsor terrorism, build weapons of mass destruction, and \n     acquire sophisticated armaments. Any government or private \n     company that helps Iran to expand its oil [production] must \n     accept that it is . . . contributing to this menace.\n\n  This cannot continue and this is why I and my colleagues introduced \nS. 1228, which now has 43 cosponsors. I thank them for their support \nfor this important bill.\n  We can wait no longer. We must put real teeth in our policy of \neconomically isolating and undermining a regime which has embarked on \npolicies of terrorism and aggression that impose a clear and present \ndanger to the vital security interests of our own Nation.\n  Without such a policy there is no doubt that Iran will continue to \nget the benefit of doing business with companies that put their own \ndesire for profits ahead of the interests of the international \ncommunity in preventing Iran from joining the nuclear weapons club and \ncontinuing its vast support for terrorist groups. With such a policy, \nthere would be a real chance of convincing Iran that its attempt to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction and its promotion of international \nterrorism is entirely counterproductive.\n  If foreign companies are to understand that they are subsidizing \nIranian terrorism they should heed the words of Secretary of State \nWarren Christopher's statement before the U.N. General Assembly on \nOctober 25, 1995, when he stated:\n\n       Every dollar that goes into the coffers of a state sponsor \n     of terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass \n     destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to \n     prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities.\n\n  No one could have said it better. I hope that our friends overseas \nunderstand this as well, but if they fail to do so, this bill will \nserve as a reminder.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1228, the Iran \nOil Sanctions Act of 1995. This bill would put sanctions on foreign \ncompanies that invest in Iran and thereby help that country develop its \noil and gas resources. The increased revenue from such enhanced oil \nproduction augments Iran's ability to fund its development of nuclear \nweapons and its support for international terrorism.\n  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, American administrations with \nbipartisan congressional support have used economic sanctions to hinder \nIran's support for international terrorism and to make it harder for \nthat country to get materials and revenues to strengthen its nuclear \nand conventional weapons programs.\n  Earlier this year, just prior to the Banking Committee's March 16 \nhearing on our country's economic relations with Iran, the committee \nlearned that then existing restrictions on such relations did not \nprohibit the Conoco Co. from signing a contract with Iran to develop a \nhuge offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf. The Clinton administration \nimmediately announced that while Conoco's actions were not illegal, \nthey were ``inconsistent with our policy of brining pressure on Iran, \nboth politically and economically to change its unacceptable \nbehavior.'' The President then on March 15 issued an Executive order \nprohibiting United States persons from entering into contracts for the \nfinancing or the overall supervision and management of the petroleum \nresources of Iran.\n  On May 8, President Clinton issued another Executive order that \nimposed significant new economic sanctions on Iran, including a \nprohibition on trading in goods or services of Iranian origin, a ban on \nexports to Iran, and a ban on new investment or bank loans to Iran. The \nnew prohibitions applied to U.S. persons, wherever they may be, \nincluding the foreign branches of U.S. entities.\n  The Clinton administration also urged other countries to support \nUnited States efforts to pressure Iran economically and persuaded our \nG7 allies to avoid any collaboration with Iran that might help that \ncountry develop a nuclear weapons capability. A number of foreign \ncorporations, however, are supporting Iran's efforts to increase its \noil and gas production. S. 1228 seeks to persuade such companies from \nassisting Iran as the latter uses its oil and gas revenues to fund \nbehavior harmful to the international community.\n  At the Banking Committee's October 11 hearing on S. 1228, Under \nSecretary of State Tarnoff told the committee that ``a straight line \nlinks Iran's oil income and its ability to sponsor terrorism, build \nweapons of mass destruction, and acquire sophisticated armaments.'' He \nalso told us that the administration was making great efforts to \npersuade other nations to cooperate with our embargo of Iran. He \nexpressed concerns, however, that we not enact legislation that would \nmake it more difficult to get that cooperation. Chairman D'Amato \nassured Under Secretary Tarnoff that he wanted to work with the \nadministration in crafting legislation that would persuade foreign \ncompanies to cooperate with our embargo of Iran. \n\n[[Page S18830]]\n\n  Prior to the December 12 committee markup of S. 1228, Chairman \nD'Amato, Senator Boxer, myself, and other members of the committee \nworked with the administration to develop a bill the administration \ncould endorse. Agreement was reached and on December 12, the committee \nadopted a substitute version of S. 1228 that President Clinton \nsupports.\n  It does not target trade but rather new investment contracts that \nenhance Iran's ability to produce oil and gas. The bill also provides \nthe President the necessary flexibility to determine the best mix of \nsanctions in a particular case, and to waive the imposition--or \ncontinued imposition--of sanctions when he determines it is important \nto the national interest to do so. In using these authorities, the \nPresident is directed to consider factors such as the significance of \nan investment, the prospects for cooperation with other governments, \nU.S. international commitments, and the effect of sanctions on U.S. \neconomic interests and regional policies. Finally, S. 1228 authorizes \nthe Secretary of State to provide advisory opinions on whether a \nproposed activity would be covered to avoid unnecessary uncertainty on \nthe part of companies and friction with allies.\n  This bill was reported out of committee by a vote of 15-0. It is a \nbill I support because it will make it more difficult for Iran to fund \nits efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and its support for \ninternational terrorism. I urge its enactment.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third time, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendment was agreed to.\n  So the bill (S. 1228), as amended, was deemed read the third time, \nand passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``A bill to deter investment in \nthe development of Iran's petroleum resources.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/18/senate-section/article/S18828-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BRUCE R.
