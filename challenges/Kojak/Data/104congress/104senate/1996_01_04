Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think it is clear that the effect of this will be to \ncontinue the District of Columbia government until January 25 at which \ntime we hope we will have an agreement, or we will have some permanent \nresolution of appropriations bills and the D.C. appropriations bill. \nThere is only one outstanding difference on that appropriations bill. \nIt relates to vouchers.

Mr. President, while I agree that it is right to deal \nwith the problems facing the District of Columbia, there should be no \nmisunderstanding about the current situation. There are hundreds and \nhundreds of problems that are being created almost on a daily basis \nthat have not been dealt with. Veterans are again in the same position \nthey were prior to Christmas. If something is not done prior to the end \nof this month, veterans will not receive their disability checks.\n  If something is not done before the end of this month, AFDC \nrecipients will not have their checks.\n  If something is not done before the end of this month, 260,000 \nFederal workers will have been out of work for an entire month. And the \ntaxpayers are paying $40 million a day for this to occur.\n  How ironic can it be? The irony certainly must be apparent to every \none of the people involved. How ironic that at the very time we are \ndealing with the budget, trying to find some resolution to the deficit, \nwe are creating through this irresponsible Government shutdown a $40 \nmillion deficit unnecessarily each and every day. It is just \noutrageous. \n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  The Senate has, through leadership of the majority leader and \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, come to terms with this. We \npassed the continuing resolution. That issue is over and done with.\n  What remains is for the House to act responsibly to do what they \nshould have done weeks ago--to pass a continuing resolution, put people \nback to work, and make absolutely certain that this horrendous \nsituation we face today is solved once and for all.\n  If we do not, there will continue to be dire consequences. Everyone \nshould know that Meals on Wheels runs out of money this week. Senior \ncitizens who may only receive one meal a day will cease receiving those \nmeals as a result of the inaction in the House. Senior citizens will go \nhungry. No one ought to be confused about it. Everyone ought to \nunderstand the implications of what we are doing here. Seniors who may \nnot get any other nutritional opportunities for the entire day will be \ndenied this one meal as a result of House Republican intransigence.\n  Medicare contractors are no longer being paid. Medicare contractors \nare now being asked to go out and provide medical services without any \ncompensation at all.\n  So are we affecting the lives and health of millions of Americans \nbeyond Federal workers? Absolutely. We are doing it today.\n  I already mentioned veterans not receiving their disability benefits. \nThey are not receiving educational benefits either.\n  Unemployment offices--we have people out of work, walking in for \nunemployment compensation, not knowing how they are going to pay their \nbills. Their situation is totally unrelated to any budget negotiations. \nThey are walking into unemployment offices and finding that no one can \nprovide them with service because 10 States have already been forced to \nshut down their unemployment offices. Ten States have shut down every \nsingle unemployment office\n  So people seeking help--not Federal employees, not people who may be \npart of the Federal Government but people who are out of work--are now \nbeing told there is nothing that we can do for them either.\n  Superfund has been halted now for cleanups in 32 toxic wastesites. \nThere are 32 sites around the country completely shut down as a result \nof what has happened here in the Congress, and what is happening--or \nnot happening--on the House side.\n  There are 20,000 student loans per day that are not being processed.\n  I had a call a couple of days ago from a friend in South Dakota whose \ndaughter is depressed and in tears wondering just what is going to \nhappen because she was told she cannot even go back to college because \nher student loan did not come through for the second semester. What \nhappens to the next 6 months of her life?\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about furloughing Federal \nworkers without pay. But it appears that the House may furlough \nthemselves with pay. How outrageous can that be? What a contrast. What \nan incredible juxtaposition of fairness. The House is going out on a 2-\nweek vacation with pay.\n  Every Federal worker is left at home without pay and the Federal \ntaxpayer is left holding the bag each and every day for services not \nrendered.\n  This country has been in very difficult positions in the past. But I \ndaresay, Mr. President, that this is the most inexplicable, outrageous \nsituation that I have seen since coming to the Senate. It has to end. \nThe House has to come to grips with taking the responsibility and doing \nthe right thing. It has to happen, and it better happen today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S35-7", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, 100 years ago today, Utah became the 45th \nState of the Union. I wish to join with Utahns everywhere and celebrate \nthis momentous day, as I am sure my colleagues would as well, and I \nextend my best wishes for the next century.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 100 years ago today, January 4, 1896, \nPresident Grover Cleveland signed a proclamation admitting Utah as the \n45th State of the Union. I rise in recognition of this event and to \njoin with Utahns everywhere to celebrate the centennial of the State of \nUtah.\n  Prior to President Cleveland's action, Utahns had diligently battled \nfor more than half a century to attain this goal. The telegram \nannouncing Utah's statehood arrived at 9:13 a.m. on that winter morning \nin January at the Western Union office located on Main Street in Salt \nLake City. As gunshots rang out the news, hundreds of people began \nshouting with joy, ``Statehood has been proclaimed.'' Bells and \nwhistles reverberated throughout the valley, and one-by-one, 100 \nAmerican flags were hoisted.\n  President Cleveland actually signed the proclamation at 10:03 a.m. in \nWashington, DC. His private secretary, Mr. Thurber, was quoted in the \nSalt Lake Tribune as saying,\n\n       The President looked upon the signing of the proclamation \n     as purely as Executive act, and one not, therefore, to be \n     witnessed by the public any more than the affixing of his \n     signature to other routine business which came before him.\n\n  Let me emphatically state 100 years later than President Cleveland's \nact was not just routine business--this was the birth of a truly \nremarkable State.\n  Utah is great because its people make it so. Utahns, regardless of \nreligious affiliation, hold solid values in common that I believe are \nessential to the quality of life anywhere. These include a strong work \nethic, honesty, charity, compassion, thrift, perseverance, and respect \nfor the family. There is a positive can do attitude in our State that \nis irresistible and refreshing.\n  As our State motto indicates, Utah is industrious. As we excel in the \narts and humanities, we also excel in the sciences and in commerce. \nThis success has brought us an enviable level of prosperity compared to \nother States, and sets the stage for a stable future for our children.\n  Utah's natural beauty is unsurpassed. The State of Utah has as a \nlasting and historical landmark, the Great Salt Lake; the greatest snow \non Earth; and everything to offer in pure natural beauty. We are \nsurrounded by the majesty of our mountains and forests; the \nbreathtaking beauty of our red rock canyons; and the wide, open, \nlimitless expanse of our farmlands and deserts.\n  People have come to Utah from every part of the world with one basic \nmotivation--the belief that this is the place where they would find the \nopportunity to pursue their hopes and dreams. Utah's history is filled \nwith tales of people who have displayed remarkable determination and \nthe will to forge ahead regardless of the odds. Our history and our \npeople have literally made a desert blossom. Utah leaves an indelible \nimpression upon its citizens, its visitors, and its leaders. The Utah \nvalues and the people who believe in them are the reasons Utah is a \nwonderful place to live, work, and most importantly raise our families.\n  Mr. President, most of my colleagues have had the opportunity to \nvisit Utah and experience the spirit that makes our State what it is \ntoday. As many have told me, they can fully understand why I am so \nproud to represent Utah in this body. I choose to bring this highly \nimportant date to the attention of the Senate in the hope that my \ncolleagues will join with me in congratulating all Utahns for a job \nwell done.\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\n  I want to publicly recognize all of the citizens of the great State \nof Utah and sincerely thank them for making Utah the wonderful place \nthat it is today. I am honored to represent the people of Utah, and I \nhope and pray that the next 100 years will be successful and peaceful \nfor all those who dwell within Utah's borders. Happy 100th birthday \nUtah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate the current celebration which is ongoing in my home State of \nUtah. With the beginning of this new year, Utah begins its centennial \ncelebration having been admitted to the Union of States in 1896.\n  This 100-year mark is very significant considering the long struggle \nfor the citizens of the Utah Territory to gain statehood in the late \n19th century. The people of the Utah Territory tried unsuccessfully for \nadmission to the Union six times--1849, 1856, 1862, 1872, 1882, and \n1887--before being admitted in 1896.\n  Today, Utah is one of the fastest growing States in the country. \nBusiness is thriving as more and more companies establish roots in the \nState. The banking and financial industry have a long history of \nsuccess in Utah. Manufacturing industry continues to grow and succeed. \nUtah's software industry is growing so rapidly that it has now \nsurpassed that of Silicon Valley. Utah provides many opportunities for \nthe families that reside in the State. With six 4-year, degree-granting \nuniversities and colleges, including four State institutions and two \nprivate institutions, Utah provides its citizens with many \nopportunities to enhance their education and circumstances. Today, Utah \nis ranked among the stop States in the Nation for the quality of its \ngraduates.\n  Again, Mr. President, it brings me great pleasure to join with the \npeople of my State in celebrating during this centennial year. I would \nlike to pay tribute to the many people who have worked so hard to put \ntogether the events that are taking place this week and throughout the \nremainder of this year. In particular I would like to single out Mr. \nSteve Studdert for the fine job he has done as chairman of the Utah \nCentennial Commission. Additionally, thanks goes to Gov. Mike Leavitt \nand his many predecessors who have worked so hard over the past 100 \nyears to make Utah what it is today. Of course we cannot forget our \npioneer founders who saw the vision of what the desert could yield and \nput forth the hard work to cultivate and culture the Rocky Mountain \nvalleys we now call home.\n  For Utahns who find themselves transplanted to Washington, DC, I \nwould like to announce that a celebration will be held here on the 27th \nof January, commemorating Utah's centennial. My staff and I can be \ncontacted for further details.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S36-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S37-S38]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET STALEMATE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know that this is a Presidential election \nyear. We are going to have a hotly debated and contested Presidential \nelection. But it is going to be on issues that are important, as \nindicated by the action taken by the majority leader day before \nyesterday.\n  I commend and applaud publicly the action of the majority leader in \nallowing the Senate to pass a clean continuing resolution. I say that \nbecause the issue of allowing the Federal workers to go to work is \nimportant. It is important to more than just the Federal workers. \nTherefore, I think it is important we talk about procedure so that \npeople understand a little bit better what is going on.\n  The House of Representatives yesterday refused to allow to come to a \nvote--they refused to allow the continuing resolution that has passed \nthe Senate to come before the House to be voted upon. They did that, \nthe leadership in the House refused to let it come forward, because \nthey knew if it came forward, it would pass.\n  That, to me, is a cowardly act. Why would they not let people stand \nin the light of day and cast their vote as to whether or not this \nGovernment could continue to function? They refused to do it because \nthey knew if they brought it up for a vote, it would pass.\n  There are some in the House who think they are hurting what they \nhate; namely, the Federal Government, but they are hurting a lot more \nthan just the Federal Government. Look at any newspaper, wherever it \nmight be, in the United States today, and you will find the same \nstories.\n  I think the most illustrative appears in today's USA Today. In \ntoday's USA Today, Bangladesh, if not the poorest, one of the poorest \ncountries in the world, is going to loan money to the United States to \nkeep the Embassy open in Bangladesh. How embarrassing.\n\n       In Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, the \n     government has offered a loan [to the United States] to \n     keep lights on at the United States embassy in Dhaka.\n\n  It is hurting more than Federal workers. Alabama ran out of Federal \nunemployment money, as did many other States.\n\n       U.S. embassies around the world are being forced to beg for \n     credit.\n\n  You have businesses and governments throughout the world saying the \nUnited States cannot pay, will you give us some credit.\n\n       In Miami--\n\n  This same newspaper reports--\n\n     fishing guide Mike Haines has lost $3,000 in the past 2 \n     weeks. Haines takes people on fishing trips in Everglades \n     National Park which shut down December 20.\n       Now, 2 months after fulfilling his boyhood dream of being a \n     full-time fishing guide, Haines is scrambling to make ends \n     meet.\n       The Federal court system, including the Supreme Court, is \n     running out of funds. It has tapped into a $120 million \n     emergency fund drawn from fees collected by the courts.\n\n  They are going to run out of money on the 7th. That is Saturday, or \nSunday. The Federal courts are going to run out of money.\n\n       About 15,000 employees of Government contractors are \n     temporarily out of work.\n\n  On television last night in the news it was very, very graphic--\npeople with uniforms, protective uniforms, faces covered, every part of \ntheir body covered, working in toxic waste dumps, being laid off.\n  The L.A. Times--this is not something just within the beltway. It is \nall over the country. The L.A. Times:\n\n       Shutdown Begins To Hit Home Across the United States.\n       The effects of the shutdown have spread gradually during \n     the holidays, customarily a slow time in the public and \n     private sectors, but this week the pace quickened and the \n     closure is being felt in everything from restaurants and \n     tourist businesses to toxic waste cleanup.\n\n  National parks, Mr. President, according to the New York Times, \naverage 383,000 visitors a day. They are closed; a potential loss to \nbusinesses of $200 million a day. That $200 million goes to people's \nwages. Those people can buy cars. This, Mr. President, is an economic \ndisaster based upon an unwillingness of a certain small group of people \nin the other body to allow an up-or-down vote on whether or not the CR \nshould continue. Of course, it should continue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wish to add one further example. In Mariposa County, \nCA----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to him. He wanted to ask me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do so through the Chair, please.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thought that was the question that had been put \nearlier, I say to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the Senator aware that apparently,\n\n       In Mariposa County, CA, home of Yosemite National Park, \n     which has been closed through one of the busiest times of the \n     year, the number of private sector layoffs has climbed to \n     over 1,600 people. Most are hotel, restaurant, and gas \n     station workers who usually can depend on the revenue they \n     collect during the holiday season to carry them until the \n     summer. One-fourth of the adults in that county are out of \n     work. Officials there have declared an economic emergency.\n\n  I say, is this not yet another example of the kind of harm that is \nbeing felt across the country as a consequence of this closure of the \nGovernment?\n  Mr. REID. I would respond to my friend's question that the answer is \nyes. Even in Reno, NV, northern Nevada, why, we have significant \nnumbers of people coming from California \n\n[[Page S38]]\nall the time, and they many times do continue when they are visiting \nYosemite, which is so close to Nevada. That has been lost.\n  This is felt by not only Federal workers; this is felt by non-Federal \nworkers, and it is really reverberating throughout the entire United \nStates. And I also respond to my friend that it is going to get worse, \nas indicated in these newspapers about which I was talking.\n  The L.A. Times goes on to say that ``at the other end of the economic \nspectrum''--they are talking about people. The reason they say this is, \nunemployment compensation checks, as indicated by the minority leader, \nare not being sent out in a number of States, but at the other end of \nthe economic spectrum, many businesses are unable to obtain needed \nexport licenses or are being left with no way to obtain required \nFederal approval of special imports or other transactions.\n  That is jobs. It is fancy talk, but it means jobs.\n  Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot approve various \nofferings that have been made. Why is that important? It is important \nbecause each time a new company, a new stock offering is made, people \nare hired, put to work. They are simply not being put to work, all \nbecause a few people in the other body refuse--the leadership led by \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives refuses to allow that issue \nto come to a vote.\n\n  I see in the Chamber my friend from the State of Virginia. One of his \nfellow Members of Congress, Congressman Davis, with whom I am not \npersonally familiar but someone I have followed, he publicly, a \nRepublican, spoke out yesterday saying let us at least have a vote on \nthe House floor as to whether or not a continuing resolution should \npass.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just left, Mr. President, Congressman Davis' office. \nThe delegation here in the greater metropolitan area, Congressman \nDavis, myself, Congresswoman Morella, who represents Montgomery County, \nand Congressman Wolf, and we were joined by Congressman Bateman, who \nrepresents the Tidewater district of Virginia, all met this morning, as \nwe have been regularly meeting on this.\n  I wish to inform my distinguished colleague that Congressman Davis \nand the entire group this morning unanimously are going to do \neverything they can to oppose the House of Representatives going into \nrecess tonight, as contemplated for a period to extend perhaps until \nthe State of the Union Address around the 22d or 23d of January, while \nthese employees are out of work.\n  I shall on my own time--and perhaps these statements could be charged \nto time I will eventually seek--talk about the ripple effect here in \nnorthern Virginia. So I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada \nfor mentioning Congressman Davis. I said yesterday publicly he and \nother Republicans in the House of Representatives from this area indeed \ndeserve a great deal of personal credit for their courage in this \nsituation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is going to add 2 minutes to the \ntime of the Senator from Nevada because of the statement from the \nSenator from Virginia. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes. His \nfirst 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we should recognize that this should \nbe a bipartisan resolution of the problems we have facing this \nGovernment. I have not been a party to the talks with the President, \nthe two leaders from the House and the Senate. I hope they are \nprogressing, but they are very difficult. We know that.\n  There are 80 different issues that are issues dealing with public \npolicy that they have to work out. There has been an agreement on both \nsides that there should be a balanced budget, there should be a \nbalanced budget within 7 years. They will use CBO figures. That has \nbeen stated publicly. That is not a secret. But in the meantime, let \nthe Government go forward and go back to work, as it should.\n  I also say there are a few people--the House leadership is holding up \nthe ability to vote on a CR. What are they afraid of? They are afraid \nof the fact that if this comes up for a vote before the House of \nRepresentatives, it would pass. I understand that in the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday in a secret meeting that they had, a \nRepublican conference or caucus, 54 Republicans there voted to have \nthis brought to the floor. It would pass. Clearly it would pass.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  The Chair would state under the previous order morning business would \nnot extend beyond the hour of 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say that Mr. President, because I have been interrupted a \ncouple times.\n  Mr. President, the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       . . . budget analysts warned Wednesday that if the standoff \n     continues for even a few more days, the impact will spread to \n     larger and larger slices of the American economy and stopgap \n     solutions will be more difficult to achieve.\n       Several federal agencies reported that they have begun to \n     halt contracts with private companies that provide supplies \n     or services for federal programs. The White House Office of \n     Management and Budget said [that] no overall estimates are \n     available, [but they are strong].\n\n  It is the same in other newspapers.\n  The New York Times talks about the real problems that face this \nGovernment.\n  Mortgages. Work has halted on an estimated 200 million mortgages a \nday on mortgage loan processing for American people.\n  Veterans' Administration. That 170,000 veterans are not going to \nreceive their benefits.\n  Mr. President, I say that this has gotten out of hand. This is not \nfair to the Federal workers, but more importantly it is not fair to a \nwide segment of the American population. This has got to stop. It is \nfolly. I say, let those people come forward and allow an up-or-down \nvote in the House of Representatives. Speaker Gingrich should allow an \nup-or-down vote if he believes in the democratic process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join all those who wish the President \nand indeed the leadership of both the House and the Senate to get these \ntalks to reach a point where we can have a reconciliation of this \nproblem. We have finally, after some months, focused the country's \nattention on the need for a balanced budget. And that is the \ncenterpiece of this controversy. But I feel that this shutdown is \ntaking the public attention away from that important and historic \nlandmark achievement by the leadership of both the Senate and the \nHouse, and others; that is, bringing a final agreement on a balanced \nbudget within a 7-year period of time.\n  If the President would be forthcoming, if he would be forthcoming \nwith a balanced budget, with his own ideas as to how he can achieve it \nwithin that 7-year period of time with the CBO figures, I think these \nnegotiations could very quickly resolve such differences that remain \nand allow the current stalemate to be concluded.\n  Mr. President, earlier I spoke about the meeting on the House side \nthis \n\n[[Page S39]]\nmorning with Virginia Representatives Davis, Wolf, Bateman, \nCongresswoman Morella, who represents Montgomery County, MD, and \nmyself. We meet regularly throughout each day. But this morning we \nreported as a group first that in our own metropolitan area the SAIC \nCorp., private contractors, furloughed some 600 people. DynCorp, \nanother private contractor, has furloughed 700 people.\n  We had the transportation representatives in to see us this morning, \nprimarily the taxicab operators in northern Virginia. Their business is \nabsolutely devastated. Yesterday we met with those of the hotel \nindustry and the restaurant industry. Their business is being \ndevastated.\n  So the ripple effect, Mr. President, is impacting the greater \nmetropolitan area, and indeed in many other places throughout the \nUnited States. It is imperative that all of us bring to bear our best \njudgment to try and resolve this problem.\n  Mr. President, I wish to include in today's Record just samples of \nthe thousands of communications being forwarded to my office, both by \ntelephone and by letter. I am certain that this is taking place in \nother offices here in the Senate. As a matter of fact, Congressman \nBateman said he cannot even get through to his office in Tidewater, VA, \ntoday because of the volume of communications from his constituents.\n  But one letter dated December 12 of last year from a retired Navy \ncaptain, signed both by himself and his wife, simply says:\n\n       Our country is already in a sorry state due primarily to \n     congressional incompetence over the years, and these \n     situations only make matters worse. Perhaps one answer to the \n     ``stalemate'' problem might be to exclude the media from all \n     deliberations and eliminate press conferences.\n\n  This is sort of the typical reaction of an individual who has \ndedicated his life as a public servant here in the military to try and \nkeep our Nation strong but expressing his own views.\n  A second letter, December 29, 1995, from Mr. John Fulton of Vienna, \nVA, indicates he is a lifelong Republican, but he says:\n\n       There is no rational reason why the issue of ongoing day to \n     day operations of our government cannot be separated from the \n     larger, and critically important, budget deficit problems.\n\n  I certainly agree with these constituents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Virginia Beach, VA,\n\n                                                December 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John W.

While you are not \n     directly involved the respective parties leadership must stop \n     this nonsensical attempts to outwit the other side for \n     political gain. It is time for your colleagues to put aside \n     their egos and do the work Congress was elected to do, and \n     within the framework of the Constitution.\n       Our country is already in a sorry state due primarily to \n     congressional incompetence over the years, and these \n     situations only make matters worse. Perhaps one answer to the \n     ``stalemate'' problem might be to exclude the media from all \n     deliberations and eliminate press conferences. In any event, \n     you and your colleagues must get your act together, for the \n     good of our country.\n       Having said the above we, like most of your senior citizen \n     constituents, only ask that in your deliberations and voting \n     that we be treated equally and fairly.\n           Sincerely,\n     T.H.

Conaway\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Vienna, VA,\n\n                                                December 29, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to express my concern and \n     dismay over the way in which this congress is conducting the \n     work of the Nation.\n       As a lifelong Republican, I am embarrassed and appalled at \n     the recent actions taken by members of our party which have \n     resulted in a partial shutdown of government operations, \n     financial problems for thousands of federal employees and \n     private contractors, cost to the nation of millions of \n     dollars in federal funds wasted daily and gross inconvenience \n     to our citizens nationwide. The lack of mature leadership and \n     responsibility demonstrated by Republican members of both the \n     House and Senate in this situation is without historical \n     precedence in the 44 years that I have been privileged to be \n     a party member and vote!! It would appear that a significant \n     number of congressional members have forgotten a fundamental \n     principle of our Democracy--the ends don't justify the means! \n     If this behavior continues there will be no need for term \n     limits.\n       There is no rational reason why the issue of ongoing day to \n     day operations of our government cannot be separated from the \n     larger, and critically important, budget deficit problems. We \n     must separate these issues; get the government and related \n     businesses back to work and focus on the central issue before \n     the Nation--the re-prioritization of our national goals, \n     priorities, programs and commitments necessary to balance our \n     budget and relieve our children and grandchildren of the \n     horrendous 4 trillion dollar debt. If the congress and \n     administration are unable to resolve this issue before the \n     next election then let the voters decide who they want to \n     entrust the challenge to.\n       I am also greatly concerned about the proposed capital \n     gains tax cuts and child tax credits. If our party is serious \n     about deficit reduction and restoring our Nation's fiscal \n     health and credibility we should recruit all Americans to \n     share in the sacrifice--sustain the cuts, drop all tax cuts \n     and apply all the savings toward the $4,000,000,000,000 + \n     deficit! Any other course of action will be correctly viewed \n     by the American people as a sham, catering to wealthy-special \n     interest groups and we will (and should) pay at election \n     time. This is a year when those of us who have profited \n     greatly from stocks/bonds investments should be willing to \n     make a continued investment in the Nation which made those \n     earnings possible--through capital gains and other revenues. \n     When we get our nation out of debt we can cut taxes--and all \n     celebrate!\n       I appreciate your leadership and wish you and your staff a \n     blessed and prosperous New Year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Fulton.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico seek the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S38-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S39-S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LIVELIHOODS DISRUPTED\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to comment on two major items \ntoday. First--this is a somewhat new item. I believe it is a new \nexample of the abrogation of responsibility by the House Republican \nleadership. For 20 days we have been holding three-quarters of a \nmillion Federal civil servants hostage in this effort to exercise what \nSpeaker Gingrich calls his right not to pass spending bills.\n  He has referred to that many times in interviews. As a result, as the \nSenator from Virginia was just pointing out, many Americans--contract \nworkers, those planning to travel, those seeking export licenses, those \nseeking federally insured mortgages--have had their livelihoods \ndisrupted.\n  Now the leadership in the House has added the military personnel of \nthe country to the list of those whose livelihoods are being disrupted.\n  Yesterday, the House failed to override the President's veto of the \nDefense authorization bill. And when they did that, Congressman Dellums \nsought to bring up S. 1514, which is a bill that the Senate passed last \nSaturday to ensure that our troops get their full January pay raise, \nboth their basic pay and subsistence pay, which are to increase 2.4 \npercent, and their quarters pay, which is to increase 5.2 percent.\n  When the Senate passed the bill last Saturday, the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Stevens, made the statement: ``Mr. President, this bill should \nnot be controversial. The President asked that it be passed and has \nsaid that he will sign it as soon as he receives it.''\n  Congressman Dellums yesterday tried to bring it up in time so that \nthe Pentagon could ensure that troops receive their full pay in their \nfirst January paycheck. He was refused.\n  Mr. President, when we have troops in Bosnia and when our troops are \nproudly around the globe in other potential hot spots--South Korea, the \nMiddle East--the House Republicans should not be adding them to the \nlist of people who are being inconvenienced and whose livelihoods are \nbeing disrupted by inaction in Congress. This is yet another example of \nwhere Senate Republicans have acted responsibly in carrying out their \nduties under the Constitution; House Republicans have not. The Senate \nacted last Saturday on the Stevens-Thurmond bill as soon as the \nPresident vetoed the Defense authorization bill. I am sure many Senate \n\n[[Page S40]]\nRepublicans do not agree with the President's veto of that Defense \nauthorization bill, but they were not going to allow their differences \nwith the President on that larger issue to adversely affect our troops.\n  Mr. President, I can only hope that the House Republican leadership \nwill reverse course today. Their refusal to take up and to pass that \nmilitary pay bill yesterday was inexcusable. I hope they will do our \nmilitary personnel and all Americans a service by bringing it up and \npassing it today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S39-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECOND SESSION OF THIS CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak about one other issue that \nI am quite concerned about, and that is the implication of what is \ngoing on now for the work of this Congress in the second session and in \nfuture sessions. There has been a lot of talk about hostage-taking. \nThere was a very good editorial that has been referred to in the \nWashington Post yesterday about how the current shutdown is an example \nof hostage-taking. Yet, the editorial stated, I thought, very \neloquently:\n\n       Hostage-taking is an ugly business. It doesn't matter what \n     the cause. Innocent people are seized and used as pawns; they \n     become political trading stamps whose welfare is exchanged \n     for things the hostage-taker could not win by normal means.\n\n  Obviously, the most dramatic example of hostage-taking in recent \nhistory in this country was the hostage-taking in Iran in November \n1979. It could be debated whether the current Government shutdown rises \nto the level of a hostage-taking. Perhaps this is just a using of \npublic servants, Federal employees, as pawns in a larger political \ngame, and I will leave to others the debate about whether this is, in \nfact, a hostage-taking.\n  But, Mr. President, in my view, when each of us took our oath of \noffice, and that oath included the duty to protect and defend the \nConstitution, implied in that was the responsibility to maintain a \nfunctioning Government. Now, that is not written into the Constitution, \nbut I think it is clearly implied that those of us who seek public \noffice will take on that responsibility.\n  We can argue about what the Government ought to do, we can argue \nabout how large the Government ought to be, we can argue about how many \nemployees ought to be hired by the Federal Government, but the basic \nresponsibility to maintain a functioning Government is something about \nwhich I think is very difficult for us to argue.\n  The Republican leadership in the House has taken a different view. \nThey are saying that as to the parts of the Government which today \nremain closed, they do not share that responsibility to maintain those \nparts of the Government functioning. They believe that is the \nPresident's problem, it is not their problem.\n  Those who wrote our Constitution established a system of government \nwhere power is shared, but also a system of government where \nresponsibility is shared, and part of that responsibility that is \nshared is the responsibility to maintain a functioning Government.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Maryland \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \ngiven our constitutional arrangements of separation of powers and \nchecks and balances, if both branches do not act responsibly, how can \nwe meet our responsibilities under the Constitution?\n  We have a situation here, as I perceive it, in which a coercive \ntactic is being employed which I understand has never been used \npreviously in our Nation's history. That is, a certain group, in order \nto get its way on a substantive issue, is prepared to use as a tactic \nthe closing down of the Government with all of the harm that inflicts, \nnot only on the Federal employees but throughout the private sector.\n  This is a classic example of using any means to get to your end, even \nthough the means that are being used here result in a breakdown of our \nconstitutional system of democratic government. What is the Senator's \nperception with respect to that?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the question very much, and \nI agree entirely with what the Senator from Maryland is saying. I \nbelieve it is a breakdown of our system. I believe the Founding Fathers \nwho set up our system of government intended that all of us in \nGovernment, whether in the legislative branch or in the executive \nbranch, would work together to try to maintain a functioning Government \nand to resolve disputes. That is not happening now.\n  I was particularly bothered by an article on December 2 in the \nWashington Post where it talked about the impasse that was existing, \nand it referred to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse, Mr. Livingston. It said:\n\n       Livingston and other Republicans yesterday boasted that \n     after weeks of standoff over spending issues, the momentum \n     had shifted in the Republicans' direction when the President \n     accepted the defense spending bill. ``I think that once the \n     defense bill was off the table, the administration lost the \n     leverage it really had planned on using,'' Livingston said. \n     He added that most of the remaining spending bills include \n     programs that ``are a greater concern to the President'' than \n     to many other Members of Congress.\n\n  To me, that does not bode well for the rest of our deliberations in \nthe second session of the Congress. If the President needed to keep the \nDefense appropriations bill on the table in order to be able to bargain \nwith the House, then the obvious message is that he would keep it on \nthe table in a new session. I cannot conceive of the President this \nfall, for example, when we send him appropriations bills, I cannot \nconceive of him signing a legislative appropriations bill before all of \nthe executive branch appropriations bills have been completed. It would \nnot make any sense, if this is the new context in which we operate.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Representative Boehlert stated in mid-November, and I \nquote him: ``You have a group in our conference who could not care less \nif the Government shuts down. They will be cheering.''\n  I submit, shutting the Government down is a default in carrying out \nyour responsibilities as an elected Member of the legislative branch. \nYou have to separate out the matter of carrying forward the normal \nfunctions of Government, on which millions of people across the country \ndepend, from disputes you may be having over particular issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Brett, as Senators know, is the quarterback of the \nGreen Bay Packers.\n  When I introduced the resolution, I did so on my behalf and Trent \nLott, as a cosponsor. I learned, after adopting the resolution, that \nthe two distinguished Senators from Wisconsin wanted their names to be \nadded as cosponsors of the resolution. I looked at the Record and it \ndoes reflect that later in the Record. I wanted to make a point of \nsaying that I had not received that information at the time the \nresolution was submitted and passed by the Senate.\n  I was going to ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senators \nHerb Kohl and Russ Feingold be added as cosponsors, but that is \nreflected in the Record. So I am pleased that they joined us in the \nresolution commending and congratulating Brett Favre for the great \nhonor that he received.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S40-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S40-S41]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BRETT FAVRE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators \n\n[[Page S41]]\nRuss Feingold, Thad Cochran, and Trent Lott, to congratulate Green Bay \nPackers' quarterback, and Kiln, MS, native Brett Favre for winning the \n1995 National Football League Most Valuable Player Award.\n  After leading the Green Bay Packers to their first National Football \nConference [NFC] Central Division title since 1972, Brett Favre ran \naway with the National Football League Most Valuable Player voting, \ncapturing 69 votes from a nationwide panel of 88 sports writers and \nbroadcasters. Favre's numbers speak for themselves, as he threw an NFC \nrecord 38 touchdown passes for over 4,400 yards passing. This would be \nconsidered an amazing accomplishment for any quarterback; however, \ncouple it with nagging injuries over a 17-week season, and you've \ndescribed the iron-willed ``Leader of the Pack,'' Brett Favre.\n  Brett Favre has emerged as a true star in the National Football \nLeague. His Most Valuable Player Award is the first for any Green Bay \nPacker since 1966, when then Packer quarterback and MVP Bart Starr led \nthe Green and Gold to its first of two Super Bowl championships. The \nPackers and all their loyal fans hope history repeats itself this year.\n  On behalf of Wisconsinites and Green Bay Packers' fans everywhere, I \ncongratulate you, Brett Favre, on your MVP season and a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S40-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S41]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET IMPASSE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is becoming more obvious every day \nthat the White House is not prepared to reach an agreement with the \nCongress to balance the budget. We have not seen any specific proposal \nfrom the administration to make any changes that would, in fact, lead \nto a balanced budget. They are unnecessarily shutting down Government \nservices and programs and furloughing Government workers.\n  The Congress must now act to identify the activities that should be \nfunded and pass legislation that puts people who are really needed back \nto work. There has been too much political grandstanding. It is time \nfor that to end.\n  We should not give up our goal of getting spending under control and \nbalancing the budget. That probably means electing a new President \nlater this year who will cooperate with the Congress in this effort. In \nthe meantime, I am prepared, and I know other Senators are prepared to \nwork with the Republican majority and with like-minded Democrats to get \nthe Government back in business with reductions in those programs that \nshould be cut back, and to resolve this impasse.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I posed a question to the Senator from \nNew Mexico and his time then expired. I ask unanimous consent to yield \nto him at this moment to respond to that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maryland. \nI will be brief. I did want to conclude my answer to his question.\n  I think what we have is a very troublesome development in the way \nthat the Congress and the President are interacting. It seems that the \nCongress is going to take the view that it only has a responsibility to \nenact a Defense bill, that other bills can go their own way--and, of \ncourse, its own appropriation, the legislative appropriation bill--and \nit is up to the President to try to get the others enacted. If that is \nthe case, then you have essentially a hostage-taking or a standoff, \nwhich I think is very destructive of the system of Government as it was \nintended.\n\n  This hostage-taking can be a two-way street. Hostage-taking begets \nmore hostage-taking. As I indicated before, the President would be ill-\nadvised, in my opinion, if these are going to be the ground rules for \nthe interaction with the Congress, to sign a legislative appropriations \nbill in this new session of Congress until all appropriations bills for \nthe executive branch have been signed and put into law.\n  I am also greatly concerned that we are not going to be able to get \ngood cooperation between the Legislature and the President on doing a \nDefense appropriation bill. If, as Congressman Livingston points out, \nonce the President signs the Defense appropriations bill, the Congress \nis then absolved from the responsibility to work with the President on \ngetting the other appropriations bills signed, that, to me, is a very \ntroublesome situation, which I take as a great problem for all of us.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to respond, and I hope that a \nreasonable resolution of these problems can be found. I thank the \nSenator from Maryland for the time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I briefly want to add to the comments of \nthe Senator from New Mexico on this particular matter. To make our \nconstitutional system work requires, I believe, a certain amount of \nrestraint and good judgment on the part of all decisionmakers. It must \nbe an essential premise of our system that one is not willing to \nsubvert everything, in effect to bring the whole building crashing \ndown, in order to get your way. I never understood democracy to work \nthat way. There has to be a certain amount of accommodation. Obviously, \nthe basic functions of Government should continue. Are we to reach a \nstate of affairs where every time there is a sharp policy difference--\nand people can obviously hold sharply different opinions--that for one \nside to gain its way, it brings the Government to a halt and inflicts \nall of this harm that is being felt across the country?\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post story giving examples \nof such harm be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The headline is: ``Day 19: Federal Siege Takes Public, \nPrivate Hostages.''\n  It says:\n\n       The partial shutdown of the federal government dragged \n     through its 19th straight day yesterday with one clear \n     effect. It took even more hostages.\n       Health officials in Nebraska, facing a widespread flu \n     outbreak, urged Federal officials to reopen the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention to help them assess and \n     contain the problem. The federal Meals on Wheels Program, \n     which delivers hot food daily to more than 600,000 needy \n     senior citizens, is running out of money and may be partially \n     closed by week's end. The Peace Corps, also desperately short \n     of cash, began drawing up plans to recall some or all of its \n     7,200 members worldwide if the shutdown persists much longer.\n       In Mariposa County, CA, home to Yosemite National Park, \n     which has been closed throughout one of its busiest times of \n     the year, the number of private-sector layoffs climbed past \n     1,600. Most are hotel, restaurant and gas station workers who \n     usually can depend on the revenue that they collect during \n     the holiday season to carry them until the summer.\n       One-fourth of the adults in the county are now out of work, \n     and officials there have declared an economic emergency.\n\n  This is no way to do business, obviously. There is no reason to it. \nIt does not make common sense. There is a tremendous ripple effect \nthroughout the private sector of people dependent on Federal contracts \nand Federal activities. Needlessly and harmfully the shutdown is \nresulting in laying off people in the private as well as the public \nsector.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia, in his comments earlier, \nmade reference to one such occurrence about which he had received \nnotice only this morning. Currently half a million Federal workers are \ncoming to work and not getting a paycheck. Another quarter of a million \nhave been furloughed and are not getting paychecks. Workers in the \nprivate sector now are not going to get paychecks. How is it \nanticipated that people will be able to handle this situation?\n\n  The Federal workers are told that once they go back, they will be \npaid. But who can bridge the intervening period? Unfortunately, there \nmay be a lack of sensitivity in the Congress because, many Members have \nsignificant economic means and, therefore, the loss of a paycheck--\nwhich is not happening for them--does not really place a burden upon \nthem. They can handle that situation. But most people are not so well \nsituated. Whether they work for the Federal Government or whether they \nare in the private sector, they \n\n[[Page S42]]\nneed a regular paycheck in order to meet their obligations, such as \nmortgage payments, car payments, and school payments.\n  Nearly half of the Federal employees--46 percent--make less than \n$35,000 a year. Three quarters of all Federal employees make less than \n$50,000 a year. Less than 1 percent--six-tenths of 1 percent of all \nFederal employees--make over $100,000 a year. Members of Congress make \nmore than that. Close to 100 percent of all Federal employees make less \nthan Members of Congress. Now, these employees cannot move from period \nto period without a paycheck. We need to put them back to work.\n\n  The New York Times had an editorial this morning, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the editorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The editorial stated:\n\n       The turmoil and uncertainty created by vast numbers of \n     Federal workers not going to work or not being paid is \n     poisoning the atmosphere for progress on the budget. Too much \n     hardship has already been inflicted, not only on the 760,000 \n     unpaid workers, but on millions of Americans who cannot get \n     visas, loans, or any number of other Federal services. \n     Congress and the President should reopen the government now.\n\n  I absolutely agree with that sentiment. There is a colleague in the \nHouse, in the Republican leadership in the House, who said in mid-\nNovember, ``You have a group in our conference who could not care less \nif the Government shuts down. They will be cheering.'' What an \nabdication of responsibility.\n  Do Members of Congress, as my distinguished colleague from New Mexico \nstates, think they have no responsibility for ensuring that the \nGovernment continues to function and providing the basic services upon \nwhich so many of our people are dependent?\n  The people in the private sector, some will go bankrupt out of this \nescapade. They will go bankrupt. I have had people call my office who \nsay, ``We are not going to be able to make it. We set up a small \nprivate business and things were working fairly well and now we are \nconfronting a situation where we may well go under.'' For 19 days now \nwe have been through this situation after the previous closedown of 6 \ndays, all in order to try to bring a coercive pressure, a scorched \nearth bargaining tactic, with respect to the larger issue of the 7-year \nbudget projection.\n  Now, that issue involves many difficult and complex questions and a \nstrong difference over what the priorities should be. But in my \njudgment, it is an irresponsible and impermissible tactic to use the \nclosing of the Government, which has never been done before, to use the \nclosing of the Government as a coercive pressure in to achieve a \ncertain result with respect to the larger budget issues.\n  Are we going to descend, deteriorate into such practices in the \nCongress, thereby falling short of meeting the responsibilities I think \nwe have under the Constitution? Mr. President, Congress and the \nPresident should reopen the Government now as the majority leader \nsought to do when he moved the continuing resolution and sent it over \nto the House. House adoption of it would bring this crisis to an end.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n          Day 19: Federal Siege Takes Public, Private Hostages\n\n                           (By Rene Sanchez)\n\n       The partial shutdown of the federal government dragged \n     through its 19th straight day yesterday with one clear \n     effect. It took even more hostages.\n       Health officials in Nebraska, facing a widespread flu \n     outbreak, urged federal officials to reopen the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention to help them assess and \n     contain the problem. The federal Meals on Wheels Program, \n     which delivers hot food daily to more than 600,000 needy \n     senior citizens, is running out of money and may be partially \n     closed by week's end. The Peace Corps, also desperately short \n     of cash, began drawing up plans to recall some or all of its \n     7,200 members worldwide if the shutdown persists much longer.\n       In Mariposa County, Calif., home to Yosemite National Park, \n     which has been closed throughout one of its busiest times of \n     the year, the number of private-sector layoffs climbed past \n     1,600. Most are hotel, restaurant and gas station workers who \n     usually can depend on the revenue that they collect during \n     the holiday season to carry them until the summer.\n       One-fourth of the adults in the county are now out of work, \n     and officials there have declared an economic emergency. The \n     local newspaper has launched a food drive for those in need, \n     and radio stations in the Yosemite area are urging residents \n     in neighboring counties to drive over and do business there.\n       ``Who's paying the price for this? Not Congress or the \n     president, but the average citizen,'' said Michael Coffield, \n     the Mariposa County administrator. ``All the money our \n     residents are losing is gone for good. Every day, it is \n     getting more and more dire.''\n       Ever since the shutdown began, President Clinton and \n     congressional Democrats have insisted that it would pose \n     significant hardships, and Clinton made his most strident \n     remarks yet on that subject yesterday by ticking off a \n     lengthy list of problems he said the government's partial \n     closure is causing Americans.\n       But some Republican leaders have countered by saying the \n     shutdown shows how large parts of the government do not \n     affect many Americans. Other Republicans contend that short-\n     term problems from the shutdown are far less important than \n     the long-term crisis an unbalanced budget will create.\n       Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said that his department \n     has received more than 63,000 phone calls regarding working \n     and wage complaints that it has not been able to answer in \n     the past three weeks.\n       Federal courts have remained open throughout the shutdown \n     by running on filing fees and other miscellaneous funds. But \n     court officials are now predicting that they will exhaust \n     those emergency funds by Sunday. David A. Sellers, spokesman \n     for the federal courts' administrative office, said at that \n     point it would be up to individual courts around the country \n     to decide whether to close or to keep some of their business \n     going.\n       The Peace Corps also has stayed partially open during the \n     shutdown by using leftover funds from the last fiscal year. \n     That pool of money is now drying up. Officials said that if \n     the shutdown persists another week or so they may be forced \n     to recall volunteers who work in 95 countries, because the \n     agency will not be able to pay their living allowances.\n       ``We're having to take a very serious look at that as this \n     goes on,'' said Andre Oliver, a Peace Corps spokesman.\n       The furlough also has begun to threaten the complicated \n     process by which scientists, universities and other research \n     organizations apply to the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) for money to finance experiments and other scientific \n     studies.\n       January is the beginning of a thrice-yearly cycle in which \n     grant applications are reviewed by committees of outside \n     experts, and then recommendations on whether to fund them is \n     passed on to NIH officials. None of the preparation for that \n     is occurring.\n       NIH also has about 2,000 grants that have been approved but \n     whose financing hasn't been provided to the researchers in \n     the last month. About half are multi-year projects already \n     underway, and about half are for new research waiting to \n     begin.\n       ``We're all sort of teetering on the edge now,'' said Wendy \n     Baldwin, NIH's deputy director for extramural research. \n     ``There's a whole cascade of scheduling in jeopardy.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n                            The Budget Scrum\n\n       For fans of political games, President Clinton put on a \n     rip-roaring show yesterday, as he charged right through the \n     budget rift that has opened up on the Republican side between \n     Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. The new year thus dawns with the \n     surprising spectacle of two archrivals, Mr. Dole and Mr. \n     Clinton, trying to look like grown-ups while the Republicans \n     in the House insist childshly that the only way to apply \n     leverage on the President is to keep the Government closed. \n     More and more it looks as if the zealous freshmen are calling \n     the shots in the House.\n       Say this for the freshmen Republicans. In theory they are \n     just the kind of people the public says it wants in \n     politics--men and women of principle who have a lot more on \n     their minds than re-election. But zeal needs to be harnessed \n     to a caring practicality. In the current impasse, Mr. Clinton \n     and Mr. Dole have it right. The turmoil and uncertainty \n     created by vast numbers of Federal workers not going to work \n     or not being paid is poisoning the atmosphere for progress on \n     the budget. Too much hardship has already been inflicted, not \n     only on the 760,000 unpaid workers, but on millions of \n     Americans who cannot get visas, loans or any number of other \n     Federal services. Congress and the President should reopen \n     the Government now.\n       But it is also time for the White House to help resolve the \n     budget impasse by sketching more details of the President's \n     own thinking on how to achieve a balanced budget in seven \n     years, as House Republicans demand. Mr. Clinton's skill in \n     gaining political advantage from the current situation has \n     been impressive. But his tactics leave even his allies \n     confused on how much he really does want a compromise \n     balanced budget, as opposed to an impasse on which he can run \n     for re-election while defending longstanding Democratic \n     principles.\n       By all accounts, the long hours of negotiating over the \n     holiday weekend involved a lot of Mr. Clinton and Mr. \n     Gingrich discussing the arcana of Federal social policies \n     while many other people in the room rolled \n\n[[Page S43]]\n     their eyes. There is no sign yet of real horse-trading except a leak \n     here and there. For instance, the White House might be \n     willing to modify its opposition to a cut in the capital \n     gains tax. The Republicans seem willing to scale back their \n     $240 billion tax cut. But the House freshmen and their allies \n     insist that they simply do not trust Mr. Clinton to bring the \n     process to a conclusion until they get a clearer signal of \n     where he would be willing to make concessions, particularly \n     on Medicare, Medicaid and welfare.\n       The freshmen militants, Mr. Gingrich and even the \n     Democratic leadership have the luxury of being dealt into a \n     game whose outcome means less to them than to Mr. Clinton and \n     Mr. Dole. With their eyes on the Presidential race, each man \n     is trying to calculate whether he has more to gain from \n     accommodation or recalcitrance. Mr. Dole has promised to \n     bring adult leadership to the White House, but he does not \n     look very adult if he cannot stand up to his party's kiddie-\n     corps zealots. Mr. Clinton needs to emerge as a President who \n     can stay resolute in the face of opposition; but at a certain \n     point the Chief Executive of a Government that cannot open \n     for business will begin to look weak.\n       Mr. Dole is right when he observes that Americans are \n     growing impatient with the budget impasse. Right now, Mr. \n     Clinton may have more to gain by holding out on the budget \n     while insisting he wants to reopen the Government. But there \n     is clearly a deal within reach, and the public will remember \n     who walks out of the wreckage with it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S41-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, all my life I have heard the saying, ``Can't \nsee the forest for the trees.'' I think those words can be \nappropriately applied to the situation we now find ourselves in. For \ntoo many Federal workers, for too many thousands of honest, hard-\nworking Americans trying to make a decent living, this budget impasse \nand shutdown has demonstrated to them that some of their elected \nrepresentatives cannot see the forest for the trees.\n  While some are wrapped up in trying to score political points, to \ngain political favor in certain circles, they are missing the point of \nwhat is really going on outside the beltway. How disappointing it is to \npick up the morning's Washington Post with the headlines, ``Employees \nFind They Are an Afterthought.'' How sad it is to know that people who \nneed food, who need medicine and basic care will be deprived of \nservices. How sad it is, Mr. President, to hear some demagog the \nsituation by saying that nobody is missing those Government workers and \nwe need to get rid of more of them.\n  My office, as others have stated here this morning, is being overrun \nwith calls and letters about how this shutdown is affecting families in \nKentucky, far outside the beltway, far away from the political arena. A \nmother in Lexington, KY, wrote me, ``Most of us live from paycheck to \npaycheck. We cannot survive without being paid. I am a single parent \nstruggling to pay rent, a car payment, and keep food in the house, so I \nhaven't been able to save part of my salary. If I'm not paid on January \n16, I will be evicted.'' This is a woman that was on welfare, that was \nable to get a job and get off of welfare, and now the Government is \nforcing her back into welfare. She asks in her letter, ``Isn't this the \nUnited States of America? Isn't our Government supposed to be by the \npeople and for the people?'' ``Federal employees,'' she says, ``are \nalso people.''\n\n  She is speaking from her heart about real people, about the thousands \nwho cannot get mortgage insurance, thousands who are losing home loans, \nthousands working in service industries, the rippling effect, facing \nthe daily threat of being laid off. Homeowners in eastern Kentucky \nthreatened with landslides because the Office of Surface Mining is \noperating on reduced staff and reduced funding. Real people, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Another person wrote, ``I'm excepted from furlough which means I'm \nworking now with no pay. The check I received yesterday was one-quarter \nof my salary. My mortgage is due. This one-quarter does not cover the \nmortgage. What is worse is that I have two small children. I must \ncontinue to pay my baby sitter to keep them after school while I go to \nwork for no pay.''\n  I received a call from a grandmother. I do not know how many in here \nhave ever been involved in trying to help a couple adopt a child. When \nI was Governor of Kentucky we worked with agencies. It is an emotional \nperiod. It is a real decision to adopt a child. So I got a call from \nthis grandmother. She was worried about her granddaughter. The adoption \nof a baby has been halted because the agencies do not have enough money \nto process the necessary paperwork. That is hurt, Mr. President. That \nis not inconvenience, that is hurt. You have hurt that family that made \nup their mind to adopt a child. That is hurt, capital H-u-r-t. She is \nlooking to her representatives for help and answers. What do we do to \nhelp her? How do you tell someone that is out there working hard, \npaying their taxes, that because of circumstances completely out of \ntheir control they cannot go forward with adopting a child?\n  Mr. President, the hardest thing I have had to do in my 21 years in \nthe U.S. Senate is to say to men and women in the military to go defend \nour country on some foreign shore, to lay their lives on the line. One \nthing I have told them, and one thing that helps, that whatever I can \ndo to support them when they come back, or their loved ones if they do \nnot come back, I will do.\n  Looking now at the VA, ``VA Runs on Promises.'' ``Nursing home \nworkers tend patients without pay. They are stripping the sheets off, \nthe laundry, trying to take care of our veterans, for no pay.''\n  So we say to our veterans, the only reason you are being taken care \nof is because they are willing to come as long as they can. These \npeople cannot get another job. They are prohibited from getting another \njob to have some income, maybe, to offset the loss of their paycheck.\n  Let me also tell you about ``Helen's Hotline'' from the VA hospital \nin Lexington. What are they doing? Food--God's Pantry, in Lexington, \ndistributes food to the homeless and those who need food. They will \nprovide up to 3 weeks of food to those people. They are even giving \nthem transportation to God's Pantry in order to pick up some food. Food \nand social and spiritual support are being offered by the VA hospital \nthere in Lexington, stress relief, and the canteen service will \naccept--think about this, now--accept postdated checks from the \ncafeteria or retail store through January 17.\n  Creditors' letters have been sent from the Directoegins its \ncentennial celebration having been admitted to the Union of States in \n1896.\n  This 100-year mark is very significant considering the long struggle \nfor the citizens of the Utah Territory to gain statehood in the late \n19th century. The people of the Utah Territory tried unsuccessfully for \nadmission to the Union six times--1849, 1856, 1862, 1872, 1882, and \n1887--before being admitted in 1896.\n  Today, Utah is one of the fastest growing States in the country. \nBusiness is thriving as more and more companies establish roots in the \nState. The banking and financial industry have a long history of \nsuccess in Utah. Manufacturing industry continues to grow and succeed. \nUtah's software industry is growing so rapidly that it has now \nsurpassed that of Silicon Valley. Utah provides many opportunities for \nthe families that reside in the State. With six 4-year, degree-granting \nuniversities and colleges, including four State institutme. ``Is this \nreally America? Is this what America is all about? Is this how the \nworld's greatest superpower functions?\"\n  These people want a resolution to the crisis. They want to reopen \nGovernment just like the distinguished majority leader, Senate \nRepublicans, and Senate Democrats want. As one said, it is time to stop \nthe nonsense going on here in Washington. They agree with our majority \nleader when he says, ``Enough is enough.''\n  Let us reopen Government. Let us stop this insanity and get on with \nthe shaping of a fair and equitable budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe \n\n[[Page S44]]\nfull text of two letters I referred to in my statement earlier.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 3, 1996.\n       Dear Elected Representative: I'm writing to speak out for \n     furloughed federal employees and working federal employees \n     who are not being paid. I happen to be one of those directed \n     to work without pay. Since I came to work for the federal \n     government in 1977 federal employees have taken the brunt of \n     budget cuts and have been reviled by Presidents and Congress. \n     Our salaries have fallen far behind the private sector. It is \n     proposed that our pensions be further cut and even those of \n     us who had careers covered under Social Security before \n     coming to the government have had our future Social Security \n     benefits cut in half. However, this budget battle is the \n     final outrage against federal employees. What private company \n     could order their employees to work, but not pay them? \n     Ironically, the federal government would be on their doorstep \n     immediately. I can't even file for unemployment benefits \n     since I have been directed to work, and am doing so without \n     pay.\n       Most of us live from paycheck to paycheck. We cannot \n     survive without being paid. I am a single parent, struggling \n     to pay rent, a car payment and keep food in the house so I \n     haven't been able to save part of my salary.\n       If I am not paid on January 16, 1996, I will be evicted. My \n     landlord isn't interested in the reason he doesn't receive \n     his rent. He just demands it be paid on the 1st day of each \n     month. I will also lose my car if this continues and my \n     credit will be ruined. It may be already.\n       We were given a letter to send to our creditors asking for \n     forbearance. Do you really believe that the banks, insurance \n     companies and Corporate America care why our bills are not \n     being paid. NO--THEY DO NOT!\n       Isn't this the United States of America? Isn't our \n     government supposed to be by the people and for the people? \n     Federal employees are also people. We pay taxes. We vote. We \n     are part of the people referred to in the Bill of Rights and \n     the Constitution. I would have never believed this could \n     happen in this country. We are being deprived of our basic \n     human rights because we happen to be federal employees. My \n     mind almost refuses to accept that this is happening to me, \n     but the realities of unpaid bills and basic needs not being \n     met jerk me back into the real world that I must live in--\n     unknown to you!\n       I have related my personal situation to you but please \n     remember that it is also representative of the situation of \n     about 700,000 citizens of this country who have given daily \n     of themselves to serve this country.\n       I am frustrated, fearful, resentful and very angry over the \n     situation I have been placed in by you. Regardless of your \n     political allegiance or your personal position on the \n     national budget issues, you have severely and wrongfully \n     damaged my life forever. The harm done to this point is \n     irreversible and the damage irreparable. Please wake up and \n     stop this nightmare.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------ ------.\n\n                                 ______\n\n                                                  January 3, 1996.\n       Dear Congressman, I am an employee of Social Security. As \n     you may be aware, as a field office employee, I am excepted \n     from furlough which means I am working now with no pay. The \n     check I received yesterday was for \\1/2\\ salary (through 12/\n     15/95). My mortgage is due and this \\1/2\\ does not cover the \n     mortgage. What is worse is that I have 2 small children. I \n     must continue to pay a baby sitter to keep them after school \n     while I go to work with no pay.\n       The end result is that we do not have money for anything \n     except utilities. My children wanted to know this morning why \n     they had left over Christmas turkey and dressing in their \n     lunch boxes instead of their usual chips and sandwiches. It \n     is because these, the chips and sandwich are now ``non-\n     essential'' items in our household and because you all can \n     not see fit to work the budget out--they must suffer. If you \n     have a better explanation that I can give a 5 yr. old and 8 \n     year old--please let me know. This is beginning to HURT! My \n     children do not understand and neither do I. Please work this \n     out--Soon!! Before I have to explain to them why we have no \n     heat--\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------ ------.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we hear a lot about ``all the President has \nto do is sign the bills.'' If you put things in the bills that are not \nacceptable, then you ought not to expect it to be signed. That is \ntrying to put the President in a position where he cannot sign it. All \nwe have to do is pass a clean CR and put Government back to work.\n  The Senate has done that. The Democrats in the House are ready. There \nis only one group, one element that is saying to my people down there: \n``We do not care whether you pay the mortgage, whether you pay your \nutilities, whether you buy food''--things of that nature. We think we \nought to get with those people and say to them, let us get on with the \nrunning of the Government. We can balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S43-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S44-S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is with interest I listened to some of \nour colleagues talk about the Government shutting down, and I also note \nyesterday, when the President had a press conference, he said the \ncongressional Republicans shut down the Government. At least he said \nCongress shut down Government. He mentioned several examples.\n  Several of the examples that have been mentioned, both on the floor \nand by the President and by other people, some of the horror stories of \nindividuals who have lost their jobs, who are not being paid, are in \nagencies for which the President vetoed the appropriation bill. One \nagency that has received as much attention as any other is Interior, \nthe appropriation bill that is covered by Interior, dealing with \nnational parks and the museums.\n  The Washington Post has run some front-page articles talking about \nthe museums not being open, the Smithsonian shut down, national parks \nbeing shut down, not having access for individuals wanting to have \ntheir vacations and go to the parks, not being able to get in because \nthe Government shut it down and, as the President said, Congress shut \nit down.\n  I just happen to be aware of the fact the President vetoed the \nInterior bill. The President is the one who shut down the parks. The \nPresident is the one who did not make it possible for the parks to be \nopened. If he had signed the bill, those people would have been paid. \nThey would not have been furloughed. The parks would be open. The \nSmithsonian would be open. Those people would have had coverage. There \nwould be no disruption.\n  I just make that point. It is interesting that everything is \nCongress' fault. The President vetoed the Interior bill. I think that \nis unfortunate.\n  I used to manage that bill. Now Senator Gorton is managing that bill, \nand I think he has done a very good job. I looked at the veto message \ndealing with Interior. There are different reasons why the President \nvetoed the bill. These are very poor excuses for vetoing a bill. I have \nurged others, and I hope maybe, I will tell my friends and colleagues, \nmaybe within a very short period of time we will have another Interior \nbill on the floor. I hope that is the case. I hope it happens today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the House of \nRepresentatives is going to take up a veto override today on that. I \nwas over there earlier this morning.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. The veto override may not happen. I \nhope it does. That is one way we could get the employees back to work \nimmediately.\n  If that does not happen, I hope we will take the original Interior \nbill as it passed through both Houses and maybe make some changes. I am \nlooking at the President's veto message on Interior. Most of these \nchanges could be made with very little dollars involved and maybe some \nbetter understanding.\n  We had the Presiding Officer, a moment ago, who is from Alaska--part \nof it was dealing with Tongass. There is a misunderstanding on what \nwould happen in the Tongass. Some people were saying the Interior bill \nas passed would open up a lot of additional clear cutting. I do not \nthink that is the case. We can clarify that, and we should clarify it.\n  I am looking through some of the other things that were mentioned. I \nask unanimous consent to have the President's veto message printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. But these are minuscule problems. This is no reason to \nshut down the Interior Department, national parks, Forest Service and \nso on, and everything else that is covered by this bill, Indian Health \nServices--you name it.\n  So, let us try to accommodate. Let us make a couple of concessions. \nLet us work to resolve some of the problems that are raised in here. It \ncan be done with very few dollars and open up the Interior Department, \nopen up the national parks, open up the Smithsonian, open up the \nnational museums. There is no reason not to. The President should not \nhave vetoed the bill in the \n\n[[Page S45]]\nfirst place, but the President is responsible for those parks being \nclosed.\n  Yesterday, or the day before, there was an article in the Post \ntalking about somebody having a concession service adjacent to a park \nand now they had to let their employees go. Those employees, \nincidentally, will not be covered by the bill once it passes. They will \nnot be paid. They are not Federal employees; they are contractors. And \nif they are not contracting with the Federal Government, if they just \nhappen to be doing business adjacent to the Federal Government \noperation, they are out of luck.\n  Again, I fault President Clinton in this case. I think he made a \nmistake in vetoing the bill. But for him to say Congress is the reason \nwhy those agencies are shut down is not the case, and that is not the \ncase in Interior.\n  It is not the case in other agencies as well. A lot of us are very \nconcerned about the Veterans' Department being closed. I agree with my \ncolleagues from Maryland and other places saying if you have a \nphysician or if you have a nurse or if you have somebody working in a \nveterans hospital, that person ought to be paid. It does not make a lot \nof sense not to pay them.\n  Why are they not being paid? The appropriation bill was not signed. \nWe passed the appropriation bill, we funded the Veterans' Department, \nthe President vetoed the bill.\n  Why did he veto the bill? I have a copy of his veto message. I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. But we should take care of veterans and people who are \nworking in veterans hospitals. They should be paid. They should not be \nfurloughed. And we can solve that problem. I am hopeful before very \nlong we will pass the VA-HUD bill, and let us look at the President's \nveto message and see if some accommodations can and could and should be \nmade in that area.\n  But let no one misunderstand. The President vetoed the bill that \nfunds the Veterans' Department. It was on his desk. If he would have \nsigned that bill, those individuals would not have been furloughed. \nThey would not have been working without pay. So we need to get past \nthis maybe rhetorical war and who is at fault. The President vetoed \nseveral of these bills.\n  One of the other things that maybe concerns me where Congress is \nlargely at fault is dealing with the agency called Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education--actually three different agencies. We \nhave heard some people talk about how some people are impacted. This \nSenate has not passed that appropriations bill. It is the only \nappropriations bill we have not passed. You might say, ``Why hasn't \nit?'' We are supposed to pass that bill before the end of September. We \nhave not passed it.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a filibuster on even a motion to \nproceed to that bill. I have been around here a long time. I cannot \nremember an appropriations bill where Members filibustered the motion \nto proceed. We usually have fought out our differences--win, lose, or \ndraw--on all appropriations bills. Somebody said it has riders on it. \nAll appropriations have riders on how are we going to spend money. This \nbill is no different than any other bill. It had some riders. It says \nthe administration will not spend money on a variety of different \nthings. That is part of Congress' legislative responsibility. But we \nhave not even been able to vote on the Labor-HHS bill. That is \nunfortunate.\n  I hear today and read in the paper about scare tactics--that it is \nterrible; we are not able to take care of the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics or Meals on Wheels. It is because, unfortunately, many \nDemocrats will not allow us to bring that bill up and vote on it. I \nhope maybe we can get that resolved because that bill needs to pass. We \nneed to vote. We need to find out where the votes are. Some people are \nobjecting to us even considering the bill.\n  Looking at several of the bills the President has vetoed, Interior, \nwhich I alluded to before. If you add Interior, 76,000 employees are \nimpacted. The Forest Service is funded at 38,000 under that bill. \nIndian Health is at 15,000, for a total of 133,800 employees who are \nimpacted because the President vetoed the Interior bill. That was not \nCongress' veto. It was the President's veto.\n  Again, I reiterate my statement about my offer to work with people. I \nthink we ought to make some changes--minor changes--and pass the \nInterior bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I welcome this attitude that we need to try to work out \nthe differences. That is how I think you legislate.\n  The fact is, though, that when President Reagan and President Bush \nvetoed appropriations bills, until we worked out the differences we \npassed the continuing resolutions to allow the Government to continue \nto function. We then considered seriously the basis upon which the \nPresident had vetoed the legislation and tried to work out an \naccommodation so that an appropriations bill could be passed by the \nCongress to which the President could give his consent.\n  So the veto by the President of legislation because it contains \nprovisions with which he disagrees is a standard practice.\n  What has happened in the past is either we could work that out, or we \nhave provided a continuing resolution in the meantime while we tried to \nwork it out. That has not been done in this instance. I do say to the \nSenator that I think that his suggestion that we ought to look at the \nbasis of the veto message and see what accommodations can be made \nbetween the two branches in terms of passing another bill, my \nunderstanding is the other side simply wants to send the same bill back \nwhich I would not regard as a constructive action.\n  I assume from the Senator's comments that he would not regard it as a \npositive or constructive action in the circumstance either.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to respond to my colleague, I really see \nno reason that the President vetoed the Interior bill and put people \nout of work. My point is that for the President to say, ``Well, this is \nCongress' fault these people are not working,'' I just disagree. I \nthink he bears direct responsibility in vetoing the Interior bill which \nis impacting the lives of 133,000 employees, and also for his actions \nin vetoing Commerce, State, Justice, as well as VA-HUD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. In looking at VA-HUD, and if we are not able to break \nthis impasse soon, I tell my colleague from Maryland that it is my hope \nthat we will take up--maybe we cannot pass--the HUD bill. Maybe there \nis a dispute. But we ought to be able to pass the veterans bill. My \nguess is we could pass that very quickly and maybe some additional \nthings.\n  I worked with the Senator Mikulski. I was on that Appropriations \nCommittee. I cannot help but think we could fund most areas in that \nbill. I have a copy of that veto message. I think we should be able to \nfund people working for the Veterans' Department, and hopefully we will \nbe able to break that logjam. We should do it today, or certainly \nbefore the end of this week.\n  In looking at Commerce, State, Justice, the Justice portion of it I \nhave heard some people allude to the fact, well, we are going to have \nproblems with prisons; we are going to have problems with clerks; and \nso on. Hopefully we will pass the Justice portion of it. I notice there \nis a dispute in Commerce. Maybe we could leave that one set aside, or \nother areas.\n  My point is that the President vetoed that bill. That bill has \nimpacted 194,000 employees. We passed that bill. The President could \nhave signed the bill and then said, well, he sends a rescission, or he \ncould have requested a supplemental appropriations. That has happened \nas well. The President did not do that.\n  I think the President's pollster was whispering in his ear saying, \n``This is looking good if you stand up to Congress and veto some bills. \nWe will reenact Harry Truman, and say the heck with Congress.'' \nUnfortunately, that \n\n[[Page S46]]\nhas put thousands of people into a furlough situation, or thousands of \npeople into working without pay.\n  The President vetoed those bills. He could have signed those bills \nand then worked out a budget agreement. He could have signed those \nbills and then requested a supplemental appropriation, if he did not \nthink we were spending enough money in some areas. If he thought we \nwere spending too much money in other areas, he could have sent a \nrescissions package. But instead he was in a veto mood, and he vetoed \nthese bills having an impact on hundreds of thousands of people, all of \nwhich he is trying to give Congress full credit for.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No. I am almost out of time.\n  So the President is directly responsible for putting hundreds of \nthousands of people--I will submit this for the Record as well--who \nwere impacted because he vetoed the bills. That was his right to do so. \nBut for him to come back and say that was all Congress' fault I think \nwas incorrect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis chart.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to the printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Ball's in the President's Court\n\n  The following bills have been vetoed by the President.

In the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, it would \n     allow harmful clear-cutting, require the sale of timber at \n     unsustainable levels, and dictate the use of an outdated \n     forest plan for the next 2 fiscal years.\n       In the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest, the \n     bill would impede implementation of our comprehensive plan \n     for managing public lands--the Columbia River Basin Ecosystem \n     Management Project. It would do this by prohibiting \n     publication of a final Environmental Impact Statement or \n     Record of Decision and requiring the exclusion of information \n     on fisheries and watersheds. The result: a potential return \n     to legal gridlock on timber harvesting, grazing, mining, and \n     other economically important activities.\n       And in the California desert, the bill undermines our \n     designation of the Mojave National Preserve by cutting \n     funding for the Preserve and shifting responsibility for its \n     management from the National Park Service to the Bureau of \n     Land Management. The Mojave is our newest national park and \n     part of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act--the \n     largest addition to our park system in the lower 48 States. \n     It deserves our support.\n       Moreover, the bill would impose a misguided moratorium on \n     future listings and critical habitat designations under the \n     Endangered Species Act. And in the case of one endangered \n     species, the marbled murrelet, it would eliminate the normal \n     flexibility for both the Departments of the Interior and \n     Agriculture to use new scientific information in managing our \n     forests.\n       Second, the bill slashes funding for the Department of \n     Energy's energy conservation programs. This is short-sighted \n     and unwise. Investment in the technology of energy \n     conservation is important for our Nation's long-term economic \n     strength and environmental health. We should be doing all we \n     can to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge, not back \n     off.\n       Third, this bill fails to honor our historic obligations \n     toward Native Americans. It provides inadequate funding for \n     the Indian Health Service and our Indian Education programs. \n     And the cuts targeted at key programs in the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs are crippling--including programs that support child \n     welfare; adult vocational training; law enforcement and \n     detention services; community fire protection; and general \n     assistance to low-income Indian individuals and families.\n       Moreover, the bill would unfairly single our certain self-\n     governance tribes in Washington State for punitive treatment. \n     Specifically, it would penalize these tribes financially for \n     using legal remedies in disputes with non-tribal owners of \n     land within reservations.\n       Finally, the bill represents a dramatic departure from our \n     commitment to support for the arts and the humanities. It \n     cuts funding of the National Endowments for the Arts and \n     Humanities so deeply as to jeopardize their capacity to keep \n     providing the cultural, educational, and artistic programs \n     that enrich America's communities large and small.\n       For these reasons and others my Administration has conveyed \n     to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot accept \n     this bill. It does not reflect my priorities or the values of \n     the American people. I urge the Congress to send me a bill \n     that truly serves the interests of our Nation and our \n     citizens.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       The White House, December 18, 1995.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n     To the House of Representatives\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2099, the \n     ``Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1996.''\n       H.R. 2099 would threaten public health and the environment, \n     end programs that are helping communities help themselves, \n     close the door on college for thousands of young people, and \n     leave veterans seeking medical care with fewer treatment \n     options.\n       The bill includes no funds for the highly successful \n     National Service program. If such funding were eliminated, \n     the bill would cost nearly 50,000 young Americans the \n     opportunity to help their community, through AmeriCorps, to \n     address vital local needs such as health care, crime \n     prevention, and education while earning a monetary award to \n     help them pursue additional education or training. I will not \n     sign any version of this appropriations bill that does not \n     restore funds for this vital program.\n       This bill includes a 22 percent cut in requested funding \n     for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a 25 \n     percent cut in enforcement that would cripple EPA efforts to \n     enforce laws against polluters. Particularly objectionable \n     are the bill's 25 percent cut in Superfund, which would \n     continue to expose hundreds of thousands of citizens to \n     dangerous chemicals and cuts, which would hamper efforts to \n     train workers in hazardous waste cleanup.\n       In addition to serve funding cuts for EPA, the bill also \n     includes legislative riders that were tacked onto the bill \n     without any hearings or adequate public input, including one \n     that would prevent EPA from exercising its authority under \n     the Clean Water Act to prevent wetlands losses.\n       I am concerned about the bill's $762 million reduction to \n     my request for funds that would go directly to States and \n     needy cities for clean water and drinking water needs, such \n     as assistance to clean up Boston Harbor. I also object to \n     cuts the Congress has made in environmental technology, the \n     climate change action plan, and other environmental programs.\n       The bill would reduce funding for the Council for \n     Environmental Quality by more than half. Such a reduction \n     would severely hamper the Council's ability to provide me \n     with advice on environmental policy and carry out its \n     responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       The bill provides no new funding for the Community \n     Development Financial Institutions program, an important \n     initiative for bringing credit and growth to communities long \n     left behind.\n       While the bill provides spending authority for several \n     important initiatives of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD), including Community Development Block \n     Grants, homeless assistance and the sale of HUD-owned \n     properties, it lacks funding for others. For example, the \n     bill provides no funds to support economic development \n     initiatives; it has insufficient funds for incremental rental \n     vouchers; and it cuts nearly in half my request for tearing \n     down the most severely distressed housing projects. Also, the \n     bill contains harmful riders that would transfer HUD's Fair \n     Housing activities to the Justice Department and eliminate \n     Federal preferences in the section 8, tenant-based program.\n       The bill provides less than I requested for the medical \n     care of this Nation's veterans. It includes significant \n     restrictions on funding for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     that \n\n[[Page S47]]\n     appear designed to impede him from carrying out his duties as an \n     advocate for veterans. Further, the bill does not provide \n     necessary funding for VA hospital construction.\n       For these reasons and others my Administration has conveyed \n     to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot accept \n     this bill. This bill does not reflect the values that \n     Americans hold dear. I urge the Congress to send me an \n     appropriations bill for these important priorities that truly \n     serves the American people.\n                                               William J.

Mr. President, first of all I want to identify with what \nI think has been a very compelling case made by a variety of my \ncolleagues here on the floor of the Senate, by the Senator from New \nMexico, the Senator from Maryland, and the Senator from Kentucky, in \ndescribing in very human terms what is happening with real families \nimpacted by the Government shutdown. And that same situation is \nhappening in spades in my own State of Massachusetts. There are \nheartrending stories of families that in so many circumstances really \nare being devastated. The adverse impact on children continues. And it \nis very real. The prospects are of serious consequence, indeed. And \nthat is a very important issue for the American people to dwell on, to \nbe concerned about and also to bring their best judgment on the levels \nof power to try to remedy it.\n  The Government shutdown was remedied here in the U.S. Senate by the \nactions that were taken by Senator Dole, and I think all of us want to \ntake note of his leadership and understanding--that this charade of \nclosing down the Government is nothing but a charade.\n  If our good friends, our Republican friends, the majority in the \nHouse and Senate, had met their responsibilities, these various \nappropriations bills would have been passed as has been done in other \nyears. If they had been vetoed, these matters would have been worked \nout in the same way they have been historically--as has been described \nby the Senator from Maryland.\n  It is not a shutdown because even our Republican friends say they are \ngoing to pay all of these individuals eventually. So it is really not a \nshutdown. The taxpayers are going to pay these people.\n  Maybe they get some satisfaction, the Senator from Oklahoma and \nothers, from the fact that the Americans are not going to be working \nnow. They are not going to work, and, yet, our Republican friends say \neventually they are going to be paid. And in the meantime, we have \nthese human conditions and human tragedies that are taking place. The \nAmerican people understand it. I think all of us are very hopeful that \nour Republican friends in the House are going to follow the leadership \nthat has been provided in the Senate by Republicans and permit the \nopportunity for the services to be continued which are in so many \ninstances essential for the well-being of our fellow citizens. And, I \nam hopeful that whatever differences exist can be worked out as has \nbeen part of the proud tradition of this country.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to address an issue which is related to these \nnegotiations which are taking place between the leadership, Republican \nand Democrat, and the President. It is one aspect of these negotiations \nwhich I think bears close attention by our colleagues here in the \nCongress and the Senate but most of all by our senior citizens and by \nworking families in this country, because it is a matter that will have \na very significant and important adverse impact on them if it is \nincluded in the budget proposal.\n  Like others, I have stated that we are for the balanced budget, but \nwe do believe it has to meet the basic criteria of being fair and just \nto the American people. That means if there is going to be belt-\ntightening, it ought to be across the board and not be particularly \nburdensome to the neediest and most vulnerable, the children, disabled, \nthe neediest families in our society. That means we ought to make sure \nwhatever the final outcome is going to be, it will be fair and just for \nall Americans. It is on that issue that I address the Senate for these \nfew remaining moments this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S47-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S47-S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LEGISLATING A CHANGE IN THE CPI\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the President and the congressional leaders discuss \nways to achieve a balanced budget, one idea should be rejected out of \nhand--legislating a change in the Consumer Price Index.\n  That kind of arbitrary action by Congress would break faith with the \nelderly and make a mockery of the commitment of both parties not to cut \nSocial Security.\n  It would raise taxes on low-income working families qualifying for \nthe earned income tax credit--and other working families as well.\n  It would lead to lower wage increases for millions of workers \nthroughout the country at a time when one of the most serious \nchallenges our society faces is the decline in the living standard for \nall but the wealthiest families.\n  Such a change would be harshly regressive in its impact. It would be \nunprecedented political meddling in what has always been an impartial, \nfactual determination of the CPI.\n  Reducing the CPI would reduce cost of living adjustments for millions \nof Americans receiving Social Security benefits, military pensions, \nveterans' pensions, and civil service retirement. It would reduce the \namount of Supplemental security income payments to the needy. Because \nof indexing of tax brackets, it would raise income taxes for most \ntaxpayers--and reduce the earned income tax credit.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 1-percent decrease in \nthe change in the CPI would reduce Government spending and increase \nGovernment revenues over the next 7 years, for a total deficit \nreduction of $281 billion. Some may see this large sum as a magic \nbullet to balance the budget and avoid other painful choices. But it is \na bullet aimed at millions of Americans who need help the most, and who \ndon't deserve this added pain. It makes no sense to fight hard to save \nMedicare--and then attack Social Security.\n  Legislating an arbitrary reduction in the CPI would clearly break the \ncompact of Social Security. That compact says, ``work hard, play by the \nrules, contribute to the system, and, in return, you will be guaranteed \nretirement security when you are old.'' An essential part of that \ncompact is a fair Social Security COLA, so that senior citizens can be \nsure that their hard-earned Social Security benefits will not be eaten \naway by inflation.\n  Overall, more than three-fourths of the lower spending under the \nchange would come from cuts in Social Security alone. Nearly all the \nrest would come from other Federal retirement programs. It is the \nelderly who will pay heavily if Congress adopts this change.\n  Over the next 10 years, a 1-percent cut in the COLA would reduce the \nreal value of the median income beneficiary's Social Security checks by \n$5,300. By the 10th year, the real purchasing value of that check would \nbe 9 percent lower--making it even harder than it is today for senior \ncitizens to stretch their limited incomes to pay the bills for housing, \nfood, medical care, and other necessities.\n  Reducing the Social Security COLA is a direct attack on the \nretirement benefits that senior citizens have earned. If Congress is to \nrespect family values, it has to value families, especially the \nmillions of elderly families all across America.\n  Changing the CPI also affects the deficit by increasing taxes, \nbecause income tax brackets and the earned income tax credit are \nindexed to inflation. If tax brackets are not adjusted for inflation, \ntaxes go up and the earned income tax credit goes down.\n  Failing to adjust tax brackets hits middle income families the \nhardest. For the wealthy, the change in the CPI would have a minimal \nimpact. A family earning $100,000 would see its taxes rise by one-third \nof 1 percent of its income. But for families at lower income levels, \nthe differences are far more significant. A family earning $36,000 \nwould face a tax increase that, as a percent of income, would be more \nthan four times as large. The hardest hit of all would be low-income \nworking families who depend on the earned income tax credit. Twelve \npercent of the total tax increase--$13 billion--would be paid by these \nlow-income hard-working families. \n\n[[Page S48]]\n\n  The impact of cutting the CPI reaches well beyond the Federal budget. \nIt is also a direct attack on the wages of working families. Many \nworkers have CPI adjustments in their collective bargaining contracts. \nBut every pay increase is affected by the CPI. If the CPI is reduced by \nCongress, wages will be lower too for virtually all workers across the \ncountry.\n  There is no greater source of dissatisfaction in American families \nthan the continuing erosion of their living standards. Except for the \nwealthy, the story of the past two decades has been ``work harder and \nearn less.'' Cutting the CPI will make a bad situation even worse, by \nputting even greater downward pressure on the wages of every American.\n  Lowering the CPI has been presented as merely an overdue technical \ncorrection that should be supported as a matter of good government. \nThis claim cannot pass the truth in advertising test.\n  The technical argument for lowering the CPI has been made by the \nBoskin Commission, which was appointed by the Senate Finance Committee \nto examine the issue. The Commission issued an interim report last \nSeptember, which identifies several biases in the calculation. The \nCommission asserted that the CPI has overstated inflation by 1.5 \npercent a year. For the future, the Commission predicted that the CPI \nwould be 1 percent a year too high.\n  The major problem with the Commission's analysis is that the sources \nof bias it identifies are also identified by the nonpolitical \nprofessional economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the \nDepartment of Labor. They have the responsibility for setting the CPI \neach year. They do so fairly and impartially. They make periodic \ncorrections to take account of any biases--up or down--that affect the \nindex. The Bureau already plans to reduce the CPI by about two-tenths \nof 1 percent in 1997. This reduction is already assumed in the budget \nprojections for the next 7 years.\n  The issue is not whether there should be changes in the CPI, but who \nshould make them and how large they should be. The Boskin Commission's \nwork is a poor basis for changing the CPI. As the Commission itself \nacknowledged, it did little original research. The Commission's \nmembership was stacked with economists who believed that the CPI was \noverstated. According to Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic \nPolicy Institute, ``All five members had previously testified that they \nbelieved the CPI was overstated. Economists who gave contrary \ntestimony \n* * * were excluded.''\n  According to Joel Popkin, another expert on the CPI, the Commission \ncomprised five of the six witnesses before the full Finance Committee \nwho gave the highest estimates of bias. As Mr. Popkin also pointed out, \nthe interim report of the Commission falls far short of presenting \nadequate justification for its conclusions, and therefore provides no \nbasis for Congress to change tax policies or entitlement programs such \nas Social Security.\n  In fact, for the elderly, the group most affected by any change, the \nmost authoritative study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests \nthat the CPI may understate rather than overstate the true increase in \nthe cost of living, because of the rapid increase in medical costs for \nthe elderly.\n  To legislate an arbitrary change in the CPI would be unprecedented. \nIn the entire history of the CPI, the Congress has never tried to \nimpose a politically driven adjustment, and there is no excuse for \nimposing one now. Senior citizens and working families across the \ncountry depend on a fair CPI, and Congress should keep it that way.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just wish to say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, I listened very carefully. This question of the CPI is \nopen for debate. Thus far, consideration has been given in a bipartisan \nmanner by Members on both sides of this aisle, and as yet there has \nbeen no resolution. I think, indeed, there is some consideration at the \nlevel of the President and his senior advisers on this issue.\n  But, Mr. President, what disturbs me so much is that the Senator from \nMassachusetts sought to come here this morning and talk about that \nissue, yet he fails to address one of the most burning issues indeed on \nboth sides of the aisle here in the U.S. Senate, and that is the \ninability of the majority leader, the inability of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, to bring up the Labor and Human Resources \nappropriations bill. It is stopped, blocked, such that this body \ncannot--cannot--act upon that very important piece of legislation. The \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is the ranking member of that \ncommittee, and as such he is in a position to see that this piece of \nlegislation could be brought forward.\n  This Senator is receiving reports this morning--and I called in as \nearly as an hour ago to the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, and \nto the facilities here in Maryland--as to what the impact is of this \nshutdown on those very important, ongoing health advisory services to \nall of our citizens, and I shall later in the day perhaps be able to \nadvise the Senate. I heard that the CDC is not able to monitor the flu \nepidemic that is now in the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, I would hope that at some point, if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts desires to return to the floor, that he might \naddress this important issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I have a minute to respond to the Senator from \nVirginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could get clarification, I would be \nglad to withhold so long as the Senator does not use a minute of my own \ntime. Could we agree he have a minute, and then I have the time \nallocated to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time assignment to the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold until the Senator responds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is so interesting to listen to my good \nfriend and colleague cry crocodile tears for the Centers for Disease \nControl because in the very appropriations bill the Senator has talked \nabout he would cut the Centers for Disease Control by a third and \ndiminish its effectiveness to deal with these communicable diseases.\n  That is an issue we ought to be debating out here. The Senator knows \nwe could pass that bill if it had not come with the unwarranted and \nunjustified positions that have been assumed by the majority in \nundermining a woman's right to choose and including striker \nreplacement. Drop those, and it passes by a voice vote this afternoon, \nI say to the Senator.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S48-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S48-S51]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that there have been efforts at \nthe White House, meetings between the President, the Vice President, \nand the leaders of Congress to try to find a solution to our budget \nproblems. I know that sometimes they feel like they are trying to grasp \nfor the wind. It is very difficult to find a solution, but it is a \nvery, very important effort. I wish them continued encouragement in \ntheir efforts to find an agreement to the budget. I have been very much \nconcerned that it does not seem like they are making that much \nprogress.\n  The way you get a budget agreement, the way you get any agreement any \ntime when you have two opposing \n\n[[Page S49]]\nviews is both sides have to give a little and get a little in return. I \ndo not think that is happening yet. But I hope they will continue. I \nhope that something will happen, if they do not meet today, tomorrow, \nthat dramatic progress will be made, although I know it will be very \ndifficult.\n\n  Yesterday afternoon the President went on national television right \nbefore the bipartisan meeting on the budget to bemoan the partial \nshutdown of the Federal Government. He recited a list of horror stories \nabout the disastrous effects of that shutdown.\n  He said, ``We ought to reopen the Government.'' I agree. He said, \n``The shutdown has been especially devastating to hundreds of thousands \nof dedicated public servants who work for the American people through \nthe Federal Government.'' I agree with that. He said, ``It's time to \nstop holding Federal workers hostage in this process.'' I agree with \nthat too.\n  But that is the limit of my agreement with President Clinton. There \nis an awful lot of misunderstanding or misinformation that is being \nperpetrated on the American people about how we got into the situation \nwe are in now.\n  Let us remember that the current shutdown is indeed partial because \nit does not effect any departments or agencies whose appropriations \nbills have been signed into law. I believe seven of them have been \nsigned into law.\n  So the question is, why have not the remaining appropriations bills \nbeen signed into law? If they had been, we would not have the situation \nwe have now.\n  There have been two major problems in getting those bills signed into \nlaw. One is the President himself. The second is the Democratic \nminority here in the Senate. Most of the President's tales of woe \nyesterday would not have been happening if the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education appropriations bill was signed into law. But we \nwould not even pass it here in the Senate.\n  There is the problem. It is the Senate that has not acted. It is the \nminority in the Senate that has blocked the Labor-HHS, Education \nappropriations bill from even being considered. Keep in mind what has \nhappened is that there is a threat to filibuster the motion to proceed \nbecause of some policy language that is in that Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill. We are being told by the minority in the Senate \nyou cannot even bring it up because of some of the provisions in this \nbill.\n  Why not? Let us bring it up. Let us have amendments. Let us debate \nthem. Let us vote. Oh, no. The minority in the Senate, the Democrats in \nthe Senate, have blocked even the consideration of this bill. Why? \nBecause of striker replacement language that is in this bill where the \nPresident clearly, in my opinion, and I think some courts will \neventually decide, has exceeded his authority with an Executive order \non this subject. But the Democrats in the Senate will not even allow \nthat bill to be brought up for consideration. Yet, they complain about \nhow people are being affected by the fact that we do not have funding \nin this particular area.\n\n  Let us do something about it. Let us get the bill up. Let us go with \nthe usual process around here, let us have votes. Some amendments will \npass, some will not. Let us send it to the President and let him do \nwhat he will.\n  So we need to keep in mind exactly why some of these horror stories \nare happening. It is because the Democrats in the Senate will not even \nallow this appropriations bill to be brought up. So, you know, I am \nconcerned about the Meals on Wheels Program, over Medicare contractors, \nover jobs that might be affected by this. The solution is to take this \nLabor-HHS-Education appropriations bill up.\n  The responsibility is at least a shared one. The President had the \ntemerity yesterday, for instance, to complain that the Environmental \nProtection Agency has been crippled by the shutdown. But who was it \nthat vetoed the appropriations bill that had funding for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in it? President Clinton.\n  The President complained about the shutdown of emergency programs at \nFEMA. But who vetoed FEMA's appropriations bill? President Clinton \nvetoed that bill.\n  The President, with a straight face, complained about shutdowns at \nthe State Department after he himself vetoed the State Department's \nappropriations bill. Oh, but he said he had his reasons for those \nvetoes, that he did not get everything he wanted in some of those \nbills.\n  Well, here is, in his own words, what he said about why he vetoed \nsome of these bills. ``I will not sign any version of this bill,'' \ntalking about the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill--and get \nthat, ``any version''--``that does not fund the COPS initiative as a \nfree-standing, discretionary grant program, as authorized.''\n  Translation: The Congress decided to fight crime by giving localities \ndiscretion in how they spend Federal aid. Mr. Clinton says it is his \nway or no way. He will shut down three critical Federal Departments \nunless he gets his COPS program the way he wants it.\n  We have three coequal branches of Government. The President cannot \nsay, ``It's my way or no way.'' He has to work with the Congress, and \nhe has to be sometime aware of what the courts have said.\n  But that is not all. He would keep those Departments shut down and \ntheir work force out on the street unless the Congress limits \nrestrictions on the conduct of the Legal Services Corporation and its \ngrantees, otherwise he cannot accept the appropriations bill. Funding \nis provided, services will be provided, but there are some restrictions \non trying to control the excesses of the Legal Services Corporation. \nBut he is ready to shut down all three of these big Departments and the \nagencies that are also affected by it because he cannot accept it the \nway it was written in the appropriations bill we sent him.\n  He said he ``cannot accept'' the money Congress wants to spend to \nkeep the Commerce Department in operation and to keep the Justice \nDepartment in operation and to keep the State Department in operation \nunless we agree to pay for abortions for prison inmates.\n  Did you hear me? One of the 10 issues, I believe it was 10, that he \nlisted why he vetoed that bill--actually it was 9 major issues--was \nbecause it had limits on abortions being paid for prisoners. The \nAmerican people would not believe that. That was one of the main issues \nthat he listed as to why he would veto that bill.\n  He said he cannot accept congressional funding for these three very \nimportant Departments as long as there is a moratorium--not a ban, mind \nyou, just a moratorium--on future listings under the Endangered Species \nAct by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  There is a lot of feeling across America that the Endangered Species \nAct has gone too far, has been distorted, has gone from what was needed \nto ridiculous. I voted for the original Endangered Species Act, but I \nhad no idea that it was going to get into a situation where an entire \nappropriations bill would be vetoed for the Interior Department because \nof objections relating to the marbled murrelet. The President lists as \none of the seven major reasons why he vetoed the Department of Interior \nbill is because he did not like the objections regarding the marbled \nmurrelet.\n  Do the American people know this? Would they be horrified if they \nrealized that one of the major reasons the President vetoed an \nappropriations bill was because of this bird? I guess it is a bird. I \ndo not think they would be very happy with that.\n  He had other reasons, as well, for closing down those three \nDepartments. He opposes funding reductions in the Census Bureau. How \nmany of you think the American people are all upset because there maybe \nis not enough funding in 1996 for the Census Bureau? Maybe it does \ndeserve more, but that is what all this budget discussion is really \nabout, I thought. If there is an agreement there would be some more \nfunding provided for these things, then the changes would be made. But \nto veto the bill, and one of the major reasons listed for the veto of \nthe Commerce, State, Justice Department bill was because he opposes \ncuts in the Census Bureau. I do not think there are a lot of American \npeople really worrying about that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that? \n  \n[[Page S50]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me continue. I am about to get to the point where I can \nyield. Let me continue on my thought, if I can.\n  He is so devoted to the Commerce technology programs that he shut \ndown the entire Department in order to preserve them. I do not \nunderstand the thinking.\n  The same holds true with the Interior and Energy Departments. The \nworkers are idled because Mr. Clinton has two problems with the \nInterior appropriations bill. His first problem is he wants more money. \nYes, that is the big part of it all, he wants more money for \neverything. I was looking over his objections on the Interior bill. He \nwants more money for DOE energy conservation, more money for Native \nAmerican programs, more money for the National Endowments for the Arts \nand the Humanities.\n  That is the crux of all of it. We have a President for the first time \nin my memory, and I have been watching them pretty closely now for \nabout 27 years, who is vetoing appropriations bills because they do not \nspend enough. Every other President I have ever watched, Democrat and \nRepublican, vetoed appropriations bills because Congress could not \ncontrol its insatiable appetite to spend more of the taxpayers' money. \nNow we have a President who says, ``I want more money'' and, in most \ncases, we are not talking about cuts in a lot of them, we are talking \nabout controls on the rate of increases in these programs.\n  His second problem concerns provisions regarding \ncertain environmental areas. The Tongass National Forest, the Columbia \nRiver Basin, the Mojave National Preserve. In the case of the Mojave \nNational Preserve, as I understand it, he is mad because the \nresponsibility would be shifted from the Park Service to the Bureau of \nLand Management. Is that enough reason to veto an appropriations bill \nfor the Interior Department?\n\n  And in Tongass, he objects to clear cutting. As I understand the \nlanguage in the bill, clear cutting is prohibited in there. He pointed \nout three technical concerns he had, basically technical. I think they \ncan be worked out. I hope they will be, and I hope we can move this \nInterior Department appropriations bill forward.\n  The third vetoed appropriations bill would have funded the Veterans' \nDepartment, HUD, and several smaller agencies. President Clinton killed \nthat funding and let those Departments and agencies close because \nCongress would not give him money for his pet projects, such as the \nNational Service Program. As always, he wanted more of the public's \nmoney than Congress wanted to spend: More for EPA; more for the Council \non Environmental Quality; more for something called Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Program, and just generally more \nmoney.\n  He even vetoed the bill because Congress inserted a provision to stop \nthe Secretary of the Veterans' Department from engaging in \ninappropriate political activity. He cited that as one of the reasons \nwhy he vetoed it.\n  So it goes on and on, Mr. President. I am afraid we have not done a \nvery good job in explaining why we did some of the things we did in \nappropriations bills, but more importantly, explaining why the \nPresident vetoed them.\n  If I held up the list of the seven things that he cites as to why he \nvetoed the Interior appropriations bill--plus, of course, more money \nfor everything--I do not believe the average American would agree with \nwhat he did. They would not think that a disagreement over whether some \nparticular national preserve is controlled by the Park Service or the \nBureau of Land Management is enough reason to veto the bill.\n  But I think we can find a solution. We will and we should try to pass \nthese appropriations bills again with changes that have been suggested, \nsometimes by the President and sometimes by others. It has not been \ndone before now partially because there was a thinking that there were \nserious budget negotiations underway and maybe some conclusion would be \nreached on the entitlements programs and on returning tax dollars to \nthe people who pay the taxes and only appropriated accounts.\n  But since fast progress is not being made, at least we should go \nahead and try to move some of these appropriations bills, individually \nor in a group, and allow the President to make up his own mind then \nwhether or not he wants to veto them again. But if he does, the record \nwill then be replete with evidence: The problem is not the Congress, \nthe problem is the President, because we are going to give him another \nopportunity to consider these appropriations bills individually or \nperhaps even in a group.\n  Hopefully, we can come to an agreement. Hopefully, the budget \ndiscussions will bear real fruit. But it is going to take a lot more \nmovement by the President than I have seen or I have read about in the \npress so far.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period for morning \nbusiness be extended until the hour of 1:30 p.m., with statements \nlimited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield to the Senator from \nMaryland. I thank him for letting me complete my statement before he \nasked his question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Interior bill permits clear cutting in the \nTongass National Forest, I take it from the Senator's comments he would \nbe opposed to it; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think there should be language in the appropriations bill \nthat would be--frankly, I hoped it would say there should not be clear \ncutting. I am not on the Appropriations Committee. I know they are \nworking on that, and I think they will come up with language that will \nclarify that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I take it from that response, if the President had a \nreasonably based concern that the bill would permit clear cutting, it \nwould be a justified basis on which to veto the bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not think so. Although I understand his concern and \nwhile I may have some agreement with him on it, to veto the entire \nDepartment of Interior appropriations bill over that one point would \nnot be sufficient, in my mind, because you are talking about thousands \nof people being out of work, you are talking about monuments being \nclosed down, parks being closed down.\n  That could have been clarified in other ways, through authorization, \nthrough other appropriation bills, and it would be coming very quickly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is what we did with Presidents Reagan and Bush. \nThey would veto the bills, then we would try to accommodate their veto \nmessage and work out an understanding between the executive and \nlegislative branches. But if that was not done immediately, we would \nprovide a continuing resolution so the Government could function.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield on that, 2 years in a row in the \nReagan administration, the Congress did not pass a single \nappropriations bill that was signed into law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right, and----\n  Mr. LOTT. And the Democratic-controlled Congress passed continuing \nresolutions that had all 13 appropriations bills lumped into them--just \nlumped them into a pile along with the debt ceiling and everything, and \nleft town and said to the President, ``Sign it.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. We reached agreement with the President, and the \nGovernment continued to function on the basis of the continuing \nresolution.\n  Now you have an instance in which you have just brought the \nGovernment to a partial shutdown by not providing a continuing \nresolution and not working out the differences that were connected with \nthe veto of the appropriations bills.\n  The Senator mentioned the Bureau of the Census, and he sort of \ndismissed it. The United States has done a decennial census every year \nsince 1790. That was when the first census was done. We have done a \ncensus every 10 years since then. Does the Senator think that we should \ndo a decennial census in the year 2000?\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, I would want to think about that and make sure I gave \nyou a fully informed answer. I think the answer is probably yes. But we \nare not talking about not funding the Census Bureau; we are talking \nabout the level of funding for the Census Bureau 4 years from when this \ndecennial census will occur, and also when it involved vetoing an \nentire Department's appropriations bill. I do not think that \n\n[[Page S51]]\nbecause the President did not get all the funds he wanted, that is \nenough to veto the State, Commerce, Justice appropriations bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator that the President had other \nreasons as well. But since you focused on the Bureau of Census, unless \nthe Census Bureau gets additional funds now to begin the work that \nneeds to be done to do the decennial census in the year 2000, they will \nnot be able to do it.\n  Mr. LOTT. But you cannot be concerned here about Meals on Wheels, \nother Federal programs, and monuments being closed and, on the other \nhand, say, ``I am vetoing the bill because you do not give me all of \nthe funding I want for the Census Bureau or for the National Endowment \nprograms.'' This process could still go forward. My point is that the \nPresident vetoed these bills, in my opinion, on questionable grounds \nthat put all of these Federal workers out of work.\n  We passed one continuing resolution, I remind the Senator from \nMaryland, and I was involved in the discussions and suggested some \nlanguage that helped move that continuing resolution through right \nbefore Thanksgiving, with the idea that there would be sufficient time \nfor us to get an agreement on our budget before Christmas. It did not \nhappen. We still do not have one. The President signed into law a \ncommitment to have a balanced budget in 7 years, using CBO numbers or \nreal numbers, which still has not happened.\n  So the Congress, frankly, is concerned about sending another CR down \nthere that would extend the time without knowing what the result is \ngoing to be. By the way, how much time does it take? The President has \nknown for weeks, for months, that we were moving toward a balanced \nbudget in 7 years, yet he did not really get engaged until actually \nright before Christmas. But it is time that we get an agreement. If we \nget an agreement, then all these other problems will fall by the \nwayside.\n  What we are trying to do is get a solution that controls the rate of \ngrowth in the explosive Federal Government spending for the sake of our \nchildren's future. That is what I worry about. I worry about this \n$185,000-plus a year in interest on the national debt that every child \nowes when they are born. How are we going to control this? That is what \nis really at stake.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Can I ask what the time situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Mississippi has \n5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think I have made my point for now. I am \nsure we will have continuing discussions. I think we can find solutions \nif men of good will are willing work together and try to find a way to \nwork out the disagreements and come to the conclusion and pass these \nbills. I do not see why it could not be done quickly. I certainly hope \nit will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to make this observation about \nthe comments of the Senator from Mississippi. Never before has the \nCongress used as a coercive tactic to close down the Government in \norder to try to gain its way for a fundamental change----\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Is it not true that, in 1987, I believe, the Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress passed a CR that had every appropriations bill, \ndebt ceiling, and a number of other issues, and left town and said to \nthe President, ``Sign it and keep the Government operating, or veto it \nand shut it down.''? And they were gone. Did that happen or not?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The President could have called the Congress back. The \nCongress gave him a CR so the Government could continue to function. \nNow what is happening is, for the first time ever, the Congress is \nrefusing to provide a CR and use that as a coercive tactic in the \nbargaining. That is an irresponsible and, in my view, impermissible \naction. That is what is happening.\n  We did not close the Government down with respect to the Republican \nPresidents. We let the Government go on to function.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Government has been closed down before during \nDemocratic administrations. This is not new. We have had budget \ndisagreements every year for the last 15 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Government has been closed down for 19 days.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know it has been done for at least 11 days, as I \nremember. I do not remember the other times, but we have had these \nshutdowns before.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I want to answer \nthat point. There were periods before the Civiletti decision in 1980 in \nwhich the Government continued to function without an appropriations \nbill because there was not a ruling that under the Antideficiency Act, \nthe Government could not go on functioning. So we did not have an \nappropriations bill, but the Government continued to function.\n  Then we had this ruling that you are not allowed to do that. \nSubsequent to that, we had maybe a day, or a weekend, or something, in \nwhich there would be a gap in between having an appropriation bill, and \neither getting an appropriation or getting a continuing resolution. \nThis is the first time, clearly, in which an extended period has been \nallowed to develop as a coercive tactic in closing down the Government.\n  You cannot find a previous instance--you can find instances before \nthe Civiletti opinion in which departments continued to function \nwithout an appropriations bill, but there was then a ruling that said \nsuch functioning ran counter to the Antideficiency Act. You can then \nfind instances after the Civiletti opinion in which you had a period of \na day or two or a weekend in which that was the case. But we never had \nan instance, as we have now experienced, where we have had 6 days \nearlier in 1995 and now we have run for 19 days and where it is clearly \nadmitted that this is being used as a coercive tactic.\n  My distinguished colleagues in the House have been very explicit \nabout the fact that they will, as they say, create a ``titanic \nlegislative standoff'' with President Clinton. Others have said openly \nthat they intended to bring the Government to a halt, to have a \nclosedown, in order to provoke a controversy.\n  My very basic point is that this is irresponsible. It has not been \ndone in the past. It represents, I think, an abuse of the \nconstitutional arrangements of power, and it ought to cease.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S48-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S51-S53]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have heard, during the course of the \nmorning, that this is really just a question about the various funding \nand how we will be able to get the resources to be able to move toward \na balanced budget. I think it is important that as we see this process \nhopefully move forward, that the American people are going to \nunderstand the various options which we can take that make that \nprogress.\n  I want to address the Senate on the fairness issue in reaching the \nbalanced budget, because I think all of us know if it was just a \nquestion of figures, anyone could reach the balanced budget by \nslashing, burning and ending various kinds of programs. The question \nis, how are we going to reach that objective and do it in a way that \nwill be fair, meeting the standard of fairness to the American people. \nI think it will only be if the proposal that is agreed on, and \nhopefully it will be agreed on by the Congress and by the President, \nwill meet that standard of fairness, and will be acceptable by the \nAmerican people. That is a fair test.\n  I want to address the Senate for a few moments this afternoon on a \nvery important aspect of what I think is the issue of fairness. The \noriginal Republican budget plan was properly vetoed by the President \nbecause it failed to meet this test of fairness. It inflicted deep cuts \nin Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and other important \nnational priorities, and included large tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals and corporations.\n  Half of all the spending cuts in the Republican plan came from the \nbottom 20 percent of families in America while only 9 percent of the \ncuts came from the top 20 percent of families in America. Two-thirds of \nthe tax breaks in the Republican plan go to the same top 20 percent of \nAmericans, while the bottom 20 percent would face a tax increase. The \nmiddle 60 percent of Americans would also be hit unfairly. They would \nlose an average of $600 each because of the spending cuts, and get back \nonly a third of that amount in tax reductions. \n\n[[Page S52]]\n\n  In order to have a fair balanced budget, every form of spending \nshould be on the table. By the year 2002, the largest of all \nentitlement programs will be tax entitlements. It is not going to be \nthe Census Bureau, it is not going to be the NEA, it will not be \neducation, it is not going to be the environmental cleanup, it is going \nto be tax entitlements. Between now and the year 2002, the Federal \nGovernment will spend over $4 trillion in tax loopholes and tax \npreferences which go disproportionately to wealthy individuals and \ncorporations. In 2002, these tax entitlements will represent a larger \nshare of the budget than Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid or any \nof the other entitlement programs. So far, out of the $4 trillion of \ntax entitlements, the Republicans are willing to cut only $16 billion. \nOut of the $4.3 trillion, they are prepared to cut $16 billion.\n  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal cited the increasing \ndisparity of the tax burden between individuals and corporations. The \njournal cites Treasury Department figures that corporate taxes in 1993 \naccounted for only 10 percent of the total Federal tax collections. In \n1960, that figure was 23 percent. The proportion of taxes paid by \ncorporate America has decreased by more than half at the same time the \ncorporate profits have soared and wages have remained stagnant.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986, the most recent comprehensive reform of \nour Tax Code, was enacted to provide greater equity in the tax burden \nby eliminating corporate loopholes. The statistics compiled by the \nOffice of Management and Budget suggest this has had limited effect. \nMr. President, this chart is effectively summarizing what was in the \nWall Street Journal article about a week ago about what has happened \nwith tax fairness, and corporations versus families. Here we find where \nthe American families, working families, individuals, and individual \nfamilies have been with respect to tax revenues, and where the burden \nhas fallen.\n  What have we seen over the period of the last years? Constant \nreduction in terms of corporate participation. It is now just about a \nthird of what it was back some 30 years ago. Basically, that has been \nbecause of the escalation of the various tax expenditures and tax \nloopholes. What do our Republican friends want to do in their budget? \nThey want to provide greater kinds of benefits to the corporations and \nwealthiest individuals, and increase--increase--the taxes on the \nworking families, on the neediest working families in this country.\n  I wish when we listen to our good Republican friends that are talking \nabout how the President wants to spend a little more on the Census \nBureau and how he wants to do a little more on the environment, that we \nwould realize that their arguments would have a lot more power if they \nexplained why they want to have $245 billion in tax breaks, which is \ntheir latest offer, saying they will not support any kind of budget \nunless it has that $245 billion--again, it is the corporations who have \nbeen gradually paying less and less of their fair share of the load.\n  We hear a lot about people being in the wagon and out of the wagon, \npaying their fair share of the load. What we have seen, Mr. President, \nis over the period of these years right up until now, the gradual \nreduction in the corporations' participation because of the whole range \nof different tax expenditures.\n  Let me just describe briefly a few of those. Again, this is occurring \nbecause the Tax Code is still rife with loopholes through which this \ncountry's major corporations jump with ease. The General Accounting \nOffice has reported that in 1991, 73 percent of foreign-based \ncorporations doing business in the United States pay no Federal income \ntaxes. More than 60 percent of U.S.-based companies paid no U.S. income \ntaxes. Not only are the foreign corporations not paying any, what we \nhave devised in the Tax Code are provisions which are encouraging these \ncorporations to move jobs overseas taking jobs away from Americans. We \ngive them tax benefits if they take the jobs away from hard-working \nAmericans who are already paying their fair share, to move them \noverseas. We found that when the President in the last Congress closed \ndown one of the principal loopholes, no sooner had it been closed down \nthan under the Republican program it has opened up again.\n  Companies still have a significant incentive to minimize the \ncalculation of their U.S. income, and therefore their U.S. taxation. \nThey shift income away from the United States and shift deductible \nexpenses into the United States. In fact, these corporate tax loopholes \nencourage companies to move plants and jobs overseas to low-tax havens. \nOur Tax Code promotes the wage stagnation caused by the exodus of good \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Surely, if elderly couples depending on Medicare and having an \naverage income of less than $17,000 a year would be required by the \nRepublican plan to pay an additional $2,500 in Medicare premiums to \nbalanced the budget over the next 7 years, corporations can be asked to \ncontribute their fair share.\n  If 4 million children would lose their health care and 5 million \nsenior citizens and disabled Americans would lose their Medicaid \nprotection to balance the budget, corporations can be asked to bear \ntheir fair share. Surely, if education funding would be cut by 30 \npercent and millions of college students would have the cost of their \nstudent loans increased to a point where they may no longer be able to \nafford college, corporations can be asked to bear their fair share.\n  Here are several approaches to make this work. First, the Republican \nplan would provide a reduction of 17 percent in the Federal budget over \nthe next 7 years, exclusive of defense spending and Social Security. \nReducing the $4 trillion in tax subsidies by 17 percent would achieve \nsavings of $680 billion.\n  If we applied the 17-percent reduction to only one-quarter of the tax \nexpenditures, we would save $170 billion--more than enough to provide \nthe additional savings needed in the current impasse to balance the \nbudget fairly in 7 years. Surely it makes sense to reduce corporate \nsubsidies by a similar percentage as programs that benefit working \nAmericans and the poor are being cut.\n  As a second approach, a number of specific corporate loopholes that \nare contrary to sensible national policy could be eliminated entirely \nto achieve the needed savings. It would make sense under this approach \nto focus specifically on tax subsidies that have the direct or indirect \naffect of encouraging American businesses to move transactions and jobs \noverseas. It is particularly offensive, at a time when large numbers of \nAmerican workers are losing their jobs and being dislocated by changes \nin the economy, that the Tax Code is subsidizing corporations to move \ntransactions and jobs overseas.\n  Here are examples of some of the most egregious corporate tax \nexpenditures:\n  Runaway plants--$8 billion over 7 years: The Tax Code now encourages \nU.S. firms to move abroad. A manufacturing plant that moves overseas \ncan defer its taxes on profits until those profits are repatriated to \nthe United States. As a result, much of these profits never come back \nto the United States. Unlike all other taxpayers, these multinational \ncompanies are not required to pay taxes at the time of the gain.\n  Closing this egregious loophole would eliminate an $8 billion \ngiveaway over 7 years. Yet, legislation proposed to address this \nspecific issue was rejected by the Senate earlier this year on a party \nline vote.\n  As a result, foreign subsidiaries can accrue big profits abroad, \nstash the money in foreign bank accounts, and not pay any U.S. taxes on \nthem.\n  In a related matter, the President and Congress took action in 1993 \nto close an additional loophole that provides incentives to companies \nto move jobs overseas. The Republicans now want to reopen that \nloophole, and have done so in their budget plan.\n  Over the course of the past 15 years, the United States lost 3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs. Fifty percent of these jobs have been lost \nin the last 5 years alone. These jobs were being lost at the same time \nthat U.S.-owned subsidiaries were locating plants in tax haven \ncountries across the globe.\n  Closing these loopholes is a win-win for the American worker and the \nAmerican taxpayer. U.S. companies will no longer have the same \nincentive to move U.S. jobs overseas and at the same time we can reduce \nthe Federal deficit.\n  Transfer pricing--$35-$40 billion annually: Companies have a \nsignificant \n\n[[Page S53]]\nincentive to minimize their U.S.-based income, and therefore their U.S. \ntaxes. Therefore, they shift income away from the United States and \nshift tax-deductible expenses into the United States. Plain and simple, \nit's cooking the books, shifting costs from one part of the company to \nanother for tax purposes, or transfer pricing.\n  IBM, for example, was fortunate enough to accumulate $25 billion in \nU.S. sales in 1987. That same year, its 1987 annual report stated that \none third of its worldwide profits were earned by its U.S. operations. \nClearly, its U.S. operations appeared profitable and successful. Yet, \nits tax return reported almost no U.S. earnings.\n  A recent study asserts that transfer pricing could cost as much as \n$35 to $40 billion annually. The Multi-State Tax Commission has stated \nthat it is at least a $2 billion a year problem, and that only includes \nforeign-based companies doing business in the United States. And there \nare far more U.S.-based companies with foreign operations than foreign-\nbased companies with U.S. operations.\n  And this is not the result of tax policy that is intended to spur \nU.S. investment. In contrast, it is revenue lost directly as a result \nof multinational companies fixing the books to minimize their U.S. tax \nliability.\n  This is not a new problem with which we are dealing. To the contrary, \nwe have been trying to close this loophole for almost 20 years. Back in \n1978, when we debated the United States-United Kingdom tax treaty, we \nspent a substantial amount of time on this issue. We knew then, as we \nknow now, that it was a loophole that necessitated action. The only \ndifference now is that it is a much bigger problem, more pervasive, and \nmore costly to the Federal Treasury.\n  States have responded to this problem by requiring companies to \nproportion their costs and profits according to employees, payroll, and \nother standards. We can do the same.\n  And even more troubling is the fact that this is not a single \nloophole that exists by itself for multinational corporations. There \nare others, such as tax credits provided to U.S. companies for tax \npayments made to foreign countries by their subsidiaries, or tax \ndeferrals for U.S. companies on income of foreign operations that are \nnot repatriated to this country.\n  Title passage--$16 billion over 7 years: Another tax loophole for \nmultinational corporations is the so-called inventory property sales \nsource rule. Large multinational exporting corporations are able to \nsell goods abroad and avoid U.S. taxes through some fancy footwork \nduring the export process. This provision allows multinational \ncorporations to shift sales to overseas operations, eliminating \ntaxation in this country.\n  This loophole was closed by both the House and the Senate in the 1986 \ntax reform process, but was reopened in conference. Treasury has \nestimated that if we eliminated it altogether, as we tried to do in \n1986, we would generate as much as $16 billion.\n  Let's look at an example. Company X is shipping out some products to \na foreign country. Under normal circumstances, that shipment would pay \ntaxes to the United States. But under a special rule, that company \npasses title to the products out on the high seas, thereby avoiding all \nFederal taxes. This is equivalent to a tax exemption that \ndisproportionately benefits upper income individuals.\n  Some people will say that we are taking steps that will hurt exports \nand the expansion of our markets that can create new jobs for the \neconomy. But we are only closing an unnecessary loophole that is \nprevalent because companies are willing to pass title of property in \nthe middle of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n  Foreign sales corporations--$9.4 billion over 7 years: An additional \ntax break is provided to companies through paper transactions. It is \ncalled the foreign sales corporation loophole, and provides exporters \nwith the opportunity to exempt a portion of their export income from \nU.S. taxation.\n  A company does not have to increase its export activity, increase its \npayroll, or even increase its own production in the United States. It \nonly has to set up a foreign sales corporation on paper. It can then \nexempt up to 30 percent of its export income from taxes. The Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates that the closure of this loophole would raise $9.4 \nbillion in new revenue over the 7-year budget period.\n  Capital gains tax reduction: Whether we agree or disagree about its \nmerits, do any of us really believe that it should be retroactive to \nJanuary 1, 1995?\n  Is that fair? To give new tax breaks to wealthy individuals \nretroactively while we also cut important programs for our working \nfamilies?\n  Billionaires' loophole: We still haven't closed the so-called \nbillionaires' loophole. On April 6, we voted 96-4 to close it up tight, \nand the Senate Finance Committee has closed it twice now. But every \ntime it goes to conference, it gets opened up.\n  This is a tax loophole that exists for billionaires who renounce \ntheir American citizenship to avoid millions and even billions of \ndollars in taxes on income, capital gains, gifts, and estates.\n  The law would not prevent individuals from shifting both their assets \nand their citizenship to a foreign country. Rather, it would just make \nsure that those who have amassed great wealth through the U.S. economic \nsystem pay their fair share of taxes.\n  Last year, approximately 850 individuals renounced their citizenship, \nbut only a handful of those would be affected by this legislation. The \ntax loophole only applies to those with a minimum $600,000 in \nunrealized gains, which generally would necessitate a minimum $5 \nmillion net worth. All those without that level of liability can \nrenounce their citizenship without the IRS ever questioning their \nmotives.\n  This loophole allows an individual to enjoy all the benefits of the \nUnited States, including its stature as an economic engine for the \nworld, grow rich because of it, and then expatriate without being taxed \non the wealth generated in this country. This tax break costs the \ntaxpayers $3.6 billion over 10 years.\n  It is not even a slap on the wrist. It is barely enough to close the \nloophole that permits American billionaires to renounce their \ncitizenship and take up their residency overseas in order to escape \nAmerican taxes.\n  Unbelievable. We passed the amendment here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate by over 90 votes, saying: When you go to the conference on those \nbudgets, pull that Benedict Arnold proposal out of that budget.\n  Those doors were not even closed over there when out it came again, \nright out again. No wonder the President vetoed that particular budget. \nWho wants to be associated with saying to a superwealthy American, \n``Renounce your citizenship and escape all the taxes for the moneys you \nhave earned in the United States''? That provision is still in there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S51-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S53-S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WHO SPEAKS FOR THE TAXPAYER?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief because I have spoken \nearlier. I see there is another Senator wishing to speak. But I would \nlike to respond directly to some of the comments just made with regard \nto taxes. I will hold it down. We are trying to go back and forth.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of complaining about tax cuts in the \nbudget negotiations. I ask the question again, who, here, is going to \nspeak for the taxpayers of America? There are a lot of Americans out \nthere getting up every morning at 5 o'clock, going to work, pulling \ntheir share of the load, paying taxes. They think a little more \nfairness in the Tax Code, a little incentive to save, a little \nincentive for growth in the economy to create jobs is a good idea. \nEverybody around here seems to be worried about this program or that \nprogram, this welfare program, that program. What about the people who \nare paying the taxes on all these programs? Why do they not get a \nlittle help?\n  As I understand it, one of the points that was indirectly referred to \nwas the earned income tax credit. I do not know much about what has \nbeen going on in the budget negotiations at the White House, but I \nunderstand that is one area where they are very close to agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point? \n  \n[[Page S54]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The earned income tax credit program is one that most of us \nhave supported in the past. The problem has been it has exploded, like \nso many Federal programs. Now, I understand, people who have an income \nof up to $30,000 a year are getting a tax credit. We are not saying \neliminate it. We are not saying wipe it out. We are saying control the \nexplosive growth, make sure it is applicable and provided to those who \nare at the low-income, entry level, and not begin to move it on up into \nthe beginnings of middle-income people.\n  Another point, let us talk about the specifics of the tax proposals. \nI have asked this question here on the floor and nobody has really \nresponded to it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask the Senator this question, why is the \nSenator----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why is the Senator so concerned about providing some \noffset for the EITC program, for the increases in the Social Security \nand the excise taxes and other FICA taxes, for families that are making \n$30,000, yet so unwilling to try to provide also some belt tightening \nfor those who are making $400,000? I have not heard the Senator talk \nabout that. I am stunned by his silence. I am sure he is going to \naddress that issue. That is what this is about.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time belongs to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would ask this of the Senator, is he opposed to \neliminating the marriage penalty in the Tax Code? For years we have \ntalked about the unfairness of the marriage penalty. That is one of the \nthings we propose to eliminate, and it is not cheap. It costs a good \nbit of money. Why should a couple living apart pay more when they get \nmarried, under the Tax Code, even though they are making the same \nmoney?\n  Who among us opposes the option of the spousal IRA, the spouse \nworking in the home being able to have an individual retirement \naccount? I do not think anybody is opposed to that. Most of us would \nlike to see the IRA expanded because we would like to encourage \nsavings. When we had the individual retirement account provisions in \nthe 1980's it worked. It encouraged people to save. Part of what is \ngoing on in these negotiations would allow for an expansion of IRA and \nthen allow it to be used for education and for medical purposes. I \nthink those are good ideas.\n  And should we not allow for changes in the estate taxes so people who \nhave small farms and small businesses do not wind up having to sell the \nfarms that have been in their families for years to pay for the estate \ntaxes--how in the world did we ever get in a position of taxing death, \nanyway? I think most American people would like to receive some relief \nthere, whether they are wealthy or poor, frankly.\n  Also, you want to help families, a family of four? How about helping \nthem by allowing them to keep a little of their own money with a tax \ncredit for children? We are trying to encourage and help families with \nchildren provide for their own needs, and not everybody just look to \nthe Federal Government to do it for them.\n  Yes, the capital gains tax rate cut. This is something most people \nwill acknowledge, if it is done properly, will encourage growth in the \neconomy and the creation of jobs. Even the President has said as much. \nHe has said that if other tax provisions can be worked out, and the \nspending disagreements can be worked out, that this is something that \nhe could support.\n  So it is one thing to bash the tax cuts en bloc, but when you take it \napart and look at what is in the package that passed the Congress \noverwhelmingly, there is an awful lot of good in there. I hope it will \nremain in the final package.\n  Maybe the magic number is not 240 or 245, maybe it is less than that. \nBut I think we need to look at the specifics of what we are trying to \ndo and who we are trying to help in the economy. If we need to make \nchanges to make sure it is directed more to the middle-income families, \nfine. I would support that. I think that is the way the talks will \neventually go.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I yield the floor I yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yesterday AT announced they were going to fire 30,000 \npeople. Why in the world would you cut the taxes, in some instances in \nhalf, on the CEO's getting the stock options, who are not on their way \nout the door, and then turn to these fired, these families who have \nbeen fired, and say it is going to be harder for you to get a tuition \nloan to send your son and daughter to college. Or, if they are----\n  Mr. LOTT. It is not going to be harder for them to get a tuition \nloan.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Low-income people, they are not going to get the tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. LOTT. Everybody who wants to go to college will be able to get a \nloan or grant or work-study program or scholarship. They will be able \nto go to college in America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not under the plan you put forward. You are cutting \nback on that.\n  You are having senior citizens finding themselves unable to get \nmedical care and, at the same time you are doing all this, you are \ngoing to give a big tax break.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reclaim my time. If the Senator is going \nto make that kind of statement about what we are going to do, throwing \nsenior citizens off of Medicare, that is just not the case. It is not \nthe intent and it would not be the result.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I think the Senator from Maryland knows that in \nthe alternative budget that has been proposed by the majority in \nCongress, more money is added back for education. Even these direct \nloans are being increased.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on the issue of education?\n  Mr. LOTT. I still maintain, when you look at the Federal programs we \nhave with the NDSL, the Pell grants, the other grants, the myriad of \nprograms to help people who want to go to college, the money is there \nfor people that need it. The only ones who may not be getting enough \nhelp are those in the upper-middle-income category that cannot qualify \nfor the loans or the grants.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask, just on that question----\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why does the Senator, who believes in competition and \nalso in choice, why does he defend the Republican position in insisting \nthat students get their aid and assistance through colleges through the \nguaranteed loan program, which provides, over the period of the next 7 \nyears, a guaranteed profit of between $7 and $9 billion over that \nperiod to the banks in this country, rather than letting the college \nand the student make their choice whether they want that or the direct \nloan program?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let the Government do it. That is always the answer. Let \nthe Federal Government become the lender of first resort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why not let the schools and students choose the loan \nprogram that provides the best services at the lowest cost, rather than \nwriting in, as the Republicans have done, an arbitrary cap on direct \nloans?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reclaim my time to say this. The answer is \nalways let Uncle Sam give the money, direct the money, loan the money. \nI say the private sector can do it and they will do a better job of \ncollecting the loans that are owed than the Federal Government. The \nFederal Government has a terrible record in collecting money that is \nowed on these loans that have been made.\n  I say we should have a greater emphasis on loans, as a matter of \nfact. I have always supported the NDSL Program. But now we are going to \na program that, in my opinion, is going to wind up costing a whole lot \nmore and, for a lot of kids in the future who will need that help, the \nmoney will not be there to help them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have heard some very interesting \ncomments by the Senator from Mississippi, the Senator from Maryland, \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, debating what the provisions of the \nFederal \n\n[[Page S55]]\nbudget should be. Each Senator has his own views. That is a very \nimportant debate. I personally fall on the side of the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Massachusetts, in saying this budget \nproposed by the Republican majority is unfair. It creates too much of a \nburden on middle-income people, on low-income people, and shifts the \nbenefit to the most wealthy. It is just basically unfair. But, Mr. \nPresident, I stand here to address another issue.\n  While we are here debating what the provisions of the Federal budget \nshould be, many--tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of \ninnocent Americans--are suffering because the Government is shut down \nand because innocent Americans, whether they are working for the \nFederal Government or not, are bearing the brunt of this shutdown. It \nis wrong. It is absolutely wrong. We should put people back to work.\n  The burden of this debate should not fall on innocent Americans, and \nit is now falling on innocent Americans because the House majority and \nthe Speaker of the House are in a willful band over there and are not \nletting American Federal employees go back to work.\n  It is a very interesting debate we have heard from the Senator from \nMississippi, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from \nMaryland. It is very interesting. Let us have this debate. Let us work \non the budget. Let us work on the provisions. But, in the meantime, let \nus put Americans back to work, and let us take the burden off of \ninnocent Americans.\n  Today, once again, most of the employees of the Forest Service, the \nBureau of Land Management, the VA hospitals, the State Department, and \nmany other parts of our Government will stay home and the rest will \nwork without pay.\n  Small businesses will go without Government contracts as their rent \nand utility bills are coming due.\n  People on Indian reservations will have to go without heating \nassistance money as a blizzard now sweeps across the Great Plains \nduring the coldest weeks of the year.\n  Gas stations in rural areas that depend on their customers in the \nForest Service will lose more of their business.\n  Families will lose there housing deposits. Why? Because the VA cannot \nprocess home loans.\n  I am here to say that it is an outrage. I spent last Monday walking \ndown Route I-94 through Miles City, close to where you, Mr. President, \nreside. That is the State you represent. I heard from people who do not \nknow how they will pay their heating bills, and others who had counted \non a day snowmobiling in Yellowstone National Park. I have heard the \nsame outrage from people in our State who are unable to go snowmobiling \nin Yellowstone National Park. Excuse my language, but they are mad as \nhell, and they are right to be mad as hell.\n  Listen to a letter I got last week from a fellow who works in the \npark.\n\n       I work here in Yellowstone National park in the fleet \n     Maintenance Division as a mechanic. The job I currently hold \n     has been the best one I've ever held. I've held this \n     permanent position since the 25th of September, 1989. As you \n     very well know, the National Park Service is currently in the \n     middle of the budget crisis. This stalemate has got to stop \n     now, due to the fact that the main concessionaire, TW \n     Recreational Services, has been considering shutting the \n     season down because they cannot maintain the number of \n     employees to wait out this ``Mexican Standoff'' and may have \n     to abandon the rest of the season.\n       Not only that, the gateway communities of the Park are \n     currently losing capital and are trying to survive the lost \n     income all because you people decided to ``flex'' your muscle \n     and keep the National Park Service shut down.\n\n  Now hear an e-mail I received just this morning from a woman who \nworks in Hamilton:\n\n       As a non-tenured, furloughed staff scientist at the Rocky \n     Mountain Labs, NIH, Hamilton Montana, I am feeling this quite \n     acutely, both financially and professionally.\n\n  Or listen to the folks at the Gardiner Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       Gardiner is the north entrance to Yellowstone Park. The \n     economy is almost entirely dependent on visitors to \n     Yellowstone. With Yellowstone closed the last three weeks, \n     the cost to our small community of 1,500 is not less than \n     $1.5 million in private sector gross receipts.\n\n  Mr. President, you heard that right. Since last December, Gardiner \nhas lost $1,000 for every single resident--innocent people, while we \nhere debate. It is wrong.\n  Mr. President, it is an outrage. Whatever one's views on the budget, \nit is wrong and has to stop. It is wrong that innocent people suffer, \nwhether they are furloughed Federal employees or other Americans who \nfeel the brunt of it, while we in the Congress debate the budget.\n  I want to commend our majority leader for doing what is right and \ngetting the Senate to do its part by passing a bill to keep the \nGovernment open. That was a tough decision. He has been roundly \ncriticized for it. But it was the right thing to do.\n  Now it is up to Speaker Gingrich and the House. Up to now, they have \nflat-out refused to do what is right. They have flat-out refused to \ntake the burden off of innocent Americans. They are the holdouts. \nYesterday, they voted to keep hurting the small businesses outside \nYellowstone, keep the people on the Fort Peck Reservation and our other \nreservations waiting for their heating assistance, keep people at home \nor working without pay.\n  Why did they do it? Well, they have ideas that they want the \nPresident to accept on the budget. Maybe they believe they get some \nleverage over the President with this, or think they have some \npolitical advantage when all of this is ended. That might be so. I have \nideas that I would like the President to accept on the budget, too. But \nI am not going to punish innocent people just because I want my views \nadopted.\n  The fact is, you should not do things that you know are wrong. It is \nthat simple. It is the very first moral lesson we learn as children. \nYou should not do things you know are wrong.\n  You should not make families on the Fort Peck Reservation go without \nheating in the coldest part of winter.\n  You should not threaten the jobs of auto mechanics and scientific \nresearchers.\n  You should not threaten to make small businesses close their doors \nbecause they have no money to pay the rent.\n  You should not hurt innocent, hard-working people.\n  So I have come down here to the floor, Mr. President, just to say to \nthe Speaker and to the folks in the House, do what you know is right. \nPass the resolution. Put folks back to work. Take the burden off of \nthem so that we in both Houses of Congress, along with the President, \ncan do the Nation's work and pass the 7-year balanced budget \nresolution.\n  Let us debate the provisions of it, but let us not in the meantime \nput the burden on innocent Americans. Mr. Speaker, and all of the \nRepublicans in the House, I urge you to do what you know is right. Pass \nthe resolution and put the people back to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just a couple of days ago Ellen Goodman \nwrote a very interesting column entitled ``Bootstraps for Middle-Aged \nChildren,'' and she addressed the problem that would confront the \nelderly and their children if the budget is cut according to the \nRepublican budget proposal. She made the point that middle-aged \nchildren may get a small tax cut of less than $1 a day and a nursing \nhome bill of $35,000 a year for their parents if some of these Medicaid \ncuts go through.\n  Actually, the fact is that Medicaid now pays for 60 percent of \nnursing home care. The elderly are required to use up their own assets \nuntil they get down to a level where they qualify for Medicaid. These \nare middle-income people who are, in effect, by their health situation, \nforced to use up their assets in order to meet their medical needs, and \nthen Medicaid covers for them. If Medicaid ceases to do that, the \nburden is going to come back upon their children.\n  I think if people ask themselves carefully, ``Which would you rather \ndo, forego a small tax benefit or keep the protection against the \nextraordinary costs of nursing home care?'' they would want to be \nprotected against the nursing home costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\n\n                      [From the Sun, Jan. 3, 1996]\n\n                  Bootstraps For Middle-Aged Children\n\n                           (By Ellen Goodman)\n\n       Boston.--This one is for Priscilla Parten, the Derry, N.H., \n     woman who had the temerity to ask Lamar Alexander who would \n     care for the elderly if the budget is cut according to the \n     GOP pattern.\n       The answer from the presidential candidate, one of the men \n     hawking their wares across New Hampshire was that ``We're \n     going to have to accept more personal responsibility in our \n     own families for reading to our children and caring for our \n     parents, and that's going to be inconvenient and difficult.''\n       Happy New Year, Priscilla and open up your calendar. \n     Scribble down two rather large words under 1996: Personal \n     Responsibility. They're going to be the watchwords of the \n     1996 campaign.\n       Personal Responsibility is the catchall moral phrase \n     uttered by politicians in favor of removing the guaranteed \n     safety net and parceling the money out in incredibly \n     shrinking block grants to the states. It's the all-purpose \n     ethical disclaimer for those who equate the task of caring \n     for the elderly sick with ``reading to children,'' for those \n     who blithely describe eldercare as ``inconvenient'' or \n     ``difficult'' but character-building.\n       To know what they have in mind, get past the P.R. campaign \n     and go to the fine print of the GOP's Medicaid Transformation \n     Act of 1995. That's the Orwellian title for the bill that \n     would ``transform'' Medicaid by eliminating its guarantee.\n       From the day Medicaid is block-granted, adult children \n     earning more than the national median income--that's $31,000 \n     a year per household--may be held responsible for the bill if \n     their parents are in a nursing home. If they don't pay up, \n     these newly defined Deadbeat Kids may find a lien put on \n     their incomes, their houses, their savings.\n       A secret of the current system is that Medicaid, the health \n     program established for the poor and their children, now pays \n     for 60 percent of nursing-home care. That's because nursing \n     care eats up the assets of elders at a rate of about $35,000 \n     a year until they are indigent.\n       Not surprisingly, the folks calling for Personal \n     Responsibility draw on examples of personal irresponsibility \n     to justify a change that is beginning to make middle-class \n     eyes widen. They point to elderly millionaires who \n     deliberately transfer their assets to the kids in order to go \n     on the dole in nursing homes. They describe deadbeat kids who \n     callously drop their parents at the government door and go \n     off to the Bahamas.\n\n\n                        the ones who will suffer\n\n       But if and when states begin sending bills to the kids, \n     those folks aren't the ones who'll suffer. Thousands of \n     middle-aged ``children'' of the 3 million elders in nursing \n     homes may have to pay for their parents out of their \n     children's education fund and their own retirement savings. \n     Adult children, perhaps elders themselves, may have to choose \n     between nursing sick parents at home or emptying the bank.\n       How neglectful are we, anyway? Despite the bad P.R. we are \n     getting, families do not by and large look to nursing homes \n     for their parents until they are overwhelmed. Elders do not, \n     by and large, go there until they are too ill to be cared for \n     at home. Only one-fifth of the disabled elderly are in \n     nursing homes.\n       Daughters and daughters-in-law provide most of the care of \n     elders and they will shoulder the increased Personal \n     Responsibility at the cost of their jobs, their pensions, \n     their own old age. The daughter of a disabled 88-year-old \n     may, after all, be 66 herself. It is their characters that \n     will be built on deteriorating lives. One politician's social \n     issue is another woman's life.\n       There is enough guilt in every family to trip the \n     responsibility wire, to push the button that says families \n     should take care of their own. As a political slogan, P.R. \n     passes what Dan Yankelovich calls the ``they have a point'' \n     test.\n       But there is an awful lot of Personal Responsibility going \n     around already. As educational loans are cut we are told to \n     be responsible for our own children. As company pensions are \n     fading, we are told to be responsible for our own retirement. \n     At the same time we are to be responsible for disabled \n     parents and even grandparents.\n       Dear Priscilla, when the politicians up there start talking \n     about Personal Responsibility, they mean our responsibility, \n     not theirs. The GOP Congress isn't just trying to balance the \n     budget. They want to end the idea of government as an agent \n     of mutual responsibility.\n       This is what you get in return for a safety net: a pair of \n     bootstraps, a middle-class tax cut of less than a dollar a \n     day and, oh yes, a nursing-home bill of $35,000 a year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S55-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S56-S58]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FEDERAL REGULATION OF WETLANDS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for years, I have tried to reform the way \nour Federal Government protects wetlands. The current system is \nbureaucratic and cumbersome; it is full of delay, waste, and \nuncertainty. I believe that wetlands should be protected. I believe \nthat the Federal Government should continue to have an important role. \nBut clearly, whatever is done to address the outstanding questions \nsurrounding the Federal regulation of wetlands, the system must be \nstreamlined. This is not radical or extreme. It is not even partisan. \nIf one is not an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency or if \none is not a K-Street concrete environmentalist, streamlining makes \nsense. Streamlining is a bipartisan issue. Depending on which day one \ndecides to listen to the President, he believes in streamlining.\n  Senators may remember the National Performance Review to re-invent \nGovernment making Government work better and cost less. We have been \ntold that the administration wants to make the Government user \nfriendly, that it wants to streamline and reduce duplication and waste.\n\n       Our goal is to make the entire Federal Government both less \n     expensive and more efficient, and to change the culture of \n     our national bureaucracy away from complacency and \n     entitlement toward initiative and empowerment. We intend to \n     redesign, to reinvent, to reinvigorate the entire national \n     government.\n\n  This is President Clinton on March 3, 1993. He also said:\n\n       It is time the Federal Government follow the example set by \n     the most innovative State and local leaders and by the many \n     huge private sector companies that have had to go through the \n     same sort of searching reexamination over the last decade, \n     companies that have downsized and streamlined and become more \n     customer-friendly and, as a result, have had much, much more \n     success.\n\n  Apparently, Vice President Gore also believes in streamlining and \nreinventing Government. On that same day, Vice President Gore said:\n\n       It's time we cut the red tape and trimmed the bureaucracy, \n     and it's time we took out of our vocabulary the words, `Well, \n     we've always done it that way.\n\n  The Vice President also requested action from citizens and \npolicymakers.\n\n       Help us get rid of the waste and inefficiency. Help us get \n     rid of unnecessary bureaucracy. Let us know when you spot a \n     problem and tell us when you've got an idea.\n\n  I have spotted a problem and I have an idea. Outside of Washington, \nthis is common sense. The problem is that we have multiple agencies \ndoing the same thing with regard to wetlands. My idea was to eliminate \njust a fraction of the existing redundancy in wetlands regulation. The \nClinton administration already has employees at the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers who have had the lead in making permitting decisions on \nwetlands for 20 years. The Clinton administration also has employees at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency which oversee the same permitting \ndecisions. My idea is that one team of professionals should be enough. \nIf it is not enough, then we have more management problems than a \nNational Performance Review could remedy.\n  I included a provision in the VA-HUD appropriations bill which \nremoves EPA's duplicative authority to veto corps-issued permits. \nAccording to the corps, there is no other Federal regulatory program \nthat gives two Federal agencies decisional authority over the same \nFederal permit of action. The corps has been the lead agency in \nwetlands protection for almost 20 years and it simply cannot be \ndemonstrated that we need to hire one set of bureaucrats to second-\nguess what the first set of bureaucrats is hired to do in the first \nplace. We are here today to balance a budget. To balance a budget, \ntough choices must be made. Eliminating redundant activities is an easy \nchoice. It is common sense. Leave it to the environmental lobbyists to \nargue that we need two or more different Federal agencies conducting \nthe same task--looking over each other's shoulder--adding expense, \nconfusion, delay and frustration for our Nation's citizens.\n  There have been many changes recommended to improve the \nadministration of this important program. This change is the easiest \none. In that sense, I thought the provision should be non-\ncontroversial. In fact, no Senator offered an amendment on the floor to \naddress this provision. It was not challenged in the House. Hearings \nhave been held in both the House and the Senate. The House-passed \nreauthorization of the Clean Water Act removes this duplicative \nauthority. The bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate to reform the \nwetlands regulatory program removes this authority.\n  Knowing of the Clinton's administration's efforts to streamline \nGovernment, I was surprised to learn in the President's veto message \nthat this provision is one of the reasons for the \n\n[[Page S57]]\nPresident vetoing the bill that funds Federal employees at EPA, the \nVeteran's Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and others. \nNot even rank and file people at the EPA could think this is a very \ngood reason for the President to prevent their funding bill from \nbecoming law. This is truly an astonishing notion put forth by the \nPresident. He is saying, in effect, I don't trust the people who I \nhired and the people who work for me at the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers to protect wetlands and to obey the law so I want to make \nsure I have another agency of people who I hired and who work for me to \nkeep an eye on them.\n\n  Mr. President, for me, this issue is a flashback to another \nstreamlining provision I proposed in the 102d and 103rd Congress. \nSeveral years ago, a farmer in St. Louis County came to my office with \na real problem. He had some wet places of ground on his land and he had \nfour different agencies coming out to that land telling him different \nthings. I sent representatives out. The four agencies could not agree. \nThey had swampbuster, they had section 404 regulations in hand. We got \ntwo different opinions on the particular wetlands problems and the \nagencies could not agree.\n  I had a modest suggestion and introduced legislation to make the Soil \nConservation Service the lead agency responsible for technical \ndeterminations about wetlands on agricultural lands. After several \nyears passed, I offered this proposal as an amendment on May 4, 1993, \nto S. 171, the Department of the Environment bill to elevate the EPA to \nCabinet level. The administration opposed that idea also--at least \ninitially. The opposition dug out all the same bogeymen, ghosts, and \ngoblins. I was actually told that this amendment would make things more \ncomplicated--not less--if SCS was the lead agency. I was told this was \nthe wrong vehicle and that the amendment would make wetlands regulation \nmore expensive. The bipartisan amendment failed 40-54. Eight months \nlater, the administration adopted this idea administratively and said \nthey were glad they thought of it. In the interagency press release, \nthey noted:\n\n       The agreement eliminates this duplication of effort and \n     gives the farmer one wetland determination from the Federal \n     Government. Farmers can now rely on a single wetland \n     determination by the Soil Conservation Services.\n\n  Interior Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks George \nT. Frampton, Jr., said:\n\n       This agreement represents a common sense approach to \n     administering wetlands programs affecting our Nation's \n     farmers. We are minimizing duplication of effort.\n\n  For this administration, it is a fine line between extremism and \ncommon sense. I would hope that another change of heart could be in \norder but I fear that the pressure from environmental lobbyists may be \ntoo great.\n  During Senate hearings, EPA argued repeatedly that they never use the \nauthority so we shouldn't care about them having it. I will argue that \nif they never use it, then why have it? I would like to know why the \nadministration desperately needs an authority that has only been used \n11 times in the last 20 years as tens of thousands of permit decisions \nwere made. Is the President trying to say, well, yes, we agree that the \nEPA has not officially objected to corps decisions 99.9978 percent of \nthe time, but we can never be too careful. We have so much extra money \nand so many people looking for work at EPA, that we better have them \nready for that eventuality that occurs .0022 percent of the time.\n  The other argument that is used is that we would have the corps \npermitting themselves for their own activities. As Senators know, the \ncorps does not actually issue itself section 404 permits but does \nfollow all of the steps involved in the permitting process. Every other \nexisting internal and external decision safeguard is affected by my \nlegislative provision. The corps must meet the public interest review \nwhich requires the careful weighing of all public interest factors. Mr. \nPresident, listen to the list of criteria to be considered under the \npublic interest review:\n\n       All factors which may be relevant to the proposal must be \n     considered including the cumulative effects thereof: among \n     those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general \n     environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish \n     and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land \n     use shore erosion, etc.\n\n  Additional criteria the corps are bound to follow are found in the \nsection 404(b)(1) guidelines developed by the EPA. EPA retains its \n404(q) authority, known as elevation authority, which allows the EPA \nand the Department of Commerce and the Interior to request higher level \nreview within the Department of the Army. Individual State permitting \nand water quality certification requirements provide an additional form \nof objective safeguard to the corps regulatory program. Section 401 of \nthe Clean Water Act requires State certification or waiver of \ncertification prior to issuance of a section 404 permit--effectively \ngiving States veto authority.\n  In addition to these requirements, the corps' implementing \nregulations require that district engineers conduct additional \nevaluations on applications with potential for having an effect on a \nvariety of special interests such as Indian reservation lands, historic \nproperties, endangered species, and wild and scenic rivers. The corps \nmust satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act requirements during \nthe permit process and permit decisions are subject to legal \nchallenges. EPA also has lead enforcement authority. One final \nsafeguard is provided by my fellow Senators. The great majority of \ncorps projects are authorized by Congress. I believe this Congress has \nthe understanding and concern to put the brakes on bad projects--\nenvironmental lobbyists and EPA wetlands experts are not the only \npeople who understand and are willing to protect valuable wetlands.\n  As anyone can see, the cries from the environmental lobby are a red \nherring. There remains lots of bureaucracy and lots of redundancy for \nthose who cherish it. In this case, they are crying wolf. My provision \nwill do nothing to harm wetlands. Under my provision, if a wetland is \nor is not permitted, it will be because of an official decision made by \nan official of the Clinton administration.\n  What is this about? It is a plain old-fashioned bureaucratic turf \nfight. EPA bureaucrats have power and they don't want to surrender any \nof it. They have good working relationships with environmental \nlobbyists who don't want to see their access reduced. I have no doubt \nthat EPA employees work very hard and have expertise in wetlands \nissues, but I am simply saying that the corps does, too, and one agency \nis enough. I expect bureaucrats to fight to protect power and to \nprotect turf. What I do not expect, however, is their political \nleadership to provide them cover for doing so. Is the President here to \ncreate a government that works better and costs less or is he here to \nprotect bureaucratic turf and the regulatory status quo. Unfortunately, \nthe bureaucrats whose turf the President is protecting are currently at \nhome because the President vetoed their funding bill--in part, and \nastonishingly, over this common-sense issue.\n  Mr. President, there was a New York Times article printed in the \nRecord on December 14 [S18650] that discusses this issue. I ask \nunammious consent that my response to that letter be printed in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nWall Street Journal op-ed piece entitled ``Death of a Family Farm,'' \ndetailing an abuse of wetlands regulations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 1995.\n     Ms. Kris Wells,\n     Editor, Letters to the Editor, The New York Times, New York, \n         N.Y.\n       Dear Ms. Wells: The December 12, 1995, story entitled \n     ``Brief Clause in Bill Would Curb U.S. Power to Protect \n     Wetlands'' is a very catchy headline, but grossly inaccurate. \n     As the article accurately notes, the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have \n     dual decisional authority in permitting activities in \n     wetlands. According to the Corps of Engineers, no other \n     program maintains this dual decisional authority over the \n     same permit or action.\n       In the spending measure I crafted for Veterans Affairs, \n     Housing and Urban Development and the EPA, I included a \n     provision that eliminates this dual authority by removing \n     EPA's authority to veto permits the Corps has issued. \n     Therefore, the provision would indeed curb one and only one \n     of the many ``EPA'' powers to protect wetlands, but it \n     certainly does not curb ``U.S.'' power to protect wetlands \n     unless you think the \n\n[[Page S58]]\n     ``U.S.'' Army Corps of Engineers in not a federal agency. Additionally, \n     these two agencies just happen to report to the same boss/es; \n     ie., the President, Office of Management and Budget, the \n     Counsel on Environmental Quality and the Vice President, who \n     is a self-proclaimed advocate for the environment.\n       There are many things this government can no longer afford, \n     and on the top of that list is bureaucratic redundancy. Leave \n     it to the environmentalists to argue that we need two or more \n     different federal agencies conducting the same task--looking \n     over each other's shoulder--adding expense, confusion, delay \n     and frustration. The bottom line on this issue and on the \n     projects that were mentioned in the article is this: if a \n     wetland is or is not permitted, it will be because of an \n     official decision rendered by officials of the Clinton \n     Administration. If people in the environmental community do \n     not feel that the Clinton Administration has hired aggressive \n     enough regulators, then they should take it up with the \n     Clinton Administration and quit crying wolf about a common-\n     sense provision to streamline government--a goal that the \n     President has repeatedly endorsed.\n       As Vice-President Gore said on March 3, 1993: ``It's time \n     we cut the red tape and trimmed the bureaucracy, and it's \n     time we took out of our vocabulary the words, `Well, we've \n     always done it that way.' . . . Help us get rid of the waste \n     and inefficiency. Help us get rid of the unnecessary \n     bureaucracy. Let us know when you spot a problem and tell us \n     when you've got an idea.'' Don't bother telling the \n     environmental activists and lobbyists when you've got an \n     idea. Which conservative ever called such dug-in-defenders of \n     the status quo liberals?\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher S. Bond.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                         Death of a Family Farm\n\n                          (By Jonathan Tolman)\n\n       ``My mother lives in Cranston. There aren't any wetlands \n     there.'' This was the incredulous statement of a co-worker \n     when I tried to explain to her the plight of the Stamp farm. \n     Bill Stamp, president of the Rhode Island Farm Bureau, and \n     his wife Carol own one of the few farms left in the state. \n     But due to federal regulations, their farm is slated to close \n     at the first of the year.\n       The Stamps' troubles all started when the city of Cranston, \n     R.I., rezoned their property from agricultural to industrial. \n     For years, Cranston had been trying to get the Stamps to \n     develop their property. To give them an added incentive, the \n     city decided to raise their taxes to the industrial bracket \n     in1983.\n       In order to pay the higher taxes and keep their farming \n     operation alive, the Stamps decided to develop part of the \n     property at Cranston and move their farm to another part of \n     the state. Their first encounter with wetlands happened three \n     years later after they built a road on part of their \n     property. The Stamps had already received permits from both \n     the city and the state to proceed with the road when the Army \n     Corps of Engineers decided to get involved.\n       Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, before anyone can \n     deposit dredged or fill material into a ``navigable water'' \n     of the U.S., they must get a permit from the Army Corps of \n     Engineers. Over the years, with the legal prodding of \n     environmentalists and a string of court cases, the Corps has \n     expanded its definition of ``navigable water'' to include \n     areas you wouldn't normally expect to see boats, namely \n     wetlands.\n       Identifying wetlands is a difficult business. As the Corps \n     pointed out in one of its recent press releases, ``Wetlands \n     don't have to have visible water.'' Because of the tricky \n     nature of wetland identification, in 1987 the Corps developed \n     a 150-page manual filled with flow charts, appendices and \n     guidelines for identifying wetlands.\n       Upon learning about the road, the Corps told the Stamps, \n     ``Since a Federal permit has not been issued for the work you \n     are presently performing, you are hereby ordered to cease and \n     desist from any further work within Corps jurisdiction.'' In \n     order to continue, the Stamps had to apply for a permit for \n     the road they had already built. The Corps denied the permit, \n     and demanded that the road be removed. In addition, the Corps \n     demanded that the Stamps also remove the water and sewer \n     lines which had been placed on their property. The Corps \n     refused to consider any additional permits until the Stamps \n     complied with their demands.\n       Realizing the mess they were in, the Stamps hired an expert \n     consultant to help them with their wetland problems. After \n     surveying the area with the Corps' own manual, the consultant \n     came to the conclusion that the area where the Stamps built \n     their road wasn't even a wetland. Just to be sure, he brought \n     in two other wetland and soil scientists to look at the area. \n     In a letter to Mr. Stamp, one of the experts, a dean at the \n     University of Rhode Island, wrote: ``The delineation of \n     wetlands on that portion of your property is obviously in \n     error.'' The other consultant, a former New York State \n     soil scientist, concluded, ``Since the soils would not \n     qualify as hydric soils, the area would not be a wetland \n     under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdiction.''\n       Yet when the Corps was asked to reevaluate the site, it \n     refused. The consultant, feeling that the Stamps had been \n     wronged, wrote the Washington headquarters of the Corps and \n     asked for a re-evaluation. The Acting Assistant Secretary of \n     the Army. G. Edward Dickey, refused, ``because the Corps is a \n     decentralized agency, the divisions and districts are \n     responsible for most permit decisions and other related \n     regulatory decisions, including delineations.'' (Perhaps \n     someone should tell the secretary of the Army that he is now \n     in charge of a ``decentralized agency.'')\n       Now, after the Stamps have spent thousands to restore the \n     ``wetland,'' as well as having paid $15,000 in fines, \n     thousands of dollars in legal fees and a lot more in \n     increased property taxes, the original permits from the state \n     of Rhode Island have expired. Unless the state can come \n     through with new permits in the next few weeks, the Stamps \n     will be unable either to sell or develop their land, and \n     their financiers will likely foreclose on their farm in \n     January.\n       Some might argue that in order to protect our nation's \n     fragile wetlands, some errors and unfortunate incidents will \n     happen, but in the long run it will be worth the price. The \n     problem with this reasoning is that the 404 program doesn't \n     really protect wetlands. Although the unwitting can get \n     caught in the regulatory morass of the 404 program, savvy \n     developers are aware of myriad exemptions, such as a rule \n     that if the Corps does not respond within 30 days of being \n     notified about a construction project of less than 10 acres, \n     the developer can proceed with the project.\n       Because of such loopholes it is not surprising that many \n     environmentalists detest the 404 program almost as much as \n     landowners. An article published last spring in Audubon \n     magazine described the 404 program as ``a hoax perpetrated \n     and perpetuated by a wasteful, bloated bureaucracy that is \n     efficient only at finding ways to shirk its obligations and \n     that when beaten on by developers, spews wetland destruction \n     permits as if it were a pinata.'' The environmentalists' \n     argument isn't just liberal griping. Recent data from a \n     nationwide survey of wetlands, conducted by the U.S. \n     Agriculture Department, suggests that even though wetland \n     regulation has increased in the last decade, wetland losses \n     to development have not slowed. Even more ironic is that \n     despite the continued loss of wetlands to development, a host \n     of non-regulatory, incentive-based programs have restored so \n     many wetlands that this year the U.S. will gain more wetlands \n     than it lost.\n       Recently, Sen. John Chafee (R. R.I.), chairman of the \n     Environment and Public Works Committee, announced plans to \n     consider the re-authorization of the Clean Water Act, \n     including the 404 program. The senator has the power to \n     eliminate a program that both landowners and \n     environmentalists agree is a bloated, wasteful bureaucracy. \n     Maybe he can do it before another farm in his home state goes \n     belly up.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are many ways in which we can reform \nthis program. We can do so in a bipartisan way. We can do so in a way \nthat cuts redtape and offers new incentives for wetlands protection. We \ncan do so in a way that includes more respect for those who currently \nprotect wetlands--private property owners. We can bring rationality to \nthe program and turn an important program into a more effective and \nmaybe--maybe--even a more popular program. In the process, we might \neven give the States a greater role. In my State, I know we have \nofficials who understand and care just as much about wetlands as the \nfolks who work here in Washington. I am hopeful that these issues can \nbe addressed. In the meantime, this legislative provision is an \nimportant start toward removing duplicative redtape and an important \ntest for the President to see if he is so wed to the regulatory status \nquo, that he would reject this commonsense reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S56-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S58]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Accordingly, Mr. President, I have \nthe honor to propose as first-in-the-field, a remarkable triple-\nhyphenated safe bet and sure winner from the new year's day editorial \nof the Washington Post entitled, appropriately enough, ``The New \nYear.'' The editorial looked back to its predecessor 50 years ago, when \nthe Post editorial writer of that age, contemplating the end of the \nSecond World War, pondered whether the United Nations might now bring \npeace on Earth. This year's editorial comments, ``That sort of world-\nfederal-ish talk seems almost quaint today.'' Indeed, it does. Cord \nMeyer apart, there are not likely to be as many as half a dozen \nAmericans alive who remember the World Federalists and their \nunflinching attachment to world government. That, of course, is just \nthe role editorials play in our lives; to remind us of forgotten \nfancies and dashed dreams, lest we become too much impressed with the \nwonders of our own age.\n  Mr. President, I can report that Mr. Safire, interviewed by telephone \nin his posh Washington offices, readily concurred that ``world-federal-\nish'' was definitely an early starter for this year's pol-lexigraphic \nrace, adding that it might prove a watershed compound and go on to win \na triple crown.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have come for the first time to a \ndisturbing conviction. That conviction is that I do not believe this \nbudget process is going to succeed. I am beginning to believe that any \namount of negotiating in the future is not going to result in \nagreement. I have come to this point because 44 days after the \nPresident said he agreed that we should enact a balanced budget, \nnothing has happened, and I am not sure that negotiating and bargaining \nis being done in any way that would fulfill that commitment.\n  The President, first of all, has not demonstrated any history of \nsupporting or proposing a balanced budget and has yet to put a balanced \nbudget as scored by the agency that he insisted it be scored by, on the \ntable.\n  He has vetoed the only real budget that has come before his desk, and \neven now, today, January 4, as I said, 44 days after he agreed to enact \na balanced budget, he has yet to propose a balanced budget. President \nClinton has now proposed four budgets, none of which has produced a \nbalance. The third so-called balanced budget he proposed was scored by \nthe Congressional Budget Office as $200 billion per year over balance \nas far as the eye could see, and then his fourth budget only managed to \nreduce the deficits to $100 billion a year for every year ad infinitum.\n  Not one Member of the Senate, Republican or Democrat, has voted for \nthe President's budget. In one vote, it was defeated 96 to nothing, in \nanother 99 to nothing. So this is just not Republican rhetoric. This is \na unanimous rejection of the President's attempts to balance the budget \nby all Republicans and all Democrats in the Senate.\n  So for anybody who is under the illusion that the President has \nproposed a balanced budget with honest numbers, no one in this body, \nRepublican or Democrat, agrees to that.\n  It seems to me, third, that at every stage of the negotiations the \nPresident has purposely tried to distract the Nation's attention from a \nbalanced budget.\n  First, he talked about the number of years it would take to balance \nthe budget and finally agreed, under duress I think, that 7 years would \nbe the right number. But he was quoted as saying, and I quote again, \n``[As President] I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.'' \nHe said that on Larry King in June.\n  And then in July, he said, ``But I do not believe it is good policy, \nbased on my understanding of this budget--which is pretty good, now--to \ndo it in 7 years.'' That he said in a Rose Garden ceremony in July.\n  Then he said, well, I think we ought to ``balance the budget in 10 \nyears. It took decades to run up the deficit, it's going to take a \ndecade to wipe it out.'' That was during his Presidential address to \nthe Nation.\n  Then he used the scoring issue, that is, determining whether or not \nthe numbers were real, as a distraction. He challenged us--and I sat \nover at the House of Representatives during his State of the Union \nAddress--when he said, ``Let's at least argue about the same set of \nnumbers so the American people will think we are shooting straight with \nthem.'' That was in his address before a joint session of Congress on \nadministration goals in February 1993.\n  And so we accepted that challenge, and we said we will agree, Mr. \nPresident; let us use the agency that you want to use. That is the \nCongressional Budget Office. And then we argued back and forth, back \nand forth, and the President said, well, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, I do not agree with them. I wish to use my own numbers.\n  For nearly 9 months he was able to distract the press, the Congress, \nand the American people from the real issue of balancing the budget by \nfocusing the debate on how long it ought to take, on what numbers we \nought to use. So he--I have to give him credit--he masterfully \nmaneuvered and shifted the debate for month after month after month \nwhen the real issue was balancing the budget.\n  The President's attitude is particularly destructive because we are \nat a unique moment in recent history. We have the opportunity to pass a \nreal balanced budget, interestingly enough, at a time when the \ndifferences between us are not that great. We have a chance to \nnegotiate because really we are quite close. A number of Democrats have \nworked with Republicans in trying to put together an alternative budget \n\n\n[[Page S60]]\nthat would reach balance, and the number differences really are not \nthat far apart.\n  The differences between the Republican budget and the President's \nonly amounts to 2 percent of the entire budget. Even on the most \ndivisive issues, those issues of Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare \nreform, we are quite close.\n  On the most contentious issue of all, Medicare, both the President \nand the First Lady have essentially stated that they would do more to \nslow the rate of growth than what the Republicans have done. In 1993 \nthe President said:\n\n       . . . Medicare and Medicaid are going up at three times the \n     rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times \n     the rate of inflation. This is not a Medicare and Medicaid \n     cut.\n\n  The First Lady in 1993 said:\n\n       We are talking about beginning to reduce the rate of \n     increase . . . in the Medicare from about 11 percent . . . \n     increase annually to about 6 or 7 percent increase annually.\n\n  So what the Republicans have done in their budget is exactly what \nboth the President and the First Lady had indicated that we ought to \ndo. And yet now it is politically turned to the fact that the \nRepublicans are trying to cut when it is not a cut. We are trying to do \nwhat they suggested.\n  My point is, not necessarily that the President is playing politics \nwith this, although clearly he is, my point is that we are not far \napart at all.\n  I think we need to understand also that this partial shutdown of \nGovernment could be solved overnight if the President had simply signed \nthe appropriations bills that were sent to him. He chose to veto the \nInterior appropriations, the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations, \nand the VA-HUD appropriations bills. Those hundreds of thousands of \nworkers, Federal workers that are not now working that we hear about \nevery day at drumbeat out of the White House could all be at work if \nthe President had just signed the bills that we sent to him.\n\n  What is discouraging, Mr. President, is that we have come so close \nfor a result so important and that the remaining differences between us \nare narrow. But it seems to me that the President is willing to \nsacrifice perhaps one of the most important things the U.S. Congress \ncould do in this decade if not this century. We are sacrificing that, \nthe demands of history for the demands of politics.\n  Look, this game cannot continue indefinitely. We have to end this \npolitical posturing. I think we have a moral obligation to do so. I am \nconvinced that we should set some kind of firm deadline and prove once \nand for all if the President has any intention of supporting a balanced \nbudget. That deadline ought to be set in weeks, not months.\n  If the President refuses to negotiate in good faith to reach that \nagreement and do what he said he would do, that is, put a budget on the \ntable that actually balanced, if he is not willing to do this, then I \nthink we should end this politically motivated pretense that is going \non.\n  It would then become an issue to be decided in the 1996 elections. \nVoters would be presented with a very clear choice: The status quo, \ncontinue the Government growing as it has, leave it the same, that \nGovernment needs to do more, keep spending, keep taxing, or change the \nfundamental direction and course of Government and achieve a balanced \nbudget.\n  If we do that, we can pass appropriations bills that produce enough \nsavings to ensure that we can still reach a balanced budget in 7 years \nduring this interim period between the time we cut off negotiations and \nthe election of 1996.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that it is time for the games and the \npolitics and the distractions to end. There is one issue, and one issue \nonly that we must decide: Will we fulfill the promise of this unique \nmoment in passing a balanced Federal budget? All the rest can be \nnegotiated if both sides negotiate in good faith. If the President \nrefuses to do so, as he has done to this moment, then the question will \nneed to be put to the American people--is it enough for a President to \ntalk about a balanced budget or do we need a President who will \nactually agree to a balanced budget?\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time I have remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S59-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S60-S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HOW LONG UNTIL SOME MEMBERS IN CONGRESS COME TO THEIR SENSES?\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, when I was a young man the Governor of \nTennessee, the then-Governor of Tennessee, Frank Clement, delivered the \nkeynote address at the Democratic national convention. As I matured and \nstudied speeches like that, I decided it was not quite as great as I \nthought it was at the time. But the thrust of the speech was, ``How \nlong, America?'' And he kept coming back to that recurring theme. ``How \nlong, oh, how long, America?'' In other words, how long are we going to \nwait for solutions to these problems?\n  That would be a good speech to give today, how long the American \npeople are going to have to wait until some people in this body, but \nespecially in the House, come to their senses.\n  This morning we had a group of Social Security workers come into our \nLittle Rock office. I was out at the time. My legislative director \nsuggested that they call the Speaker of the House. He told them he \nwould be happy to give them the names of the 73 freshmen Congressman \nover there, their telephone numbers, and reminded them that the Senate \nhad voted to do precisely what should be done, thanks to the courage of \nthe majority leader.\n  The majority leader probably is not interested in having a Democrat \ncompliment him for what he did because I am sure he is taking \nunbelievable flak from some quarters in his own party. That goes with \nthe leadership. If you are not willing to stand up for what you \nbelieve, you do not deserve to be called a leader. If you do not stand \nup for responsible Government, you do not deserve to be here.\n  We have a saying in Arkansas when something is really out of the \nordinary. We say, ``I have been to two State fairs and a goat rope, and \nI never seen anything like this before.'' I can tell you, I have never \nseen anything like this before. I pray to God we never see anything \nlike it again, because if the checks and balances of the Constitution \ncan be circumscribed and circumvented by a simple hard-core majority \nwho are willing to stick together, and most of whom distrust \nGovernment, strongly distrust Government, the next question you have to \nask yourself is, if people are willing to abuse their power by \ncircumventing the Constitution in a way that was never intended by \nMadison and the other Framers, how long can we continue to govern \nourselves? That is a very legitimate question that you are going to \nhear asked more and more if this is not resolved shortly.\n  The American people are divided to some extent. They do not \nunderstand it. But I can tell you, each day that goes on they become \nincreasingly apprehensive about just what is going on, what is the \nmeaning of it. They are not Federal employees, and so they are not very \nperturbed about it. But as they see their lives disrupted, as \neverybody's lives are going to be, if this goes on much longer, they \nare going to acclimate themselves and attune themselves to what is \ngoing on here.\n  We should not for one moment forget what is the overriding issue \nhere. There is a minor constitutional crisis that could loom very large \nin the future; there is, obviously, a tremendous political battle going \non, and that is where the American people really do not understand why \nwe would subject this country to this for political reasons.\n  But we should not ever forget one simple fact: All we have to do is \nwhat the Senate did the night before last and pass a continuing \nresolution and get Government up and running. It has nothing to do--it \nhas nothing to do--with the discussions going on at the White House. \nYou can resolve every single issue that is at stake here without \nsending 250,000 workers home and others with half paychecks and scaring \nthe pants off a lot of American citizens.\n  The tax cut is one of the issues. That is not an unsurmountable \nproblem. I cannot tell you how I detest the thought of that $245 \nbillion tax cut, and every time I look at the statistics on who gets \nthat $245 billion, I am literally stunned that every newspaper in \n\n[[Page S61]]\nthe country is not editorializing on it every single day.\n  Think about it. The people who make less than $30,000 a year get \nvirtually not one dime of it, and if you make $300,000 a year, you are \ngoing to get over $8,000 a year in tax cuts. What kind of a nation \npasses tax bills like that?\n  Let me go back. That is based on a CBO assumption that the budget \nwill be balanced in the year 2002, and by doing so, interest rates will \ndecline to the point that over a 7-year period, we will save $245 \nbillion. I can tell you that is a massive assumption, one that I can \nalmost guarantee you will never come about.\n  In order for that to come true, every single projection of growth \nrate, interest rates, and unemployment which the Congressional Budget \nOffice puts out would have to come true, literally true--every one of \nthose things.\n  It also means that next year and the next year and the next year, \nthrough 7 years, Congress will do precisely what was projected in this \n1995 budget resolution. We will not even do what the budget resolution \ndoes in 1996. I can bet you we will not do it. We certainly are not \ngoing to do it every year between now and the year 2002. You are going \nto have tornadoes in my State, you are going to have floods in the \nMidwest, you are going to have hurricanes in Florida, you are going to \nhave droughts throughout the Midwest, and we are going to pick up the \ntab for every bit of it. None of that is anticipated in the budget \nresolution.\n  But for purposes of argument, because the President did, in fact, \ncome out with his own tax cut, not nearly as massive as this one, but \nwhy not say to the Republicans: ``You're hot for a $245 billion tax \ncut. You want to spend all of $245 billion the Congressional Budget \nOffice says you are going to save over the next 7 years. We do not \nbelieve that. Not only do we disagree strongly on who would get the tax \nbenefits, we do not think those savings will ever materialize. But to \nprove our good faith, why don't we do this? Let's wait until the budget \nfor 1998 comes up before we get into this tax-cutting business. If all \nCBO's projections have come true, interest rates are as low as they \nprojected, all the other economic indices are the way they projected \nthem and the savings are materializing, then say, `OK, we'll accept a \n$200 tax refund for all the children in America,' and if it goes \naccording to Hoyle for 2 more years, up it to $400.''\n  Why would that not be a simple solution to it? After all, once you \nput that tax cut in place, if this place falls apart and the dome of \nthe Capitol falls to the ground, you will not be able to take that tax \ncut away. You are going to be spending the money for a tax cut that you \ndo not have, because we will never undo it. So why do it, unless you \nknow the savings are going to be there?\n  I heard the majority whip say this morning that this President is the \nfirst President that ever wanted more money. He never heard of anybody \nvetoing a bill because they wanted more money. I remind the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Ronald Reagan used to go around saying, ``I'm being \naccused for these massive deficits, and you know I can't spend a penny \nthat Congress doesn't appropriate.''\n  To the ordinary layman out there, that is fine, because the people \nalways liked the President better than Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, we were to go into recess. \nThe Senator is recognized for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. While he was saying, ``I can't spend a penny that \nCongress doesn't appropriate,'' he was never vetoing any money bills. \nHe signed everything we sent him, and the people should be grateful, \nbecause while he was President, Congress appropriated billions less \nthan he asked for. But he vetoed a defense bill because it was not high \nenough, and we had to give him more money to get him to sign the bill.\n  Mr. President, the American people last fall were angry about a host \nof things. There was no one single thing that people were angry about. \nThere were a whole host of things they were angry about. It is an \ninteresting thing, you take 1 percent of the vote last fall and shift 1 \npercent of the vote here, here and there, and we would not have \nanything bordering on an American revolution.\n\n  As far as the bonded Contract With America, so far two things have \npassed both Houses and have been signed by the President, and both of \nthem would probably have been passed without the so-called Contract \nWith America.\n  People were not voting for the Contract With America, because they \ndid not know anything about it. They were voting because they were \nangry. They were angry about the deficit, they were angry about gays in \nthe military, they were angry about some Members getting in trouble. It \nwas a whole host of things.\n  But I can tell you, Mr. President, the one thing they were not voting \nfor was chaos. So far, that is all they have gotten out of it.\n  The other day I mentioned James Baldwin, a great black author, who \nwrote a book called ``Go Tell It on the Mountain.'' In the book--it was \nsort of autobiographical, I guess--the person who was the central \ncharacter in the book was obviously James Baldwin.\n  He described the churches when he was a youngster and how people \nwould have dinner on the grounds after church. Senator Heflin, and \nsoutherners like Senator Heflin and I know what that is like. He has \nbeen to a thousand dinners on the grounds after church on Sundays, just \nas I have.\n  James Baldwin describes in the book listening to some of the black \npreachers talk about how many souls they had saved in the last revival, \nhow many souls they had saved in the last year, and this youngster who \nwanted to be a preacher was offended by the way they talked about how \nmany souls they had saved, not as individual people who were actually \nsaved but macro numbers, and he took a vow that never would he take the \ngift of God so lightly.\n  As you might guess, as you go on into the book, he becomes a \nminister, and the first thing you know, he is one of the big stars at \nthe dinner on the grounds after the church services, and he is talking \nabout how many souls you save, as he said originally, as though you \nwere talking about ears of corn being lopped off the stalk. Yes, he \nfell into it, too. It was a magnificent novel. I recommend it to you. \nHere we talk about 250,000 employees, which is a big number. Do you \nknow what they are? They are red-blooded human beings with families, \nwith obligations. Some of them are losing their credit rating right now \nbecause they cannot pay their bills. They, each one, count.\n\n  When people sometimes ask me how I would sum up our democracy and the \nConstitution of the United States--which is sacred to me--I always say \nthe Constitution of the United States says one thing. Well, it does not \nsay it, but it means one thing and, that is, each one of us counts. Our \ncriminal justice system, our whole legal system, all of our freedoms in \nthe Constitution say each one of us counts, and each one of these \n250,000 people who are suffering count. I know how nice it is to go \ninto a coffee shop. ``It has not hurt me any.'' ``I have not lost a \nthing.'' ``It looks to me like we can probably do without those 250,000 \nfrom now on.'' You let this go on another 2 weeks and see what they are \nsaying in the coffee shops.\n  So, Mr. President, these are human beings, and they are depending on \nCongress to do the right thing, to govern and not abuse their power. \nWhat is the cost of this? Why are the American people not up in arms \nabout this? They say $45 million a day. I do not know who computed \nthat, but add $12 million to that as of Sunday night. The 10-percent \nairline costs--do you want to take a guess what revenues that produces \nto the U.S. Government every year? Between $4 and $5 billion. We are \nlosing $12 million a day. Add that to the $45 million, and then you \ntake the loss of revenues of the communities who are dependent on \nGovernment, national parks, and so on. You are going to be at $100 \nmillion a day, while we continue to negotiate and bargain and bicker \nabout sums much, much smaller than that. It is the height of \nirresponsibility to hold this country hostage in order to get your way. \nIt is an outrageous abuse of power. I do not mind saying, in a partisan \nway, that I believe a lot of people are going to pay for this come next \nNovember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. \n  \n[[Page S62]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the situation in the Senate now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair indicates to the Senator that we are \nacting on a unanimous-consent request that the Senate go into recess \nsubject to the call of the Chair immediately after the remarks of the \nSenator from Arkansas, and those have just finished.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity this \nmorning to speak because I had to be elsewhere, which you might \nsuspect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a quorum call for 5 minutes \nafter which I be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes and then the \nSenate recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator can ask \nunanimous consent to speak or put in a quorum call and then state that \nrequest, and the Chair would consider that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The quorum call needs to run before I make the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will withhold for a moment, is the \nSenator prepared to proceed now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I need that 5 minutes that I was seeking.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Nunn would also seek 10 minutes. Why do we not \ntake a quorum call and then see if we can work that out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have been in the chair listening for \nsome time, and I wanted to make a couple of observations. First of all, \nI agree thoroughly with Senator Dole and the Members of this body in \nseeking to have a resolution which would put the Government back in \nplace. It seems to me that that is what we should do. We ought to have \na limited CR in which there is time to proceed with what I hope are \nuseful negotiations that are going on. We need to put this thing behind \nus and get on with resolving the problems.\n  There are, however, I think, a couple of other things that we also \nought to be able to expect. One is that the White House and the \nPresident should deliver what they said they would. We did this on \nNovember 19, I believe. We had an agreement that we would have a CR, \nthat during that time there would be a balanced budget based on CBO \nnumbers, over 7 years. It did not happen. That did not happen. Then we \nhad an opportunity--the White House did--to pass appropriations bills, \nto put almost all those back to work who are now furloughed. They did \nnot do that. He vetoed it.\n  Mr. President, there is another difficulty that we have had in \nWyoming. It has to do with Yellowstone Park. There was an article in \nthe paper this morning about it. Our Governor sought to negotiate with \nthe Secretary of the Interior so that the State would take \nresponsibility for part of Yellowstone Park. There was no real effort \non the part of the Secretary to do that. Promise to return calls, \npromise to do something to consider a proposition by the State, did not \ndo that. So not only are the employees of the National Park Service in \nthis case not working, but neither are the concessionaires, neither are \nthose who had contracted to do work, because the Department of Interior \ndid not, frankly, make the real effort to do anything about that. So \nthere has to be some responsibility assigned there in terms of doing \nwhat we said we would do.\n\n  Second, Mr. President, it seems to me that those who are doing the \nnegotiating, if they really wanted to find a solution, if there was a \nreal, honest-to-goodness effort on the part of the parties to find a \nsolution, they could do that. It is time to do that.\n  Frankly, I suggest that the three principles sit down, the President, \nthe majority leader, and the Speaker of the House--eliminate all the \nobservers, eliminate the staff--and come to some agreement, come to the \nsnubbing post on what we ought to do. There is a lot of leeway within \nthis outline, and we can do that. Mr. President, that is our job.\n  Our job is to find solutions. That is what we are here for. That is \nwhy we are the trustees for the American people. Our job is to keep the \nGovernment functioning in as effective way as we know how. Our job is \nto make decisions and to move forward. We have great opportunities to \ndo that, great opportunities in this place to do that. There are \nopportunities in the White House.\n  There is not much point in assigning blame, but there is plenty to go \naround. We ought to come to the snubbing post and make some decisions. \nI yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the \nprevious order, I be recognized to speak for not more than 10 minutes, \nSenator Nunn be recognized thereafter for up to 15 minutes, and \nfollowing those remarks, I ask that the Senate stand in recess subject \nto the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S62-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S62-S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CURRENT SITUATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there has been a rather lengthy \ndiscussion this morning about the continuing resolution and the status \nof our public employees. I very much wanted to be here this morning to \ntalk about it, but obviously I had some other things I had to do as we \nseek to get a balanced budget.\n\n  I thought I might take just a few minutes and talk about the fact \nthat the situation that we are in today is the result of both the \nPresident of the United States and the Congress of the United States \nhaving certain rights and certain responsibilities. In a sense, it is a \ntwo-way street, not a one-way street like everybody has been talking \nabout, including the President, who used the words ``cynical strategy'' \nto talk about the Republican Congress, albeit he chose to say it was \nthe Republican House rather than both of us. ``Cynical strategy'' \nseemed to indicate that the entire blame for where we are today should \nbe borne by the U.S. House Republicans, or a combination of the House \nRepublicans and the Senate Republicans.\n  Mr. President, and fellow Americans, that is not true. Let me state \nwhat Republicans have done and what I perceive that the President has \nnot done that put us in this situation that we are in today. Before I \nbegin that, I would like very much to state once again that I hope we \ncan resolve the issue of Federal employees who have not been paid and \nwho have been relying upon their paychecks while they work without pay \nor relying upon them because we promise to pay them. I think we ought \nto solve that issue and solve it quickly. They are not responsible for \nthe problem.\n  Having said that, Republicans in both Houses produced a balanced \nbudget using real numbers and using the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates. We already did that. The President of the United States, in \nhis capacity as the Chief Executive, chose to veto that. \n\n[[Page S63]]\n Had that been signed, obviously we would not be in this mess.\n  I am not standing here saying the President has no prerogative to \nveto that. He vetoed it. Nonetheless, we had already passed many of the \nappropriations bills, and the President got on television yesterday and \nenumerated a whole series of things that were situations where either \npeople are suffering because we have not passed certain appropriations \nbills, or the Government cannot do certain things like issue visas, so \nmany foreigners cannot get in the country. And the President is \ncritical of the Congress--in particular, the Republicans in the House--\nbecause he says they are to blame for this.\n  Let me remind the American people this is a two-way street. Had the \nPresident of the United States signed three bills which he vetoed--\nCommerce, State, Justice; Interior appropriations; VA-HUD \nappropriations--many of the long list and litany of things that have \ngone wrong in America would not have gone wrong. They would have been \ntaken care of by these bills.\n\n  Now, there are some who took to the floor this morning and said the \nPresident has this absolute right to veto but Congress has no rights; \nthey must respond and either give him what he wants or suffer the \nconsequences of partial closure of Government. Not so. No student of \nour Constitution is going to tell you that. When he vetoes them, he \nbears some responsibility for vetoing them. We certainly have a \nresponsibility to say, well, if he vetoed them, try something else and \nsee if we can get through this.\n  I understand that is being tried and some targeted appropriations are \nbeing worked on. I hope it works. I hope the President understands the \nnext time we send him something that is targeted that he does not have \nthe absolute right to veto them and then claim it is our responsibility \nbecause the Government is closed. We have a right to stand up and say, \n``Mr. President, these are tough times. We do not agree on a lot of \nthings, but you do not have the absolute immunity to veto bills and \nblame us because the Government is closed.''\n  You might have to look at the next Interior bill. Mr. President, \nthere was not very much money involved in that Interior bill. Frankly, \nyou got some bad advice on the Interior bill, yet you get up and talk \nabout cynicism when most of those U.S. monuments, the museums, would \nhave all been opened if you had signed that bill. You look at your \nlist, Mr. President, of why you vetoed it--pretty flimsy stuff. If you \nhave some responsibility in this, then the public ought to look at why \nyou vetoed them and what were your reasons.\n  Let me also suggest that the President used some very, very \nstrained--strained--words when he spoke of cynical strategy. I am \nworking in good faith with this President to try to get a balanced \nbudget, but I believe he and his entire administration have been \nengaged in a cynical strategy since June of this year when they \nproduced a budget allegedly in balance that did not use the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers and economics but used their own, \nconcocted by their on economists, by their own OMB personnel, and have \nnever to this day produced a balanced budget using the Congressional \nBudget Office numbers. That is a strategy. It is a beautiful strategy. \nSince the word ``cynical'' is battered around, it is a cynical strategy \nbecause never to this day--while blaming Republicans for all kinds of \nthings--never to this day has the President of the United States had to \nput a balanced budget on the table. We are negotiating with him and he \nstill has never put one on. He has not put it on in the negotiations. \nAnd I am breaching nothing there, everybody understands he has not. He \ndid not when we asked him to, and he signed a continuing resolution \nthat said we would be bound by the Congressional Budget Office \neconomics and numbers, and the conclusion on that is that means the \nfinal agreement will be judged that way, not that I have to produce \none. Is that not interesting?\n\n  So, to this date, no balanced budget in 7 years using the CBO numbers \nhas been produced by this White House, by this President, by his \nCabinet. And they are now engaged in blaming this whole episode on \nRepublicans.\n  At least it is a two-way street from here to Pennsylvania Avenue, and \nwhen Presidents veto bills that fund Government, they take a bit of the \nresponsibility of what will happen if Congress chooses not to fund some \nof those. After all, I do not advocate this, but the truth of the \nmatter is the Constitution is eminently clear. Congress has the purse \nstrings of the U.S. Government. We decide how to spend the taxpayers' \nmoney, and that is not a shared responsibility, I regret to say. That \nis a singular responsibility, and we have been choosing not to fund \nwhat the President wants.\n  We are also trying to get a balanced budget, which the President \neither does not want or wants something different on. These are \ndifficult political and philosophical times. What is at stake is big. \nFor some of us what is at stake is whether future generations have to \npay for our bills or whether we will pay for them ourselves.\n  So, whenever we have stories about things going wrong because \nGovernment is closed, none of us like that. But the big reason for all \nthis, it all starts because Republicans have come to the conclusion \nthat we want to live up to our commitment to use real numbers, no phony \nnumbers, use Congressional Budget Office numbers and produce \nsignificant change in Government so as to produce a balanced budget.\n  So I wish I could have done this earlier in the day, but I think I \nhave made my case. I think I have made my case that the reason we are \nin this mess is not just because Republicans have not sent bills to the \nPresident to fund Government; the President bears some of the blame, \nand I have elaborated that as best I could here today. It is a two-way \nstreet, and bantering around words like cynicism, and a cynical \nstrategy, deserves a response. Or it is not too far-fetched to conclude \nthat their strategy in the White House has been a cynical strategy of \nrather significant proportions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have made it clear in previous remarks and \nother public statements that I oppose shutting down portions of the \nFederal Government as a tactic in the budget debate. I have supported \nthe continuing resolutions that would restore funding for full \nGovernment operations as we continue to move toward the objective of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Dole, Senator Daschle, and others \nin this body who have concluded that the current situation is \nartificially created, it is unnecessary and is a wasteful burden on \nFederal workers and on the taxpayers they serve.\n  Mr. President, I recall here over the last 20 years, several debates \non holidays, whether we ought to add another holiday to the overall \nholidays the Federal Government observes. I remember people totaling up \nthe amount of money it costs to have one holiday and projecting that \nover 20 years and talking about the astounding cost when you pay people \nfor a holiday. If anyone stops and thinks about what we are doing now, \nI believe we are about on day No. 20--there may be a few more days in \nthat counting the previous shutdown--we really have had 20 to 25 \nadditional holidays this year where the taxpayers of this country are \npaying for people who want to work but who are not allowed to work, but \nthey are \n\n[[Page S64]]\ngoing to be paid. And that is, to me, a real paradox, as to how you \npossibly can start off a quest to save $1.2 trillion over 7 years by \ndeclaring over 20 paid holidays for workers.\n  And then, it is not only the workers themselves--it is unfair to them \nbecause they want to work, they are not getting paid now, and that is a \nhardship--but also it is terribly unfair to literally hundreds of \nthousands and growing to be millions of Americans who are suffering \nbecause of this shutdown.\n  Mr. President, there are many examples of the harm being done by the \nshutdown. One example which has not drawn much attention is the fact \nthat the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC in \nAtlanta, GA, is virtually shut down. Today is the 50th year of \noperation of the Communicable Disease Center, and it is effectively \nclosed. Except for a skeleton staff, no personnel are available to \nfulfill the functions of the CDC.\n  This is bound to have an impact on the health and safety of the \nAmerican people and, indeed, citizens around the world. The workers at \nthe CDC are the same Federal workers who pinpointed the cause of \nLegionnaire's disease and toxic shock syndrome. These are the same men \nand women who risked their lives to investigate the recent outbreak of \nebola and track the course of influenza, AIDS, and TB across the Nation \nand indeed the world. Their job is to investigate, to define, to \nmonitor and to prevent disease--to get out in front of emerging \ninfectious diseases, food and waterborne diseases, respiratory \ninspections, birth defects, lead poisoning, air pollution, radiation, \nand other environmental health emergencies.\n  The problem in this area is you do not know it is an emergency if you \nare not out in front of it before it is too late. We will be lucky if \nwe get by with this shutdown and closedown of the CDC without having \nsome serious problem and erosion in the health of the American people.\n  In some cases, the CDC implements control measures during a critical \ntime when minutes and even seconds count. Rarely a week passes by \nwithout the CDC directing the Nation's attention to important new \nresearch findings on public health issues. At this point, we do not \nknow what public health crisis will emerge in 1996. With a CDC \nshutdown, we do not know what might be happening right now. What we do \nknow is that the CDC plays a critical role in watching for signs and \nsustaining sophisticated surveillance and monitoring communications \nwith medical health officers in our Nation and throughout the world. We \ndo not know the impact of the Government shutdown on the health of the \nU.S. citizens. We may not know it until it is too late.\n  Like other Federal employees, the people in CDC are deeply dedicated, \nhard-working persons, scientists, physicians, and public health \nprofessionals. Some even risk their lives to investigate outbreaks of \nunknown, sometimes even deadly diseases. These people are protecting \nthe Nation's health and they are anxious to return to their jobs.\n  In addition, the CDC personnel who are not at work, who would \notherwise be there, they would be providing critical funding for \ntechnical assistance to State and local programs for sexually \ntransmitted diseases, TB, HIV, childhood immunization, environmental \nhealth, national and international chronic and infectious disease \nprevention, breast and cervical cancer. We all need to recognize they \nare not on the job.\n  Mr. President, diseases, viruses, bacterial infections, and cancers \ndo not stop because of a Government furlough or a partisan political \nand budget debate.\n  CDC grants to State health agencies to fund prevention programs that \nare fundamental to saving lives and maintaining the health of our \npopulation are also being affected adversely. Programs in 20 States for \nrape prevention are in danger, and funds for staffing hotlines for \npublic health emergencies, such as violence, STDs, and HIV, may halt \noperations. All of this is in great risk.\n  We cannot afford to wait to open the doors at the CDC. The health of \nthe Nation and the world could be at stake.\n  I urge our colleagues in the House to think again about the tactics \nthey are using. They are trying to get the budget balanced, and that is \na goal that all of us should work toward. And I hope we can achieve \nthat. But the tactics being used are totally counterproductive to the \ntaxpayers and to the country and to the health of our citizens. We must \nnot continue to hold hostage the health and safety of American citizens \nwho are paying for a service that is not being rendered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S63-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S64-S65]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BUDGET DILEMMA--A TWO-WAY STREET\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, my friend from New Mexico talked about the \nrights of the Congress regarding the purse strings, and the rights of \nthe President regarding the veto. And he emphasized that this is a two-\nway street. I agree that the budget dilemma, the budget challenge, the \neffort to balance the 7-year budget, is indeed a two-way street. The \nAmerican people should hold all of us accountable for that.\n  But this continuing tactic to keep the Government closed down is not \na two-way street. There are a group of people who believe--I think \nerroneously so--that it gives them leverage. In effect they are saying \nthat the President should care more about the health of the American \npeople, about the workers out there, than the Congress does. Otherwise, \nwhy is it leverage? Is it leverage for you to hold somebody hostage if \nboth have an equal stake in returning that innocent victim without \nbeing harmed? If it is not leverage, then why do it? If it is leverage, \nthat means that the Congress does not have an interest in the workers \nand does not have an interest in the people who are being affected in \nthis country, and indeed abroad.\n  Mr. President, I do not understand any logic behind the House \nRepublicans' position. And I again am gratified that the leadership of \nthe Senate on both sides of the aisle recognize that this is \ncounterproductive, and recognize that the wrong people are being held \nhostage in this high-level game of Russian roulette.\n  Mr. President, one closing thought again in response to the thoughts \nvoiced by my good friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici.\n  This effort to get the budget under control is indeed a two-way \nstreet. As I think we have set forth in the Chafee group composed of \nabout 10 Democrats and about 10 Republicans, there is no reason the \nparties cannot come together. It is not easy. It is not something that \ncan be done in an or hour or two hours but over a 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-day \nperiod should be able to be done.\n  I do not think there is any question about the responsibility of \nkeeping the Government closed. That is a tactical decision made by \nHouse Republicans. But all of us are involved in the effort to try to \nget the budget under control. It is very clear what has to be done. The \nadministration and Democrats have to be willing to save more on \nentitlements, to restrain the growth of entitlements more than has thus \nfar been indicated. Republicans have to be willing to come down some on \nwhat they are doing in terms of the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid which \nare too severe. That is very apparent.\n  It is also apparent that both the Republicans and the White House \nneed to take another thorough look at tax cuts. It is to me almost \nunbelievable that we can be starting a quest to get the budget under \ncontrol by declaring a very large dividend at the very beginning before \nwe have implemented anything. That is what large tax cuts do. So I am \nhoping that the tax cuts will come down, and that the Republicans will \nagree to that.\n  I am hoping that those of us on the Democratic side will recognize \nthat we have to restrain the entitlement growth. That is the heart of \nwhat has to be done. It is apparent for all of us to see. There are a \nlot of complexities in doing it. But we will have to make those \nmovements.\n  In the final analysis, there is a right of the President to veto, and \nthere is a right of Congress not to appropriate. There also is a right \nof the American people to say, ``We have had enough; a plague on both \nyour houses. We send people to Washington to be able to reach \nreasonable compromises to govern this Nation effectively and both \npolitical parties are failing at that task.''\n  At some point the American people are going to come to that \nconclusion, \n\n[[Page S65]]\nand they are going to come to the conclusion that both parties are to \nblame. I hope everyone recognizes that because that day, if it has not \nalready arrived, is fast approaching.\n  I believe it is up to all of us to put aside some of the harsh and \nunreasonable rhetoric and some of the incivility that has gone into \nthis debate and to recognize we all have an obligation to the American \npeople and to our children and grandchildren to get this Nation's \nfiscal house in order and to do it in a responsible way, a way that \nwill not be looked back on in a year or two as an absolute march of \nfolly but a way that is fair and effective for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S64-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S65]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADM. ARLEIGH A. BURKE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today a grateful Nation pays its final \ntribute to a true patriot and hero, Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, who died on \nMonday at the age of 94.\n  Admiral Burke will be buried on the grounds of the Naval Academy in \nAnnapolis, where he graduated in 1923. His service to the Nation will \nserve as a model to Academy graduates as well as all members of the \nArmed Forces for generations to come.\n  Admiral Burke said he was attracted to the Navy because, in his \nwords, the rules were ``strict, known and observed.'' His adherence to \nthe rules was a matter of personal honor, not bureaucratic timidity. \nWhen it came to strategy and tactics, he was a bold innovator. During \nWorld War II, he initiated dramatic changes in naval doctrine, \ndeveloping and implementing tactics relying on the speed and \nmaneuverability to destroyers armed with torpedoes to undertake \noffensive operations.\n  Admiral Burke's Destroyer Squadron 23, known as the ``Little \nBeavers'' compiled an outstanding combat record in the Pacific in 1943, \nwhich earned him the Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Cross, and \nthe Legion of Merit. During the assaults on Bougainville and Buka in \nthe Solomon Islands, he made two dramatic high speed runs, crippling \nJapanese airfields and sinking a large number of Japanese vessels. \nReflecting the speed and daring of these maneuvers, Adm. William F. \nHalsey gave him the nickname ``Thirty-One Knot Burke'' after Burke sent \na message to American transports announcing: ``Stand aside! Stand \naside! I'm coming through at 31 knots.'' A Presidential Unit Citation \npraised the squadron's ``daring defiance of repeated attacks by hostile \ngroups'' and its attacks on the ``enemy's strongly fortified shores to \ncarry out sustained bombardments against Japanese coastal defenses and \nrender effective cover and fire support for * * * major invasion \noperations * * *.''\n  Subsequently he helped plan the invasions of Iwo Jima, Guam, the \nMarianas, and Okinawa. At Okinawa, the ship on which he was serving was \nhit by kamikaze suicide planes, and he was awarded the Silver Star for \nrescuing sailors trapped in a compartment by smoke and fire resulting \nfrom the attack.\n  After the war, he served in the office of the Chief of Naval \nOperations, where he produced an influential report emphasizing the \nvital role of the Navy in the post-war national security establishment. \nAlthough the inter-service rivalries of the period nearly cost him \npromotion to the grade of admiral, President Truman recognized his \nskills and character and he was promoted.\n  During the Korean war, Admiral Burke served as commander of a cruiser \ndivision and as a member of the Military Armistice Commission. In 1955, \nhe was appointed by President Eisenhower and confirmed by the Senate as \nChief of Naval Operations, a position he filled for an unprecedented \nthree terms. He played a key role in the development of antisubmarine \ntechnology, the Polaris submarine, and strengthening allied navies.\n  President Kennedy offered him the opportunity to serve a fourth term \nas CNO, but Admiral Burke declined so that the Navy could have younger \nleadership. After retiring from the Navy, he helped to establish and \nlead the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which has \nprovided numerous influential studies on national security matters. He \nalso served as president of the Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts \nof America. In January 1977, Admiral Burke was awarded the Nation's \nhighest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom, by President Ford. The \nNavy's Arleigh Burke class is named in his honor. When the lead ship, \nthe Arleigh Burke, was commissioned in 1991, he gave the crew a simple, \ndirect message reflecting his belief in providing the Navy with the \nbest equipment and hard training: ``This ship is built to fight,'' he \nsaid. ``You'd better know how.'' It is most fitting that the crew of \nthe lead ship, the Arleigh Burke, will be present to honor him today.\n  The current Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Boorda, summed up \nAdmiral Burke's career when he said: ``Admiral Arleigh Burke defined \nwhat it means to be a naval officer: relentless in combat, resourceful \nin command and revered by his crews. He was a sailor's sailor.''\n  I wish to express my condolences to his wife of 72 years, Roberta \n``Bobbie'' Gorsuch Burke, and to express my appreciation for his \ndevoted service to our Nation.\n  I think we can indeed say--all of us can say--that he followed \nmilitary affairs, and that Admiral Burke, in Admiral Boorda's words \nindeed ``* * * defined what it means to be a naval officer: relentless \nin combat, resourceful in command and revered by his crews.'' He was, \nindeed, ``a sailor's sailor.''\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the time, and I will yield \nback any I have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S65-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S65]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow, like other Members of Congress, I \nwill receive a paycheck for the last 2 weeks. In good conscience, \nhowever, I cannot use this money while thousands of Federal Government \nemployees are denied their paychecks because Congress refuses to reopen \nthe Government. Until this Government shutdown ends, I will be putting \nthe amount of my paycheck into escrow.\n  As a matter of principle, Members of Congress should be treated the \nsame as all Federal employees. I work for the people of Vermont, \nincluding the hard-working Federal workers who are being punished by \nthis Government shutdown. If the Federal workers in my home State \ncannot receive a paycheck, then I will not receive a paycheck.\n  I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of Senator Boxer's no budget-no \npay bill which would stop the pay of Members of Congress during a \nGovernment shutdown. The Senate has passed this legislation three \nseparate times, but the leadership of the House of Representatives \nrefuses to bring the bill to a vote. I would also note that the Senate \nhas passed legislation to put people back to work. The distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, introduced a continuing resolution which \npassed to that effect. But that has been rejected by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I urge the House Speaker and my other colleagues in the House and \nSenate to also give up their paychecks until Congress ends this foolish \nGovernment shutdown. Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans are all \naccepting their pay while Federal workers are working without pay or \nforced to stay home without pay. In fact, at least one Member of the \nother body said he would accept his pay ``because he is in the \nConstitution,'' although I do not find his name in my copy of the \nConstitution. I believe it is the height of arrogance for them to \naccept it. In fact, they even accepted travel money \n\n[[Page S66]]\nfrom the taxpayers to go home for a Christmas vacation.\n  If the Speaker and his followers would also give up their pay as I \nam, I believe the House would quickly vote to reopen the Government. \nMaybe if they went without pay for a while, they would find out what it \nis like when you are working but not getting paid. They would learn \nthat the bills keep coming even though the paychecks do not, which is \nwhat thousands of Federal workers in Vermont and throughout the country \nare now finding out.\n  My family is no different than any of the other hundreds of Vermont \nfamilies that are going to miss that paycheck because of this shutdown. \nI will not enjoy my pay if they cannot enjoy theirs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S65-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 46. A joint resolution making further continuing \nappropriations for the fiscal year 1996 for the operations of the \nPassport Office of the Department of State; to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n\n\n               passport office continuing appropriations\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the 20th day of an \nuntenable situation. Large parts of the \n\n[[Page S67]]\nFederal Government are closed. Spending authority is suspended for 9 \nCabinet departments and 38 agencies, commissions, and boards, which \nhave responded by closing virtually all functions.\n  Prior to 1982, the Federal Government had never closed. This is now \nthe 12th closing in 14 years. Recall that the British arrived in \nWashington in 1814. They burnt the White House. They burnt the Capitol. \nWe still did not close down the Federal Government. In the 1930's, in \nthe midst of the worst depression we have ever had, we kept the Federal \nGovernment open. We now have an army in the Balkans. They deserve a \nbetter example.\n  One critical service forced to close is the Passport Office of the \nDepartment of State. Last night, the Senate passed a continuing \nresolution attached to H.R. 1643 and the majority leader's back-to-work \nbill, S. 1508. Both of these measures would reopen our passport \noffices. But, apparently, the House may balk at approving these \neminently reasonable and logical measures. Accordingly, I rise to \nintroduce legislation to reopen the Passport Office. Last year 5.3 \nmillion Americans applied for passports. This year the agency expects a \nrecord 5.6 million applications. Today, the Washington Post reports \nthat the Government closing has created a backlog of 200,000 passport \napplications. This is no way to begin a record-breaking year at the \nPassport Office.\n  Speaking of the backlog of passport applications is perhaps too \ncallous. All of these applications were submitted by citizens who \nexpect that the Federal Government will provide them with a passport so \nthey can travel to other countries to conduct business, study, visit \nfamily and friends, and vacation. Two hundred and fifty constituents \nhave contacted my office seeking assistance; however, the passport \noffice will only issue passports in cases considered life or death \nemergencies. One man was unable to attend his daughter's wedding in \nLondon because his passport had expired and could not be renewed. \nAnother who is employed abroad fears losing his job if he cannot get \nhis passport renewed. For years, we badgered the Soviet Union to grant \nmore passports to its citizens. Now we are denying them to our own.\n  Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights, ratified by the U.S. Senate on April 2, 1992, recognizes that \n``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.'' \nThis is a binding international obligation of the United States, yet we \nhave now taken action which violates that covenant.\n  A 1- or 2-day delay might be considered a nuisance. For this to \ncontinue for 3 weeks leads to incalculable waste, as people are forced \nto cancel plans and seek refunds for reservations. This is not just. \nClosing passport offices and other large swaths of the Federal \nGovernment erodes the confidence of all Americans, disrupts the lives \nof those who rely on Government services, and discourages Federal \nworkers. Clearly we have entered an Orwellian realm in which employees \nare paid not to work so that negotiations to save money can continue.\n  The Founders of our Nation were astute students of government. They \nsearched history to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various \npolitical systems as they debated and later formed our own Government. \nThey perceived how government power is derived from the consent of the \ngoverned. They perceived how government power is derived from the \nconsent of the governed. In the Declaration of Independence they reveal \ntheir insights:\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever \n     any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it \n     is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to \n     institute new Government, . . . Prudence, indeed, will \n     dictate that Governments long established should not be \n     changed for light and transient Causes;\n\n  Governance is a covenant between the people and their leaders. \nPerhaps not since secession has that covenant been so trampled. The \nclosing of the Government ought never have begun. Now we should end it \nwithout further delay. At a minimum, we should reopen our passport \noffices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S66-9", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 912\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Rockefeller] was added as a cosponsor of S. 912, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to the \neligibility of veterans for mortgage revenue bond financing, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1453\n\n  At the request of Mr. Burns, the name of the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1453, a bill to prohibit the \nregulation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs of any activities of sponsors or \nsponsorship programs connected with, or any advertising used or \npurchased by, the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association, its agents or \naffiliates, or any other professional rodeo association, and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S67-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S67-S70]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n            THE ROAD TO MOUNT RUSHMORE IS A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, Mount Rushmore, set in the heart \nof the Black Hills National Forest, was created as a shrine to \nAmerica's democracy. As a powerful American symbol, it is the jewel of \nthe National Park System. Like all other units of the National Park \nSystem, Mount Rushmore was forced to close as part of the Government \nshutdown on December 15, 1995.\n  However, thanks to the extraordinary dedication of one man, Mount \nRushmore will remain illuminated for all to see during this dark period \npreceding fiscal responsibility. Mr. Art Oakes has graciously donated \nfunds to ensure that the monument is able to remain lit for the more \nthan 2 million visitors it receives each year.\n  I share with all Americans the frustration that the Federal \nGovernment remains partially shut down. It is clear that Americans want \na balanced budget and are willing to shoulder the burden to get it \ndone.\n  Mr. Oakes has shown us just how dedicated Americans are to a balanced \nbudget. He is willing to give up his own hard-earned money to help \nMount Rushmore through this shutdown crisis. He recognizes that Mount \nRushmore is not just a park, but a symbol of what America represents--\nboth to other Americans and to tourists from overseas.\n  Today, my wife Harriet and I would like to show our support for Mr. \nOakes' efforts by donating $200 for continuing the nightly illumination \nof the Mount Rushmore monument.\n  As many of you may know, Mount Rushmore was designed in 1927 by \nGutzon Borglum, the son of Danish immigrants. The monument is a shrine \nof American Presidential heroes: George Washington, Father of the \nNation; Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence; \nTheodore Roosevelt, conservationist and trustbuster; and Abraham \nLincoln, the Great Emancipator and preserver of the Union.\n  More than 65 years later, Mount Rushmore is still one of the most \npowerful symbols of America. It represents the freedom of democracy, \nthe melting pot country which offers the hope of a better life. Yet how \ncan we continue to promise a better life if our President refuses to \nagree on a plan to balance the budget?\n  We need a balanced budget. The American people want and deserve an \nend to shamelessly wasteful spending programs. Washington must operate \nunder a budget where we live within our means--as people in my home \nState of South Dakota do every day.\n  I feel passionately that we must give the dream of America--\nrepresented by Mount Rushmore--back to our children. We can do that \nonly if Bill Clinton agrees on a balanced budget. I want the National \nPark Service and the rest of the Federal Government back at work and \nfully functioning. This will happen if Bill Clinton agrees on a \nbalanced budget. It is that simple. Bill Clinton should stop stalling \nand start leading. He should support our goal of a balanced \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO CONGRESSMAN KWEISI MFUME\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join with \nthe citizens of Baltimore and Maryland in expressing warmest \ncongratulations to Congressman Kweisi Mfume upon his appointment as \npresident and chief executive of the NAACP. Those of us privileged to \nhave worked closely with Congressman Mfume are convinced that the \nNAACP, the African-American community, and all Americans of goodwill \nwill be well served by this appointment. It is an inspired choice.\n  Kweisi Mfume's accomplishments compellingly demonstrate the quality, \nstrength, and determination of his character. Against great odds, \nCongressman Mfume overcame what would be considered for most people \ninsurmountable obstacles in shaping his life and career. In his first \nelected office, he established an outstanding record for public service \nas a member of the City Council of Baltimore. This was followed by \nservice in the U.S. House of Representatives where as chair of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, he led that group with exceptional \neffectiveness and vision.\n  It is very encouraging that the NAACP Board of Trustees has called \nupon Congressman Mfume's leadership at such a critical time in the \nhistory of the organization and of the civil rights struggle. He brings \nto this demanding responsibility unique dimensions of perception and \nexperience. His long-time grassroots involvement has equipped him with \na special understanding of needs of individuals and community groups, \nwhile his proven and tested national leadership gives him a unique \nknowledge of the realities and demands of the public and private \nsectors. These insights and experiences will greatly benefit the NAACP.\n  Congressman Mfume's appointment further solidifies the historic and \nproductive relationship between Baltimore and the NAACP, whose national \nheadquarters is located in our city. He follows in the footsteps of \nother distinguished Baltimoreans who were critical to civil rights \nprogress: the late, great Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who \nled the relentless effort which finally brought down the legal \nstructure of segregation; Clarence Mitchell, Jr., the NAACP's chief \nWashington lobbyist, whose legislative genius was critical to the \npassage of every landmark piece of civil rights legislation and, Dr. \nLilly Jackson and Ms. Enolia MacMillan, two courageous leaders of \nMaryland's NAACP who inspired their counterparts throughout America.\n  Congressman Mfume's presence will be deeply missed in the Congress. \nBut, like another esteemed colleague, former Representative William \nGray, now the President of the United Negro College Fund, he is \ncontinuing the struggle for justice and equality in a newer arena.\n  I salute the NAACP for this outstanding appointment and pledge to \ncontinue working with its members and new leader in the continuing \nstruggle for an America which provides opportunity and fairness for all \nits citizens. I ask to have printed in the Record several articles from \nthe Baltimore Afro-American, the Baltimore Jewish Times, the Baltimore \nSun, the New York Times, and the Washington Post describing the \nachievements and life of this extraordinary man and the great \nchallenges which lie ahead for him.\n  The articles follow:\n\n           [From the Baltimore Afro-American, Dec. 16, 1995]\n\n                         New Hope at the NAACP\n\n       It borders on the ironic that after a nationwide and \n     lengthy search to find a new leader for the much beleaguered \n     NAACP, the right candidate--and some would say the perfect \n     candidate--came from the same city where the association has \n     its headquarters--Baltimore.\n       In selecting Rep. Kweisi Mfume as its President/CEO the \n     NAACP--to use an apt description--has struck oil. Rarely has \n     the naming of an individual to such high profile position \n     been greeted with such an unanimous chorus of approval, from \n     the President of the United States, to the man and woman in \n     the street.\n       If ever things were meant to be, then probably it was meant \n     to be that Mr. Mfume would be called upon to resurrect the \n     nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, and \n     that he would respond at the cost of giving up a seat in the \n     U.S. Congress to which he could have been reelected as long \n     as he wished.\n       A more qualified candidate--and here we are not simply \n     talking about what appears on paper but what's inside--would \n     be most difficult to find. It is as if the man and the job \n     were waiting for each other.\n       There are the challenges ahead for Mr. Mfume of eliminating \n     the $3 million plus debt, rebuilding staff, redefining the \n     role of the NAACP, rebuilding bridges of understanding that \n     his immediate predecessors destroyed, and above all, \n     restoring the faith of people in the NAACP.\n       This is a tall order, but we believe Mr. Mfume is the right \n     person, in the right place, at the right time, to fill it.\n       He can not do this however, unless the African American \n     people, who have always been the rock on which the NAACP \n     stood, rally now to its support.\n       Either through donations, or memberships, or a combination \n     of both, it is imperative that all of us join Mr. Mfume in a \n     grand and glorious campaign to set matters right at the \n     NAACP.\n       Without it, we would indeed be in dire straits.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Baltimore Jewish Times, Dec. 15, 1995]\n\n                          Mfume's Advancement\n\n       Rep. Kweisi Mfume's decision last week to leave Congress \n     and assume the leadership of the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People is an important development for \n     a black community that needs strong and farsighted leadership \n     to fight the unprecedented attack on the civil rights \n     advances of the past half-century now underway in Washington. \n     It also is welcome news for a Jewish community that remains \n     concerned about the decay of our cities, and rising signs of \n     black anti-Semitism.\n       Rep. Mfume's story--his rise from a life on the streets and \n     the kinds of social problems that have become epidemic in our \n     cities--is legend in Baltimore. And he has become, as \n     described by Baltimore Jewish Council Executive Director \n     Arthur C. Abramson ``a strong and supportive friend of the \n     Jewish community.'' (See ``A Friend, In Deed,'' on Page 22.)\n       His tenure as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus was \n     not without controversy; it was Rep. Mfume, after all, who \n     suggested a ``covenant'' between the influential \n     congressional group and Nation of Islam leader Louis \n     Farrakhan. But he also helped give the caucus a new \n     prominence and ability to help shape the national agenda.\n       These are discouraging times in Congress--for Democrats and \n     black legislators, in particular. The civil rights agenda is \n     under assault; important social programs that have helped \n     keep stabilize cities despite growing poverty and growing \n     despair are being decimated.\n       Rep. Mfume faced an extraordinary choice; stay in a safe \n     congressional seat, and fight from within to head off the \n     most sweeping Republican cuts--or work to rebuild an \n     organization that was once the towering giant of the civil \n     rights movement, but which has failed to adjust to the harsh \n     realities of the 1990s.\n       Rep.

Harris and Michael A. Fletcher)\n\n       In choosing Rep. Kweisi Mfume as its new leader, the NAACP \n     reached out to a former street fighter and seasoned \n     politician to take on a daunting array of internal and \n     external challenges facing the historic civil rights \n     organization.\n       NAACP officials hope Mfume (D-Md.), who was named president \n     and chief executive officer Saturday, can bridge the divide \n     between blacks and whites, battle the increasingly powerful \n     congressional conservatives and heal the internal divisions \n     that have crippled the organization in recent years.\n       ``The organization needed a jolt of electricity, and he is \n     exactly the man to give it to them,'' veteran civil rights \n     activist Roger Wilkins said yesterday. His uncle, Roy \n     Wilkins, headed the NAACP for years.\n       Mfume ``is a man who understands the streets. He also has \n     operated in the highest policy spheres in the United States. \n     He is smart, he is tough, and he has integrity,'' Wilkins \n     said. For Mfume, the job offers a chance to broaden his role \n     as a national black leader by reaching out to a new \n     generation of activists while reassuring the old guard of the \n     civil rights establishment, who form the core of the NAACP's \n     support. He has pledged to work to recruit young people and \n     others who have seen the NAACP, the nation's oldest and \n     largest civil rights organization, as elitist and \n     increasingly irrelevant.\n       ``The time is now for a new generation to join the NAACP,'' \n     Mfume, 47, said during his acceptance speech Saturday. \n     ``While we value maturity and experience, we must learn to \n     cherish youth. . . . I reach out to the current generation \n     and say to you in the clearest terms that it is all right to \n     come back home to the NAACP.'' Baltimore \n\n[[Page S69]]\n     NAACP member Kobi Little, 24, welcomed Mfume's comments. He is suing \n     the organization because youth members, ages 17 and younger, \n     are barred from voting in branch and national elections. ``I \n     think it will mean good things for the organization,'' he \n     said.\n       Mfume is in his fifth term representing Baltimore's \n     predominantly black 7th Congressional District in the House. \n     In 1992, he was elected and served for two years as chairman \n     of the Congressional Black Caucus, when it enjoyed the peak \n     of its power working with a Democratic president and a \n     Democratic majority in Congress. He plans to resign from the \n     House and assume his new post Feb. 15. ``We are at the \n     crossroads of tremendous change in our nation,'' Mfume said. \n     ``Despite the gains made by African Americans, racism \n     continues to divide our country and polarize our people. We \n     can stand by and watch in the comfort of our own \n     circumstances, or we can step forward and dare to lead.''\n       Mfume has scored his first victory by uniting the fractious \n     NAACP board behind his selection, which was unopposed, \n     despite some board members' previous plans to challenge the \n     search committee's candidate. The challenge ``never \n     materialized,'' said board member Joe Madison, who was a \n     finalist for the job. ``I'm just ecstatic about the choice \n     and relieved that someone of the stature of the congressman \n     would step up and take the job.''\n       Mfume said he plans to reach out to the NAACP's historic \n     allies in the corporate and white communities. He also plans \n     to make a ``long list'' of courtesy calls on national black \n     figures, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\n       Mfume's selection won cautious praise from Jewish activists \n     who traditionally have supported the NAACP but have been \n     alarmed in recent years by its overtures to Farrakhan, whose \n     rhetoric has been denounced as antisemitic.\n       Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation \n     League of B'nai B'rith, hailed Mfume's selection yesterday. \n     He said, ``We need the NAACP to be strong and active and to \n     be a major voice for civil rights, for unity, and to fight \n     discrimination.''\n       But he added: ``I will have a problem if he looks to \n     Farrakhan for leadership. I hope and believe he will not.'' \n     Born Frizzell Gray in West Baltimore, Mfume--in the words of \n     poet Langston Hughes--didn't ascend to power on a crystal \n     staircase. He dropped out of school and fathered five sons by \n     four women by age 22.\n       Gray hung out on street corners, got into fights and \n     drifted between menial jobs. But he changed his life as \n     radically as he changed his name. He said the name, which is \n     of African derivation, translates as ``conquering son of \n     kings.''\n       Mfume received a degree in urban planning from Morgan State \n     University and became a talk show host on the college's radio \n     station. Mfume championed issues of the poor and the \n     disenfranchised and won a seat on the Baltimore City Council \n     in 1979. NAACP board member and civil rights activist Julian \n     Bond was on the search committee that selected Mfume. Bond \n     said that what is at stake now is the very survival of the \n     NAACP--``its future, its very existence.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 15, 1995]\n\n               Big Choice for Kweisi Mfume--and the NAACP\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       Every now and then someone will make a choice that, however \n     little you might have anticipated it, immediately strikes you \n     as brilliant--even obvious.\n       That's my reaction to the NAACP's selection of Kweisi Mfume \n     to be its new leader. The 47-year-old Baltimore congressman \n     was nowhere on my list of candidates for the job; I'd simply \n     never thought of him in that connection. But as soon as I \n     heard that he'd been chosen, I could only think: Yes!\n       Clearly, it's a brilliant choice for the troubled \n     organization as it wrestles with the difficulties of changing \n     directions without losing its fundamental character. Mfume is \n     young enough, savvy enough and ``street'' enough to deal with \n     the young people his predecessor, the Rev. Benjamin Chavis, \n     tried to reach during his foreshortened tenure. As a fifth-\n     term congressman, former chair of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus and widely respected civic and political leader, he is \n     experienced enough and solid enough to instill confidence in \n     the rest of his potential constituency.\n       Nor, now that I think of it, is it a bad choice for Mfume \n     himself. He may have been close to the limit of his political \n     influence and patience, given the country's tightening purse \n     strings and rightward movement. The NAACP leadership gives \n     him a shot at leadership on a new, higher, more effective \n     level.\n       But even brilliant choices are not guaranteed success. If \n     Mfume will permit a word of caution from an admirer:\n       The NAACP is, in some ways, two organizations--one devoted \n     to a glorious past of fighting Jim Crow, school segregation \n     and laws calculated to limit black advancement; the other \n     groping for relevancy at a time when so many of black \n     America's problems (though arguably spawned by racism) are \n     perpetuated and exacerbated by our own inappropriate choices \n     and behavior.\n       Kweisi Mfume is also two men--the one accepting the \n     traditional view that racism is our number one problem, the \n     other bold enough to see the need for blacks to change their \n     behavior, no matter what white people do or fail to do.\n       Which Mfume is taking charge of the NAACP? His acceptance \n     speech of last Saturday offers a small clue. ``We are at the \n     crossroads of tremendous change in our nation,'' he said. \n     ``Despite the gains made by African Americans, racism \n     continues to divide our country and polarize our people. We \n     can stand by and watch in the comfort of our own \n     circumstances, or we can step forward and dare to lead.''\n       A guaranteed applause line, that. And yet I hear myself \n     asking: Lead where? For if he is talking about leading a \n     fight against racism, I fear he is missing the boat. Racism \n     has not disappeared from American life; far from it. But I \n     really do believe that it is no longer the main barrier to \n     black progress--particularly among those of us most in need \n     of progress. Does Mfume?\n       Like most of us, I suppose he is of two minds. The recent \n     settlement of cases involving discrimination at Denny's \n     restaurants, the humiliation of two innocent black teenagers \n     by security people at the Eddie Bauer's outlet in suburban \n     Washington, the race killing of two civilians by white \n     supremacist soldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C.--all these things \n     and more counsel vigilance against racism. Mfume understands \n     that.\n       But he understands something else: that lasting change must \n     come from within. It wasn't racism that made Mfume (then \n     known as Frizzell Gray) a violent, street-running dropout who \n     fathered five sons by three women--all ``without benefit of \n     clergy.'' And it wasn't the defeat of racism that helped him \n     to turn his life around.\n       He's not sure precisely what it was. But he does know that \n     once he made the decision to get himself together, to make \n     something of himself, he had lots of help and advice from \n     people who had it to give. There is something deeply \n     inspirational about his journey from irresponsible street bum \n     to respected leader who, by the way, took the trouble to \n     build a relationship with his sons.\n       Which experience should guide his efforts to reach out to \n     young blacks, as he has vowed to do: the humiliations of \n     racism or the power of decision? They may be equally \n     authentic, but, as his own life teaches, they are not equally \n     effective at producing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n             Mfume: Not Just Leader, a Savior to N.A.A.C.P.\n\n                         (By Steven A. Holmes)\n\n       Washington, December 10.--When Representative Kweisi Mfume \n     walked into a hotel conference room here to interview with \n     the board of directors of the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People on Saturday, the group broke \n     out into spontaneous applause. It was perhaps the first time \n     in more than two years the full board had found anything to \n     cheer about.\n       For an organization mired in debt and increasingly accused \n     of being archaic and out of touch, Mr. Mfume, who was named \n     on Saturday as the N.A.A.C.P.'s president and chief executive \n     officer, is viewed by many within the civil rights group as a \n     savior. So much so that the descriptions of him that flow \n     from some quarters lapse effortlessly into hyperbole.\n       ``In our new president we have the brilliance of Dubois, \n     the eloquence of Martin Luther King, the toughness of \n     Thurgood Marshall, the caring of Ms. Bethune and Harriet \n     Tubman and Sojourner Truth,'' A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., a \n     retired Federal Judge said, comparing Mr. Mfume to a pantheon \n     of icons of the anti-slavery and civil rights movements.\n       While neither Mr. Mfume nor anyone else could be such a \n     giant, he clearly provides skills, outlook, visibility and a \n     personal story that could help revive the ailing \n     organization.\n       Born Frizzell Gray in Baltimore in 1948, Mr. Mfume spent \n     his early years under the hand of an abusive stepfather who, \n     until Mr. Mfume's mother divorced him, beat his wife and \n     belittled his stepson. When Mr. Mfume was 16, his mother died \n     of cancer, leaving him feeling alone and abandoned.\n       For several years, Mr. Mfume went through what he later \n     called his ``lost years,'' dropping out of high school, \n     hanging out on the tough streets of the city's west side, \n     where he was known by his nickname of Pee Wee, and fathering \n     five children out of wedlock by four different women.\n       ``I came out of a disjointed family structure,'' Mr. Mfume \n     said in a speech last year. ``I grew up in the worst possible \n     conditions. I became homeless after my mother's death, hit \n     the streets and dropped out of school, flirted with every \n     temptation that was around, became a teen parent before my \n     time, felt left out and victimized.''\n       But Mr. Mfume grabbed hold of his life. He earned a high \n     school equivalency diploma, attended Morgan State University, \n     a historically black college in Baltimore, and later gained a \n     reputation as a disk jockey and radio talk show host. Along \n     the way he took a new name (pronounced Kwah-EEE-see Oom-FOO-\n     may), which in a Ghanaian dialect means ``conquerer of \n     kings.''\n       ``It's different,'' Mr. Mfume once said of his name. ``So \n     is Zbigniew Brzezinski.''\n       After seven years as a member of the Baltimore City \n     Council, Mr. Mfume was the surprise victor of a 1986 \n     Democratic Primary to replace retiring Representative Parren \n     J. Mitchell. In the heavily Democratic district, the win \n     virtually guaranteed election to Congress. He has been \n     reelected four times, often gaining more than 80 percent of \n     the vote in the general election.\n     \n[[Page S70]]\n\n       As a Representative, Mr. Mfume made his mark as Chairman of \n     the Congressional Black Caucus from 1992 to 1994, a time when \n     the number of blacks in the House shot up to 40 from 26.\n       With new-found strength because of its increased size, the \n     caucus under Mr. Mfume flexed its muscles as never before. It \n     pointedly chastized President Clinton for bowing to criticism \n     and withdrawing Lani Guinier, a professor at the University \n     of Pennsylvania Law School, as his nominee for Assistant \n     Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n       The caucus also pressed Mr. Clinton to use American troops \n     to restore ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to \n     power, one of the few groups to do so publicly for what was \n     considered by many to be a hopeless cause.\n       Mr. Mfume's tenure as head of the caucus was not without \n     its missteps. In 1992, he angered Jews and some members of \n     the Caucus when he declared that the group had entered into a \n     ``sacred covenant'' with the Nation of Islam.\n       In the face of criticism and in the wake of an anti-\n     Semitic, anti-Catholic and anti-white speech by one of Mr. \n     Farrakhan's aides, Khalid Abdul Mohammed, Mr. Mfume disavowed \n     any association with the group and spent much time mending \n     fences with Jewish leaders in Baltimore.\n       As a five-term Representative from Baltimore, where the \n     N.A.A.C.P. is based, Mr. Mfume brings political acumen to the \n     civil rights group, the country's oldest but one whose \n     political relevancy has been questioned in recent years. He \n     has shown an ability to raise money, a skill badly needed for \n     a group saddled with a $3.2 million debt. As a former \n     Baltimore street tough who turned his life around, he also \n     lends credibility to a message of personal responsibility for \n     black youths.\n       ``The time is now--right now--to restore the financial, \n     spiritual and political health of this historic, American \n     institution,'' Mr. Mfume said at a news conference following \n     the board's decision. He added, ``And my job is to provide \n     the leadership that will make that happen.''\n       His career has been free of scandal, a stark contrast to \n     the recent history of the N.A.A.C.P. In the last two years, \n     the organization has fired its executive director amid \n     charges of sexual discrimination and harassment and replaced \n     a board chairmen who was accused of financial improprieties.\n       With his handsome looks, smooth manner and current \n     girlfriend--an actress, Lynn Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award \n     in 1991 for her portrayal of Josephine Baker in a cable \n     television movie--he brings a measure of glamour to an \n     organization sometimes seen as frumpy.\n       At his news conference on Saturday, Mr. Mfume spoke of the \n     need for the N.A.A.C.P. to maintain a commitment to coalition \n     politics with whites and others. In doing so, he appeared to \n     be trying to assuage the concerns of some whites and blacks \n     who had been put off by the attempts by Benjamin F. Chavis \n     Jr., the former executive director, to align the organization \n     with Mr. Farrakhan, who preaches a black separatist ideology.\n       ``It is easier to accomplish things when you maximize the \n     number of people who you have working with you and working \n     for you,'' he said in an interview.\n       As a condition of taking the job, Mr. Mfume wrested \n     concessions from the N.A.A.C.P. board, which since the mid-\n     1980's has taken much power and control from the \n     organization's chief executive but has fallen short in \n     raising money and in debating and formulating policy.\n       Rather than report to a 64-member board, Mr.. Mfume will \n     deal with a smaller executive committee and have the \n     authority to hire and fire staff, a power that had been \n     stripped from the top executive. And to denote who will be in \n     charge, his title will be president and chief executive \n     officer, not executive director.\n       The need to symbolically change the position back to \n     president--something, although small--was powerful in terms \n     of what is said about the position,'' he said in an \n     interview.\n       One unknown question, however, is Mr. Mfume's \n     administrative skills. As member of Congress, and before \n     that, the Baltimore City Council, Mr. Mfume has never had to \n     run an organization as large as the N.A.A.C.P. But officials \n     of the organization say they are not overly concerned.\n       ``If that becomes a problem, we could get him a manager,'' \n     said one board member who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n     ``Because he brings so much else, if he's weak there, we \n     could prop him up.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Dec. 10, 1995]\n\n                       Mfume Transformed Himself\n\n\nmaturing: as he progressed from the baltimore city council to the u.s. \n   congress, kweisi mfume developed into a polished consensus builder\n\n                    (By Tom Bowman and Karen Hosler)\n\n       ``We are going to change,'' Rep. Kweisi Mfume declared \n     yesterday after being chosen to head the NAACP.\n       He could have been talking about himself. Kweisi Mfume, 47, \n     began his political career as a dashiki-clad political \n     activist on the Baltimore City Council. But when he arrived \n     on Capitol Hill, he quickly transformed himself into a \n     polished consensus builder.\n       Battling Mayor Donald Schaefer and Council President \n     Clarence H. ``Du'' Burns, he first ran in 1979 on a campaign \n     to ``beat the bosses,'' advocating for the poor and the \n     powerless.\n       After two terms on the council, he decided in 1986 to make \n     a run for the seat of Rep. Parren J. Mitchell, a retiring \n     civil rights legend who served 16 years in the House. \n     Defeating a Republican, St. George I. B. Crosse III, in a \n     bitter contest for the 7th District seat, he embarked on a \n     bridge-building effort, forging a relationship with Governor \n     Schaefer.\n       The dashikis gave way to finely tailored dark suits. The \n     once-angry voice took on a measured and mellifluous cadence. \n     ``I'm the same fighter, but the arena has changed,'' he \n     explained once. ``Sometimes I will do it by compromise, \n     sometimes I will do it through confrontation.''\n       He reached out to all his constituencies, from Catonsville \n     to West Baltimore to Charles Village to East Baltimore and \n     Hampden. Some white areas in the district had felt snubbed by \n     Mr. Mitchell.\n       The new congressman set up town meetings with his \n     neighboring Democrat, Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin, and followed \n     his predecessor, Mr. Mitchell, to the House Banking, Finance \n     and Urban Affairs Committee.\n       But Mr. Mfume became more adept at dealing with the \n     opposition than was the often-acerbic Mr. Mitchell. ``Mfume's \n     style is, `You'll like me and respect me,' '' Daniel P. \n     Henson III, the city housing commissioner, said several years \n     ago. ``Parren's style was, `You may not like me, but you'll \n     respect me.' ''\n       On the Banking Committee, Mr. Mfume matured into a skilled \n     legislative craftsman. He was instrumental in saving programs \n     that aided minority businesses. And he embraced issues \n     outside the traditional black agenda, from high-technology \n     development to business tax breaks.\n       Within two years, he became a leader in the Congressional \n     Black Caucus, which elected him one of two vice chairmen.\n       ``He's serious. He's thoughtful, He's a consensus \n     builder,'' Rep. Mike Espy, a Mississippi Democrat, said in \n     December 1992, when Mr. Mfume was elected chairman of the \n     Black Caucus.\n       With his elevation to caucus chair and the election of a \n     Democratic president, Mr. Mfume found his profile rising in \n     Washington. President Clinton desperately needed the votes of \n     the 39-member Black Caucus to get his legislative agenda \n     through Congress.\n       As head of the group, Mr. Mfume proved a tough negotiator \n     and a shrewd bargainer, often holding out for concessions \n     from Mr. Clinton on programs such as the tax credit for the \n     working poor. The man who once had a popular radio talk show \n     on Morgan State's WEAA now became a fixture on the nationally \n     televised Sunday TV talk shows.\n       The Black Caucus, under Mr. Mfume, provided Mr. Clinton \n     with critical votes for his crime bill, despite deep-held \n     opposition to death penalty provisions.\n       Mr. Mfume's term as caucus chairman had its stormy moments. \n     He made many of his more traditional colleagues uncomfortable \n     by reaching out to the Nation of Islam and its chairman, \n     Louis Farrakhan, who has a history of making inflammatory \n     remarks about Jews and other groups.\n       But after Republicans took control of Congress this year, \n     the Black Caucus members were mere voices in the wilderness. \n     Because the caucus members are among the most liberal in \n     Congress, few found any common ground with the ruling \n     Republicans.\n       Mr. Mfume found himself in an unhappy eclipse. Once \n     surrounded by reporters every time he left the House floor, \n     the Baltimore Democrat could recently be seen ambling alone \n     past the press-mobbed Republican leaders.\n       No longer in the majority party, he would become the 20th \n     House Democrat to leave or announce plans to do so. Five \n     others have switched to join the GOP.\n       When Mr. Mfume assumed the leadership role in the Black \n     Caucus three years ago, Mr. Espy offered words that would \n     apply today as Mr. Mfume assumes the leadership of the NAACP.\n       ``He has a professional style, which we need,'' Mr. Espy \n     said in 1992. ``It will be difficult.

This synthetic cooking oil and the decision by FDA are the subject \nof this week's Time magazine cover story.\n  The scientific issues under review by FDA are fascinating and I \ncommend FDA for its management of the review by the Food Advisory \nCommittee.\n  The Procter & Gamble Co. undertook its efforts to better understand \nfat in the human body in the 1950's and developed olestra in the \n1960's. In 1971, Procter & Gamble began the approval process at FDA.\n  More than two decades later, olestra has not yet been approved. \nNobody is faulting the FDA; approval of olestra has posed unique and \nunprecedented scientific questions that had to be researched. \nAccordingly, the FDA has approached this unprecedented food additive \nwith appropriate prudence, and \n\n[[Page S71]]\nProcter & Gamble was required to invent new protocols to test olestra's \nsafety for human consumption.\n  Regulatory review by the FDA is necessary to ensure the public health \nand safety. At the same time I believe that we should encourage \ninnovation by American industry. I believe that unnecessary delay in \nthe approval of new products will have a negative impact on the \ninvestment in research and development. Without the FDA approval, \nolestra cannot be manufactured for and used by the Nation's consumers. \nProcter & Gamble has invested more than $200 million in the development \nof this product and expects to invest many more millions to construct \nmanufacturing facilities should olestra be approved. Therefore, I am \npleased that the FDA has indicated that it will complete its \ndecisionmaking process very soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of my letter of December 13, 1995, \nto Commissioner Kessler of the FDA be printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 1995.\n     David A. Kessler, M.D.,\n     Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Park Lawn \n         Building, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Mr. Commissioner: I am writing in regard to the food \n     additive petition for olestra, the non-calorie fat \n     substitute. Because of olestra's development by the Ohio \n     based Procter & Gamble Company, I have been interested in the \n     product and its review by the FDA. I am pleased to hear that \n     the Food Advisory Committee has recommended to the FDA that \n     olestra meets the statutory standard of ``reasonable \n     certainty of no harm.''\n       I want to commend FDA for its management of the Food \n     Advisory Committee review process. It is my understanding \n     that based upon an objective scientific process, no \n     significant new safety issues were raised and no new data \n     raising concern were introduced. I further understand that \n     the issues of labeling statements and postmarketing \n     surveillance raised by Committee members were addressed and \n     agreed to by Procter & Gamble prior to the meeting.\n       FDA's commitment to further the process is certainly \n     evidenced by the November 13 publication of the Federal \n     Register notice announcing that all data, information and \n     public comments on the petition were to be filed by December \n     1 in order to facilitate the FDA decision making process. I \n     am pleased that the notice also indicated that the FDA \n     intends to render a decision within 60 days of the conclusion \n     of the Food Advisory Committee meeting provided no \n     significant new safety issues are raised. Given the favorable \n     review by the advisory committee and the absence of \n     significant new safety issues or concerns, I believe that the \n     FDA should take the necessary steps to ensure that the \n     decision making process is completed within the timetable on \n     or about January 17, 1996. I look forward to the final agency \n     action on the olestra petition.\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Glenn,\n                                             U.S. Senator.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S70-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S71]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     OUTSTANDING ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN WISCONSIN COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS\n\n   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two \noutstanding accomplishments in Wisconsin collegiate athletics. Over the \nweekend of December 9-10, 1995, two Wisconsin schools were crowned as \nnational champions. On Saturday, December 9, the University of \nWisconsin-La Crosse captured the NCAA Division III Football \nChampionship, by defeating Rowan, NJ, 36 to 7 in the Amos Alonzo Stagg \nBowl, held in Salem, VA. Also finding success in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the University of Wisconsin claimed their first NCAA Division \nI Men's Soccer Title, downing Duke University, 2 to 0 in Richmond. Both \nchampionships can be attributed to a team first attitude, and a work \nethic that is second-to-none.\n  Behind an uncompromising defense that allowed just 153 yards, \nincluding yielding only 4 yards during the 3d quarter, and a balanced \noffensive attack that amassed 451 yards, the UW-La Crosse Eagles earned \ntheir second national title in 4 years. Although they trailed Rowan \nearly in the game, the ``never-say-die'' Eagles went on to score 36 \nunanswered points including an 85-yard scoring strike by senior All-\nAmerican quarterback, and Division III Player of the Year, Craig \nKusick, that seemed to decimate the valiant efforts of the Rowan \ndefense. Inspired by their offensive counterparts, the unrelenting \nEagle defense held Rowan scoreless for the final three quarters, and \ngave UW-La Crosse the lead for good after tackle Mike Ivey stopped an \novermatched Rowan back for a safety. The championship marks the second \nDivision III title for Eagle head coach Roger Harring and caps off his \n27th season with an undefeated campaign, 14-0.\n  Defense has also been the key on the road to the Badgers' title run. \nWhile allowing only 11 goals all season, and never more than 2 in a \ngame, the Wisconsin defense continued to stonewall its opponents by \nbecoming the first team ever to go through the entire five-game \ntournament without allowing a goal. The 2-to-0 victory over Duke in the \nfinal extended their shutout string to 7 consecutive games and the 17th \nblanking over their 25-game schedule. Truly a team effort, Coach Jim \nLaunder's Badgers were the first Wisconsin team to advance past the \nNCAA quarterfinal.\n  There is a cliche that says, ``Offense wins games. Defense wins \nchampionships.'' Although somewhat simplistic, it can be no more true \nthan in the results of the championships attained by our fine Wisconsin \nuniversities. Wisconsin is truly proud of all its student athletes, and \non behalf of the State of Wisconsin, I salute our national champions \nfor their dedication to their common goal and for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S71-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S71]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO PATTY CALLAGHAN, ACTION FOR EASTERN MONTANA, GLENDIVE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish today to give tribute to \none of eastern Montanan's treasures, Patty Callaghan. Patty recently \nretired after 20 years with Action for Eastern Montana.\n  Patty retired as executive director to attend Luther Seminary in St. \nPaul, MN. She hopes to return to eastern Montana as a lay leader with \nrural churches.\n  Montana needs more leaders like Patty Callaghan. Rural Montana needs \nthe love for and knowledge of our State that people like Patty have.\n  Patty's work with Action actually led to her decision to choose the \nseminary. When funding cutbacks in the programs that she administers \nforced her to look to other resources, Patty found the churches \nresponding generously. She found the needs of rural communities to be \nmuch the same as the need of rural congregations--energy, leadership \nfor change, accountability, respect, and compassion.\n  Patty has dealt with many family issues that will serve her will in \nher new life. She found the work at Action for Eastern Montana \nrewarding and the Glendive community generous when a need was \nidentified.\n  In a recent tribute to Patty, family members, coworkers, friends, and \nmany others including Montana's Governor Marc Racicot expressed their \nrespect and appreciation for her life's work.\n  I would also like to express my profound respect and admiration for \nPatty Callaghan and what she has done for eastern Montana. Public \nservice can bring out the best and worst in people. With Patty, her \ncompassion and caring has only deepened. Eastern Montana desperately \nneeds this commitment to its communities.\n  Thank you, Patty. We wish you the best and look forward to seeing you \nagain soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S71-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S71]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JANUARY 5, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, it had been our thought we might remain in \nsession tonight because the House may take action with reference to our \ndeeming resolution which passed here the other day. There will be a \nHouse Republican conference at 7 o'clock. They have not yet passed, and \nI do not know precisely what, if anything, will pass, but we wanted to \nbe here if something passed later this evening. I now understand that \nwould be objected to--an effort to do it tonight--so if there is any \naction it would come tomorrow. I had hoped we would do it tonight \nbecause if it passed Federal employees could be back to work tomorrow \nmorning. I know that is the hope of the Senator from Virginia who has \nbeen working on this on a daily basis. We have had meetings throughout \nthe day on the balanced budget amendment and we have also talked about \nFederal employees. Speaker Gingrich is very forthcoming. I know he has \nbeen in meetings throughout the day.\n  I think all of us regret the deadline of January 3 passed without \nreaching a balanced budget agreement. We have not given up. We will be \nback, as I said, negotiating tomorrow afternoon and probably Saturday \nafternoon. I would say perhaps by the weekend or sometime early next \nweek we probably ought to have some agreement--or disagreement, maybe; \nthat we cannot put it together. But we have not reached that point yet. \nI will keep everybody informed.\n  If there are any rollcall votes, as I have indicated to the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, there would be at least 24 hours' \nnotice provided to our colleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again salute our distinguished majority \nleader. I know how hard he has worked on this.\n  I have been in consultation with my colleagues from Virginia in the \nHouse of Representatives, and most specifically Congressman Davis, \nhere, within the hour.\n  As you state, the House will have its caucus tonight. I, just \nspeaking for myself, am optimistic, without going into the details, \nthat there will be some action. Therefore, if that is done, it is \nlikely that this body, the Senate, would review it tomorrow, would that \nbe correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would do it as quickly as we can. I thought if the House \ntook it up in the morning it might be finished at 11 o'clock and we \ncould take it up at any time it comes from the House.\n  I will say, as I said before, some of our House colleagues have a \ndifferent view of this than some of us in the Senate; maybe not all of \nus in the Senate. But I also add, at least this Senator has been here \nthe last couple of weeks doing a lot of the heavy lifting. We explored \nalmost every option I can think of to get people back to work. I know \nthat is the view of all the House Members, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, that they should be working and they should be paid, and you \nshould not pay people for not working. In this case the workers are \nwilling.\n  I hope there will be some positive measure to come from the House \ntomorrow so we can take it up and pass it very quickly and then get \nback to where we ought to be, back on our message. Our message is \nbalancing the budget over the next 7 years. It is not a Government \nshutdown. Our message is to balance the budget. That is what the \nAmerican people want us to focus on, on both sides of the aisle. That, \nand a number of other issues like welfare reform and tax cuts for \nfamilies with children.\n  In my view, the other message is an impediment. If you watch the \nevening news tonight you will probably see two or three stories on the \nGovernment shutdown but not one on the balanced budget, not one. So I \nthink somewhere along the way we have gotten off message. I hope things \nwill move along here, we will get back, get our work done.\n\n  I would think Members on both sides would like some free time this \nmonth or next month because we have sort of gone around the calendar \nhere.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I commend my distinguished \ncolleague and friend, the majority leader. I know full well, having \nshared many of the hours here over the past couple of weeks with you, \nthat you have done more than your share of the heavy lifting and you \nhave explored in a very objective way, recognizing the diversity of \nviews within our own party as well as across America. But the keystone \nis the balanced budget using the CBO figures. I am hopeful the \nPresident will recognize that obligation on his part to send to the \nCongress, as early as possible, such a balanced budget.\n  I think, when the history is written on this, the turning point in \nthis classic chapter of our history will be when the distinguished \nmajority leader stood right here, and I was privileged to be on the \nfloor, and you said those important words, ``Enough is enough.'' That \nwas the turning point.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank Congressman Wolf and Congressman Davis and also \nCongresswoman Morella, because they have been working with us, with the \nSenator, with our office, and I know they have been working on the \nHouse side. They may be in a little better position to appreciate the \nimportance of some early action because they have a great number of \nFederal employees in their districts. Obviously, they are very \nconcerned.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President I would like to add Congressman Bateman. He \njoined with us in our regular daily meetings today because a \nsignificant part of the Federal establishment in Virginia is in the \nTidewater, of which he is a Representative.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/04/senate-section/article/S72-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S72]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 11 A.M.
